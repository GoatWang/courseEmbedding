        Our Story      









Naomi Whittel started Reserveage Nutrition™ with just four Resveratrol products more than five years ago; her goal was to become an innovator in the health and wellness field. Working with a renowned team of PhDs, medical advisers and nutritional experts, she sought to provide best- in-class nutritional supplements that are backed by gold standard science.





Every one of our products takes its inspiration from clinically researched ingredients and the world’s healthiest cultures.






My quest of curiosity (a wanderlust, if you will) began when I was a very young girl. Growing up in a family of chemists and scientists who immersed themselves in a biodynamic, organic lifestyle long before it was a trend, we always turned to pure, whole ingredients taken from the earth for solutions. This has become my lifelong passion and purpose and is why I founded Reserveage™ Nutrition. I welcome you to join me in my journey to wellness.

Our founder, Naomi Whittel, was having dinner with her cousin, Dr. Eric Lafforgue, when their conversation turned to The French Paradox. Why do the French, who enjoy a rich diet filled with cheese, pastries and great wine, also enjoy good health? The answer may be their daily consumption of red wine, which contains Resveratrol, a powerful antioxidant that has been shown in studies to help support the “longevity gene.” At that moment, the cousins decided to harness the antioxidant power of Resveratrol. And Reserveage™ Nutrition and the first four Resveratrol products were born, launching in March of 2009.

Reserveage Resveratrol supplements are created through combining standardized amounts of resveratrol from Japanese knotweed with our polyphenol blend from our patent-pending, proprietary process called Vine to Capsule® technology that preserves the essential phytonutrients found in grape skin, vines and stems. By partnering with a state-of-the art polyphenol manufacturing facility just minutes from the vineyards where we source the ingredients in our premium Pro-Longevity Factors® Blend, we are able to boost its bioavailability, resulting in products dedicated to purity, potency and freshness. “Individuals appreciate the sincere transparency Reserveage offers, and I am confident in each capsule’s quality,” said Reserveage’s Scientific Adviser Eric Lafforgue, MD.

Meet Naomi Whittel

Loving mother, wife, daughter, sister, girlfriend, mentor and confidante...
Naomi Whittel is also a bold, audacious corporate executive and 
			award-winning natural products expert. She's an innovative 
			powerhouse and leading voice in the natural nutritional supplements 
			industry, as well as a no-nonsense, courageous leader and concerned, 
			compassionate world citizen. Naomi cares about her family and 
			friends, as well as her company, her employees, her community and 
			the world in which we live. 
As a leading female innovator in the health and wellness field 
			today, Naomi is committed to producing the best-in-class, wholesome 
			nutritional products possible with science-based ingredients and 
			transparent manufacturing processes. She's the founder and CEO of 
			four companies and corresponding major brands in the natural 
			supplements industry and is proud to introduce ONE Optimal Nutrients 
			Everyday™. 
Naomi's mission has always been to deliver the best-of-class 
			products, consistent with her core business attributes: trusted, 
			authentic, science-driven, effective, simple/understandable, 
			accessible/convenient, innovation, industry leadership, engagement, 
			education/communication, and giving back to the community. 
In fact, all of her products are formulated and backed by Naomi's 
			Promise™ — a set of seven guiding principles that demonstrate her 
			commitment to your health by delivering the best, science-based, 
			safe and effective nutritional products:

Based on Science and Research 
Certified, Award-Winning Product Integrity 
Current Good Manufacturing Practices 
Clinical Studies Supporting Claims
Patent-Pending or Patented Proprietary Ingredient Technology 
				
Formulated to Exclude Unnecessary Binders and Fillers 
Formulated with Ingredients That Are Gentle on the Digestive 
			System

Naomi was raised in a family of world-renowned doctors, scientists 
			and biodynamic farmers in Europe, so her passion for natural, 
			science-based products is influenced by her heritage. Over the past 
			two decades, Naomi has increased her knowledge in natural products 
			and expanded her passion to make the world healthier by bringing 
			clean, high-quality, effective nutrition to the far reaches of the 
			world. 
To accomplish this lofty goal, Naomi seeks out leading doctors, 
			scientists and nutrition experts and partners with them to develop 
			wholesome, effective formulations using natural raw materials 
			whenever possible with transparent sourcing from seed-to-shelf and 
			state-of-the-art technology. 
Naomi's way has always been to cut through the jungle of much-hyped 
			but ineffective ingredients, choosing optimal levels of clinically 
			researched and effective nutrients. Inside her nutritional 
			supplements are just the optimal nutrients you need – without 
			excessive fillers and additives used in many brands – to produce the 
			most wholesome nutritional supplements possible at the best value.
			
Naomi's companies promote sustainable "green" practices, 
			manufacturing transparency and female empowerment. She is the 
			founder of the DAWN Network (Developing and Advancing Women in 
			Naturals) – a national initiative to expand female leadership roles 
			in the natural products industry.
Every one of Naomi's products takes its inspiration from the world's 
			healthiest people with a commitment to preserving healthy cultures 
			and sustainable practices. Naomi began a supportive working 
			relationship with the Kuna indigenous people of coastal Panama, 
			whose healthy cocoa-drinking culture inspired Naomi's 
CocoaWell 
			brand. Naomi is proud to share the Kuna's knowledge about cocoa and 
			their health and longevity secrets of their culture with the world. 
			Naomi's company is investing in and committed to helping the Kuna 
			secure their economic future by helping to reinvigorate their cacao 
			farming practices. 
Naomi and her companies have received more than 25 industry awards, 
			including Nutrition Business Journal's 2012 Business Achievement 
			Award, the prestigious Stevie Awards in 2010 for Best Executive, 
			Best Entrepreneur, Best Overall Company of the Year, Fastest Growing 
			Company of the Year and Most Innovative Company of the Year and many 
			more. Recently, Naomi was named Ernst & Young's 2013 Entrepreneur of 
			the Year.

The climb to CEO can happen quicker than you thinkPrivacy Policy





In only a few years, Naomi Whittel has reached a point in her career that takes some people a lifetime.It was 2009 when Whittel started a business called Reserveage Nutrition selling nutritional supplements.The supplements were so successful that Whittel sold her company six years later for $37 million. Now she's CEO of the company that bought hers, Twinlab Consolidated Holdings.How the 42-year-old Boca Raton woman rose from entrepreneur to CEO is a story of dedication, leadership and concern for the consumer.

"Naomi is naturally curious with a passion to win," says adviser Sanjay Khosla, a professor at Northwestern University's Kellogg School of Management in Chicago.Whittel's grew up in Europe, the daughter of a French mother who was an artist and an English father who was a chemist. It was a perfect foundation for the business she would build.She began Reserveage at a time when she and her husband were looking to start a family. She had been taking herbal supplements and discovered that she had high levels of metal in her body.In building her company, she stressed science, working off clinical research as well as launching new studies. She went to the University of Bordeaux in France to learn about the "French Paradox," an observation of low coronary heart disease and death rates among the French, despite high intake of dietary cholesterol and saturated fat.

"This is not fair," she said of her French cousins. "They're eating double cream brie and drinking wine."Her research also led her to the vineyards of Bordeaux, the source of resveratrol, one of the ingredients she uses in her supplements.Resveratrol is a protective compound found in the stems and vines of French grapes. The supplements also contain collagen, a staple in the Asian diet. They are sold at health stores including GNC, Whole Foods Markets and Vitamin Shoppe; directly through the company website; and through QVC.Heather Hausenblas, professor at Jacksonville University's School of Applied Health Sciences in Jacksonville, has participated in independent studies and has been a consultant to Reservage in studies over the years on resveratrol, as well as the company's Collagen Booster."What I love about Naomi and her product is the great science. There's so much out there that's not very good," said Hausenblas, who now uses Collagen Booster herself. "As a woman approaching 50, I'd like to slow down the clock,' she said."I see little improvements in my skin and hair," Hausenblas said, though she warns that it "takes time."Scripps Florida in Jupiter is studying different types of resveratrol to come up with the best form. Scientist Paul Robbin, who specializes in metabolism and aging studies, said he takes resveratrol, which "has clearly seen positive effects in mice."He said there's plenty of competition in the resveratrol market with companies including Fort Lauderdale-based Life Extension and Elysium, which has an advisory firm of leaders in the field including Nobel Prize winners."There's no reason not to take [resveratrol]. It might have some benefits and there are no side effects," he said.Consumers agreed, so much so that Reserveage Nutrition expanded too quickly."We grew within three years to $70 million in top-line sales, and we didn't have the infrastructure," Whittel said. "We spent a year and a half picking up the pieces."To correct the company's course, she brought in a chief financial officer who told her she needed to spend less time as the company spokeswoman and more time digging into the basic drivers of the company."We focused on systems and practices and time management. We became laser-focused," she said.The biggest payoff has been in its beauty category. Collagen product sales grew 28 percent over the past 52 weeks, according to data by Spins, a Chicago organization that provides data analysis for the industry. Reserveage sales grew by 4.7 percent last year.Khosla, the Kellogg professor, been a mentor to Whittel since they met an Ernst & Young Entrepreneur of the Year conference. Whittel won in her category in 2013.At Reserveage, Whittel has built a diverse team with complementary skills, Khosla said. "These leadership skills will be really great in helping her succeed as a public company CEO," he said.Whittel says her focus on the consumer is equally responsible for her success."When I started Reserveage, I started with a focus as a consumer," she said."As a consumer, you just want to make a good choice on the multivitamin that you're putting into your mouth, on the price point and on the purity, and we have an incredible story to tell."Whittel advises consumers to find out about the source of ingredients in supplements they're purchasing. "Call up their customer service and ask them how to read the supplement panel," she said.Besides taking her own supplements, Whittel sips her favorite drink of kale, celery and cucumber during a workday. It helps her maintain her energy as she travels for business and cares for her family. She and her husband, Rob Whittel, a Boca Raton lawyer, have four children, ages 1 to 13.Whittel she credits her stepfather for her introduction to business. He owned a plastics manufacturing company in Vermont."He allowed me to shadow him, to sit in every meeting I wanted to at a very young age, and that provided me with a certain level of confidence concerning my level of curiosity," Whittel said.She embraces the transition to public company CEO. "I do well under pressure," she saidFrom her Boca Raton office, Whittel oversees 260 employees, including those in Grand Rapids, Colo. Twinlab manufactures some 250 products including Daily One, a multivitamin offered in a soft capsule, and a collection of eye health products under Occuguard.In 2015, Twinlab had sales of $81.67 million, up 33 percent from 2014. But its gross profit last quarter was primarily attributable to the acquisition of Reserveage and contract manufacturer Nutrascience Labs, according to Twinlab's quarterly filing in May. Twinlab trades over the counter; it's 52-week high was $1.75.Whittel sees herself as more than a CEO. She also takes on the role of mentor to her employees, particularly women who are coming up the ranks, to give them the exposure and experience they need for personal growth. She also mentors Rachel Zietz, a teenage entrepreneur from Boca Raton who recently appeared on TV's "Shark Tank."

While becoming CEO of a public company is a challenging role, Whittel said she is approaching it with the same curiosity, passion and leadership she has at her own company."I'm always concerned. I believe that only the paranoid survive. I believe being concerned is a big part of success," she said.mpounds@tribpub.com or 561-243-6650

NOTE FROM NAOMI











My quest of curiosity (a wanderlust, if you will) began when I was a very young girl. Growing up in a family of chemists and scientists who immersed themselves in a biodynamic, organic lifestyle long before it was a trend, we always turned to pure, whole ingredients taken from the earth for nutritional solutions. This has become my lifelong passion and purpose, and is why I founded Reserveage™ Nutrition. I welcome you to join me in my journey to wellness!




I am inspired by the wisdom of nature and the healthiest cultures around the world. I look for solutions to the many health challenges we face–from beauty and weight management to aging and heart health, and everywhere in between. Like any nutritional navigator, I will travel the far reaches of the globe seeking to identify natural solutions you can trust to provide real benefit for a myriad of your health needs. There is no jungle too remote or biodynamic vineyard to distant in my search for the purest ingredients and sustainable partnerships.




I pull from my own health challenges and solutions, my family’s heritage in science and organic farming practices, the rituals of some of the world’s healthiest cultures in addition to cutting-edge innovation to bring to market our most effective nutritional supplements. We seek out the finest ingredients from the purest sources, and employ the highest standards of fair trade and good manufacturing practices to deliver beneficial nutritional supplements for you and your family, as well as our own! We are committed to traceability and transparency, and helping to protect the planet through sustainable initiatives, whenever possible.




I welcome you to join me on our journey to wellness. I would love for you to share your own health pursuits, so we can work together toward a healthier future.




Cheers!









Naomi Whittel,




Founder & CEO of Reserveage™ Nutrition

Naomi Whittel: How I Nailed My Debut on QVC


The founder of Reserveage Organics reveals how she aced this crucial moment in her company's life.






 By Liz Welch


Liz Welch is a National Magazine Award-winning journalist who has written for The New York Times, Real Simple, Glamour, and Inc., among other publications. She is the co-author with her siblings of the recent book The Kids Are All Right, a highly regarded memoir of her childhood.

This is the story of entrepreneur Naomi Whittel, as told to Inc.'s Liz Welch.
My executive assistant was the first to suggest that I go on QVC. I brushed it off. But a very good friend of mine in the skin care world introduced me to the buyers there, and after a three-hour meeting, I realized I was wrong. The network said it would put me on the air only after a rigorous scientific and legal process. I was impressed.
But my staff was not. My sales team thought I was turning my back on our core customers--the health-food stores that had embraced our products from the start. As the news spread among our customers, the main feedback was, "How could you do this?" But I wanted to reach the shopper who doesn't shop at GNC or Whole Foods.
Before I decided to go for it, I pored over case studies and all the analytics. QVC reaches more than 90 million households, which means I would be speaking directly to the QVC customer, as well as the Whole Foods customer who was flipping channels and maybe even the CEO of GNC. In the end, my decision was based on pure instinct.
My debut was in September 2011. I was selling our antiaging Resveratrol supplements. I was very nervous and very overwhelmed. QVC has an in-house talent trainer--she told me to talk to the camera as if it were my sister or best friend. The pressure is intense. When you go on, you have one shot--you either make it or you don't. I didn't know how well I did until it was over. That's when I saw the numbers--we had reached our goal. Still, I did not exhale for months.
We have since introduced other lines. Not everyone who sees you on QVC is going to buy your product that day, but since I started this, our customer base has grown 30 percent; in 2012, revenue hit $70 million. Even better, soon after I appeared, I started getting texts from my retailers, whose sales of Reserveage products have since doubled, saying, "Great job!"

        Our Story      









Naomi Whittel started Reserveage Nutrition™ with just four Resveratrol products more than five years ago; her goal was to become an innovator in the health and wellness field. Working with a renowned team of PhDs, medical advisers and nutritional experts, she sought to provide best- in-class nutritional supplements that are backed by gold standard science.





Every one of our products takes its inspiration from clinically researched ingredients and the world’s healthiest cultures.






My quest of curiosity (a wanderlust, if you will) began when I was a very young girl. Growing up in a family of chemists and scientists who immersed themselves in a biodynamic, organic lifestyle long before it was a trend, we always turned to pure, whole ingredients taken from the earth for solutions. This has become my lifelong passion and purpose and is why I founded Reserveage™ Nutrition. I welcome you to join me in my journey to wellness.

Our founder, Naomi Whittel, was having dinner with her cousin, Dr. Eric Lafforgue, when their conversation turned to The French Paradox. Why do the French, who enjoy a rich diet filled with cheese, pastries and great wine, also enjoy good health? The answer may be their daily consumption of red wine, which contains Resveratrol, a powerful antioxidant that has been shown in studies to help support the “longevity gene.” At that moment, the cousins decided to harness the antioxidant power of Resveratrol. And Reserveage™ Nutrition and the first four Resveratrol products were born, launching in March of 2009.

Reserveage Resveratrol supplements are created through combining standardized amounts of resveratrol from Japanese knotweed with our polyphenol blend from our patent-pending, proprietary process called Vine to Capsule® technology that preserves the essential phytonutrients found in grape skin, vines and stems. By partnering with a state-of-the art polyphenol manufacturing facility just minutes from the vineyards where we source the ingredients in our premium Pro-Longevity Factors® Blend, we are able to boost its bioavailability, resulting in products dedicated to purity, potency and freshness. “Individuals appreciate the sincere transparency Reserveage offers, and I am confident in each capsule’s quality,” said Reserveage’s Scientific Adviser Eric Lafforgue, MD.

Founder and CEO of Reserveage™ Nutrition, Naomi Whittel has dedicated her career to naturally beautify the world with a vision oriented around science, health and wellness. Whittel is a 'nutritional navigator' who travels the globe studying various cultures and ecosystems to discover the best standards in nutritional health. Launching her company with four products in March 2009—Reserveage™ Nutrition now offers an extensive list of products ranging from skin hydration, metabolism boosters, anti-aging, cardiovascular support, antioxidants, and much more. Naomi Whittel has received several prestigious awards for her role as a successful female entrepreneur, including the following: the Gold Stevie Winner as Female Executive of the Year and the Silver Stevie Winner as Female Entrepreneur of the Year. "Naomi Whittel is one of the nation’s leading female innovators in the natural products industry. With two decades of experience in developing and managing sustainable companies in the health and wellness sector, she is the founder and CEO of Reserveage Nutrition™ and two sister companies: ResVitale™ and ReBody™. Together these natural health supplement brands have earned over 30 industry awards in four years, and are recognized for their mission to produce life-changing products based on ground-breaking science."
Recently, Naomi Whittel assented to an interview with a local Arts & Entertainment Examiner, Nicolette Mallow, to talk entrepreneurship and becoming a CEO at the age of 23. Whittel also shared some helpful tips and insights related to wellness. The interview was held within the Press room at Prevention Magazine's third annual R3 Summit held at ACL Live at The Moody Theater in Austin, Texas.
Nicolette Mallow: On stage, you spoke of age and numbers. You emphasized that a number doesn't define us no matter how young or advanced in age. Listening to you talk about starting a company that went global and being the CEO at 23 years old is so inspiring to all female (or male) entrepreneurs. However, I also recall during the presentation you mentioned that sometimes in the past you hid the fact you were the CEO because you felt your age might cause others to not take you seriously... How did you overcome the fear of being the youngest? It's important for us all to learn from our elders or those with the experience of time that exceeds our own. But I have often felt the same way as an artistic professional when I'm the youngest, and often the only female, in a group where everyone else is older. It can be hard to be taken seriously and it can feel discouraging... How did you break free of all that and succeed?
Naomi Whittel: Being a young entrepreneur can be difficult. In hindsight, I wish that I hadn't always kept it a secret that I was the CEO. But it's a learning process for everyone starting out. First off, in order to succeed you have to be willing to fail and to be bold. To take risks. Failure is a huge part of success, but so long as you hold fast to your purpose and sustain boldness in all you do. In due time your visions and dreams will transpire. It's also imperative to have a voice and to be honest with yourself. To know your strengths and weaknesses... Not long ago, I was in a meeting with other entrepreneurs and we were discussing investments. We needed to raise money for something that day and it seemed daunting to the others. At first no one was willing to invest, but I saw no reason to not make a move and act. I was the first one, and the youngest, to offer up a check to invest. Once I made the first move, the others were interested in the investment and we raised the money that day. Boldness goes a long way... Once you harness your internal power and know how to use it in a healthy way. Once you find a vision and hold onto it: falling into success becomes natural.
NM: Speaking of healthy, in regards to nutrition and wellness, it can be daunting for those just starting out with a mission to achieve a better diet or a healthier lifestyle. There are thousands of books, recipes and products out there for people to try. Where to begin? What is your advice for anyone wanting to change their lifestyle and nutritional diet but they don't know where to start?
NW: Yes there is a lot of information there. I would advise the first step to be the elimination of processed foods. Processed foods do not carry natural nutrients, or often any nutrients, and therefore the body is not getting anything vital or healthy from these processed foods. Processed foods can do more harm than good. Solely because processed foods often carry a lot of chemicals and damaging, artificial substances within them, too. People aren't always aware that what they are eating isn't actually food at all... I was fortunate to grow up in a home of science and chemistry with parents focused on a biodynamic, organic lifestyle. However, I want everyone to join me on the journey to wellness no matter how or when their journey begins.
NM: My last question is, for those of us who sustain an overall healthy diet, exercise, drink plenty of fluids, take nutritional supplements and hydrate our skin, hair and nails. For those of us who feel we are nearly doing it all. What is something else that we can do to improve our diet and overall wellness?
NW: Intermittent fasting is something even the pro's can forget to do. Fasting periodically from 8 PM to NOON has amazing benefits on the body. Intermittent fasting has proven to control blood sugar and insulin. It can promote weight loss and reduce cholesterol levels. Intermittent fasting can even assist with cellular repair or inflammation in the body, reducing stress.
