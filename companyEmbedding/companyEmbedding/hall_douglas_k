A book is the nearest thing we have to telepathy, sending thoughts from the author's mind directly to the readers even over a gap of two thousand years. Even with all our technology, there is no better way to make a brain to brain connection than by simply reading a book. Go Way Back to the BeginningAntique books and manuscripts offer an amazing look into history, you can see the thoughts of the past as they saw them themselves. Antiquarian and collectible books don't just look good on the shelf, they also grow in value. There is nothing like picking up an old book to really feel the past. Explore the Human ConditionThe beauty of fiction and literature is that it lets you explore the human condition in a way that mere recitations of fact can never duplicate. Rather than focusing on the mundane, these books bring out the emotional truth of human experience. They show you who you really are by exposing you to other experiences you could never have discovered yourself. These books are the underpinnings of human culture. See how someone else sees the world. Discover the World Around YouNon fiction books offer the widest range of human experience, joined only by their commitment to the truth. From self-help to space travel, they run the gamut of human thought. Learn how to deal with your family, how to save money for that trip, or how the Egyptians built the pyramids. Follow famous lives, or study esoteric philosophies. It's all there for you to find. Non fiction gives us the foundations of human civilization, the story of how everything works. Keep Learning for LifeEducation is the gateway to success, and textbooks are your key to that door. From elementary readers to calculus texts, these books are the doors to our full potential. Textbooks not only give us facts, they give us the tools to interpret and make use of those facts. They are the key to organizing our thoughts and making our brains work for us. It's not just academia either, mechanics textbooks can help you learn how to fix your car.Tell us what you think - opens in new window or tabSide Refine PanelShop by CategoryAntique Books and ManuscriptsAudiobooksBook & Magazine Wholesale & Bulk LotsSee all in Book & Magazine Wholesale & Bulk LotsBook Wholesale LotsOther Book & Magazine Wholesale & Bulk LotsWholesale AudiobooksWholesale MagazinesBook AccessoriesSee all in Book AccessoriesAddress BooksBlank Diaries & JournalsBook CoversBook LightsBook PlatesBook Stands & HoldersBookendsBookmarksOther Book AccessoriesCatalogsSee all in CatalogsAgriculture CatalogsArt & Exhibitions CatalogsAuction CatalogsClothing & Fashion CatalogsDepartment Stores CatalogsMusic & Instruments CatalogsOther CatalogsOwner's Manuals CatalogsToys & Hobbies CatalogsChildren & Young Adult BooksSee all in Children & Young Adult BooksChildren & YA Non-Fiction BooksChildren's Fiction BooksChildren's Picture BooksOther Children & Young Adult BooksYoung Adult Fiction BooksCookbooksFiction & Literature BooksMagazine Back IssuesNonfiction BooksOther BooksTextbooks & Educational Books

Nonfiction books span the gamut of human experience, and some people have done unbelievable things. Nonfiction isn't limited to memoirs and biographies, either; it covers anything that isn't made up.Take a Step Into the PastHistory has always been a popular form of nonfiction, largely because there are so many different kinds of history. You can study everything from military history, to the history of quilting on the Canadian prairies. Anything people have ever done has a history, and in most cases you can find a nonfiction book about it. History covers everything from the broad sweep of empires to the personal stories of a single week in an individual's life. It's the story of humanity.Discover Your Inner SpiritualityEven as the world grows more and more materialistic, people find themselves turning toward nonfiction books on religion and spirituality. These books provide many people a way to find meaning in a world that is moving faster and faster every day. You can find everything from closely reasoned apologetics for the major faiths, to New Age life guides in the same place. Perhaps you'll succeed at your quest for meaning between the pages of a nonfiction book.Everyone Has to EatAll cultures have one thing in common; recipes. No matter what the culture, someone has written a cookbook, spreading cuisine around the world. You can find books on French, German, Italian, Caribbean, and just about any other form of cuisine you can imagine. In addition to cookbooks, there is also a whole world of diet books. Whether you want to lose weight, gain weight, or manage a health condition, there is a diet book to fit your needs.The Eyes Have ItArt and photography books bring the vision of the world to your very eyes. Art is fundamental to the human experience, and just one art book can show you millions of dollars' worth of old masters from around the world without the need to leave your couch. Photography books let you see the world as people like Ansel Adams and F-Stop Fitzgerald see it.Tell us what you think - opens in new window or tabSide Refine PanelShop by CategoryBooksNonfiction BooksBook AccessoriesAntique Books and ManuscriptsAudiobooksCatalogsChildren & Young Adult BooksCookbooksFiction & Literature BooksMagazine Back IssuesTextbooks & Educational BooksBook & Magazine Wholesale & Bulk LotsOther BooksFormatsee allHardcoverPaperbackMixed LotSubjectsee allArt & PhotographyBiography & AutobiographyBooks on CollectingHistoryMilitary & WarReligion & SpiritualitySports & RecreationTransportationPublication Yearsee all1800-18991900-19491950-19992000-20102011-NowSpecial Attributessee all1st EditionDust JacketEx-LibraryIllustratedLarge PrintSignedLanguagesee allConditionsee allBrand NewLike NewVery GoodGoodAcceptableNot SpecifiedPricePlease provide a valid price range$-$Buying Formatsee allAll ListingsAuctionBuy It NowItem Locationsee allDefaultWithindistance2 miles5 miles10 miles15 miles20 miles50 miles75 miles100 miles150 miles200 miles500 miles750 miles1000 miles1500 miles2000 milesofGoUS OnlyNorth AmericaWorldwideDelivery Optionssee allFree ShippingFree In-store PickupShow onlysee allReturns AcceptedCompleted ItemsSold ItemsDeals & SavingsMore refinements...

The End of Christendom and the Future of Christianity

Author: Douglas John Hall
Publisher: Wipf & Stock
Publication Date: 2002
Pages: 80

Sample Pages: 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7




Christianity can have a significant future—one that will be faithful to the original vision of the movement and of immense service to our beleaguered world. But to have that future, Western Christians must give up the future that 16 centuries of state-sponsored Christianity has conditioned them to covet.
Douglas John Hall traces the decline of Western Christendom, examining ecclesiastical responses to its fall. He proposes that the churches should use their disestablishment for good, and describes how Christians might serve dominant societies, classes, and institutions in a post-Christian era.




 

Imaging God: Dominion as Stewardship

Author: Douglas John Hall
Publisher: Wipf & Stock
Publication Date: 2004
Pages: 256

Sample Pages: 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7




The deterioration of our natural environment is one of the major issues of our time. Many analysts say that the Christian concept of humanity’s “dominion” over creation is a primary cause of this crisis.
Douglas John Hall does not attempt to exonerate historical Christianity from that charge—the church must own part in this predicament. But, Hall argues, confession alone is not enough. The crisis forces us to rethink our whole understanding of the relationship between humanity and nature. This new understanding must be based on the image of God in humanity—the imago dei.
Hall carefully examines the biblical, historical, and theological meanings of this term, which became Christianity’s symbolic way of designating the essence of human beings. He argues that the image of God is not an endowment; rather, it is a quality that pertains to our relationship with God. We should think of imago as a verb, not a noun, he says. The human vocation within the created order is “to image” the creator.




 

The Messenger: Friendship, Faith, and Finding One’s Way

Author: Douglas John Hall
Publisher: Cascade
Publication Date: 2011
Pages: 192

Sample Pages: 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7




When he was 20 years old, Douglas John Hall hoped to study music professionally. He met a young minister whose “different” Christianity both surprised and intrigued him. In the end, this friendship altered the course of his life. This book traces the story of their 50-year friendship and its impact upon their lives. In the process of telling his story, Hall reveals the importance of mentors in the lives of the young.


Doug Hall weighs in again with his characteristic gracefulness and his mature, uncommon wisdom.
—Walter Brueggemann, William Marcellus McPheeters professor of Old Testament emeritus, Columbia Theological Seminary




 

The Steward: A Biblical Symbol Come of Age

Author: Douglas John Hall
Publisher: Wipf & Stock
Publication Date: 2004
Pages: 272

Sample Pages: 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7




Many Christians are confused or ambivalent about their role as stewards. Douglas John Hall recaptures the most basic meaning of the biblical metaphor of the steward and applies that meaning to our social context. Working from numerous angles, Hall explores the rich meaning and implications of stewardship. He compares scriptural teaching on stewardship—concentrated in Jesus’ parables—with the role of stewardship in the church’s history, maintaining that ever since the fourth century, the church's understanding and practice of stewardship has been distorted by its alliance with institutional power.





 

Waiting for Gospel: An Appeal to the Dispirited Remnants of Protestant “Establishment”

Author: Douglas John Hall
Publisher: Cascade
Publication Date: 2012
Pages: 226

Sample Pages: 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7




Douglas John Hall argues that Christianity first gained a foothold in the world because it proclaimed a message that awakened men and women to possibilities they had never entertained. According to Hall, Christianity’s existence is dependent on this new zest for life that is awakened in people who are transformed by a gospel that speaks to the specifics of each persons time and place. Religion is in decline in the West, but Hall challenges Christians to stop devising ever more impressive promotional schemes, and to hear and proclaim the gospel instead.


As people continue to discuss the place of the church in North America leaning on sociology and cultural studies, Doug Hall reminds us that in the end it will be only theology, a lived theology of existential depth, that will help.
—Andrew Root, Olson Baalson Associate Professor of Youth and Family Ministry, Luther Seminary, St. Paul, Minnesota




 

What Christianity Is Not: An Exercise in “Negative” Theology

Author: Douglas John Hall
Publisher: Cascade
Publication Date: 2013
Pages: 194

Sample Pages: 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7




What really is Christianity? If all the religious packaging in which it is wrapped were removed, what would remain? These were Dietrich Bonhoeffer’s questions, and Douglas John Hall argues that they must be ours today. In many quarters, Christianity is so narrowly identified with a few radical parts, cultural associations, and past ambitions that many see it as a threat to the planetary future.
Hall maintains that, though we may no longer speak clearly of the essence of Christianity, perhaps we may still have a sufficiently shared sense of the core of the faith to be able to say what Christianity is not.


In his critique of idolatrous misconstruals of the faith, Hall is himself a forceful antidote to the dysfunction of our society and to the dismay of the church.
—Walter Brueggemann, William Marcellus McPheeters professor of Old Testament emeritus, Columbia Theological Seminary
As one of this generation's most profound theological thinkers, Douglas John Hall reveals his magisterial grasp of the depth and complexity of the Christian tradition.
—Patricia G. Kirkpatrick, associate professor of Hebrew Bible, McGill University




 

When You Pray: Thinking Your Way into God’s World

Author: Douglas John Hall
Publisher: Wipf & Stock
Publication Date: 2003
Pages: 158

Sample Pages: 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7




When life becomes complicated with problems too painful to face, Christians often turn to God as a way of turning off the world. For Douglas John Hall, prayer is more than a shield from trouble or a source of comfort. He calls Christians to experience exciting prayer possibilities that lift us out of our self-concern into a vital, worldly stewardship in harmony with the purpose of the gospel.
This thoughtful study asks two significant questions: what is prayer, and what should we be doing when we pray? Hall explores the nature of prayer, and the relationship between prayer, thought, and action. He observes that “Love for God and love for the world are not alternatives; they are part of the same seamless robe.” Through prayer “God separates us from the world in order to send us back into the world with renewed spirits.”

Publisher's Description▼▲
In these dialogues with doubt, Hall enters into an earnest search with a young inquirer a composite of undergraduates, graduates, clergy, working people, his own children who is on the edges of Christian faith. Half familiar with superficial aspects of Christianity, hopeful of there being greater depth than has been found so far, she or he is curious, insistent, looking for something to believe in but not ready to leap without good reason. Such a person is asking, "Why be Christian?" In a passionate and personal way, Hall probes fundamental religious questions and wrestles with the cogency of basic Christian convictions about Jesus and God, about religious belief and the human predicament, about inauthentic forms of Christianity, about what is missing in human life today. Quoting Unamuno's dictum that "Faith that does not doubt is dead faith," Hall's accessible and straightforward book helps readers to reclaim a Christianity of personal, intellectual, and moral integrity. This book may well prove a modern religious classic.
