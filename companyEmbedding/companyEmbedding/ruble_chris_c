                            The website was not working correctly when I first tried to reload my card and I had to spend time on the phone waiting to speak with a representative.  After speaking with them I was told to wait for the website and was not even offered the option to reload over the phone.  It ended up working later, so it wasn't a big deal.

Great

                            It was easy to use enjoyed using it getting pesos out of the ATM but unfortunately I was a little disappointed the fact that the ATMs kept on charging me a fee which I thought there wasn't going to be a fee but otherwise it was good to have.
