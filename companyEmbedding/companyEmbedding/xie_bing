Herbal Creams


Our creams are compounded specifically to order. If you treat skin diseases, support your internal treatment with topical applications. We offer a range of well established herbal creams to assist you. And of course, you can design your own herbal creams.
 
How are our creams compounded?
The composition of our creams is based on traditional recipes. To compound the creams, we use a coconut oil base cream (paraffin-free), liquid extracts and other substances like alum, sulfur or beeswax. The liquid extracts are carefully blended with the base cream to achieve a homogenous and consistent product. The creams are suitable for sensitive individuals and babies.
 
Quality and Safety
We use GMP manufactured ingredients only. The compounding process follows a strict protocol to prevent errors. Furthermore, we perform long term testing on all of your creams in our own laboratory to ensure quality and safety of the products.
 
Packaging & Sizes
Our creams are packed in strong, white polypropylene (PP) jars (50g, 100g, 250g, 400g). They are fitted with a transparent caska-seal, which prevents contact with the cream and assists in keeping the lid clean. The cream jars are then packed and sent in padded bags. Our packaging materials are eco-friendly and recyclable because we care about our planet.

Sentiment Analysis: mining opinions, sentiments, and emotions. Cambridge University Press, 2015.
 Book:  Sentiment Analysis and Opinion Mining (Introduction and Survey), Morgan & Claypool, May 2012. 
 See "Feature-Based Opinion Mining and Summmarization" in Microsoft Live/Bing Search and Google Product Search (paper).

 Note: I don't know the techniques used by Microsoft Live/Bing (9/28/2007), but Google has a paper. To see the model, please check out (Hu and Liu, KDD-2004) and (Liu et al, WWW-2005) below, or the books above (better). Try search for a camera and click on reviews. You will see summarized user opinions on product features/aspects in a bar chart.

 Opinion Parser: my sentiment analysis system has been licensed to two companies.  

 The system analyzes sentiments, opinions and emotions, extracts sentiment targets: entities, topics and their aspects/features, and handles comparative sentences. 
 I cannot make the system open-source due to its commercial use. If you want to know how it works, please read my new sentiment analysis book, which gives a lot of details.

1. Introduction 

This work is in the area of sentiment analysis and opinion mining from social media, e.g., reviews, forum discussions, and blogs. In our KDD-2004 paper, we proposed the Feature-Based Opinion Mining model, 
which is now also called Aspect-Based Opinion Mining 
(as the term feature here can confuse with the term feature used in 
machine learning). The output of such opinion mining is a 
feature-based opinion summary 
or aspect-based opinion summary. The commonly known sentiment classification is a sub-task. Our current work is in two main areas, 
which reflect two kinds of opinions (or evaluations)

 Mining regular (or direct) opinions. Ex: (1). This camera is great. (2). After taking the drug, I got stomach pain.
 Mining comparative opinions. Ex: Coke tastes better than Pepsi.

 Since 2006, we have also worked on 

Fake review and opinion spam detection. Fake reviews are also called bogus reviews or fraudulent reviews. See the papers [WWW-2007, WSDM-2008, CIKM-2010a, CIKM-2010b, WWW-2012]


2. Sentiment Analysis or Mining of Regular Opinions

In this research, we aim to mine and to summarize online opinions in reviews, 
tweets, blogs, forum discussions, etc. Specifically, we mine features or aspects of entities (e.g., products) or topics on which people have expressed their opinions and determine whether the opinions are positive or negative. For opinion summarization, we advocate the quantitative aspect and the target of opinions because 50% of the people say something is bad is not the same as 5% say it is bad. 

 Abstraction of the problem: Feature-based opinion mining and summarization (aspect-based opinion mining and summarization) of multiple reviews (KDD-04 and WWW-05)

Formal definitions can be found in my book "Sentiment Analysis and Opinion Mining". They are based on several of our papers in 2004 and 2005. The abstraction provides a model of online opinions, describes what should be extracted from opinion sources (e.g., reviews, forums, and blogs) and how the results 
may be organized and presented to the user. The main mining tasks are:

 mining entities and their features (or aspects) that have been commented on or evaluated by people,
 determining whether the comment/opinion on each entity feature (or aspect) is positive, negative or neutral (aspect-based sentiment classification), and  
 summarizing the results. 

3. Sentiment Analysis of Comparative Opinions 
A comparative sentence usually expresses an ordering relation between two sets 
of entities with respect to some shared features (or aspects). For example, the 
comparative sentence "Canon's optics are better than those of Sony and 
Nikon" expresses the comparative relation: (better, {optics}, {Canon}, 
{Sony, Nikon}). Comparative sentences use different language constructs 
from typical opinion sentences (e.g., "Cannon's optic is great").

Abstraction of the problem: "which is better than which on what". Again, the formal definitions can be found in my book "Sentiment Analysis and Opinion Mining". The main mining tasks are:


 identify comparative sentences from texts, e.g., reviews, forum or blog postings, and news articles.

 extract comparative relations from the identified comparative sentences. 


Opinion Lexicon (or Sentiment Lexicon)

 Opinion Lexicon: 
A list of English positive and negative opinion words or sentiment words
 (around 6800 words). This list was compiled over many years starting from our first paper (Hu and Liu, KDD-2004). 
 Comparative words: A list of non-standard English compariative words and phrases for sentiment analysis. This list was compiled over many years starting from our first paper (Jindal and Liu, SIGIR-2006)
 Although necessary, having an opinion lexicon is far from sufficient for accurate sentiment analysis. See this paper: Sentiment Analysis and Subjectivity or the Sentiment Analysis book.
 Try Search for the Best Restaurant based on specific aspects, e.g., "best burger," "friendliest service." The system is a demo, which uses the lexicon (also phrases) and grammatical analysis for opinion mining. 


Data Sets

 Annotated: Customer Review Datasets (5 products) associated with the paper (Hu and Liu, KDD-2004). 
 Annotated: Additional Customer Review Datasets (9 products) some used in (Ding, Liu and Yu, WSDM-2008), which improves the lexicon-based method proposed in (Hu and Liu, KDD-2004)
 Annotated: More Customer Review Datasets (3 products) used in (Liu et al., IJCAI-2015)

  Amazon Product Review Data (more than 5.8 million reviews) used in (Jindal and Liu, WWW-2007, WSDM-2008; Lim et al, CIKM-2010; Jindal, Liu and Lim, CIKM-2010; Mukherjee et al. WWW-2011; Mukherjee, Liu and Glance, WWW-2012) for opinion spam (fake review) detection. You can also use it for sentiment analysis. It has information about reviewers, review texts, ratings, 
product info, etc. Due to the large file size, you may need to use Download Accelerator Plus (DAP) to download. If you use this data, please cite (Jindal and Liu, WSDM-2008).
 Pros and cons dataset used in (Ganapathibhotla and Liu, Coling-2008) for determining context (aspect) dependent sentiment words, which are then applied to sentiment analysis of comparative sentiences (comparative sentence dataset). The same form of Pros and Cons data was also used in (Liu, Hu and Cheng, WWW-2005). 
 Comparative sentence dataset used in (Jindal and Liu, SIGIR-06) and (Jindal and Liu, AAAI-2006). Comparative sentence dataset used in (Ganapathibhotla and Liu, Coling-2008). 
 Blog author gender classification data set associated with the paper (Mukherjee and Liu, EMNLP-2010)
  Debate data set  used in (Mukherjee and Liu, ACL-2013; Mukherjee et al. ACL-2013 ). 
  Yelp Filtered Reviews for Opinion spam or fake detection associated with the paper (Mukherjee et al.ICWSM-2013).
