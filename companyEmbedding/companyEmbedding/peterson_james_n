                              An undergraduate capstone engineering design project now provides hydroelectric power to a remote wilderness location. Students
                                 investigated the feasibility of designing, building, and installing a 4kW hydroelectric system to satisfy the need for electric
                                 power to support the research and teaching functions of Taylor Ranch, a university facility far from the utility grid. After
                                 showing such a system to be feasible, they proceeded to design and build it. Technical issues and stringent environmental
                                 regulations are addressed. The students documented their design and developed instructions for installation and operation.
                                 The system was installed and currently provides electric power for Taylor Ranch. The first year of operation is briefly described
                                 and photographs of the equipment are presented. (Author)

Employees







Peterson, James N
Owner


















Before you Hire

Here are some rules, regulations, and laws governing general contractors
in Minnesota:













Does Peterson, James N carry a valid contracting license?



Licenses are required for all residential building contractors and residential remodelers who contract with a homeowner to construct or improve dwellings by offering more than one special skill. Owners working on their own property must also be licensed if they build or remodel for the sole purpose of speculation or resale.











How important is contractor licensing in Minnesota?



Contractors acting as sole proprietors, or qualifying persons for a construction related business entity, must pass a two part exam. The first section tests building code compliance knowledge. Section two tests a candidate's understanding of Minnesota business and law.











Your liability risk when hiring Peterson, James N



Licensed contractors in Minnesota must carry both active workers' compensation and general liability insurance policies. Request a copy of the insurance certificate for each before any work begins. 











Financial recourse when hiring Peterson, James N



The purpose of the Minnesota Contractor Recovery Fund is to compensate consumers who have suffered losses due to a licensed contractor's fraudulent, deceptive, or dishonest practices, conversion of funds, or failure to perform. All licensed contractors are required to pay a fee to the fund. The total amount that can be paid out against any one licensed contractor is $75,000. If multiple claims are filed against the same contractor, they are prorated. In these situations, you may not be able to recover your entire loss. 











How is the BuildZoom score calculated?



The BuildZoom score is based on a number of factors including the contractor's license status, insurance status, verified work history, standing with local consumer interest groups, verified reviews from other BuildZoom users and self-reported feedback from the contractor.











Why you should hire through BuildZoom



When it comes to major construction work or even minor alterations to your home, hiring the wrong contractor could result in incomplete or defective work. You may even find yourself dealing with huge liability claims. BuildZoom does the homework for you and helps you hire the right contractor.











You should get several bids before hiring a contractor



Before hiring a contractor in Minnesota, be sure to get at least 3 detailed bids. Quality contractors will take the time to explain their budget proposal, and help guide you through the estimate process. Be wary of an abnormally low bid, they are not worth the risk. These underpriced projects often do not end well for the homeowner, choose a contractor you trust and can clearly communicate with. BuildZoom has made the bid collection process extremely simple (and free). Just click here to get started.

Nice.
April 27, 2017


By: Stephen B.
Product: Peterson University Flake 50g 

        Good medium strength flake. Nice topping and burn. Much better than Erinmore Flake. 
      




Good smoke!

Favorite Peterson Flake
March 30, 2017


By: Charles M.
Product: Peterson University Flake 50g 


Nice, well rounded VA/Burley flake here.  The plum topping is more predominantly in the tin and room notes rather than in taste and is so very pleasing.  I have a Bjarne pipe designated to a fold-n-stuff filling of University Flake.  It lights well a... Read More
nd burns without issue.  I forgot about a tin in the back of the cupboard for a few years.  Man, this ages well!  I just bought a few tins to "lose" again.  Don't let it dry out.  I prefer to keep it a little damp (as its tinned) and just know that I'll need to sit a flake out for a few hours before smoking.  Sit it out with your morning bowl and load this for some afternoon delight.  This is in my regular rotation for when I need something a little lighter and a little sweeter. Read Less






Plum Fantastic
January 30, 2017


By: Randy C.
Product: Peterson University Flake 50g 

        I first experienced this flake at a local brick and mortar store and fell in love with it. The plum topping is evident in the tin note but not overly sweet after the char light. One of my top tobaccos. 
      




One of the Favorites
October 25, 2016


By: Joshua L.
Product: Peterson University Flake 50g 

        This is one of the few Peterson blends that I really like. The plum topping is good. It packs just enough punch to get you where you're going. 
      




Nice flake with plum topping
September 26, 2016


By: David F.
Product: Peterson University Flake 50g 

        This is very similar to Erinmore Flake, but stronger and with a distinct plum topping.  Smokes nicely, deep flavors.  A nice flake to have in the cupboard for occasional smokes. 
      




Davidoff Flake medallions baby sister
September 20, 2016


By: Ahmad O.
Product: Peterson University Flake 50g 


Upon opening the customary square tin of flakes you are grested with an earthy,fruity aroma resembling that of Erinmore flakes. But make no mistake. This is nothing alike. Maybe except in the generous amount if virginia in both. The flakes are well p... Read More
ressed and presented in a fashion worthy of Peterson name. It packs easily but I discovered that packing it as a flake makes it hard to light and keep lit. As it seems it was well pressed. So breaking the flakes as I did or rubbing it would be better. Once it is packed like that, it shone. Grassy, smoky virginias takes over with a little hint of nutiness at times and fruitiness at others. It is well rounded, all day virginia smoke. And I couldn't help to make the connection of this as a milder version of Davidoff Flake medallions Read Less






Not bad
August 12, 2016


By: Daniel S.
Product: Peterson University Flake 50g 

        It is good, just not great. With other better blends like this out there, for my tastes, this is forgettable 
      




Nice smoke.
July 14, 2016


By: Den J.
Product: Peterson University Flake 50g 

        Scored some of this stuff from a friend and I must say it's pretty decent. Not the most flavorful as other virgina/burley I've had. This stuff stays lit forever. Only had to fire up the bowl twice. 
      




Smooth, satisfying
July 02, 2016


By: Haslizan A.
Product: Peterson University Flake 50g 

        Newbie? Previous ciggarette smoker? UF is a must have. Gradually experiment on other blends, although newbies tend to go for aromatic blends for a start 
      




Nice Virginia
May 21, 2016


By: Tom K.
Product: Peterson University Flake 50g 

        Very pleasant smoke, not my favorite, but good to keep a tin around. 
      




Tart
March 26, 2016


By: Carl J.
Product: Peterson University Flake 50g 


I've revisited this blend after trying it several years ago. The fruit topping is most notable on the initial light. It takes a more or less prominent role throughout, partially muting the tobaccos more or less. The after taste is the most memorable ... Read More
part, which is a tart, almost sour taste. It is a good blend but don't be expecting a powerhouse in either topping or tobacco taste. Read Less






tasteless
May 20, 2015


By: Alex c.
Product: Peterson University Flake 50g 

        compared to irish flake with similar tobaccos this is bland. Initial impressions I squirmed at the taste. 
      




One of the best
February 06, 2015


By: Ethan F.
Product: Peterson University Flake 50g 

        this was one of my first virginias and still my favorite. There is a slight plum topping that comes out in the smoke. It is very subtle and sweet, it doesn't taste like a chemical. Most of the flavor is a mellow va taste, mild but flavorful. 
      




Best Va flake to me
December 14, 2014


By: Andrea M.
Product: Peterson University Flake 50g 

        Some people tastes some plum aroma, but not me. I swear I can't feel any chemical aroma, only the sweet fundamental note of Virginia, which is pretty strong but rounded up by the burley. 
      




Good tobacco

        I don't know why but I like it. may be I like it cause the aroma of this tobacco. every things not too much.

        Tastes like a cigar. Kind of strong to me. If I wanted to smoke a cigar, I would smoke a cigar. I don't want a cigar in my pipe. Lol 
      




Very good tin
November 27, 2013


By: Adam B.
Product: Peterson University Flake 50g 


I do not smoke terribly often, and smoke tinned tobacco less often, but this is my go-to tin when I do.  I very much enjoy it; a sweet plum taste as mentioned by others.  It smokes easily and cool.  It is great to fill the rather deep bowl on my Skov... Read More

Great Anytime
August 31, 2013


By: Robert O.
Product: Peterson University Flake 50g 


I picked this up the other day due to the fact that so many people seem to like it. It was a good call. I'm not a heavy or all day smoker. Most of the time it's with a cup of coffee on the back patio in the morning or at social events in the evening.... Read More
 So I tend to look for something fairly low in vitamin N and not a Lat bomb. This flake seems to fit the bill well. Just for information sake I tend to prefer to rub out my flakes as opposed to the fold and stuff method. I allowed the flake to dry for about twenty minuets then loosely rubbed it out leaving it fairly long strands. I found it to have a light scent of raspberries in a very present and not overpowering way. The tobacco smoked and packed nicely. I believe that his could be an easy all day smoke if I were that type of person. The taste was mild to medium in strength and had a pleasant aroma. I definitely plan on purchasing more for cellaring and regular use. If you are a flake fan or just curious you definitely need to give this one a try. Read Less






My all-day.
April 29, 2013


By: Thomas W.
Product: Peterson University Flake 50g 

        This is hands down my favorite flake, even though I typically smoke VaPers. I can (and do sometimes) go bowl to bowl on this one. I love cubing it, but it folds great too. A nice burley taste predominates, and I haven't been bit yet. 
      




Excellent friend of Bourbon
February 25, 2013


By: Matthew L.
Product: Peterson University Flake 50g 

        This is an excellent flake to smoke.  It retains a certain spicy quality.  Very nice to be able to rub out your own flake according to the size you desire to fill your pipe.  This goes amazingly well with a good glass of Bourbon!!!! 
      




Not for me...
November 12, 2012


By: David N.
Product: Peterson University Flake 50g 

        Got it free with my new Peterson XL22 Green Spigot (Very nice!) However, this blend tasted like a cigarette to me.  Wife did not approve either.

September 28, 2012


By: James N.
Product: Peterson University Flake 50g 


I can't get enough of this blend. I like to keep a tin nearby just to open and take in the aroma when I'm not smoking. I have more Peterson pipes than any other brand (my family are Irish) and I find it fitting to smoke University flake through them.... Read More
 I like mild, cool smoke, and I don't need to make a trade off on taste with this. The Mahogany/Burley/Virginia ratio is bang on. I'm very proud of my stack of tins. Read Less

ertain "plum" taste. Theres times I crave Univ Flake, and I keep it on hand for those times. It is such a favorite to me , that I reserve my Peterson Silver Spigot, for it. I got my Silver Spigot, and a can of Univ Flake for Christmas last year, purchased from none other than Smoking Pipes .com. So, my first smoke, in my first Spigot, was Univ Flake. Sort of a Special moment. Just last night, I smoked the same combination, and it took me back to Christmas day. Thats how much I like University Flake. Read Less

BROOMFIELD, Colo., Sept. 22, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Ball Corporation (NYSE:  BLL) today announced that Michael W. Feldser, 64, senior vice president and chief operating officer, metal food and household products packaging, will retire at the end of 2015 after nearly a decade with the company. James N. Peterson, 47, has been named to succeed Feldser and will have the same title.
"Mike has made meaningful contributions to Ball. Most notably, he led the transformation of the food and household products packaging business into a global organization with expanded product lines and broadened geographies," said John A. Hayes, chairman, president and chief executive officer. "We congratulate Mike on his outstanding career and wish him all the best in retirement." 
Peterson came to Ball in 2006 as part of operations acquired from U.S. Can Corp. Since joining Ball, Peterson led North American packaging innovation and marketing efforts. In his most recent role as vice president of marketing and corporate affairs he led the transformation of Ball's sustainability and community programs, which has positioned the corporation as an industry leader in these categories. He has also aligned Ball's communications across the globe, and has established Ball as a leader in promoting and protecting the can industry. 
"Jim's commitment to staying close to customers, his drive for results, uncompromising integrity and overall leadership acumen ideally position him to take on this important opportunity," said Hayes.
