Welcome to OncBioMune Pharmaceuticals Inc.
We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company engaged in the development of novel cancer immunotherapy products, with a proprietary vaccine technology that is designed to stimulate the immune system to selectively attack cancer cells without harm to the patient.  The vaccine technology has been proven safe through use in more than 300 patients without a single serious adverse event.  Our lead product, ProscaVax™ for prostate cancer, is near conclusion of a Phase 1 trial funded by the Department of Defense Navy Cancer Vaccine Program.  Based upon data showing ProscaVax is non-toxic and can lower PSA levels, we are moving ProscaVax into a Phase 2 trial for prostate cancer patients in the “Active Surveillance” category, an early stage of disease for which there are currently no treatments without significant morbidities. OncBioMune also has a portfolio of targeted therapies, some of which are biosimilars to blockbuster drugs, including paclitaxel (Abraxane).

About Usadmin2016-03-30T17:16:33+00:00 
OncBioMune Pharmaceuticals is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company engaged in the development of novel cancer immunotherapy products, with a proprietary vaccine technology that is designed to stimulate the immune system to selectively attack cancer cells without harm to the patient. The vaccine technology has been proven safe through use in more than 300 patients without a single serious adverse event. Our lead product, ProscaVax™ for prostate cancer, is near conclusion of a Phase 1 trial funded by the Department of Defense Navy Cancer Vaccine Program. Based upon data showing ProscaVax is non-toxic and can lower PSA levels, we are moving ProscaVax into a Phase 2 trial for prostate cancer patients in the “Active Surveillance” category, an early stage of disease for which there are currently no treatments without significant morbidities. OncBioMune also has a portfolio of targeted therapies, some of which are biosimilars to blockbuster drugs, including paclitaxel (Abraxane).  OncBioMune is headquartered in Baton Rouge, LA.


LEADERSHIP
 Dr. Jonathan Head, Ph.D.
CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, CHAIRMAN
Dr. Head has been instrumental in the development of our new chemotherapy and immunotherapy programs. Dr. Head and Dr. Elliott are the co-developers and patent holders of one of the first patented autologous breast cancer vaccines in the United States.  His major goal is to implement translational research – the movement of laboratory-developed technologies into the clinical setting.  This is the taking of new therapies from cell culture to an accepted therapy for cancer patients.
As a tumor cell biologist, Dr. Head’s specialties include:

Cell culture research
Animal research
Human clinical research
Innovative chemotherapies
Immunotherapy/cancer vaccines
Oncogene and antisense research
Tumor markers

Dr. Head is an Adjunct Associate Professor of Biochemistry at Tulane University School of Medicine, an Adjunct Professor of Physical and Biological Sciences at Delta State University and an Adjunct Associate Professor at Louisiana State University School of Veterinary Medicine.   He is an active member of the American Association for Cancer Research and the American Society of Clinical Oncology. Although patients rarely meet Dr. Head, the new treatments we offer are the result of his and Dr. Elliott’s work.
 Dr. Robert Elliott, M.D., Ph.D.
CHIEF MEDICAL OFFICER, DIRECTOR
Dr. Robert Elliott is the driving force behind our The Elliott-Elliott-Head Breast Cancer Research and Treatment Center.  Colleagues often remark that his energy seems boundless. Indeed, it often is.
In 1973, when the Center was founded, Dr. Elliott’s dream was to create the finest center for total breast care. With that step behind us, the dream continues.  Dr. Elliott continues doing research to discover new treatments and drug therapies, and has implemented a team approach to bring total breast care to the patients.
Dr. Elliott sees patients from all over Louisiana, the Southeast and across the United States. He collaborates on research projects with other scientists around the world. Dr. Elliott has spoken to medical audiences in the United States and Europe and has authored many papers and abstracts. He has also published a book, Breast Cancer, Anger at the Enemy, which deals with the lack of total breast care available for women. He shares his own frustration and heartaches of caring for dying cancer patients as they struggle for survival, and finally sends a message of hope as he and his research team search for a cure for breast cancer.
Trained as a general surgeon, Dr. Elliott feels that breast care should be a specialty of itself, with patients being able to receive the highest quality of care from one physician who reads their mammograms, examines them, performs their surgery and administers their therapies.
To advance this concept and to share his experience with other physicians like himself who specialize in breast care, Dr. Elliott founded the American Mastology Association. He currently serves as President of this society. In spite of a busy calendar of meetings and research, Dr. Elliott’s first love is his patients. He devotes the majority of his time to the Center and to helping women overcome breast disease.
 Andrew Kucharchuk
CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER, PRESIDENT, DIRECTOR
Andrew “Al” Kucharchuk is a graduate of Louisiana State and Tulane Universities Freeman School of Business, where he earned an MBA with a Finance Concentration. He currently serves as the Company’s Chief Financial Officer and oversees the business and administrative processes.  In addition to these duties, Al also directs business development efforts including the expansion of operations to accommodate increased research and clinical development. Al has assisted Dr. Head in the administration of the three contracts that have lead to the clinical studies for the Company’s lead product, ProscaVax™.
Mr. Kucharchuk is a member of Kappa Alpha Order fraternity. He lives in Baton Rouge with his wife Jessica and their sons Henry and Davis.

“Targeted Transferrin Transport Technology”
The Company has developed a strategy to increase the efficacy and lessen the toxicity of cancer chemotherapy by binding heavy metals and coupling chemotherapeutic drugs to the serum protein transferrin. Transferrin is the serum protein that transports iron to sites of absorption, utilization and storage. Iron is an essential micronutrient for DNA synthesis, and all cancer cells require very large amounts of iron for DNA synthesis and rapid cell growth. Cancer cells express 100 to 1,000-fold greater numbers of transferrin receptors on their cell surface than normal cells.
Therefore, with our transferrin transport technology (TTT), we can deliver cytotoxic agents targeted selectively to the cancer cell, and thus, have little effect on normal cells.
Our transferrin compounds are of three types:

Heavy metals bound to the physiologic binding sites of the transferrin molecule
Drugs conjugated to the molecule by a gluteraldehyde coupling process.
 Drugs trapped in protein molecules.

These agents alone and in combination with other cancer therapies, demonstrate tremendous cancer cell killing with little effect on normal cells. They have been shown to potentiate the effect and lessen the toxicity of conventional chemotherapy if given as pretreatment prior to the chemotherapy. One of the compounds (cis-platinum-transferrin) has been shown to be an especially good radiation sensitizer, and potentiate the effects of doxorubucin when used as a pretreatment agent.
The Company is also involved in attacking iron metabolism of cancer cells by many other approaches. We disrupt intracellular iron metabolic pathways and prevent iron storage into the protein ferritin. We have technology to modulate transferrin receptors on the surface of cancer cells, which gives us much flexibility in using all of our approaches. Some of the intracellular methods use our antisense technology, which will be discussed in the section on antisense.

 OncBioMune Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (OTCMKTS:OBMP) Files An 8-K Entry into a Material Definitive AgreementItem 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
General. On July 26, 2017 (the “Original Issue Date”) the Company entered into and closed on the transaction set forth in the Securities Purchase Agreement (the “Securities Purchase Agreement”) it entered into with three institutional investors (the “Purchasers”) for the sale of the Company’s convertible notes and warrants. to the terms provided for in the Securities Purchase Agreement, the Company issued upon closing to the Purchasers for an aggregate subscription amount of $300,000: (i) 10% Original Issue Discount 5% Senior Secured Convertible Notes in the aggregate principal amount of $333,883.50 (the “Notes”); and (ii) warrants (the “Warrants”) to purchase 4,769,763 shares of the Company’s common stock, par value $0.001 per share (the “Common Stock”) at an exercise price of $0.10 per share (subject to adjustments under certain conditions as defined in the Warrants). The closing under the Securities Purchase Agreement occurred on July 26, 2017.
Follow-On Funding. Within ninety days of the Original Issue Date, so long as (1) there is no event of default under the Notes, (2) certain “equity conditions” as discussed below are satisfied, (3) there have been no material adverse changes in the business or prospects of the Company, and (4) the Company has complied with all of its obligations under the Notes and documents entered into in connection therewith, upon the satisfaction of certain conditions, the Company agreed to sell, and the Purchasers, severally and not jointly, agreed to purchase an aggregate of (i) $333,883.50 face value of 10% original issue discount additional Notes for a total purchase price of $300,000.00, and (ii) 4,769,763 Warrants (the “Follow-On Funding”). The form of the additional Notes and Warrants will be substantially similar to the Notes and Warrants issued to the Purchasers on July 26, 2017. In the event that the Company has satisfied certain conditions set forth in the Securities Purchase Agreement (b) and the Purchasers are satisfied in their sole discretion, that certain milestones have been met and the use of proceeds are satisfactory to the Purchasers, at the request of the Company, the purchase and sale of the Notes and Warrants for the Follow-On Funding may be prior to ninety days from the Original Issue Date.
The Notes. The aggregate principal amount of the Notes is $333,883.50 and the Company will receive $300,000 after giving effect to the original issue discount of $33,883.50. The Notes bear interest at a rate equal to 5% per annum (which interest rate is increased to 24% per annum upon the occurrence of an Event of Default (as defined in the Notes)), have a maturity date of March 25, 2018 and are convertible (principal, and interest) at any time after the issuance date of the Notes into shares of the Company’s Common Stock at a conversion price equal to $0.07 per share (subject to adjustment as provided in the Note), provided, however, that if an event of default has occurred, regardless of whether such Event of Default has been cured or remains ongoing, the Note shall be convertible at 60% of the lowest closing price during the prior twenty trading days of the Common Stock as reported on the OTCQB or other principal trading market (the “Default Conversion Price”). The Notes provide for three amortization payments on the six-month, seven-month and eight-month anniversary of the issue date with each amortization payment being one third of the total outstanding principal and interest. If the six-month amortization payment is made in cash then the payment is an amount equal to 110% of the applicable amortization payment and if the seven-month or the eight-month amortization payments are made in cash then the payment is an amount equal to 115% of the applicable amortization payment. The Notes may be prepaid at any time until the 210th day following the Original Issue Date at an amount equal to (i) 115% of outstanding principal balance of the Note and accrued and unpaid interest during the period from the Original Issue Date through the three months following the Original Issue Date, and (ii) 120% of outstanding principal balance of the Notes and accrued and unpaid interest during months four through seven following the Original Issue Date. In order to prepay the Notes, the Company shall provide 20 Trading Days prior written notice to the Purchaser, during which time the Purchaser may convert the Notes in whole or in part at the Conversion Price.
The Purchaser may elect at its option to receive the amortization payments in Common Stock as subject to the following conditions (the “equity conditions”): there shall be no event of default under the Note, on each payment date, the average daily volume of the Common Stock for the previous twenty (20) trading days must be greater than $30,000 (calculated by multiplying the reported volume for each such day on the principal Trading Market times the closing price on each such day), the Company’s Common Stock must be DWAC eligible and not subject to any “chill” or other restriction issued or imposed by the Depository Trust Company, the Company must be current on all its SEC filings, including to any extension requests, the shares will be delivered via an “automatic conversion” of principal and/or interest and shares of Common Stock delivered in payment of amortization will be valued at the lower of the conversion price or 60% of the lowest closing price of the Common Stock as reported on the Trading Market for the twenty prior trading days prior to the applicable amortization payment.
The Notes contain certain covenants, such as restrictions on the incurrence of indebtedness, creation of liens, payment of restricted payments, redemptions, payment of cash dividends and the transfer of assets. The Notes also contains certain adjustment provisions that apply in connection with any stock split, stock dividend, stock combination, recapitalization or similar transactions. The conversion price is subject to adjustment if we issue or sell shares of our common stock for a consideration per share less than the conversion price then in effect, or issue options, warrants or other securities convertible or exchange for shares of our common stock at a conversion or exercise price less than the conversion price of the Notes then in effect. If either of these events should occur, the conversion price is reduced to the lowest price at which these securities were issued or are exercisable. We granted the Purchasers certain rights of first refusal on future offerings by us for as long as the Purchasers hold the Notes. In addition, subject to limited exceptions, the Purchasers will not have the right to convert any portion of the Note if the Purchaser, together with its affiliates, would beneficially own in excess of 4.99% of the number of shares of the Company’s Common Stock outstanding immediately after giving effect to its conversion. The Purchaser may increase or decrease this ownership limitation to any percentage not exceeding 9.99% upon 61 days prior written notice to us. In addition, we granted the Purchasers certain rights of first refusal on future offerings by us for as long as the Purchasers hold the Notes.
The Warrants. As described above, holders of the Notes received Warrants to purchase up to 4,769,763 shares of Common Stock. The initial exercise price for the Warrants is $0.10 per share, subject to adjustment as described below, and the Warrants are exercisable for five years after the issuance date. The Warrants are exercisable for shares of Common Stock upon the payment in cash of the exercise price and they are also exercisable on a cashless basis at any time there is no effective registration statement registering the shares of Common Stock underlying the Warrants. The exercise price of the Warrants is subject to adjustment in the event of certain stock dividends and distributions, stock splits, stock combinations, reclassifications or similar events affecting the Common Stock and also upon any distributions of assets, including cash, stock or other property to the Company’s stockholders. The exercise price of the Warrants is also subject to full ratchet price adjustment if the Company sells or grants any option to purchase, sell or re-price any Common Stock or Common Stock Equivalents (as defined therein) at an exercise price lower than the then-current exercise price of the Warrant with the exception for certain exempted issuances and subject to certain limitations on the reduction of the exercise price as provided in the Warrants. In the event of a fundamental transaction, as described in the Warrants and generally including any reorganization, recapitalization or reclassification of the Common Stock, the sale, transfer or other disposition of all or substantially all of the Company’s properties or assets, the Company’s consolidation or merger with or into another person, the acquisition of more than 50% of the outstanding Common Stock, or any person or group becoming the beneficial owner of 50% of the voting power represented by the outstanding Common Stock, the holders of the Warrants will be entitled to receive upon exercise of the Warrants the kind and amount of securities, cash or other property that the holders would have received had they exercised the Warrants immediately prior to such fundamental transaction; provided that upon the occurrence of certain fundamental transactions, the holder can require the Company to purchase the Warrant for cash at a price equal to the higher of the Black Scholes Value of the unexercised portion of the Warrant or difference between the cash per share paid in the fundamental transaction and the exercise price per share.

OncBioMune Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (OTCQB: OBMP) (OncBioMune or the Company), a revenue-stage biopharmaceutical company engaged in the development of targeted cancer therapies, a proprietary cancer vaccine technology and commercialization of a portfolio of products internationally, is pleased to announce that the protocol for the planned Phase 2 trial of ProscaVax for treatment-nave prostate cancer patients is awaiting approval from the Institutional Review Board (IRB) at the host hospital, a preeminent North-eastern U.S. cancer research network. The protocol was previously submitted to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and received no comments within the 30-day comment period.
The IRB review is the final approval necessary for us to begin the first mid-stage trial of a therapeutic prostate cancer vaccine for newly diagnosed patients that we are aware of, commented Andrew Kucharchuk, President and Chief Financial Officer at OncBioMune. We are approaching a watershed moment for our company and the hundreds of thousands of newly-diagnosed men suffering from the slow progressing disease, We are eager to get the trial underway.
ProscaVax is an immunotherapeutic cancer vaccine consisting of a combination of the tumor-associated antigen PSA (prostate specific antigen) with the biological adjuvants interleukin-2 (IL-2) and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF).
Per the protocol, ProscaVax will be evaluated for safety, tolerability and efficacy as a novel therapy for patients at disease presentation who, in collaboration with their oncologist, chose to forego standard approved therapies, such as a radical prostatectomy, radiation or brachytherapy, in favor of careful monitoring for disease progression, a process known more commonly as active surveillance. Presently, there are no FDA-approved treatments for prostate cancer patients in active surveillance.
As submitted, the Phase 2 clinical protocol will randomly enroll 120 early-stage prostate cancer patients with 40 patients on standard active surveillance and 80 patients receiving ProscaVax. The patients PSAs and yearly biopsies will be monitored for disease progression. The follow-up of the patients will be for two years. The investigators are Dr. Rupal Bhatt, Dr. Glenn Bubley and Dr. David Einstein at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center of Harvard Medical School. Early clinical research of ProscaVax, including a Phase 1 study in PSA progressing prostate cancer in hormone-nave and hormone-independent patients, has shown ProscaVax to be well tolerated with a strong safety profile. Data from late-stage patients further shows signs of efficacy with respect to an increased immune response and slowing tumor progression.
We are very excited to move forward on a trial for patients on Active Surveillance for prostate cancer. Immune therapies have shown promise across many fields in oncology and we hope that ProscaVax can show activity in patients with low risk prostate cancer, said Dr. Rupal Bhatt.(c)  2017 Gulf Sports Media All rights reserved.

BATON ROUGE, LA--(Marketwired - July 20, 2017) - OncBioMune Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (OTCQB: OBMP) ("OncBioMune" or the "Company"), a revenue-stage biopharmaceutical company engaged in the development of targeted cancer therapies, a proprietary cancer vaccine technology and commercialization of a portfolio of products internationally, is pleased to announce the acquisition of the rights to six Aagaard® Propolis products for the Mexican markets from the Company's German partner roha Arzneimittel GmbH ("roha"). OncBioMune has begun the process to market the products across Mexico, with expectations for an official launch during the fourth quarter of 2017.
OncBioMune has acquired from roha the Mexican rights to:
•Aagaard® Propolis Syrup
•Aagaard® Propolis Kids Lozenges
•Aagaard® Propolis Adult Lozenges
•Aagaard® Propolis Capsules
•Aagaard® Propolis Chewable Lozenges
•Aagaard® Propolis Royal Jelly and Vitamin C Capsules
Propolis, sometimes referred to as "bee glue," is a product rich in polyphenols called flavonoids produced by honey bees. Two main immunopotent chemicals in propolis have been identified as caffeic acid phenethyl ester (CAPE) and artepillin C, chemicals known to have a wide array of positive effects related to immunosuppression, macrophage function and more. More broadly, although scientific research is limited, propolis is believed to have antibacterial, antiviral, antifungal, and anti-inflammatory properties. The combination of benefits, along with strong bioavailability and a good historical safety profile, have resulted in propolis serving as the active ingredient in traditional medicines for thousands and years and in over-the-counter medical products sold globally today.
"roha sources only the best propolis from all over the world in creating their Aagaard® line. As a result, it is the number one seller of propolis-based products in Europe," commented Andrew Kucharchuk, President and Chief Financial Officer at OncBioMune. "We believe that we can have the products in from roha's state-of-the-art manufacturing facility and on shelves in Mexico for the flu season, which should provide a nice kick-start to our sales efforts that we estimate should generate approximately $300,000 in gross revenue annually."

OncBioMune Pharmaceuticals has in some cases identified forward-looking statements by using words such as "anticipates," "believes," "hopes," "estimates," "looks," "expects," "plans," "intends," "goal," "potential," "may," "suggest," and similar expressions. Among other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in forward-looking statements are OncBioMune Pharmaceuticals' need for, and the availability of, substantial capital in the future to fund its operations and research and development; the fact that OncBioMune Pharmaceutical's vaccines and therapeutics may not successfully complete pre-clinical or clinical testing, or be granted regulatory approval to be sold and marketed in the United States or elsewhere. A more complete description of these risk factors is included in OncBioMune Pharmaceutical's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. You should not place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements. OncBioMune Pharmaceuticals undertakes no obligation to release publicly the results of any revisions to any such forward-looking statements that may be made to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this press release or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events, except as required by applicable law or regulation.

 OncBioMune Pharmaceuticals Inc. 11441 Industriplex Blvd. Suite 190 Baton Rouge, LA 70809 Corporate Office: 1-225-227-2384 Fax: 1-225-227-2957 corporate@oncbiomune.com http://oncbiomune.com/    OncBioMune Pharmaceuticals is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company engaged in the development of novel cancer immunotherapy products, with a proprietary vaccine technology that is designed to stimulate the immune system to selectively attack cancer cells without harm to the patient. The vaccine technology has been proven safe through use in more than 300 patients without a single serious adverse event. Our lead product, ProscaVax™ for prostate cancer, is near conclusion of a Phase 1 trial funded by the Department of Defense Navy Cancer Vaccine Program. Based upon data showing ProscaVax is non-toxic and can lower PSA levels, we are moving ProscaVax into a Phase 2 trial for prostate cancer patients in the “Active Surveillance” category, an early stage of disease for which there are currently no treatments without significant morbidities. OncBioMune also has a portfolio of targeted therapies, some of which are biosimilars to blockbuster drugs, including paclitaxel (Abraxane).          LEADERSHIP        Dr. Jonathan Head, Ph.D.     CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, CHAIRMAN Dr. Head has been instrumental in the development of our new chemotherapy and immunotherapy programs. Dr. Head and Dr. Elliott are the co-developers and patent holders of one of the first patented autologous breast cancer vaccines in the United States.  His major goal is to implement translational research – the movement of laboratory-developed technologies into the clinical setting.  This is the taking of new therapies from cell culture to an accepted therapy for cancer patients. As a tumor cell biologist, Dr. Head’s specialties include: Cell culture research Animal research Human clinical research Innovative chemotherapies Immunotherapy/cancer vaccines Oncogene and antisense research Tumor markers   Dr. Head is an Adjunct Associate Professor of Biochemistry at Tulane University School of Medicine, an Adjunct Professor of Physical and Biological Sciences at Delta State University and an Adjunct Associate Professor at Louisiana State University School of Veterinary Medicine.   He is an active member of the American Association for Cancer Research and the American Society of Clinical Oncology. Although patients rarely meet Dr. Head, the new treatments we offer are the result of his and Dr. Elliott’s work.              Dr. Robert Elliott, M.D., Ph.D.      CHIEF MEDICAL OFFICER, DIRECTOR Dr. Robert Elliott is the driving force behind our The Elliott-Elliott-Head Breast Cancer Research and Treatment Center.  Colleagues often remark that his energy seems boundless. Indeed, it often is. In 1973, when the Center was founded, Dr. Elliott’s dream was to create the finest center for total breast care. With that step behind us, the dream continues.  Dr. Elliott continues doing research to discover new treatments and drug therapies, and has implemented a team approach to bring total breast care to the patients. Dr. Elliott sees patients from all over Louisiana, the Southeast and across the United States. He collaborates on research projects with other scientists around the world. Dr. Elliott has spoken to medical audiences in the United States and Europe and has authored many papers and abstracts. He has also published a book, Breast Cancer, Anger at the Enemy, which deals with the lack of total breast care available for women. He shares his own frustration and heartaches of caring for dying cancer patients as they struggle for survival, and finally sends a message of hope as he and his research team search for a cure for breast cancer. Trained as a general surgeon, Dr. Elliott feels that breast care should be a specialty of itself, with patients being able to receive the highest quality of care from one physician who reads their mammograms, examines them, performs their surgery and administers their therapies. To advance this concept and to share his experience with other physicians like himself who specialize in breast care, Dr. Elliott founded the American Mastology Association. He currently serves as President of this society. In spite of a busy calendar of meetings and research, Dr. Elliott’s first love is his patients. He devotes the majority of his time to the Center and to helping women overcome breast disease.            Andrew Kucharchuk      CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER, PRESIDENT, DIRECTOR Andrew “Al” Kucharchuk is a graduate of Louisiana State and Tulane Universities Freeman School of Business, where he earned an MBA with a Finance Concentration. He currently serves as the Company’s Chief Financial Officer and oversees the business and administrative processes.  In addition to these duties, Al also directs business development efforts including the expansion of operations to accommodate increased research and clinical development. Al has assisted Dr. Head in the administration of the three contracts that have lead to the clinical studies for the Company’s lead product, ProscaVax™. Mr. Kucharchuk is a member of Kappa Alpha Order fraternity. He lives in Baton Rouge with his wife Jessica and their sons Henry and Davis.             Charles L. Rice, Jr.      DIRECTOR Mr. Rice is the President and Chief Executive Officer of Entergy New Orleans, Inc., an $800 million a year electric and gas utility and subsidiary of NYSE-listed Entergy Corporation.  After his first legal private practice position in Louisiana with Jones, Walker, Waechter, Poitevent, Carrere & Denegre, L.L.P, Rice joined Entergy in the legal department in 2000, serving as senior counsel in the Entergy Services, Inc. litigation group and then as manager of labor relations litigation support in human resources. Rice was recruited into New Orleans city government in 2002 as the city attorney and later took the critical role of chief administrative officer for the City of New Orleans, where he managed 6,000 employees and the city’s $600 million budget. In 2005, the law firm of Barrasso, Usdin, Kupperman, Freeman & Sarver, L.L.C. recruited him back to private practice, where he was named partner. Returning to Entergy in 2009, Rice served as director of utility strategy where he was responsible for coordinating regulatory, legislative, and communications efforts to develop and execute strategies that advanced commercial objectives for the company’s regulated service areas. He then served as director of regulatory affairs for Entergy New Orleans. Rice holds a bachelor’s degree in business administration from Howard University, a juris doctorate from Loyola University’s School of Law and master’s degree in business administration from Tulane University. After graduating from Howard University, he was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the United States Army and served as a military intelligence officer with the 101st Airborne Division (Air Assault) at Fort Campbell, KY. While in the Army, he earned the Airborne Badge, Air Assault badge and was awarded the Army Commendation and the Army Achievement medals. He is a member of the Alabama and Louisiana State Bar Associations, the American Bar Association, the New Orleans Bar Association, and the National Bar Association.             Daniel Hoverman        DIRECTOR Daniel Hoverman is a Director at NYSE-listed Houlihan Lokey, a leading global investment bank, where he is a senior member of the firm’s Corporate Finance Group.

It is tested and laboratory proven and could become the standard of care for prostate cancer treatment. The Company incorporates scientifically proven and clinically validated treatments for cancer. We utilize patented technology developed and or acquired by OncBioMune. The intellectual property consists of multiple technologies combined with laboratory and clinical procedures that provide new insight into the treatment of cancer. The Company’s proprietary technology provides the necessary tools for the successful treatment of patient’s with a therapeutic vaccine. It is marketable and would be very profitable upon FDA approval. The Company has data from a phase 1/2 clinical trial of their therapeutic prostate cancer vaccine. Patients with prostate cancer confirmed by biopsy and with an elevated PSA received the vaccine. We enrolled 12 patients in this study. All patients received their initial course of six vaccinations containing prostate specific antigen and biological adjuvant. Serum PSA concentrations were determined before initiating vaccination and 3-4 weeks after the 6th vaccination. Two-thirds of the prostate cancer patients’  PSAs decreased after vaccination. During the trial  the prostate cancer patients received no other concurrent therapy (surgery, hormone, radiation, radioactive seeds, chemotherapy), and have additionally received three further vaccinations alternated with low dose IL-2 for the 6 months following the initial vaccinations. The Company developed the protocol for the vaccination of prostate cancer patients using techniques developed for vaccination of breast cancer patients.  We are currently in a Phase 1 clinical trial at UCSD Medical School under an IND from the FDA with funding from the US Navy Cancer Vaccine Program. If proven effective clinically,  it could become the standard of care for prostate cancer. Information on the current clinical trial of ProscaVax can be found on the clinictrials.gov at https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02058680?term=oncbiomune&rank=1.    OvcaVax Breast cancers and other epithelial malignancies are antigenic and elicit lymphocyte responses in the autologous host, and patients that express good host immunity to their tumor have better survival. Adequate host immunity is an independent prognostic indicator and those with poor immunity have  shorter disease free intervals and shorter overall survival. The Company’s novel approach defines the tumor specific immune status of patients both pre and post immunotherapy that uses autologous tumor antigens to immunize patients. We have the ability to discriminate patients who are immunologically unreactive to tumor antigens and may be generally lymphocyte depressed from those who are tumor antigen reactive and lymphocyte competent.  Thus those patients who are unreactive and in need of immunostimulation qualify for vaccination with specific tumor antigen .  We developed our vaccine in 1993 and then immediately began vaccinating patients with depressed immunity. We obtained the first patent on a breast cancer vaccine in the U.S.A. in 1994, and were the first to use the cytokines GM-CSF and IL-2 as biological adjuvants. Appropriate patients are vaccinated in the adjuvant setting and patients with advanced disease are treated with a combined chemo-immunotherapy protocol. Some of these patients have had dramatic responses.  The Company is presently devoting much research to the tumor stroma and microenvironment for a better understanding of tumor escape mechanisms. This will allow us the ability to better attack the tumor with specific adaptive immunotherapy. This work is in progress and early results are producing exciting results.

This is the most exciting time in the history of medicine. Millions of people around the world are benefiting from breakthrough treatments that save, extend and improve life.
Research, technology and genomics are coming together to create a platform that allows researchers to decipher the cause of disease as never before. Each advance opens new doors, new cures, new treatments.
And yet, it’s not enough.
"Today's breakthroughs become tomorrow's medicines." Tweet
Cures don’t appear on a schedule. In search of the unknowable, in search of curing the incurable, there is no one map, no singular template, no predictable milestones.
Finding lifesaving medicines is a life’s work – the work of thousands of researchers who never say never. It's also the work of millions of patients who fight side by side with researchers in the battle for life, against whatever odds they face together.
Now is the time to put the accelerator to the floor. The best is yet to come – like groundbreaking advances in immunotherapy and personalized medicine – where the once impossible is now reality.
Welcome to the future of medicine. Where disease is no match for tenacity. No match for ingenuity. Where together, we go boldly.
Dylan Thomas penned "Do not go gentle into that good night" in 1947, but the sentiment is as timely today as it ever was. Millions of Americans are battling serious illnesses, but they’re not alone in the fight. They have the support of thousands of biopharmaceutical researchers whose lives are dedicated to helping patients go boldly into longer, healthier, and more productive lives.

A NEW WAY TO FIGHT CANCER 

















A NEW WAY TO FIGHT CANCER

It used to be science fiction. Harnessing your body’s own immune system to fight cancer. But what was once the fruit of a wild imagination is today a reality.
Rather than killing cancer cells directly with traditional approaches like radiation or chemotherapy, immunotherapy harnesses the immune system’s power to eliminate the cancer or slow its growth and ability to spread. Research shows immunotherapy is improving outcomes and survival rates for some patients, including kidney and lung cancer. In fact, research from the American Association for Cancer Research shows that for advanced-melanoma patients, survival rates are improving thanks in part to these new treatment options.
"It used to be science fiction. Harnessing your body’s own immune system to fight cancer." Tweet
Biopharmaceutical researchers are urgently working to gain new insights into the complex interactions between patients’ immune systems and the cancer cells growing in their bodies with the goal of markedly improving outcomes in more tumor types.
With 836 medicines and vaccines in development for cancer, 80 percent of which have the potential to be first-in-class treatments, millions of Americans living with cancer have hope for a brighter future.
Welcome to the new era of medicine.
For all of us.

HELPING DIABETES PATIENTS THRIVE

















HELPING DIABETES PATIENTS THRIVE

Diabetes is a serious condition that effects more than 30 million Americans. While complications of the disease can be dire, there is hope. Biopharmaceutical researchers are helping patients manage the condition today and envision a bright outlook for future treatments.
Diabetes: the patient perspective
Diabetes is a general term for a chronic condition where there is too much glucose (sugar) in the blood. Normally, the pancreas makes insulin to help convert glucose into energy. With diabetes, the body either does not make enough insulin (type 1 diabetes) or does not use it properly (type 2 diabetes), leading to high blood glucose levels. Uncontrolled diabetes can lead to serious health complications, such as heart attack, lower-limb amputation, vision impairment and blindness.
Endocrinologist Dr. William "Bill" Chin has experience treating endocrine disorders, including diabetes. As chief medical officer at PhRMA, he works to ensure that patient voices are heard, drawing on his dual experience as a physician and as the parent of a child with diabetes. When Dr. Chin's son, Danny, was 15, he began experiencing telltale symptoms like excessive thirst. Dr. Chin diagnosed his son himself with type 1 diabetes.
He says, "I don’t think any parent is ever prepared to learn that one of our kids has developed a disease, particularly one that will be chronic. In many ways it’s forever, but the good news is we have great therapies that actually will allow a patient with diabetes to live a full and completely normal life if it’s well managed."
The changing landscape of diabetes treatment
The medications that Danny relies on have come a long way in the last ten years. A decade ago, a number of insulin options were available to patients, as well as oral and injected medications. Successful management of diabetes required constant and diligent monitoring of glucose levels. To control their glucose, patients needed multiple daily injections and/or multiple oral medicines.
In recent years, researchers have focused on making treatments much easier for patients, from fewer pills to less frequent injections. Careful monitoring and treatment are still needed, but current medicines in development offer a promising future.
There are 171 medicines currently in development for type 1 and type 2 diabetes and diabetes-related conditions. A new wave of treatments is offering patients better or more sustained control over their glucose levels. Other medicines in the pipeline may address diabetes-related complications that affect the kidneys, blood vessels and eyes. All of the medicines are in clinical trials or awaiting review by the FDA.
While these advances have improved patient quality of life and increased lifespans for type 1 diabetes, ongoing research remains critical. In fact, diabetes was the seventh leading cause of death in the United States in 2013.
Dr. Chin says, "Collaboration is incredibly important in the understanding and development of new treatments for diabetes ... we are continually seeking to advance our understanding of the disease. This can only be achieved by having academic scientists and physician scientists working closely with scientists in the biopharmaceutical industry."

But we must not take this progress for granted.  To ensure medical innovation continues for the benefit of patients we need public policies that reward the investment and time it takes to develop life-saving treatments and cures.
In order to enhance competition and improve affordability for patients, our country must:
1)    Make medicines more affordable by rewarding value
 Today, America’s Biopharmaceutical Companies are partnering with health insurers to improve how we pay for medicines. Prices for medicines may vary based on how well an individual responds to treatment, or agreements may lower co-pays if patients achieve better health outcomes. While these partnerships will vary, they are helping to ensure we get the right medicine to the right patient at the right time – improving care and lowering costs across the health care system.
Yet, outdated regulations prevent wider use of these new payment arrangements.  Government rules and regulations should not prevent the private sector from developing better ways to pay for medicines. Rather, we must ensure health plans can cover more of the newest medicines and give patients more choices – improving care and lowering health care costs for Americans.
2)    Ensure patients get the best deal on medicines
America’s Biopharmaceutical Companies often negotiate large rebates for prescription medicines with insurers and pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs). Those rebates are growing every year and now exceed $100 billion per year – helping to hold down health care costs for patients and taxpayers.
But we can do more to ensure patients benefit directly from these negotiated savings, and put an end to an unfair practice that requires patients to buy medicines at full price, even when their insurers get a rebate. In fact, patients with large deductibles can end up paying more than their insurer pays for their medicine.  That’s wrong. Health insurance companies should share with patients the discounts they receive. This could lower out-of-pocket costs for some patients by hundreds – if not thousands – of dollars every year.
3)    Make new breakthroughs accessible, and promote competition
We need to make it make it easier for patients to get access to breakthrough medicines. It simply takes too long to get new medicines approved – over 10 years and over one billion dollars, on average.  Outdated regulations and approaches for evaluating drugs can slow things down even more. To get medicines approved faster, while ensuring safety, we need to modernize the FDA with new technologies and expertise to keep up with 21st century science. Modernizing the FDA will bring down the time and cost of developing new medicines, which will bring medicines to patients faster, and enhance competition in the market.
We also need to reduce the backlog of applications for generic medicines at the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).  This will ensure that patients benefit as less expensive generic medicines replace higher cost treatments that have lost patent protection. 
At the same time, we must avoid policies that deter risk-taking or siphon funding away from the research and development of new medicines for patients. Learn more about our plan to build a sustainable, science-based health care system that harnesses today’s hopes to discover tomorrow’s cures here.

9 Ways We Assure the High Quality of Our Nutraceuticals & Nutritional Supplements9 Ways We Assure the High Quality of Our Nutraceuticals & Nutritional Supplements














9 Ways We Assure the High Quality of  Our Nutraceuticals & Nutritional Supplements
I'm sure you've heard of vitamins, herbs, and other nutritional products that flunked lab tests. Here at Advanced Bionutritionals, we strive to make sure that does not happen.
In fact, our manufacturing process assures purity, potency and quality 9 different ways:

"You Get An A+"
"Thank you. I did receive the credit back on my credit card. You often promote your "money back guarantee" with your literature. Well, you certainly deliver on your promise!!!.
I judge a company on Quality, Price and Service (you pass on all three) but the ultimate test comes when you have a "problem". Your company scored an "A+"!!!!!! You have earned my business forever. Thank you for your outstanding service and problem resolution!"
Patrick M., Colorado



We use suppliers and growers that we've known for years. 


We use ingredients that are shown to be effective in scientific studies.


We use no artificial colors, artificial binders, artificial fillers, or artificial preservatives, and non-GMO sources whenever available. 


Every supplier is qualified by testing multiple lots of material. The material is assayed for purity and screened for pathogens like mold, yeast, staph, and salmonella.


The batches of our ingredients are tested using FTIR spectrometers and compared to a purity index.


Our products are manufactured in a facility that is GMP (Good Manufacturing Practices) certified.


Batches of our product undergo rigorous disintegration tests in conformance with USP guidelines to ensure proper breakdown in the stomach and absorption in the intestines.


Our manufacturing process has multiple checks in place, and our batches are signed off by a quality control officer to ensure accuracy, purity, and potency.


Our bottles are safety sealed for lasting freshness and potency. And each bottle is marked with a manufactured date and/or an expiration date.





For you, that means the best quality possible. In fact, we promise it. If you are ever dissatisfied with one of our products for any reason whatsoever, simply return the unused portion within 90 days of purchase. We will refund every penny you paid, including shipping and handling. You only pay return shipping.

Welcome to OncBioMune Pharmaceuticals Inc.
We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company engaged in the development of novel cancer immunotherapy products, with a proprietary vaccine technology that is designed to stimulate the immune system to selectively attack cancer cells without harm to the patient.  The vaccine technology has been proven safe through use in more than 300 patients without a single serious adverse event.  Our lead product, ProscaVax™ for prostate cancer, is near conclusion of a Phase 1 trial funded by the Department of Defense Navy Cancer Vaccine Program.  Based upon data showing ProscaVax is non-toxic and can lower PSA levels, we are moving ProscaVax into a Phase 2 trial for prostate cancer patients in the “Active Surveillance” category, an early stage of disease for which there are currently no treatments without significant morbidities. OncBioMune also has a portfolio of targeted therapies, some of which are biosimilars to blockbuster drugs, including paclitaxel (Abraxane).
