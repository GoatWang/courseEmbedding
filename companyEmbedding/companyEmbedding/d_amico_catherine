Wonderful person who loves to help others.Was this rating useful? 0 flag | Submitted June 6, 2016 5Staff 5Punctuality 5Helpfulness 5KnowledgeI have had the great fortune to have Dr. D'Amico as my family doctor for many years. I have never been disappointed in the thoughtful care she has given me. She is knowledgeable and keeps up to date on all aspects of her practice. Not only has she cared for me, but she has taken care of my two daughters and now my grandchildren are fortunate enough to be in her care also. Cathy, her receptionist, does a wonderful job of scheduling appointments and running the office efficiently. It's a great place!
Was this rating useful? 0 flag | Submitted April 4, 2016 5Staff 5Punctuality 5Helpfulness 5KnowledgeDr.D'Amico is by far the best family doctor in Ottawa. Why : you rarely have to wait 5 minutes for your appointment but be punctual, don't make her wait : She always knows the most current information on whatever you are asking about : her energy is amazing and I never leave her office feeling like my questions weren't answered : she's always smiling : Cathy her secretary is amazing as well : she goes above and beyond the call of duty, I couldn't believe it when she said that she has to do house calls at times, it was 50 years since a doctor has come to my house : you feel like you are her only patient, never rushed out the door : she always gives you an honest answer : all in all she is the best, kindest, knowledgeable, thoughtful, compassionate human being.
