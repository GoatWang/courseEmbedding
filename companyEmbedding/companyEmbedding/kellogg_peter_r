IAT Reinsurance Company Ltd. Announces Nominationof 
      Directors to MFC Board






November 25, 2013 10:00 AM Eastern Standard Time



NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Mr. Peter R. Kellogg and IAT Reinsurance Company Ltd. (collectively, “IAT”) 
      announced today that they have submitted a notice of intention to 
      nominate directors at the next meeting of shareholders of MFC Industrial 
      Ltd. (“MFC”) which is currently scheduled for December 27, 2013 
      (the “MFC Shareholder Meeting”).
    


      As set out in the notice and the enclosed materials submitted to MFC 
      (collectively, the “Notice”), which were submitted today pursuant 
      to the Advance Notice Policy adopted by the board of directors of MFC on 
      November 18, 2013, at the MFC Shareholder Meeting, Mr. Kellogg and IAT 
      intend to put forward an ordinary resolution to expand the size of MFC’s 
      board of directors by fixing the number of directors of MFC at eleven and 
      to nominate eight new directors.
    

      “We are not shareholder activists. In fact, this is the first time in my 
      life that I have ever set the wheels in motion to be an active 
      participant in a proxy contest,” said Peter Kellogg. “It is also the 
      first time that I have felt that the circumstances warranted it,” 
      continued Mr. Kellogg.
    

      Over the 14 years that IAT has held its investment in MFC, it has been a 
      patient and supportive partner with MFC. IAT’s previous requests for 
      board representation were rebuffed by MFC in no uncertain terms. As a 
      shareholder, IAT advocates and encourages long-term stewardship of 
      companies through the proper working of a relevant and independent board 
      of directors whose fiduciary responsibility - to oversee and guide 
      management and its operational plans and to act in the interests of all 
      of the shareholders - is upheld and honored.
    

      “Shareholders need to have confidence in a company’s board and its 
      strategic direction; we have lost that confidence in the current board 
      of MFC,” commented Tony Kerbs, Managing Director of IAT. “We are 
      appealing to shareholders of MFC for their assistance to support our 
      nominees and facilitate long overdue change at MFC,” continued Mr. Kerbs.
    

      IAT’s nominees consist of Mr. Kellogg, who is the Chief Executive 
      Officer of IAT, as well as Mr. J. Andrew Betts, Mr. David L. Grange, Mr. 
      Jeffrey A. Harris, Mr. William C. Horn III, Mr. Logan W. Kruger, Ms. 
      Patrice E. Merrin and Mr. Trevor S. Schultz (collectively, the “Proposed 
      Nominees”), all of whom are highly experienced and qualified 
      business leaders from a broad range of backgrounds and sectors. The 
      biographies of the Proposed Nominees are set out below.
    

      Mr. Kellogg also requested that MFC hold the MFC Shareholder Meeting in 
      Vancouver or Toronto, Canada rather than Hong Kong, in order to best 
      accommodate the vast majority of MFC’s shareholders who reside in North 
      America. Holding the MFC Shareholder Meeting in Hong Kong would make it 
      very costly and difficult for most shareholders to attend, as those in 
      Canada or the U.S. would need to depart on Christmas Day to make it in 
      time for the MFC Shareholder Meeting. Since this vote will shape the 
      future of the board and thus the future of MFC, Mr. Kellogg calls upon 
      MFC to have an open and fair shareholder vote that is inclusive of all 
      shareholders.
    

      Mr. Kellogg and IAT have filed on the System for Electronic Document 
      Analysis and Retrieval (“SEDAR”) at www.sedar.com 
      and on the Electronic Data-Gathering, Analysis and Retrieval system (“EDGAR”) 
      at www.sec.gov 
      a document containing certain of the information required by Form 
      51-102F5 – Information Circular in respect of, among other 
      things, the Proposed Nominees in connection with their proxy 
      solicitation made by public broadcast (the “Public Broadcast 
      Exemption Document”) relating to the MFC Shareholder Meeting. Mr. 
      Kellogg and IAT also intend to issue and file a proxy circular (the “IAT 
      Circular”) in due course in connection with the foregoing and other 
      matters to be considered at the MFC Shareholder Meeting. Shareholders of 
      MFC are urged to read the Public Broadcast Exemption Document, and to 
      also read the IAT Circular carefully once it is available, because they 
      do and will contain important information. Investors and shareholders of 
      MFC will be able to obtain free copies of the Public Broadcast Exemption 
      Document and the IAT Circular and any amendments or supplements thereto 
      (once available) at no charge on SEDAR and on EDGAR. In addition, 
      shareholders of MFC will also be able to obtain free copies of the 
      Public Broadcast Exemption Document and the IAT Circular and other 
      relevant documents (once available) by calling IAT’s proxy solicitor,

His fortune is primarily from his successful leadership of Spear, Leeds & Kellogg in the 1980s through to its sale in 2000 to Goldman Sachs for a reported $6.5 billion.[2] Kellogg attended Babson College, but later dropped out.
Kellogg spends his summers in Mantoloking, New Jersey.

AMEX[edit]
Spear, Leeds was fined $1 million in 2002 by the AMEX and ordered to conduct a review of the supervision of its clearance and specialist operations on the AMEX floor.[5] This came in the wake of a violation of AMEX trading rules in the mid-1990s by a Spear Leeds employee who the AMEX found was not properly supervised by the firm. The employee, who was fined $100,000 and barred from the industry,[6] was reported in the news media[7] to have testified that his actions were known to senior Spear Leeds officials, including Kellogg.
Taxes[edit]
Kellogg is the controlling shareholder of IAT Reinsurance Co. which has received media attention in the past for its former use of a U.S. law exempting small insurance companies from paying federal tax. Congress exempted insurance companies from taxes if they collected less than $350,000 in annual premiums; IAT qualified for this exemption at one time.[8]

AMEX[edit]
Spear, Leeds was fined $1 million in 2002 by the AMEX and ordered to conduct a review of the supervision of its clearance and specialist operations on the AMEX floor.[5] This came in the wake of a violation of AMEX trading rules in the mid-1990s by a Spear Leeds employee who the AMEX found was not properly supervised by the firm.

Kellogg is the controlling shareholder of IAT Reinsurance Co. which has received media attention in the past for its former use of a U.S. law exempting small insurance companies from paying federal tax. Congress exempted insurance companies from taxes if they collected less than $350,000 in annual premiums; IAT qualified for this exemption at one time.[8]

Personal[edit]
Peter attended Babson College in Wellesley, MA and the Berkshire School in Sheffield, MA. He is the son of James Crane Kellogg, III of Wall Street specialist firm Spear, Leeds & Kellogg; he joined his father's firm in 1967 after working at Dominick & Dominick. His fortune is primarily from his successful leadership of Spear, Leeds & Kellogg in the 1980s through to its sale in 2000 to Goldman Sachs for a reported $6.5 billion.[2] Kellogg attended Babson College, but later dropped out.
Kellogg spends his summers in Mantoloking, New Jersey.
NYSE[edit]
The NASD had publicly announced on November 3, 2003 that it “filed a disciplinary action against Peter Kellogg alleging that he directed fraudulent wash trades and matched trades between four accounts he controlled”. Wash sales are trades of securities without a real change in ownership of the securities traded. Matched orders are orders to buy or sell securities that are entered with knowledge that a matching order on the opposite side has been or will be entered.[3]
The NASD subsequently announced on August 6, 2004 that an NASD panel convened to hear the case dismissed this complaint against Kellogg alleging that he engaged in fraudulent wash and matched trades during August 2001. The public notice stated that "The Hearing Panel found that there was no evidence that Kellogg carried out the four transactions at issue with the intention to defraud, manipulate or deceive. Rather, the panel found that Kellogg conducted the transactions for legitimate business and tax purposes.”[4]
AMEX[edit]
Spear, Leeds was fined $1 million in 2002 by the AMEX and ordered to conduct a review of the supervision of its clearance and specialist operations on the AMEX floor.[5] This came in the wake of a violation of AMEX trading rules in the mid-1990s by a Spear Leeds employee who the AMEX found was not properly supervised by the firm. The employee, who was fined $100,000 and barred from the industry,[6] was reported in the news media[7] to have testified that his actions were known to senior Spear Leeds officials, including Kellogg.
Taxes[edit]
Kellogg is the controlling shareholder of IAT Reinsurance Co. which has received media attention in the past for its former use of a U.S. law exempting small insurance companies from paying federal tax. Congress exempted insurance companies from taxes if they collected less than $350,000 in annual premiums; IAT qualified for this exemption at one time.[8]
