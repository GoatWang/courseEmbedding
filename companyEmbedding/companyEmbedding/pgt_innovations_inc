Invest in what’s next.

	At PGT Innovations, we create long-term value through committing to companies that share our standards of integrity, innovation and growth. Our competitive advantage lies in our collective commitment to continuously researching, reimagining, developing and manufacturing the best products possible. We are proud to have the following companies in the PGT Innovations family.

	CGI

	Formed in 1992 to offer highly engineered products for custom applications, CGI Windows & Doors is now a premier manufacturer of hurricane impact resistant windows and doors. Produced to the most exacting industry standards, their high performance, high aesthetic product collections offer advanced hurricane protection of home and commercial structures, in both new and existing construction. In addition to using impact-resistant laminated glass and the finest hardware, their aluminum and vinyl windows and doors exude strength and beauty—a function of their workmanship, pride and engineering excellence.

	PGT Industries

	Founded in 1980, PGT Industries is the nation’s leading manufacturer and supplier of residential impact-resistant windows and doors. After the devastation of Hurricane Andrew in 1992, the company partnered with building officials in Miami-Dade and helped develop construction code requirements which are still among the most stringent in the nation.

	 PGT Industries employs approximately 2,200 team members as of September 2, 2014 at its manufacturing, glass plant and delivery fleet facilities in Venice, Florida, and sells through a network of independent distributors. The company’s total line of custom windows and doors are now sold throughout the eastern U.S. and a growing international market, including the Caribbean, South America and Australia.

	WinDoor

	WinDoor’s craftsmanship, attention to detail and ultra-high-performance ratings have made them the product of choice for five-star resorts, luxury high-rise condominiums and celebrity mansions along the U.S. coastline for over 15 years. Manufacturing from their 320,000 square foot facility in Orlando, Florida, their aluminum, vinyl and thermally-broken I-strut aluminum products are AAMA, ASTM and Miami-Dade, Florida approvals & TDI approved products are always available in expansive sizes, custom colors and custom configurations.

	cut sizes and some stocked items with a + - 5% glass quantity tolerance.




	 




	 


	e.


	Supplier will keep an agreed reserve supply of Products to reduce lead times, which shall be stored at Suppliers Mooresville plant and be reviewed periodically by the parties. In the event of any termination of
	this Agreement, PGT shall purchase all of such agreed reserve supply of Products at the prices for the Products set forth on Schedule B.




	 




	 


	f.


	For planning purposes, a purchase forecast will be provided by PGT to Supplier concerning one or more of the Products, in such detail as may be reasonably requested by Supplier, in which PGT will estimate its annual

	g.


	From time to time, PGT and Supplier may negotiate and agree upon the terms of special orders. Such special orders may be on terms and conditions, including pricing, different than the terms and conditions

	third party carrier shall be F.O.B. either the Nokomis Plant or the Miami Plant, as the relevant delivery instructions may specify. As applicable, Supplier will arrange for and pay the third carrier, but will then invoice PGT for the cost of
	freight. PGT will pay the cost of freight shipped via third party carrier in addition to the price of the Products. Risk of loss will pass at the F.O.B. point. Certain other applicable terms respecting freight are set forth in Schedule B.

	Certification and Quality Assurance

	Assurance evaluations. Upon PGTs request, Supplier shall provide PGT with Suppliers Quality Assurance Manual, if any. Periodic Supplier performance evaluations may be performed, the purpose of which will be to assess Suppliers
	quality as it relates to, among other things, on-time deliveries, packaging, service/warranty, and non-conforming materials as reported through PGTs Defective Material Reporting Process. Nothing in this Section 7 is an agreement by
	Supplier to change the terms and conditions of sale, including pricing.




	 




	 


	8.





	Modifications

	. Supplier will notify PGT if Supplier intends to implement a modification of the Specifications of the Products or the manufacturing processes for Products which would change such Specifications
	(collectively, Modifications). With respect to Products covered by accepted Purchaser Orders, Supplier shall implement no Modifications without PGTs prior written consent. Consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. If PGT does not
	respond to Suppliers notification within sixty (60) days of Suppliers notice of its intention to implement a Modification, Supplier may reject future orders for the materials affected by such Modification. If such Modification is
	not accepted by PGT, Supplier may elect not to implement such Modification or PGT may elect to terminate the agreement for that portion affected by such Modification.

	regulation, ordinance, demand or requirement of any governmental agency; or any other condition or occurrence whatsoever beyond the control of such party, but only to the extent performance hereunder is prevented by any such condition. If the
	performance of this Agreement is prevented by reason of any such event, (a) the party whose performance is prevented, shall give prompt written notice to the other party of the event and shall be excused from performance, but only to the extent
