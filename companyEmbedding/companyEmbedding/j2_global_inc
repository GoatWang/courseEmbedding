History[edit]
j2 Global was founded in December 1995 as JFax by Jaye Muller and Jack Rieley.[3] The company changed its registered name to j2 Global Communications, Inc. on August 2000,[4] and again to j2 Global on December 7, 2011, dropping "Communications" from its official name to reflect "...expansion from phone number-centric services ... into complementary lines of non-phone number-centric services."[5]
On November 12, 2012, j2 Global launched its digital media division with the acquisition of digital publisher Ziff Davis Inc. for $167 million in cash.[6] On February 4, 2013, j2 Global announced that it had more than doubled the size of its digital media division's business with the acquisition of IGN Entertainment from News Corp.[7] Terms of the IGN acquisition were not publicized.
On March 18, 2013, the company announced it had acquired MetroFax, a Bellevue, Washington provider of Internet faxing services.[8] On April 17, 2013, the company acquired Backup Connect BV, a Dutch provider of online backup services.[9] On 19 November 2013, its media division Ziff Davis announced it acquired electronics aggregating website TechBargain.com.
In February, j2 Global announced the acquisition of several companies: City Numbers, a UK-based worldwide provider of inbound toll-free numbers in over 80 countries;[10] LiveDrive, a UK-based provider of online backup;[11] and Australian companies OzeFax and Faxmate.[12] On 3 April[13] 2014 j2 Global announced that it acquired Business Critical Software (also known as iCritical), a UK-based email security and management company.[14]
As of 2014, j2 Global has a network that covers 49 countries on six continents. As of December 31, 2013, j2 Global reported 18 consecutive fiscal years of revenue growth.[15]
Brands and subsidiaries[edit]
j2 Global, Inc. provides Internet services through its two divisions: Business Cloud Services and Digital Media. Business Cloud Services brands include eFax, Onebox, eVoice, Fusemail, Campaigner, KeepITsafe, VaultLogix, Callstream, Yotta280, Mailout Interactive, GDV, BackUp Solutions, SugarSync, Nuvotera, UnityFax, Firstway Digital, Excel Micro, Web24 Group, MXSweep, City Numbers, LiveDrive, MetroFax, TrustFax, RapidFax, Send2Fax and Fax.com. The Digital Media division delivers various content through its digital properties, including Ziff Davis (Including PC Magazine, ComputerShopper, ExtremeTech, Toolbox.com and Geek.com) IGN Entertainment (including AskMen, 1UP.com and UGO.com), Offers.com, and NetShelter (including AndroidCentral.com, MacRumors.com, Neoseeker.com, SlashGear.com and TechSpot.com).[16]
MyFax[edit]
MyFax is an Internet business communication tool which had been provided by the Ottawa-based software company Protus IP Solutions.[17] The company was acquired by j2 Global in December 2010.
Internet faxing is a service that permits the sending and receiving of faxes using the Internet rather than the traditional public switched telephone network (PSTN), also known as the plain old telephone service (POTS) or a traditional fax machine. Faxing online eliminates problems with traditional faxing, including connection issues, busy signals and loss of data. Internet faxes can be delivered to multiple email addresses and forwarded to multiple recipients rather than to one machine at a time.[18]
History[edit]
MyFax was launched by Protus IP Solutions in 2009 as an alternative to fax machines, as it enables users to send and receive faxes from any location.[19] MyFax has grown to over 400,000 subscribers,[20] with approximately 20,000 new customers subscribing to the service each month.[21]
On December 6, 2010, MyFax announced that it had been acquired by j2 Global Communications, Inc, owners of eFax.[22]
Features[edit]
Some of the features of MyFax include the ability to send and receive faxes by email and through the internet, as well as send faxes directly from Microsoft Office, Microsoft Outlook, and Microsoft Windows-based applications including Google Docs, OpenOffice.org, and Intuit QuickBooks.[23] Recently, a program has been released that allows for iPhone and BlackBerry applications to make it fully compatible with smartphones.[24]
In 2009, TMCnet claimed that “MyFax is the fastest-growing Internet fax service used by individuals, small, medium and large businesses to send and receive faxes using existing email accounts or the web. MyFax offers services to industries in North America and Europe that are recognized as some of the fastest-growing adopters of Internet fax including healthcare, finance, insurance, real estate, transportation and government.”[25]
MyFax is now owned by j2 Global, which has imposed very restrictive terms and conditions restricting the client's right to local number portability. Among the restrictions is a $40 US charge per number if j2 permits the number to be ported out; the company imposes many arbitrary restrictions on portability and has attempted to claim the numbers as its own property, in some cases imposing inflated penalties and unilaterally taking numbers back after they've been ported to another provider by clients.[26]
Reviews[edit]
Before its acquisition by j2 Global, MyFax had received a few favourable reviews[27] including an Internet Telephony magazine product of the year for 2009.[28]
While the impact of the j2 Global acquisition is unknown, other companies acquired by j2 have been the target of frequent consumer complaints regarding sales tactics,[29] inflated fees to cancel the service[30] and toll-free number portability issues.[31][32]
Awards[edit]
In September 2012, j2 Global was recognized on the InformationWeek 500 list of technology companies.[33]
In 2013, j2 Global was ranked number 40 in Forbes' list of "America's Best Small Companies".[34]
Criticism[edit]





The neutrality of this section is disputed. Relevant discussion may be found on the talk page. Please do not remove this message until conditions to do so are met. (November 2014) (Learn how and when to remove this template message)


Some j2 Global companies have been the target of complaints ranging from number portability to issues with its contract providing no refunds on early termination.[citation needed]
It has targeted various competing providers with patent litigation, including CallWave,[35] Comodo, EasyLink Services International Corporation,[36] Open Text, Packetel, Protus, Venali and Vitelity.[citation needed] Many of these companies have filed counter-claims, some of which allege antitrust violations of Section 2 of the Sherman Act and California’s Business and Professions Code §§ 16720 and 17200.[37] j2 Global has also received complaints for making it difficult for subscribers to leave the service through high cancellation fees and lack of toll-free number portability in certain cases.[38][citation needed] Clients of companies acquired by j2 Global (such as eFax and Onebox) have complained that toll-free number portability, which was provided before the companies were acquired, has been removed, and that j2 Global (or its newly acquired subsidiaries) claim that it owns the telephone numbers associated with the service.[citation needed]

MyFax was launched by Protus IP Solutions in 2009 as an alternative to fax machines, as it enables users to send and receive faxes from any location.[19] MyFax has grown to over 400,000 subscribers,[20] with approximately 20,000 new customers subscribing to the service each month.[21]
On December 6, 2010, MyFax announced that it had been acquired by j2 Global Communications, Inc, owners of eFax.[22]

While the impact of the j2 Global acquisition is unknown, other companies acquired by j2 have been the target of frequent consumer complaints regarding sales tactics,[29] inflated fees to cancel the service[30] and toll-free number portability issues.[31][32]
Awards[edit]
In September 2012, j2 Global was recognized on the InformationWeek 500 list of technology companies.[33]
In 2013, j2 Global was ranked number 40 in Forbes' list of "America's Best Small Companies".[34]

Some j2 Global companies have been the target of complaints ranging from number portability to issues with its contract providing no refunds on early termination.[citation needed]
It has targeted various competing providers with patent litigation, including CallWave,[35] Comodo, EasyLink Services International Corporation,[36] Open Text, Packetel, Protus, Venali and Vitelity.[citation needed] Many of these companies have filed counter-claims, some of which allege antitrust violations of Section 2 of the Sherman Act and California’s Business and Professions Code §§ 16720 and 17200.[37] j2 Global has also received complaints for making it difficult for subscribers to leave the service through high cancellation fees and lack of toll-free number portability in certain cases.[38][citation needed] Clients of companies acquired by j2 Global (such as eFax and Onebox) have complained that toll-free number portability, which was provided before the companies were acquired, has been removed, and that j2 Global (or its newly acquired subsidiaries) claim that it owns the telephone numbers associated with the service.[citation needed]

History[edit]
j2 Global was founded in December 1995 as JFax by Jaye Muller and Jack Rieley.[3] The company changed its registered name to j2 Global Communications, Inc. on August 2000,[4] and again to j2 Global on December 7, 2011, dropping "Communications" from its official name to reflect "...expansion from phone number-centric services ... into complementary lines of non-phone number-centric services."[5]
On November 12, 2012, j2 Global launched its digital media division with the acquisition of digital publisher Ziff Davis Inc. for $167 million in cash.[6] On February 4, 2013, j2 Global announced that it had more than doubled the size of its digital media division's business with the acquisition of IGN Entertainment from News Corp.[7] Terms of the IGN acquisition were not publicized.
On March 18, 2013, the company announced it had acquired MetroFax, a Bellevue, Washington provider of Internet faxing services.[8] On April 17, 2013, the company acquired Backup Connect BV, a Dutch provider of online backup services.[9] On 19 November 2013, its media division Ziff Davis announced it acquired electronics aggregating website TechBargain.com.
In February, j2 Global announced the acquisition of several companies: City Numbers, a UK-based worldwide provider of inbound toll-free numbers in over 80 countries;[10] LiveDrive, a UK-based provider of online backup;[11] and Australian companies OzeFax and Faxmate.[12] On 3 April[13] 2014 j2 Global announced that it acquired Business Critical Software (also known as iCritical), a UK-based email security and management company.[14]
As of 2014, j2 Global has a network that covers 49 countries on six continents. As of December 31, 2013, j2 Global reported 18 consecutive fiscal years of revenue growth.[15]
Brands and subsidiaries[edit]
j2 Global, Inc. provides Internet services through its two divisions: Business Cloud Services and Digital Media. Business Cloud Services brands include eFax, Onebox, eVoice, Fusemail, Campaigner, KeepITsafe, VaultLogix, Callstream, Yotta280, Mailout Interactive, GDV, BackUp Solutions, SugarSync, Nuvotera, UnityFax, Firstway Digital, Excel Micro, Web24 Group, MXSweep, City Numbers, LiveDrive, MetroFax, TrustFax, RapidFax, Send2Fax and Fax.com. The Digital Media division delivers various content through its digital properties, including Ziff Davis (Including PC Magazine, ComputerShopper, ExtremeTech, Toolbox.com and Geek.com) IGN Entertainment (including AskMen, 1UP.com and UGO.com), Offers.com, and NetShelter (including AndroidCentral.com, MacRumors.com, Neoseeker.com, SlashGear.com and TechSpot.com).[16]
MyFax[edit]
MyFax is an Internet business communication tool which had been provided by the Ottawa-based software company Protus IP Solutions.[17] The company was acquired by j2 Global in December 2010.
Internet faxing is a service that permits the sending and receiving of faxes using the Internet rather than the traditional public switched telephone network (PSTN), also known as the plain old telephone service (POTS) or a traditional fax machine. Faxing online eliminates problems with traditional faxing, including connection issues, busy signals and loss of data. Internet faxes can be delivered to multiple email addresses and forwarded to multiple recipients rather than to one machine at a time.[18]
History[edit]
MyFax was launched by Protus IP Solutions in 2009 as an alternative to fax machines, as it enables users to send and receive faxes from any location.[19] MyFax has grown to over 400,000 subscribers,[20] with approximately 20,000 new customers subscribing to the service each month.[21]
On December 6, 2010, MyFax announced that it had been acquired by j2 Global Communications, Inc, owners of eFax.[22]
Features[edit]
Some of the features of MyFax include the ability to send and receive faxes by email and through the internet, as well as send faxes directly from Microsoft Office, Microsoft Outlook, and Microsoft Windows-based applications including Google Docs, OpenOffice.org, and Intuit QuickBooks.[23] Recently, a program has been released that allows for iPhone and BlackBerry applications to make it fully compatible with smartphones.[24]
In 2009, TMCnet claimed that “MyFax is the fastest-growing Internet fax service used by individuals, small, medium and large businesses to send and receive faxes using existing email accounts or the web. MyFax offers services to industries in North America and Europe that are recognized as some of the fastest-growing adopters of Internet fax including healthcare, finance, insurance, real estate, transportation and government.”[25]
MyFax is now owned by j2 Global, which has imposed very restrictive terms and conditions restricting the client's right to local number portability. Among the restrictions is a $40 US charge per number if j2 permits the number to be ported out; the company imposes many arbitrary restrictions on portability and has attempted to claim the numbers as its own property, in some cases imposing inflated penalties and unilaterally taking numbers back after they've been ported to another provider by clients.[26]
Reviews[edit]
Before its acquisition by j2 Global, MyFax had received a few favourable reviews[27] including an Internet Telephony magazine product of the year for 2009.[28]
While the impact of the j2 Global acquisition is unknown, other companies acquired by j2 have been the target of frequent consumer complaints regarding sales tactics,[29] inflated fees to cancel the service[30] and toll-free number portability issues.[31][32]
Awards[edit]
In September 2012, j2 Global was recognized on the InformationWeek 500 list of technology companies.[33]
In 2013, j2 Global was ranked number 40 in Forbes' list of "America's Best Small Companies".[34]
Criticism[edit]

Some j2 Global companies have been the target of complaints ranging from number portability to issues with its contract providing no refunds on early termination.[citation needed]
It has targeted various competing providers with patent litigation, including CallWave,[35] Comodo, EasyLink Services International Corporation,[36] Open Text, Packetel, Protus, Venali and Vitelity.[citation needed] Many of these companies have filed counter-claims, some of which allege antitrust violations of Section 2 of the Sherman Act and California’s Business and Professions Code §§ 16720 and 17200.[37] j2 Global has also received complaints for making it difficult for subscribers to leave the service through high cancellation fees and lack of toll-free number portability in certain cases.[38][citation needed] Clients of companies acquired by j2 Global (such as eFax and Onebox) have complained that toll-free number portability, which was provided before the companies were acquired, has been removed, and that j2 Global (or its newly acquired subsidiaries) claim that it owns the telephone numbers associated with the service.[citation needed]

History[edit]
j2 Global was founded in December 1995 as JFax by Jaye Muller and Jack Rieley.[3] The company changed its registered name to j2 Global Communications, Inc. on August 2000,[4] and again to j2 Global on December 7, 2011, dropping "Communications" from its official name to reflect "...expansion from phone number-centric services ... into complementary lines of non-phone number-centric services."[5]
On November 12, 2012, j2 Global launched its digital media division with the acquisition of digital publisher Ziff Davis Inc. for $167 million in cash.[6] On February 4, 2013, j2 Global announced that it had more than doubled the size of its digital media division's business with the acquisition of IGN Entertainment from News Corp.[7] Terms of the IGN acquisition were not publicized.
On March 18, 2013, the company announced it had acquired MetroFax, a Bellevue, Washington provider of Internet faxing services.[8] On April 17, 2013, the company acquired Backup Connect BV, a Dutch provider of online backup services.[9] On 19 November 2013, its media division Ziff Davis announced it acquired electronics aggregating website TechBargain.com.
In February, j2 Global announced the acquisition of several companies: City Numbers, a UK-based worldwide provider of inbound toll-free numbers in over 80 countries;[10] LiveDrive, a UK-based provider of online backup;[11] and Australian companies OzeFax and Faxmate.[12] On 3 April[13] 2014 j2 Global announced that it acquired Business Critical Software (also known as iCritical), a UK-based email security and management company.[14]
As of 2014, j2 Global has a network that covers 49 countries on six continents. As of December 31, 2013, j2 Global reported 18 consecutive fiscal years of revenue growth.[15]
Brands and subsidiaries[edit]
j2 Global, Inc. provides Internet services through its two divisions: Business Cloud Services and Digital Media. Business Cloud Services brands include eFax, Onebox, eVoice, Fusemail, Campaigner, KeepITsafe, VaultLogix, Callstream, Yotta280, Mailout Interactive, GDV, BackUp Solutions, SugarSync, Nuvotera, UnityFax, Firstway Digital, Excel Micro, Web24 Group, MXSweep, City Numbers, LiveDrive, MetroFax, TrustFax, RapidFax, Send2Fax and Fax.com. The Digital Media division delivers various content through its digital properties, including Ziff Davis (Including PC Magazine, ComputerShopper, ExtremeTech, Toolbox.com and Geek.com) IGN Entertainment (including AskMen, 1UP.com and UGO.com), Offers.com, and NetShelter (including AndroidCentral.com, MacRumors.com, Neoseeker.com, SlashGear.com and TechSpot.com).[16]
MyFax[edit]
MyFax is an Internet business communication tool which had been provided by the Ottawa-based software company Protus IP Solutions.[17] The company was acquired by j2 Global in December 2010.
Internet faxing is a service that permits the sending and receiving of faxes using the Internet rather than the traditional public switched telephone network (PSTN), also known as the plain old telephone service (POTS) or a traditional fax machine. Faxing online eliminates problems with traditional faxing, including connection issues, busy signals and loss of data. Internet faxes can be delivered to multiple email addresses and forwarded to multiple recipients rather than to one machine at a time.[18]
History[edit]
MyFax was launched by Protus IP Solutions in 2009 as an alternative to fax machines, as it enables users to send and receive faxes from any location.[19] MyFax has grown to over 400,000 subscribers,[20] with approximately 20,000 new customers subscribing to the service each month.[21]
On December 6, 2010, MyFax announced that it had been acquired by j2 Global Communications, Inc, owners of eFax.[22]
Features[edit]
Some of the features of MyFax include the ability to send and receive faxes by email and through the internet, as well as send faxes directly from Microsoft Office, Microsoft Outlook, and Microsoft Windows-based applications including Google Docs, OpenOffice.org, and Intuit QuickBooks.[23] Recently, a program has been released that allows for iPhone and BlackBerry applications to make it fully compatible with smartphones.[24]
In 2009, TMCnet claimed that “MyFax is the fastest-growing Internet fax service used by individuals, small, medium and large businesses to send and receive faxes using existing email accounts or the web. MyFax offers services to industries in North America and Europe that are recognized as some of the fastest-growing adopters of Internet fax including healthcare, finance, insurance, real estate, transportation and government.”[25]
MyFax is now owned by j2 Global, which has imposed very restrictive terms and conditions restricting the client's right to local number portability. Among the restrictions is a $40 US charge per number if j2 permits the number to be ported out; the company imposes many arbitrary restrictions on portability and has attempted to claim the numbers as its own property, in some cases imposing inflated penalties and unilaterally taking numbers back after they've been ported to another provider by clients.[26]
Reviews[edit]
Before its acquisition by j2 Global, MyFax had received a few favourable reviews[27] including an Internet Telephony magazine product of the year for 2009.[28]
While the impact of the j2 Global acquisition is unknown, other companies acquired by j2 have been the target of frequent consumer complaints regarding sales tactics,[29] inflated fees to cancel the service[30] and toll-free number portability issues.[31][32]
Awards[edit]
In September 2012, j2 Global was recognized on the InformationWeek 500 list of technology companies.[33]
In 2013, j2 Global was ranked number 40 in Forbes' list of "America's Best Small Companies".[34]
Criticism[edit]

Some j2 Global companies have been the target of complaints ranging from number portability to issues with its contract providing no refunds on early termination.[citation needed]
It has targeted various competing providers with patent litigation, including CallWave,[35] Comodo, EasyLink Services International Corporation,[36] Open Text, Packetel, Protus, Venali and Vitelity.[citation needed] Many of these companies have filed counter-claims, some of which allege antitrust violations of Section 2 of the Sherman Act and California’s Business and Professions Code §§ 16720 and 17200.[37] j2 Global has also received complaints for making it difficult for subscribers to leave the service through high cancellation fees and lack of toll-free number portability in certain cases.[38][citation needed] Clients of companies acquired by j2 Global (such as eFax and Onebox) have complained that toll-free number portability, which was provided before the companies were acquired, has been removed, and that j2 Global (or its newly acquired subsidiaries) claim that it owns the telephone numbers associated with the service.[citation needed]

History[edit]
j2 Global was founded in December 1995 as JFax by Jaye Muller and Jack Rieley.[3] The company changed its registered name to j2 Global Communications, Inc. on August 2000,[4] and again to j2 Global on December 7, 2011, dropping "Communications" from its official name to reflect "...expansion from phone number-centric services ... into complementary lines of non-phone number-centric services."[5]
On November 12, 2012, j2 Global launched its digital media division with the acquisition of digital publisher Ziff Davis Inc. for $167 million in cash.[6] On February 4, 2013, j2 Global announced that it had more than doubled the size of its digital media division's business with the acquisition of IGN Entertainment from News Corp.[7] Terms of the IGN acquisition were not publicized.
On March 18, 2013, the company announced it had acquired MetroFax, a Bellevue, Washington provider of Internet faxing services.[8] On April 17, 2013, the company acquired Backup Connect BV, a Dutch provider of online backup services.[9] On 19 November 2013, its media division Ziff Davis announced it acquired electronics aggregating website TechBargain.com.
In February, j2 Global announced the acquisition of several companies: City Numbers, a UK-based worldwide provider of inbound toll-free numbers in over 80 countries;[10] LiveDrive, a UK-based provider of online backup;[11] and Australian companies OzeFax and Faxmate.[12] On 3 April[13] 2014 j2 Global announced that it acquired Business Critical Software (also known as iCritical), a UK-based email security and management company.[14]
As of 2014, j2 Global has a network that covers 49 countries on six continents. As of December 31, 2013, j2 Global reported 18 consecutive fiscal years of revenue growth.[15]
Brands and subsidiaries[edit]
j2 Global, Inc. provides Internet services through its two divisions: Business Cloud Services and Digital Media. Business Cloud Services brands include eFax, Onebox, eVoice, Fusemail, Campaigner, KeepITsafe, VaultLogix, Callstream, Yotta280, Mailout Interactive, GDV, BackUp Solutions, SugarSync, Nuvotera, UnityFax, Firstway Digital, Excel Micro, Web24 Group, MXSweep, City Numbers, LiveDrive, MetroFax, TrustFax, RapidFax, Send2Fax and Fax.com. The Digital Media division delivers various content through its digital properties, including Ziff Davis (Including PC Magazine, ComputerShopper, ExtremeTech, Toolbox.com and Geek.com) IGN Entertainment (including AskMen, 1UP.com and UGO.com), Offers.com, and NetShelter (including AndroidCentral.com, MacRumors.com, Neoseeker.com, SlashGear.com and TechSpot.com).[16]
MyFax[edit]
MyFax is an Internet business communication tool which had been provided by the Ottawa-based software company Protus IP Solutions.[17] The company was acquired by j2 Global in December 2010.
Internet faxing is a service that permits the sending and receiving of faxes using the Internet rather than the traditional public switched telephone network (PSTN), also known as the plain old telephone service (POTS) or a traditional fax machine. Faxing online eliminates problems with traditional faxing, including connection issues, busy signals and loss of data. Internet faxes can be delivered to multiple email addresses and forwarded to multiple recipients rather than to one machine at a time.[18]
History[edit]
MyFax was launched by Protus IP Solutions in 2009 as an alternative to fax machines, as it enables users to send and receive faxes from any location.[19] MyFax has grown to over 400,000 subscribers,[20] with approximately 20,000 new customers subscribing to the service each month.[21]
On December 6, 2010, MyFax announced that it had been acquired by j2 Global Communications, Inc, owners of eFax.[22]
Features[edit]
Some of the features of MyFax include the ability to send and receive faxes by email and through the internet, as well as send faxes directly from Microsoft Office, Microsoft Outlook, and Microsoft Windows-based applications including Google Docs, OpenOffice.org, and Intuit QuickBooks.[23] Recently, a program has been released that allows for iPhone and BlackBerry applications to make it fully compatible with smartphones.[24]
In 2009, TMCnet claimed that “MyFax is the fastest-growing Internet fax service used by individuals, small, medium and large businesses to send and receive faxes using existing email accounts or the web. MyFax offers services to industries in North America and Europe that are recognized as some of the fastest-growing adopters of Internet fax including healthcare, finance, insurance, real estate, transportation and government.”[25]
MyFax is now owned by j2 Global, which has imposed very restrictive terms and conditions restricting the client's right to local number portability. Among the restrictions is a $40 US charge per number if j2 permits the number to be ported out; the company imposes many arbitrary restrictions on portability and has attempted to claim the numbers as its own property, in some cases imposing inflated penalties and unilaterally taking numbers back after they've been ported to another provider by clients.[26]
Reviews[edit]
Before its acquisition by j2 Global, MyFax had received a few favourable reviews[27] including an Internet Telephony magazine product of the year for 2009.[28]
While the impact of the j2 Global acquisition is unknown, other companies acquired by j2 have been the target of frequent consumer complaints regarding sales tactics,[29] inflated fees to cancel the service[30] and toll-free number portability issues.[31][32]
Awards[edit]
In September 2012, j2 Global was recognized on the InformationWeek 500 list of technology companies.[33]
In 2013, j2 Global was ranked number 40 in Forbes' list of "America's Best Small Companies".[34]
Criticism[edit]





The neutrality of this section is disputed. Relevant discussion may be found on the talk page. Please do not remove this message until conditions to do so are met. (November 2014) (Learn how and when to remove this template message)


Some j2 Global companies have been the target of complaints ranging from number portability to issues with its contract providing no refunds on early termination.[citation needed]
It has targeted various competing providers with patent litigation, including CallWave,[35] Comodo, EasyLink Services International Corporation,[36] Open Text, Packetel, Protus, Venali and Vitelity.[citation needed] Many of these companies have filed counter-claims, some of which allege antitrust violations of Section 2 of the Sherman Act and California’s Business and Professions Code §§ 16720 and 17200.[37] j2 Global has also received complaints for making it difficult for subscribers to leave the service through high cancellation fees and lack of toll-free number portability in certain cases.[38][citation needed] Clients of companies acquired by j2 Global (such as eFax and Onebox) have complained that toll-free number portability, which was provided before the companies were acquired, has been removed, and that j2 Global (or its newly acquired subsidiaries) claim that it owns the telephone numbers associated with the service.[citation needed]

History[edit]
j2 Global was founded in December 1995 as JFax by Jaye Muller and Jack Rieley.[3] The company changed its registered name to j2 Global Communications, Inc. on August 2000,[4] and again to j2 Global on December 7, 2011, dropping "Communications" from its official name to reflect "...expansion from phone number-centric services ... into complementary lines of non-phone number-centric services."[5]
On November 12, 2012, j2 Global launched its digital media division with the acquisition of digital publisher Ziff Davis Inc. for $167 million in cash.[6] On February 4, 2013, j2 Global announced that it had more than doubled the size of its digital media division's business with the acquisition of IGN Entertainment from News Corp.[7] Terms of the IGN acquisition were not publicized.
On March 18, 2013, the company announced it had acquired MetroFax, a Bellevue, Washington provider of Internet faxing services.[8] On April 17, 2013, the company acquired Backup Connect BV, a Dutch provider of online backup services.[9] On 19 November 2013, its media division Ziff Davis announced it acquired electronics aggregating website TechBargain.com.
In February, j2 Global announced the acquisition of several companies: City Numbers, a UK-based worldwide provider of inbound toll-free numbers in over 80 countries;[10] LiveDrive, a UK-based provider of online backup;[11] and Australian companies OzeFax and Faxmate.[12] On 3 April[13] 2014 j2 Global announced that it acquired Business Critical Software (also known as iCritical), a UK-based email security and management company.[14]
As of 2014, j2 Global has a network that covers 49 countries on six continents. As of December 31, 2013, j2 Global reported 18 consecutive fiscal years of revenue growth.[15]
Brands and subsidiaries[edit]
j2 Global, Inc. provides Internet services through its two divisions: Business Cloud Services and Digital Media. Business Cloud Services brands include eFax, Onebox, eVoice, Fusemail, Campaigner, KeepITsafe, VaultLogix, Callstream, Yotta280, Mailout Interactive, GDV, BackUp Solutions, SugarSync, Nuvotera, UnityFax, Firstway Digital, Excel Micro, Web24 Group, MXSweep, City Numbers, LiveDrive, MetroFax, TrustFax, RapidFax, Send2Fax and Fax.com. The Digital Media division delivers various content through its digital properties, including Ziff Davis (Including PC Magazine, ComputerShopper, ExtremeTech, Toolbox.com and Geek.com) IGN Entertainment (including AskMen, 1UP.com and UGO.com), Offers.com, and NetShelter (including AndroidCentral.com, MacRumors.com, Neoseeker.com, SlashGear.com and TechSpot.com).[16]
MyFax[edit]
MyFax is an Internet business communication tool which had been provided by the Ottawa-based software company Protus IP Solutions.[17] The company was acquired by j2 Global in December 2010.
Internet faxing is a service that permits the sending and receiving of faxes using the Internet rather than the traditional public switched telephone network (PSTN), also known as the plain old telephone service (POTS) or a traditional fax machine. Faxing online eliminates problems with traditional faxing, including connection issues, busy signals and loss of data. Internet faxes can be delivered to multiple email addresses and forwarded to multiple recipients rather than to one machine at a time.[18]
History[edit]
MyFax was launched by Protus IP Solutions in 2009 as an alternative to fax machines, as it enables users to send and receive faxes from any location.[19] MyFax has grown to over 400,000 subscribers,[20] with approximately 20,000 new customers subscribing to the service each month.[21]
On December 6, 2010, MyFax announced that it had been acquired by j2 Global Communications, Inc, owners of eFax.[22]
Features[edit]
Some of the features of MyFax include the ability to send and receive faxes by email and through the internet, as well as send faxes directly from Microsoft Office, Microsoft Outlook, and Microsoft Windows-based applications including Google Docs, OpenOffice.org, and Intuit QuickBooks.[23] Recently, a program has been released that allows for iPhone and BlackBerry applications to make it fully compatible with smartphones.[24]
In 2009, TMCnet claimed that “MyFax is the fastest-growing Internet fax service used by individuals, small, medium and large businesses to send and receive faxes using existing email accounts or the web. MyFax offers services to industries in North America and Europe that are recognized as some of the fastest-growing adopters of Internet fax including healthcare, finance, insurance, real estate, transportation and government.”[25]
MyFax is now owned by j2 Global, which has imposed very restrictive terms and conditions restricting the client's right to local number portability. Among the restrictions is a $40 US charge per number if j2 permits the number to be ported out; the company imposes many arbitrary restrictions on portability and has attempted to claim the numbers as its own property, in some cases imposing inflated penalties and unilaterally taking numbers back after they've been ported to another provider by clients.[26]
Reviews[edit]
Before its acquisition by j2 Global, MyFax had received a few favourable reviews[27] including an Internet Telephony magazine product of the year for 2009.[28]
While the impact of the j2 Global acquisition is unknown, other companies acquired by j2 have been the target of frequent consumer complaints regarding sales tactics,[29] inflated fees to cancel the service[30] and toll-free number portability issues.[31][32]
Awards[edit]
In September 2012, j2 Global was recognized on the InformationWeek 500 list of technology companies.[33]
In 2013, j2 Global was ranked number 40 in Forbes' list of "America's Best Small Companies".[34]
Criticism[edit]





The neutrality of this section is disputed. Relevant discussion may be found on the talk page. Please do not remove this message until conditions to do so are met. (November 2014) (Learn how and when to remove this template message)


Some j2 Global companies have been the target of complaints ranging from number portability to issues with its contract providing no refunds on early termination.[citation needed]
It has targeted various competing providers with patent litigation, including CallWave,[35] Comodo, EasyLink Services International Corporation,[36] Open Text, Packetel, Protus, Venali and Vitelity.[citation needed] Many of these companies have filed counter-claims, some of which allege antitrust violations of Section 2 of the Sherman Act and California’s Business and Professions Code §§ 16720 and 17200.[37] j2 Global has also received complaints for making it difficult for subscribers to leave the service through high cancellation fees and lack of toll-free number portability in certain cases.[38][citation needed] Clients of companies acquired by j2 Global (such as eFax and Onebox) have complained that toll-free number portability, which was provided before the companies were acquired, has been removed, and that j2 Global (or its newly acquired subsidiaries) claim that it owns the telephone numbers associated with the service.[citation needed]

History[edit]
j2 Global was founded in December 1995 as JFax by Jaye Muller and Jack Rieley.[3] The company changed its registered name to j2 Global Communications, Inc. on August 2000,[4] and again to j2 Global on December 7, 2011, dropping "Communications" from its official name to reflect "...expansion from phone number-centric services ... into complementary lines of non-phone number-centric services."[5]
On November 12, 2012, j2 Global launched its digital media division with the acquisition of digital publisher Ziff Davis Inc. for $167 million in cash.[6] On February 4, 2013, j2 Global announced that it had more than doubled the size of its digital media division's business with the acquisition of IGN Entertainment from News Corp.[7] Terms of the IGN acquisition were not publicized.
On March 18, 2013, the company announced it had acquired MetroFax, a Bellevue, Washington provider of Internet faxing services.[8] On April 17, 2013, the company acquired Backup Connect BV, a Dutch provider of online backup services.[9] On 19 November 2013, its media division Ziff Davis announced it acquired electronics aggregating website TechBargain.com.
In February, j2 Global announced the acquisition of several companies: City Numbers, a UK-based worldwide provider of inbound toll-free numbers in over 80 countries;[10] LiveDrive, a UK-based provider of online backup;[11] and Australian companies OzeFax and Faxmate.[12] On 3 April[13] 2014 j2 Global announced that it acquired Business Critical Software (also known as iCritical), a UK-based email security and management company.[14]
As of 2014, j2 Global has a network that covers 49 countries on six continents. As of December 31, 2013, j2 Global reported 18 consecutive fiscal years of revenue growth.[15]
Brands and subsidiaries[edit]
j2 Global, Inc. provides Internet services through its two divisions: Business Cloud Services and Digital Media. Business Cloud Services brands include eFax, Onebox, eVoice, Fusemail, Campaigner, KeepITsafe, VaultLogix, Callstream, Yotta280, Mailout Interactive, GDV, BackUp Solutions, SugarSync, Nuvotera, UnityFax, Firstway Digital, Excel Micro, Web24 Group, MXSweep, City Numbers, LiveDrive, MetroFax, TrustFax, RapidFax, Send2Fax and Fax.com. The Digital Media division delivers various content through its digital properties, including Ziff Davis (Including PC Magazine, ComputerShopper, ExtremeTech, Toolbox.com and Geek.com) IGN Entertainment (including AskMen, 1UP.com and UGO.com), Offers.com, and NetShelter (including AndroidCentral.com, MacRumors.com, Neoseeker.com, SlashGear.com and TechSpot.com).[16]
MyFax[edit]
MyFax is an Internet business communication tool which had been provided by the Ottawa-based software company Protus IP Solutions.[17] The company was acquired by j2 Global in December 2010.
Internet faxing is a service that permits the sending and receiving of faxes using the Internet rather than the traditional public switched telephone network (PSTN), also known as the plain old telephone service (POTS) or a traditional fax machine. Faxing online eliminates problems with traditional faxing, including connection issues, busy signals and loss of data. Internet faxes can be delivered to multiple email addresses and forwarded to multiple recipients rather than to one machine at a time.[18]
History[edit]
MyFax was launched by Protus IP Solutions in 2009 as an alternative to fax machines, as it enables users to send and receive faxes from any location.[19] MyFax has grown to over 400,000 subscribers,[20] with approximately 20,000 new customers subscribing to the service each month.[21]
On December 6, 2010, MyFax announced that it had been acquired by j2 Global Communications, Inc, owners of eFax.[22]
Features[edit]
Some of the features of MyFax include the ability to send and receive faxes by email and through the internet, as well as send faxes directly from Microsoft Office, Microsoft Outlook, and Microsoft Windows-based applications including Google Docs, OpenOffice.org, and Intuit QuickBooks.[23] Recently, a program has been released that allows for iPhone and BlackBerry applications to make it fully compatible with smartphones.[24]
In 2009, TMCnet claimed that “MyFax is the fastest-growing Internet fax service used by individuals, small, medium and large businesses to send and receive faxes using existing email accounts or the web. MyFax offers services to industries in North America and Europe that are recognized as some of the fastest-growing adopters of Internet fax including healthcare, finance, insurance, real estate, transportation and government.”[25]
MyFax is now owned by j2 Global, which has imposed very restrictive terms and conditions restricting the client's right to local number portability. Among the restrictions is a $40 US charge per number if j2 permits the number to be ported out; the company imposes many arbitrary restrictions on portability and has attempted to claim the numbers as its own property, in some cases imposing inflated penalties and unilaterally taking numbers back after they've been ported to another provider by clients.[26]
Reviews[edit]
Before its acquisition by j2 Global, MyFax had received a few favourable reviews[27] including an Internet Telephony magazine product of the year for 2009.[28]
While the impact of the j2 Global acquisition is unknown, other companies acquired by j2 have been the target of frequent consumer complaints regarding sales tactics,[29] inflated fees to cancel the service[30] and toll-free number portability issues.[31][32]
Awards[edit]
In September 2012, j2 Global was recognized on the InformationWeek 500 list of technology companies.[33]
In 2013, j2 Global was ranked number 40 in Forbes' list of "America's Best Small Companies".[34]
Criticism[edit]





The neutrality of this section is disputed. Relevant discussion may be found on the talk page. Please do not remove this message until conditions to do so are met. (November 2014) (Learn how and when to remove this template message)


Some j2 Global companies have been the target of complaints ranging from number portability to issues with its contract providing no refunds on early termination.[citation needed]
It has targeted various competing providers with patent litigation, including CallWave,[35] Comodo, EasyLink Services International Corporation,[36] Open Text, Packetel, Protus, Venali and Vitelity.[citation needed] Many of these companies have filed counter-claims, some of which allege antitrust violations of Section 2 of the Sherman Act and California’s Business and Professions Code §§ 16720 and 17200.[37] j2 Global has also received complaints for making it difficult for subscribers to leave the service through high cancellation fees and lack of toll-free number portability in certain cases.[38][citation needed] Clients of companies acquired by j2 Global (such as eFax and Onebox) have complained that toll-free number portability, which was provided before the companies were acquired, has been removed, and that j2 Global (or its newly acquired subsidiaries) claim that it owns the telephone numbers associated with the service.[citation needed]

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

22 GB gzip250 GB uncompressed

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.


RDF
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage.date> "2001-02"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#gYearMonth>  .

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
