Legal and Disclosures
 
All investing is subject to risk, including the possible loss of the money you invest. Diversification and asset allocation does not ensure a profit or protect against a loss.
 
Forward Looking Statements
The statements made herein take into account information currently available as well as historical trends. However, any forward-looking statement involves known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause the actual performance of future markets to differ materially from the projections depicted here. There can be no certainty as to the extent or depth of any market downturn, nor any assurance regarding the nature, extent or timing of markets rebounding, and past performance cannot be relied upon for future performance. When evaluating the information included in this report, you are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which reflect judgments only as of the date of the materials creation.
 
Statements of Opinion Including Case Studies
The information and opinions expressed herein are obtained from sources believed to be reliable and up-to-date, however their accuracy and completeness cannot be guaranteed. Opinions expressed reflect judgment current as of the date of this publication and are subject to change. Opinions expressed are current as of the date of the materials and are subject to change.
The materials on this site should in no way be construed as investment advice nor a solicitation to buy or sell securities or insurance products and services. No investment actions should be implemented based on the materials presented herein.
 
Investment Risk
Investment involves risk. The value of an investment as well as income associated with investments is not guaranteed and may fluctuate. Accordingly, investments may decline below what was originally invested.
 
International Investing
International investing, especially in emerging markets, involves special risks, such as currency exchange, political and economic risks. 
Alternative Investments
Alternative Investments involve a higher degree of risk because they may engage in leveraging or other speculative investment practices that may increase the risk of investment loss. Alternative investments can also be highly illiquid.
 
REITs
REITs may be subject to greater volatility than investments in traditional securities and pose special risks. The value of real estate and portfolios that invest in real estate may fluctuate due to losses from causality or condemnation, changes in local and general economic conditions, supply and demand, interest rates, property taxes, and regulatory limitations on rents, zoning laws, and operating expenses.
 
Commodities
Commodities may be subject to greater volatility than securities and pose special risks. Investments in commodities may be affected by changes in interest rates, and other factors such as weather, disease, embargoes and international economic and political developments.
 
High Yield Bonds
High yield bonds are lower grade bonds whose principal may be subject to greater fluctuation than investments in higher rated bonds. Use of these instruments may involve certain costs and risks such as liquidity risk, interest rate risk, and credit risk.
 
Indices
Index performance is shown as total return. You cannot invest directly in an index, but you can invest in securities that track an index. Index funds are weighted and so may not perform in unison with the index.
 
Professional Designations

Forward Looking Statements
The statements made herein take into account information currently available as well as historical trends. However, any forward-looking statement involves known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause the actual performance of future markets to differ materially from the projections depicted here. There can be no certainty as to the extent or depth of any market downturn, nor any assurance regarding the nature, extent or timing of markets rebounding, and past performance cannot be relied upon for future performance. When evaluating the information included in this report, you are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which reflect judgments only as of the date of the materials creation.
 
Statements of Opinion Including Case Studies
The information and opinions expressed herein are obtained from sources believed to be reliable and up-to-date, however their accuracy and completeness cannot be guaranteed. Opinions expressed reflect judgment current as of the date of this publication and are subject to change. Opinions expressed are current as of the date of the materials and are subject to change.
The materials on this site should in no way be construed as investment advice nor a solicitation to buy or sell securities or insurance products and services. No investment actions should be implemented based on the materials presented herein.
 
Investment Risk
Investment involves risk. The value of an investment as well as income associated with investments is not guaranteed and may fluctuate. Accordingly, investments may decline below what was originally invested.
 
International Investing
International investing, especially in emerging markets, involves special risks, such as currency exchange, political and economic risks. 
Alternative Investments
Alternative Investments involve a higher degree of risk because they may engage in leveraging or other speculative investment practices that may increase the risk of investment loss. Alternative investments can also be highly illiquid.
 
REITs
REITs may be subject to greater volatility than investments in traditional securities and pose special risks. The value of real estate and portfolios that invest in real estate may fluctuate due to losses from causality or condemnation, changes in local and general economic conditions, supply and demand, interest rates, property taxes, and regulatory limitations on rents, zoning laws, and operating expenses.
 
Commodities
Commodities may be subject to greater volatility than securities and pose special risks. Investments in commodities may be affected by changes in interest rates, and other factors such as weather, disease, embargoes and international economic and political developments.
 
High Yield Bonds
High yield bonds are lower grade bonds whose principal may be subject to greater fluctuation than investments in higher rated bonds. Use of these instruments may involve certain costs and risks such as liquidity risk, interest rate risk, and credit risk.
 
Indices
Index performance is shown as total return. You cannot invest directly in an index, but you can invest in securities that track an index. Index funds are weighted and so may not perform in unison with the index.

Legal and Disclosures
 
All investing is subject to risk, including the possible loss of the money you invest. Diversification and asset allocation does not ensure a profit or protect against a loss.
 
Forward Looking Statements
The statements made herein take into account information currently available as well as historical trends. However, any forward-looking statement involves known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause the actual performance of future markets to differ materially from the projections depicted here. There can be no certainty as to the extent or depth of any market downturn, nor any assurance regarding the nature, extent or timing of markets rebounding, and past performance cannot be relied upon for future performance. When evaluating the information included in this report, you are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which reflect judgments only as of the date of the materials creation.
 
Statements of Opinion Including Case Studies
The information and opinions expressed herein are obtained from sources believed to be reliable and up-to-date, however their accuracy and completeness cannot be guaranteed. Opinions expressed reflect judgment current as of the date of this publication and are subject to change. Opinions expressed are current as of the date of the materials and are subject to change.
The materials on this site should in no way be construed as investment advice nor a solicitation to buy or sell securities or insurance products and services. No investment actions should be implemented based on the materials presented herein.
 
Investment Risk
Investment involves risk. The value of an investment as well as income associated with investments is not guaranteed and may fluctuate. Accordingly, investments may decline below what was originally invested.
 
International Investing
International investing, especially in emerging markets, involves special risks, such as currency exchange, political and economic risks. 
Alternative Investments
Alternative Investments involve a higher degree of risk because they may engage in leveraging or other speculative investment practices that may increase the risk of investment loss. Alternative investments can also be highly illiquid.
 
REITs
REITs may be subject to greater volatility than investments in traditional securities and pose special risks. The value of real estate and portfolios that invest in real estate may fluctuate due to losses from causality or condemnation, changes in local and general economic conditions, supply and demand, interest rates, property taxes, and regulatory limitations on rents, zoning laws, and operating expenses.
 
Commodities
Commodities may be subject to greater volatility than securities and pose special risks. Investments in commodities may be affected by changes in interest rates, and other factors such as weather, disease, embargoes and international economic and political developments.
 
High Yield Bonds
High yield bonds are lower grade bonds whose principal may be subject to greater fluctuation than investments in higher rated bonds. Use of these instruments may involve certain costs and risks such as liquidity risk, interest rate risk, and credit risk.
 
Indices
Index performance is shown as total return. You cannot invest directly in an index, but you can invest in securities that track an index. Index funds are weighted and so may not perform in unison with the index.
 
Professional Designations

Legal and Disclosures
 
All investing is subject to risk, including the possible loss of the money you invest. Diversification and asset allocation does not ensure a profit or protect against a loss.
 
Forward Looking Statements
The statements made herein take into account information currently available as well as historical trends. However, any forward-looking statement involves known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause the actual performance of future markets to differ materially from the projections depicted here. There can be no certainty as to the extent or depth of any market downturn, nor any assurance regarding the nature, extent or timing of markets rebounding, and past performance cannot be relied upon for future performance. When evaluating the information included in this report, you are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which reflect judgments only as of the date of the materials creation.
 
Statements of Opinion Including Case Studies
The information and opinions expressed herein are obtained from sources believed to be reliable and up-to-date, however their accuracy and completeness cannot be guaranteed. Opinions expressed reflect judgment current as of the date of this publication and are subject to change. Opinions expressed are current as of the date of the materials and are subject to change.
The materials on this site should in no way be construed as investment advice nor a solicitation to buy or sell securities or insurance products and services. No investment actions should be implemented based on the materials presented herein.
 
Investment Risk
Investment involves risk. The value of an investment as well as income associated with investments is not guaranteed and may fluctuate. Accordingly, investments may decline below what was originally invested.
 
International Investing
International investing, especially in emerging markets, involves special risks, such as currency exchange, political and economic risks. 
Alternative Investments
Alternative Investments involve a higher degree of risk because they may engage in leveraging or other speculative investment practices that may increase the risk of investment loss. Alternative investments can also be highly illiquid.
 
REITs
REITs may be subject to greater volatility than investments in traditional securities and pose special risks. The value of real estate and portfolios that invest in real estate may fluctuate due to losses from causality or condemnation, changes in local and general economic conditions, supply and demand, interest rates, property taxes, and regulatory limitations on rents, zoning laws, and operating expenses.
 
Commodities
Commodities may be subject to greater volatility than securities and pose special risks. Investments in commodities may be affected by changes in interest rates, and other factors such as weather, disease, embargoes and international economic and political developments.
 
High Yield Bonds
High yield bonds are lower grade bonds whose principal may be subject to greater fluctuation than investments in higher rated bonds. Use of these instruments may involve certain costs and risks such as liquidity risk, interest rate risk, and credit risk.
 
Indices
Index performance is shown as total return. You cannot invest directly in an index, but you can invest in securities that track an index. Index funds are weighted and so may not perform in unison with the index.

Legal and Disclosures
 
All investing is subject to risk, including the possible loss of the money you invest. Diversification and asset allocation does not ensure a profit or protect against a loss.
 
Forward Looking Statements
The statements made herein take into account information currently available as well as historical trends. However, any forward-looking statement involves known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause the actual performance of future markets to differ materially from the projections depicted here. There can be no certainty as to the extent or depth of any market downturn, nor any assurance regarding the nature, extent or timing of markets rebounding, and past performance cannot be relied upon for future performance. When evaluating the information included in this report, you are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which reflect judgments only as of the date of the materials creation.
 
Statements of Opinion Including Case Studies
The information and opinions expressed herein are obtained from sources believed to be reliable and up-to-date, however their accuracy and completeness cannot be guaranteed. Opinions expressed reflect judgment current as of the date of this publication and are subject to change. Opinions expressed are current as of the date of the materials and are subject to change.
The materials on this site should in no way be construed as investment advice nor a solicitation to buy or sell securities or insurance products and services. No investment actions should be implemented based on the materials presented herein.
 
Investment Risk
Investment involves risk. The value of an investment as well as income associated with investments is not guaranteed and may fluctuate. Accordingly, investments may decline below what was originally invested.
 
International Investing
International investing, especially in emerging markets, involves special risks, such as currency exchange, political and economic risks. 
Alternative Investments
Alternative Investments involve a higher degree of risk because they may engage in leveraging or other speculative investment practices that may increase the risk of investment loss. Alternative investments can also be highly illiquid.
 
REITs
REITs may be subject to greater volatility than investments in traditional securities and pose special risks. The value of real estate and portfolios that invest in real estate may fluctuate due to losses from causality or condemnation, changes in local and general economic conditions, supply and demand, interest rates, property taxes, and regulatory limitations on rents, zoning laws, and operating expenses.
 
Commodities
Commodities may be subject to greater volatility than securities and pose special risks. Investments in commodities may be affected by changes in interest rates, and other factors such as weather, disease, embargoes and international economic and political developments.
 
High Yield Bonds
High yield bonds are lower grade bonds whose principal may be subject to greater fluctuation than investments in higher rated bonds. Use of these instruments may involve certain costs and risks such as liquidity risk, interest rate risk, and credit risk.
 
Indices
Index performance is shown as total return. You cannot invest directly in an index, but you can invest in securities that track an index. Index funds are weighted and so may not perform in unison with the index.
 
Professional Designations

Charity[edit]
Main article: The Children's Investment Fund Foundation
TCI derives its name from a charitable foundation called The Children's Investment Fund Foundation (CIFF), set up by Chris Hohn and his ex-wife, Jamie Cooper-Hohn. In an example of "venture philanthropy", CIFF initially received a portion of TCI’s profits and other donations. CIFF focuses on improving the lives of children living in poverty in developing countries, and has grown to be one of the largest charities in the United Kingdom. After suffering a 43% loss during the 2008 calendar year, as of July 2009 the previous financial year had seen a rebound of over 70% profit and revenue for TCI.[1]
Through changes set in motion in 2012, the fund and foundation were split up. The fund no longer donates money to the foundation on a contractual basis, though it may do on a discretionary basis.[2]
Investor activism[edit]
TCI has a reputation for aggressive shareholder activism.[3] Some critics[who?] believe that it has taken an active role in most situations to promote its own agenda under the guise of sound corporate governance and increase shareholder value. TCI has been a major shareholder of the German stock exchange Deutsche Börse where it forced the resignation of the CEO after he refused to abandon his plan to take over the London Stock Exchange. In 2007, after acquiring 1% of the shares of major Dutch bank ABN AMRO, TCI led an attack demanding the bank split up or sell to the highest bidder to produce shareholder value.[4] ABN was ultimately split and sold to Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS), Fortis, and Banco Santander and was a major contributing factor in the downfall of both RBS and Fortis. In June 2007, TCI failed in its attempt to get the Japanese utility J-Power, in which it had acquired a 10% stake, to boost its dividend. The general meeting of shareholders rejected the proposal, prompting a severe selloff in the stock.
In 2006, as a shareholder of both Mittal Steel Company and Arcelor, TCI supported Mittal Steel in the company's unsolicited takeover offer for Arcelor. However, when Mittal Steel subsequently attempted to acquire Arcelor Brasil (one of Arcelor's subsidiaries) without an appropriate premium, TCI defended the rights of Arcelor Brasil’s minority shareholders, causing Mittal to raise its offer price more than 55%.[citation needed]
TCI initiated legal action against the Government of India using provisions in the bilateral trade treaty between United Kingdom and India regarding the under pricing of coal by Coal India Limited,in which TCI holds 1% stake.[5]
In 2008 the company was suffering from heavy losses but recovered very well and assets under management reportedly stood around $6 billion earlier this year, and at the end of 2010, the company recorded a loss of 80% in profits as a result of reduced investment performance.[6]
Awards[edit]
The fund won Eurohedge’s European Hedge Fund of the Year award in 2004, 2005,[7] 2013[8]

Originally published in Futures & Derivatives Law Report, December 2011 - Volume 31 - Issue 11.





The economic crisis prompted a renewed focus on those market participants that use equity total return swaps to obtain synthetic positions in the shares of public companies. Periodically, parties that enter into equity total return swaps have faced calls to disclose the positions that they “hold” as if they physically owned the relevant shares. The arguments in favor of disclosure are that it puts a company on notice about the accumulation of significant positions, which could be used either as a springboard for a potential takeover bid or to exert influence over the direction and/or management of the company, and that it helps investors to make fully informed investment decisions. As large synthetic positions could also potentially be used to gain influence, there is an argument that such positions also be disclosed. On the other side of the argument, those in favor of nondisclosure argue that a synthetic holding of shares provides only the economic incidents of ownership and that, without a specific agreement to the contrary between the parties to the swap, the long party to a swap has no real influence or power over the shares, and therefore the company, by virtue of its synthetic position.

Futures & Derivatives Law REPORT The Journal on the Law of Investment & Risk Management Products December 2011 n Volume 31 n Issue 11 CSX Corp. v. Children’s Investment Fund Management (UK) LLP: Disclosure Requirements in the Context of Total Return Swaps b y I a n C u i l l e r i e r a n d C l a i r e H a l l 1 REPRINT ARTICLE The economic crisis prompted a renewed focus on those market participants that use equity total return swaps to obtain synthetic positions in the shares of public companies. Periodically, parties that enter into equity total return swaps have faced calls to disclose the positions that they “hold” as if they physically owned the relevant shares. The arguments in favor of disclosure are that it puts a company on notice about the accumulation of significant positions, which could be used either as a springboard for a potential takeover bid or to exert influence over the direction and/or management of the company, and that it helps investors to make fully informed investment decisions. As large synthetic positions could also potentially be used to gain influence, there is an argument that such positions also be disclosed. On the other side of the argument, those in favor of nondisclosure argue that a synthetic holding of shares provides only the economic incidents of ownership and that, without a specific agreement to the contrary between the parties to the swap, the long party to a swap has no real influence or power over the shares, and therefore the company, by virtue of its synthetic position. A total return swap is a contract whereby one party (the long party) receives cash flows based on the performance of an underlying asset from the other (the short party). A total return swap allows a party, for a fee, to replicate ownership of an asset without actually owning it. In an equity total return swap, the underlying asset is a specified notional amount of shares in a particular company. Where the equity total return swap is cash settled, the long party receives from the short party periodic payments (or a single payment at the maturity of the swap) representing any increase in value of the relevant shares and any distributions, such as dividends. In return, the long party pays to the short party any decrease in the value of the relevant shares and interest payments calculated with reference to an agreed interest rate on a notional amount – this effectively replicates the short party loaning to the long party the funds necessary to purchase the relevant PRINTED COPY FOR PERSONAL READING ONLY. NOT FOR DISTRIBUTION.December 2011 n Volume 31 n Issue 11 Futures & Derivatives Law Report © 2011 Thomson Reuters shares. The effect of the contract is that the long party takes the upside of the relevant company’s valuation and also bears the risk of the downside, just as if the long party owned the shares outright. In equity total return swaps, the short party will typically purchase the specified shares to hedge its own position under the swap, but need not do so.2 Further, there is usually no obligation on the long party to acquire the shares from the short party when the transaction unwinds; nor does the long party usually have the ability to direct the voting of the short party in respect of those shares. In some cases, a short party will have a policy against voting any shares that it holds as a hedge position. In the UK, the Financial Services Authority tackled the disclosure issue a few years ago by conducting a consultation and, in June 2009, publishing rules. A detailed analysis of the UK rules are outside the scope of this article. In summary, the rules require any person that enters into a cash-settled total return swap3 (in UK parlance a “contract for difference”) that references a UKlisted share, to disclose its position (or the combined position of its total return swap holdings and physical holdings) once that position is equal to 3 percent of the relevant company’s total voting rights subject to permitted exclusion.4 In the US, the relevant disclosure regime is set out in the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”) and its related rules. Recent litigation as well as the enactment of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform Protection Act 2010 (the “Dodd-Frank Act”) means that, at present, the applicability of Section 13(d) and 13(g) of the Exchange Act to cash-settled equity total return swaps is unclear and there is still no bright-line rule to follow. The Dodd-Frank Act Section 766(b) of the Dodd-Frank Act amends Sections 13(d) and 13(g) of the Exchange Act to specifically extend beneficial ownership reporting requirements to any person who becomes or is deemed to become a beneficial owner of equity securities upon the purchase or sale of a securitybased swap5 as defined under Securities and Exchange Commission’s (“SEC”) rules. Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act requires a person who acquires, directly or indirectly, beneficial ownership of more than 5 percent of certain classes of equity securities registered under the Exchange Act to file, within ten calendar days of such acquisition, a report with the SEC. Section 13(d), by its extension through Section 766(b) of the Dodd-Frank Act, could require the long party to a cash-settled equity total return swap whose swap referenced a notional amount of equity securities that, when aggregated with other equity securities, if any, beneficially owned by the long party, constitute at least 5 percent of the total outstanding shares of that class (and assuming that the class of shares was registered with the SEC), to make disclosures to the SEC as if it owned the shares. The Exchange Act does not define the concept of “beneficial ownership,” however, the SEC has promulgated rules defining a beneficial owner as someone who (i) possesses either voting power (the power to vote or direct others to vote the security) or investment power6 (the power to dispose of or direct the disposition of the security) or (ii) uses a contract, device or any other arrangement as part of a scheme to evade reporting requirements, also known as the “avoidance rule.”7 Section 766(e) of the Dodd-Frank Act adds a new Section 13(o) to the Exchange Act which states that a person is deemed to acquire beneficial ownership of an equity security based on the purchase or sale of a security-based swap only if the SEC determines (by rule and after consultation with prudential regulators and the Treasury Secretary) that the purchase or sale of the security-based swap provides incidents of ownership comparable to direct ownership of the underlying equity security and that it is necessary to achieve the purposes of the section that the purchase or sale of a security-based swap, or class of securitybased swap, be deemed the acquisition of beneficial ownership of the equity security. To date, the SEC has not exercised its rulemaking authority under Section 13(o). Instead, in its June 2011 release (the “Release”) the SEC re-promulgated certain provisions of Rule 13d-3 without change.8 PRINTED COPY FOR PERSONAL READING ONLY. NOT FOR DISTRIBUTION.Futures & Derivatives Law Report December 2011 n Volume 31 n Issue 11 © 2011 thomson reuters The Release addresses concerns of the SEC that, absent re-adoption of Rule 13d-3, Section 766 could be interpreted to exempt a person dealing in security-based swaps from the reporting requirements of Sections 13(d) and (g) and therefore allow an investor to use a security-based swap to obtain an influential or control position in a public company without disclosure. The re-promulgation of the rules preserves the application of existing beneficial ownership rules to persons who purchase or sell security-based swaps after the effective date of new Section 13(o) (i.e., July 16, 2011). As applied to security-based swaps, the SEC has confirmed that under Rule 13d-3, a person is considered a beneficial owner of an equity security underlying a security-based swap if any of the following apply:9 • The security-based swap provides a person, directly or indirectly, with exclusive or shared voting and/or investment power over the underlying equity security (whether or not such person has acquired the underlying equity security) (Rule 13d-3(a)).10 • A person uses the security-based swap as a means to divest or prevent the vesting of beneficial ownership as part of a plan or scheme to evade the beneficial ownership reporting requirements of Sections 13(d), 13(g) or 16 of the Exchange Act (Rule 13d-3(b)). • The security-based swap gives a person the right to acquire the underlying equity security within 60 days or holds the right with the purpose of changing or influencing control of the issuer of the underlying equity security (Rule 13d-3(d)(1)). In the Release, the SEC expressly states that the re-adoption of the rules is intended only to preserve the regulatory status quo and that the SEC staff is “engaged in a separate project to develop proposals to modernize reporting under Sections 13(d) and (g).” This suggests then that, although at present long parties to total return swaps seem to have escaped the disclosure obligations of the Exchange Act, the relief may be short-lived. The CSX Decision In July 2011, the appeals court for the second circuit issued its opinion in the case of CSX Corporation v. The Children’s Investment Fund Management et al. The opinion was much-anticipated by the derivatives market looking for clarification, or at least guidance, as to whether the long party to a cash-settled equity total return swap could be deemed to be the beneficial owner of shares held by the short party for the purposes of Section 13(d). No such clarification was forthcoming. The case was first brought in March 2008 by CSX Corporation (“CSX”) against The Children’s Investment Fund Management (UK) LLP (“TCI UK”), The Children’s Investment Fund Management (Cayman) Ltd., (“TCI Cayman” and together with TCI UK, “TCI”), 3G Fund L.P., (“3G Fund”), 3G Capital Partners L.P., (“3G LP”) and 3G Capital Partners Ltd., (together with 3G Fund and 3G LP, “3G” and 3G, together with TCI, the “Funds”). The circumstances of the case are as follows: TCI and 3G, both hedge funds, accumulated positions (both by direct cash investments and through total return swaps) in CSX and later sought to elect a minority of candidates to the board of CSX at CSX’s annual shareholders’ meeting in early 2008. CSX filed suit against the Funds claiming that the Funds had failed to comply with the disclosure requirements of Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act and seeking an injunction against the Funds, barring them from future violations of Section 13(d) and preventing them from voting their shares at the CSX annual shareholders’ meeting. The District Court held that the Funds had violated Section 13(d) and granted an injunction against future violations but did not enjoin the funds from voting the CSX shares. Unsurprisingly, appeals and cross-appeals followed. The general basis of CSX’s claim was that TCI breached Section 13(d) because it failed to disclose its beneficial ownership of the CSX shares held by its counterparty (the short party to the swap transaction) that were referenced in cashsettled equity total return swaps and that 3G and TCI together violated Section 13(d) by failing to disclose the formation of a group.11 CSX argued that the total return swaps referencing CSX shares PRINTED COPY FOR PERSONAL READING ONLY. NOT FOR DISTRIBUTION.December 2011 n Volume 31 n Issue 11 Futures & Derivatives Law Report © 2011 Thomson Reuters vested beneficial ownership in the Funds of the CSX shares held by the bank counterparties and therefore triggered disclosure obligations under Section 13(d) on the part of the Funds. The opinion issued by the District Court12 in June 2008 held that TCI violated its disclosure obligations under the Exchange Act. This holding was of concern to the swaps market. In its opinion, the District Court deemed TCI to be the beneficial owner of all CSX shares held by its total return swap counterparties. In determining whether TCI was the beneficial owner of the CSX shares held by the various bank counterparties, the District Court considered Rule 13d-3(a) (whether TCI had investment or voting power) and Rule 13d-3(b) (whether TCI engaged in avoidance of disclosure obligations). Ultimately the District Court decided the issue on the grounds of avoidance under Rule 13d-3(b) and deemed TCI to be the beneficial owner of the relevant shares because TCI had created and used the swaps with the purpose and effect of preventing the vesting of beneficial ownership as part of a scheme or plan to evade the applicable reporting requirements. The District Court focused on TCI’s history of spreading the swaps around so that no one bank counterparty maintained positions of 5 percent or more and TCI’s practice of transferring the swaps to banks that TCI believed were favorably disposed to its voting preferences. As noted above, the District Court’s decision was based on Rule 13d-3(b) and specific facts that tended to show that TCI had tried to avoid the disclosure regime. Importantly, the District Court did not base its decision on Rule 13d-3(a) and therefore did not rule on whether owning a long position in a swap necessarily vests beneficial ownership, leaving the issue open for future determination and therefore creating uncertainty in the swaps market. No wonder the decision of the Court of Appeal was eagerly awaited. Unfortunately, the Court of Appeal chose not to determine when a party to a cash-settled equity total return swap must comply with the disclosure requirements of Section 13(d), citing disagreement within the panel. The Court of Appeal instead chose to consider only whether a group violation of Rule 13d-3 had occurred with respect to the CSX shares held outright by the Funds. In its judgment, the higher Court remanded the issue of group violation to the District Court, citing the need for specific evidence of whether a group existed for purposes of the CSX shares that were held outright by the Funds. The Court of Appeal held that, because the District Court’s finding that a group violation had occurred was based upon the combination of shares held outright by the Funds and those shares that the District Court deemed the Funds to beneficially own, further review was required to assess whether a group violation had occurred only with respect to shares held outright by the Funds. The majority decision of the higher Court did not focus on the beneficial ownership issue at all. Judge Lewis Kaplan, in the Court’s majority opinion, explained that ultimately it was unnecessary to explore the issue of beneficial ownership as the case was decided on the basis of whether a group had formed within the meaning of Section 13(d). The opinion of the Court of Appeal therefore gave no clear answer as to the question of beneficial ownership by long parties to a total return swap. Perhaps of more interest to the derivatives market are the comments of Judge Ralph K. Winter in his concurring opinion.13 While the concurring opinion is not binding, Judge Winter’s opinion specifically addresses the question of beneficial ownership and provides a well-reasoned analysis as to the circumstances in which a long party to an equity total return swap could be treated as the beneficial owner of the short party’s shares. In his concurring opinion, Judge Winter analyzed each of the relevant parts of Rule 13d and effectively refuted the arguments put forward by the District Court on the issue of beneficial ownership. Rule 13d addresses the issue of a person obtaining control or influence over the issuer of equity securities: Investment Power – Rule 13d-3(a) CSX argued that TCI had investment power over the CSX shares owned by its counterparties because TCI knew that those counterparties would purchase CSX shares to hedge their short positions and would then sell such shares once PRINTED COPY FOR PERSONAL READING ONLY. NOT FOR DISTRIBUTION.Futures & Derivatives Law Report December 2011 n Volume 31 n Issue 11 © 2011 thomson reuters the swap transaction matured.14 In Judge Winter’s view, simply knowing or expecting that a person may purchase or sell shares is insufficient to attribute investment power to another. A counterparty can choose to hedge all, some or none of its short position and may do so by purchasing shares, entering into hedges or both. Therefore Judge Winter reasoned that, in the absence of some other agreement governing disposition of the shares, simply having a long position does not constitute having investment power either directly or indirectly. Voting Power – Rule 13d-3(a) As noted above, there is no evidence that TCI’s counterparties agreed to vote their CSX shares in accordance with the instructions of TCI, nor was this suggested at the original hearing. CSX argued that TCI selected its swap counterparties on the basis of which way TCI believed those counterparties would vote their shares. Judge Winter opined that voting power requires more than a belief or expectation that a party will vote in a certain way or the selection of a counterparty that is more inclined to vote in a manner favorable to the long party’s interests, even if coupled with evidence that the counterparty was chosen because it is viewed as holding sympathetic voting objectives; holding such views is not the same as having the ability to control voting. In reaching his conclusions as regards Rule 13d-3(a), Judge Winter focused particularly on the language of the Exchange Act and current SEC rules. Judge Winter pointed out that the language of the Exchange Act does not require disclosure of the intent to obtain control or an equity position of influence, but instead requires precise action. In Judge Winter’s view, the doctrine of harmonization of interpretation required him to look to interpretations of and case law related to Section 16 of the Exchange Act in interpreting Section 13(d), as both rely fundamentally on the concept of beneficial ownership.15 Judge Winter’s opinion focused on the fact that in 1991, the SEC harmonized Section 16’s interpretation of beneficial ownership with the corresponding provision of Section 13(d) and concluded that such case law should be used to interpret Section 13(d). In so interpreting, Judge Winter found a largely mechanical interpretation that does not focus on the “intent” of the actors. Avoidance Rule – Rule 13d-3(b) Judge Winter acknowledged that one purpose of total return swaps could be to avoid disclosure. However, he argued that a desire to avoid disclosure is not, in and of itself, sufficient to be caught by Rule 13d-3(b). Such desire must be coupled with the prevention of the vesting of beneficial ownership and that such evasion is not present where the swap provides no means of control. SEC Regulatory Authority In concluding, Judge Winter noted that in 2002, Congress16 stated that the SEC had no authority to regulate security-based swaps but that with the passing of the Dodd-Frank Act, the SEC now holds such authority. The Dodd-Frank Act came into force after the District Court’s 2008 decision. Judge Winter noted that the re-promulgation of Rule 13(d) by the SEC addressed SEC concerns that it previously had no authority to regulate security-based swaps and that without re-promulgation, Rule 13(d) would not apply unless the SEC exercised its authority under Section 13(o) of the Dodd-Frank Act. Judge Winter argues, therefore, that the District Court had no legal basis for deciding that Section 13(d) applied to the total return swaps as the SEC had no power at that time to regulate such instruments. It remains to be seen whether and how the SEC will finally clarify the issue by promulgating rules under its Section 766 powers or whether the District Court will revisit this issue when it reviews certain aspects of the case on remand. There remains as much uncertainty in the market regarding beneficial ownership issues around cash-settled equity total return swaps as existed both prior to the CSX case and the enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act. While it is clear that physically settled total return swaps trigger beneficial ownership in the underlying shares on the part of the long party, there is no bright-line rule as regards cash-settled total return swaps. What is PRINTED COPY FOR PERSONAL READING ONLY. NOT FOR DISTRIBUTION.December 2011 n Volume 31 n Issue 11 Futures & Derivatives Law Report © 2011 Thomson Reuters clear is that, until the SEC exercises its authority under Dodd-Frank, whether beneficial ownership attaches with respect to cash-settled equity total return swaps will be highly fact-specific. Holding the right to direct the voting of the underlying shares or to acquire such shares will tend to show that beneficial ownership exists; on the other hand, a specific provision in any documentation that specifically renounces all voting rights would tend to suggest the opposite. For now, long parties should exercise caution in exercising any sort of control over the underlying shares held by their counterparty. NOTES 1 Ian Cuillerier is a partner and Claire Hall is an associate in the derivatives practice of White & Case. Ian is based in the New York office and Claire is based in the Los Angeles office. 2 Alternatively, the short party may hedge by entering into an off-setting total return swap, or use a combination of the two approaches assuming the short party desires to hedge some or all of its position. 3 N ote that physically settled equity total return swaps were, and continue to be, covered by the UK disclosure regime and therefore a counterparty to a physically settled equity total return swap has disclosure obligations. 4 The UK requirements can be found in Chapter 5 of the UK Disclosure and Transparency Rules. 5 The definition of security-based swap was added to the Exchange Act by Section 761(a) of the Dodd-Frank Act and is defined as a swap on a narrow-based security index, a single security, loan or interest in a loan, or the occurrence or non-occurrence of an event relating to a single security or narrow-based security index that directly affects the financial statements, condition or obligations of the issuer; Section 712(d) of the Dodd Frank Act requires the SEC, together with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (the “CFTC”), to jointly further define certain terms, including the term “security-based swap.” The SEC and CFTC have published several notices of proposed rulemaking relating to such defined terms although final definitions have not yet been published. As drafted, the currently proposed definition of security-based swap would include a cash-settled equity total return swap. 6 Rule 13d-3(a). 7 Rule 13d-3(b). 8 See Beneficial Ownership Reporting Requirements and Security-Based Swaps, Release No. 34-64087 [76 FR 15874] and Beneficial Ownership Reporting Requirements and Security-Based Swaps Release No. 34–64628 [76 FR 34579]. 9 The Rule 13d-3 standards are applied on a caseby-case basis to determine whether a person is or becomes a beneficial owner. A physically settled trade or a cash-settled trade that specifically allows a long party to direct voting could be caught by the disclosure requirements and legal advice should be sought in each case. 10 As noted above, the long party typically has no voting rights over the underlying shares and the short party may not actually own the referenced shares. 11 From October 2006, TCI entered into total return swaps relating to approximately 14 percent of the outstanding common stock of CSX and over that time also accumulated a physical stake of about 4.2 percent. Separately, 3G built a combined physical and synthetic position in CSX of just less than 5 percent. 12 CSX Corp. v. The Children’s Investment Fund Management (UK) LLP et al., 562 F Supp 2d 511 (S.D.N.Y.) June 11, 2008). 13 A concurring opinion is one that agrees with the decision of the court, but sets out a judge’s personal view of certain aspects of the decision and such judge’s reasoning in reaching the decision. The majority opinion is binding law however, although a concurring opinion does not carry the same precedential weight as a majority opinion, it may be cited in future cases as guidance to the court. 14 It was accepted in the case that short counterparties generally do purchase the underlying shares as a means of hedging their short positions. 15 S ection 16 of the Exchange Act requires disclosure by certain company insiders that are beneficial owners of 10 percent of a company’s shares. 16 By way of the Commodity Futures Modernization Act of 2000 (the “2000 Act”).

affiliates from using your information to market to you
sharing for nonaffiliates to market to you


			State laws and individual companies may give you additional rights to limit sharing. See below for more information on your rights under state law.




What happens when I limit sharing for an account I hold jointly with someone else?

Legal and Disclosures
 
All investing is subject to risk, including the possible loss of the money you invest. Diversification and asset allocation does not ensure a profit or protect against a loss.
 
Forward Looking Statements
The statements made herein take into account information currently available as well as historical trends. However, any forward-looking statement involves known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause the actual performance of future markets to differ materially from the projections depicted here. There can be no certainty as to the extent or depth of any market downturn, nor any assurance regarding the nature, extent or timing of markets rebounding, and past performance cannot be relied upon for future performance. When evaluating the information included in this report, you are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which reflect judgments only as of the date of the materials creation.
 
Statements of Opinion Including Case Studies
The information and opinions expressed herein are obtained from sources believed to be reliable and up-to-date, however their accuracy and completeness cannot be guaranteed. Opinions expressed reflect judgment current as of the date of this publication and are subject to change. Opinions expressed are current as of the date of the materials and are subject to change.
The materials on this site should in no way be construed as investment advice nor a solicitation to buy or sell securities or insurance products and services. No investment actions should be implemented based on the materials presented herein.
 
Investment Risk
Investment involves risk. The value of an investment as well as income associated with investments is not guaranteed and may fluctuate. Accordingly, investments may decline below what was originally invested.
 
International Investing
International investing, especially in emerging markets, involves special risks, such as currency exchange, political and economic risks. 
Alternative Investments
Alternative Investments involve a higher degree of risk because they may engage in leveraging or other speculative investment practices that may increase the risk of investment loss. Alternative investments can also be highly illiquid.
 
REITs
REITs may be subject to greater volatility than investments in traditional securities and pose special risks. The value of real estate and portfolios that invest in real estate may fluctuate due to losses from causality or condemnation, changes in local and general economic conditions, supply and demand, interest rates, property taxes, and regulatory limitations on rents, zoning laws, and operating expenses.
 
Commodities
Commodities may be subject to greater volatility than securities and pose special risks. Investments in commodities may be affected by changes in interest rates, and other factors such as weather, disease, embargoes and international economic and political developments.
 
High Yield Bonds
High yield bonds are lower grade bonds whose principal may be subject to greater fluctuation than investments in higher rated bonds. Use of these instruments may involve certain costs and risks such as liquidity risk, interest rate risk, and credit risk.
 
Indices
Index performance is shown as total return. You cannot invest directly in an index, but you can invest in securities that track an index. Index funds are weighted and so may not perform in unison with the index.
 
Professional Designations

Legal and Disclosures
 
All investing is subject to risk, including the possible loss of the money you invest. Diversification and asset allocation does not ensure a profit or protect against a loss.
 
Forward Looking Statements
The statements made herein take into account information currently available as well as historical trends. However, any forward-looking statement involves known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause the actual performance of future markets to differ materially from the projections depicted here. There can be no certainty as to the extent or depth of any market downturn, nor any assurance regarding the nature, extent or timing of markets rebounding, and past performance cannot be relied upon for future performance. When evaluating the information included in this report, you are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which reflect judgments only as of the date of the materials creation.
 
Statements of Opinion Including Case Studies
The information and opinions expressed herein are obtained from sources believed to be reliable and up-to-date, however their accuracy and completeness cannot be guaranteed. Opinions expressed reflect judgment current as of the date of this publication and are subject to change. Opinions expressed are current as of the date of the materials and are subject to change.
The materials on this site should in no way be construed as investment advice nor a solicitation to buy or sell securities or insurance products and services. No investment actions should be implemented based on the materials presented herein.
 
Investment Risk
Investment involves risk. The value of an investment as well as income associated with investments is not guaranteed and may fluctuate. Accordingly, investments may decline below what was originally invested.
 
International Investing
International investing, especially in emerging markets, involves special risks, such as currency exchange, political and economic risks. 
Alternative Investments
Alternative Investments involve a higher degree of risk because they may engage in leveraging or other speculative investment practices that may increase the risk of investment loss. Alternative investments can also be highly illiquid.
 
REITs
REITs may be subject to greater volatility than investments in traditional securities and pose special risks. The value of real estate and portfolios that invest in real estate may fluctuate due to losses from causality or condemnation, changes in local and general economic conditions, supply and demand, interest rates, property taxes, and regulatory limitations on rents, zoning laws, and operating expenses.
 
Commodities
Commodities may be subject to greater volatility than securities and pose special risks. Investments in commodities may be affected by changes in interest rates, and other factors such as weather, disease, embargoes and international economic and political developments.
 
High Yield Bonds
High yield bonds are lower grade bonds whose principal may be subject to greater fluctuation than investments in higher rated bonds. Use of these instruments may involve certain costs and risks such as liquidity risk, interest rate risk, and credit risk.
 
Indices
Index performance is shown as total return. You cannot invest directly in an index, but you can invest in securities that track an index. Index funds are weighted and so may not perform in unison with the index.

Legal and Disclosures
 
All investing is subject to risk, including the possible loss of the money you invest. Diversification and asset allocation does not ensure a profit or protect against a loss.
 
Forward Looking Statements
The statements made herein take into account information currently available as well as historical trends. However, any forward-looking statement involves known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause the actual performance of future markets to differ materially from the projections depicted here. There can be no certainty as to the extent or depth of any market downturn, nor any assurance regarding the nature, extent or timing of markets rebounding, and past performance cannot be relied upon for future performance. When evaluating the information included in this report, you are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which reflect judgments only as of the date of the materials creation.
 
Statements of Opinion Including Case Studies
The information and opinions expressed herein are obtained from sources believed to be reliable and up-to-date, however their accuracy and completeness cannot be guaranteed. Opinions expressed reflect judgment current as of the date of this publication and are subject to change. Opinions expressed are current as of the date of the materials and are subject to change.
The materials on this site should in no way be construed as investment advice nor a solicitation to buy or sell securities or insurance products and services. No investment actions should be implemented based on the materials presented herein.
 
Investment Risk
Investment involves risk. The value of an investment as well as income associated with investments is not guaranteed and may fluctuate. Accordingly, investments may decline below what was originally invested.
 
International Investing
International investing, especially in emerging markets, involves special risks, such as currency exchange, political and economic risks. 
Alternative Investments
Alternative Investments involve a higher degree of risk because they may engage in leveraging or other speculative investment practices that may increase the risk of investment loss. Alternative investments can also be highly illiquid.
 
REITs
REITs may be subject to greater volatility than investments in traditional securities and pose special risks. The value of real estate and portfolios that invest in real estate may fluctuate due to losses from causality or condemnation, changes in local and general economic conditions, supply and demand, interest rates, property taxes, and regulatory limitations on rents, zoning laws, and operating expenses.
 
Commodities
Commodities may be subject to greater volatility than securities and pose special risks. Investments in commodities may be affected by changes in interest rates, and other factors such as weather, disease, embargoes and international economic and political developments.
 
High Yield Bonds
High yield bonds are lower grade bonds whose principal may be subject to greater fluctuation than investments in higher rated bonds. Use of these instruments may involve certain costs and risks such as liquidity risk, interest rate risk, and credit risk.
 
Indices
Index performance is shown as total return. You cannot invest directly in an index, but you can invest in securities that track an index. Index funds are weighted and so may not perform in unison with the index.
 
Professional Designations

Legal and Disclosures
 
All investing is subject to risk, including the possible loss of the money you invest. Diversification and asset allocation does not ensure a profit or protect against a loss.
 
Forward Looking Statements
The statements made herein take into account information currently available as well as historical trends. However, any forward-looking statement involves known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause the actual performance of future markets to differ materially from the projections depicted here. There can be no certainty as to the extent or depth of any market downturn, nor any assurance regarding the nature, extent or timing of markets rebounding, and past performance cannot be relied upon for future performance. When evaluating the information included in this report, you are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which reflect judgments only as of the date of the materials creation.
 
Statements of Opinion Including Case Studies
The information and opinions expressed herein are obtained from sources believed to be reliable and up-to-date, however their accuracy and completeness cannot be guaranteed. Opinions expressed reflect judgment current as of the date of this publication and are subject to change. Opinions expressed are current as of the date of the materials and are subject to change.
The materials on this site should in no way be construed as investment advice nor a solicitation to buy or sell securities or insurance products and services. No investment actions should be implemented based on the materials presented herein.
 
Investment Risk
Investment involves risk. The value of an investment as well as income associated with investments is not guaranteed and may fluctuate. Accordingly, investments may decline below what was originally invested.
 
International Investing
International investing, especially in emerging markets, involves special risks, such as currency exchange, political and economic risks. 
Alternative Investments
Alternative Investments involve a higher degree of risk because they may engage in leveraging or other speculative investment practices that may increase the risk of investment loss. Alternative investments can also be highly illiquid.
 
REITs
REITs may be subject to greater volatility than investments in traditional securities and pose special risks. The value of real estate and portfolios that invest in real estate may fluctuate due to losses from causality or condemnation, changes in local and general economic conditions, supply and demand, interest rates, property taxes, and regulatory limitations on rents, zoning laws, and operating expenses.
 
Commodities
Commodities may be subject to greater volatility than securities and pose special risks. Investments in commodities may be affected by changes in interest rates, and other factors such as weather, disease, embargoes and international economic and political developments.
 
High Yield Bonds
High yield bonds are lower grade bonds whose principal may be subject to greater fluctuation than investments in higher rated bonds. Use of these instruments may involve certain costs and risks such as liquidity risk, interest rate risk, and credit risk.
 
Indices
Index performance is shown as total return. You cannot invest directly in an index, but you can invest in securities that track an index. Index funds are weighted and so may not perform in unison with the index.
 
Professional Designations
CFP
Certified Financial Planner Board of Standards Inc. owns the certification marks CFP®, CERTIFIED FINANCIAL PLANNER™ and federally registered CFP (with flame design) in the U.S., which it awards to individuals who successfully complete CFP Board's initial and ongoing certification requirements.

In the face of political changes around the world, clear-sighted leadership and robust coalitions are needed now more than ever to deliver the Sustainable Development Goals. For the first time, we are articulating multi-year intent and resourcing, as well as a way of doing business that we think reflects our appetite for performance.

We can slow global warming and sea-level rise by reducing super climate pollutants called hydrofluorocarbons or HFCs. Cutting HFCs will avoid half a degree of global warming by the end of the century. This would be a big contribution to the historic 2015 Paris Agreement. Find out more about reducing HFCs and why it matters with this video which is narrated by Durwood Zaelke of the Institute of Governance and Sustainable Development.

The Children's Investment Fund Management

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


					Jump to:					navigation, 					search

The Children’s Investment Fund Management (UK) LLP (TCI) is a London‐based hedge fund management firm founded by Chris Hohn in 2003 which manages The Children’s Investment Master Fund. TCI makes long‐term investments in companies globally. The management company is authorized and regulated in the United Kingdom by the Financial Services Authority.
Like most hedge funds, TCI requires investors to commit their capital for multi-year periods. This long-term horizon allows the fund greater flexibility when trading and investing capital independent of any potential ad hoc time constraints.

Charity[edit]
Main article: The Children's Investment Fund Foundation
TCI derives its name from a charitable foundation called The Children's Investment Fund Foundation (CIFF), set up by Chris Hohn and his ex-wife, Jamie Cooper-Hohn. In an example of "venture philanthropy", CIFF initially received a portion of TCI’s profits and other donations. CIFF focuses on improving the lives of children living in poverty in developing countries, and has grown to be one of the largest charities in the United Kingdom. After suffering a 43% loss during the 2008 calendar year, as of July 2009 the previous financial year had seen a rebound of over 70% profit and revenue for TCI.[1]
Through changes set in motion in 2012, the fund and foundation were split up. The fund no longer donates money to the foundation on a contractual basis, though it may do on a discretionary basis.[2]
Investor activism[edit]
TCI has a reputation for aggressive shareholder activism.[3] Some critics[who?] believe that it has taken an active role in most situations to promote its own agenda under the guise of sound corporate governance and increase shareholder value. TCI has been a major shareholder of the German stock exchange Deutsche Börse where it forced the resignation of the CEO after he refused to abandon his plan to take over the London Stock Exchange. In 2007, after acquiring 1% of the shares of major Dutch bank ABN AMRO, TCI led an attack demanding the bank split up or sell to the highest bidder to produce shareholder value.[4] ABN was ultimately split and sold to Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS), Fortis, and Banco Santander and was a major contributing factor in the downfall of both RBS and Fortis. In June 2007, TCI failed in its attempt to get the Japanese utility J-Power, in which it had acquired a 10% stake, to boost its dividend. The general meeting of shareholders rejected the proposal, prompting a severe selloff in the stock.
In 2006, as a shareholder of both Mittal Steel Company and Arcelor, TCI supported Mittal Steel in the company's unsolicited takeover offer for Arcelor. However, when Mittal Steel subsequently attempted to acquire Arcelor Brasil (one of Arcelor's subsidiaries) without an appropriate premium, TCI defended the rights of Arcelor Brasil’s minority shareholders, causing Mittal to raise its offer price more than 55%.[citation needed]
TCI initiated legal action against the Government of India using provisions in the bilateral trade treaty between United Kingdom and India regarding the under pricing of coal by Coal India Limited,in which TCI holds 1% stake.[5]
In 2008 the company was suffering from heavy losses but recovered very well and assets under management reportedly stood around $6 billion earlier this year, and at the end of 2010, the company recorded a loss of 80% in profits as a result of reduced investment performance.[6]
Awards[edit]
The fund won Eurohedge’s European Hedge Fund of the Year award in 2004, 2005,[7] 2013[8]

CIFF is reinventing itself. Not because we have changed our mission, but because we have decided to be bolder. Whatever the challenges, we are determined to help solve some of the biggest problems facing children. In the face of political changes around the world, clear-sighted leadership and robust coalitions are needed now more than ever to deliver the Sustainable Development Goals. For the first time, we are articulating multi-year intent and resourcing, as well as a way of doing business that we think reflects our appetite for performance.

The Children's Investment Fund Management

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


					Jump to:					navigation, 					search

The Children’s Investment Fund Management (UK) LLP (TCI) is a London‐based hedge fund management firm founded by Chris Hohn in 2003 which manages The Children’s Investment Master Fund. TCI makes long‐term investments in companies globally. The management company is authorized and regulated in the United Kingdom by the Financial Services Authority.
Like most hedge funds, TCI requires investors to commit their capital for multi-year periods. This long-term horizon allows the fund greater flexibility when trading and investing capital independent of any potential ad hoc time constraints.

Charity[edit]
Main article: The Children's Investment Fund Foundation
TCI derives its name from a charitable foundation called The Children's Investment Fund Foundation (CIFF), set up by Chris Hohn and his ex-wife, Jamie Cooper-Hohn. In an example of "venture philanthropy", CIFF initially received a portion of TCI’s profits and other donations. CIFF focuses on improving the lives of children living in poverty in developing countries, and has grown to be one of the largest charities in the United Kingdom. After suffering a 43% loss during the 2008 calendar year, as of July 2009 the previous financial year had seen a rebound of over 70% profit and revenue for TCI.[1]
Through changes set in motion in 2012, the fund and foundation were split up. The fund no longer donates money to the foundation on a contractual basis, though it may do on a discretionary basis.[2]
Investor activism[edit]
TCI has a reputation for aggressive shareholder activism.[3] Some critics[who?] believe that it has taken an active role in most situations to promote its own agenda under the guise of sound corporate governance and increase shareholder value. TCI has been a major shareholder of the German stock exchange Deutsche Börse where it forced the resignation of the CEO after he refused to abandon his plan to take over the London Stock Exchange. In 2007, after acquiring 1% of the shares of major Dutch bank ABN AMRO, TCI led an attack demanding the bank split up or sell to the highest bidder to produce shareholder value.[4] ABN was ultimately split and sold to Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS), Fortis, and Banco Santander and was a major contributing factor in the downfall of both RBS and Fortis. In June 2007, TCI failed in its attempt to get the Japanese utility J-Power, in which it had acquired a 10% stake, to boost its dividend. The general meeting of shareholders rejected the proposal, prompting a severe selloff in the stock.
In 2006, as a shareholder of both Mittal Steel Company and Arcelor, TCI supported Mittal Steel in the company's unsolicited takeover offer for Arcelor. However, when Mittal Steel subsequently attempted to acquire Arcelor Brasil (one of Arcelor's subsidiaries) without an appropriate premium, TCI defended the rights of Arcelor Brasil’s minority shareholders, causing Mittal to raise its offer price more than 55%.[citation needed]
TCI initiated legal action against the Government of India using provisions in the bilateral trade treaty between United Kingdom and India regarding the under pricing of coal by Coal India Limited,in which TCI holds 1% stake.[5]
In 2008 the company was suffering from heavy losses but recovered very well and assets under management reportedly stood around $6 billion earlier this year, and at the end of 2010, the company recorded a loss of 80% in profits as a result of reduced investment performance.[6]
Awards[edit]
The fund won Eurohedge’s European Hedge Fund of the Year award in 2004, 2005,[7] 2013[8]

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
