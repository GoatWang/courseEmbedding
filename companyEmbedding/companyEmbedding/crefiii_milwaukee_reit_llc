Selected Assignments
Valbridge Property Advisors has seen and done it all — providing valuations and evaluations of all types of commercial and other properties. The assignments noted below suggest Valbridge's range of experience across the U.S.:

Valued a portfolio of 21 investment-grade office and R&D properties for a major university endowment undergoing an audit. Five Valbridge offices in multiple states participated in the assignment, providing consistent work product and single-point-of-contact service to the fund manager.


Appraised five data centers for a top national wireless telecommunications company engaged in hotly contested lease renewal negotiations with multiple landlords in various submarkets.


Valued an office complex containing 1.7 million square feet of Class A space within five skyway-connected office towers occupied by more than 85 tenants. The overall site features landmark-quality architecture and a range of amenities and walking trails. All the buildings are Energy Star certified, with some LEED rated. In conducting the valuation for the owner, we carefully considered the buildings’ energy operating performance.


Performed a market and feasibility study for the owner of a 14-acre suburban site to determine the highest and best use of the property, including demand for for-sale or for-lease residential units based on market occupancy, projected absorption and estimated sales prices and asking rents. Evaluated 31 comparable properties in addition to the overall market, and analyzed the option of holding the site for future development versus developing the site immediately.


Appraised a 312,000 square foot warehouse facility owned by a national REIT and leased to a single tenant in the beverage business. The valuation was part of a comprehensive portfolio review for REIT management.


Valued an apartment portfolio including 7,200 units in 37 communities. We were hired by a fractional-interest owner concerned about estate administration. First, we valued the portfolio overall to determine the net asset value. Second, we evaluated the operating entity agreement to analyze issues related to control, transferability and distributions (including historical distributions).


Appraised a 225,000 square foot, 14-acre site including warehouse and office space for a large regional commercial bank considering a mortgage loan for a new buyer of the property.


Appraised a portfolio of 11 fast-food restaurants including the land and the buildings for the purchase and sale of a partnership interest. The sites are located in two states.


Valued a Masonic temple that is an historic building, including a 2,300-seat auditorium, frescos and statues, in a central urban area. We helped the owner identify other potential community and cultural uses for the iconic property, recognizing that many religious and fraternal organizations nationally are experiencing demographic changes and declines in membership and, thus, are exploring strategic asset management opportunities.


Appraised an 802,000 square foot steel mill operated by the U.S. arm of an international manufacturer. The owner challenged the local government’s assessment of the property value. Our report resulted in a reduction of the owner’s tax liability.


Valued a six-acre industrial property including a bus storage and maintenance facility to help the owner determine the appropriate building lease rate and the land value. We enabled the owner to compare the income-generating power of the property over time to the benefits of an outright property sale.


Appraised a lake and surrounding buffer zone for a recently deregulated power company. The assignment results compelled the state to purchase the lakebed and buffer zone from the utility to secure the lake as a public asset. Individual property owners with adjacent sites were then offered the opportunity to buy down to the waterfront, allowing those owners to control their frontage and stabilize their property values.

You can think of these as two different company structures with very different tax requirements. Whichever way you choose to go, you're going to look more legit than the other guys. So just take a minute to consider your short-and long-term business goals to figure out which structure is best for you.
Advantages and Disadvantages
A limited liability company is a type of business structure that offers personal liability protections and a few tax advantages to boot. The "LL" in LLC is what protects your personal assets in the event of a judgment against your company. Corporations offer limited liability as well, so we're going to focus on the structural and taxation differences in the chart below.



Advantages of an LLC
Advantages of a Corporation




 No limit on the number of owners
 May issue shares of stock to attract investors


 Profit and loss are passed through to the owners' individual tax returns
 Corporate income splitting may help lower overall tax liability


 No annual meeting or minute book requirements
 






Disadvantages of an LLC
Disadvantages of a Corporation




 Cannot engage in corporate income splitting to lower tax liability
 C corp tax structure requires double taxation of corporate profits (s corp's does not)


 Cannot issue stock
 Must hold annual meetings and record minutes


 
 S corporations have restrictions on the number of owners



LLC or Corporation: Which One Is Right for Me?
Business goals aren't one size fits all, and neither is incorporating. When deciding which kind of corporation fits your business strategy, consider some of the differences that each kind offers. And take a deeper dive with our comprehensive comparison chart.
Find out which corporation is right for your business with our business wizard!

Along with picking the right entity type for your business, it's important to consider which state to incorporate in.
For most small business owners, the choice is simple: they incorporate in the state where their company is physically located, known as 'home state incorporation.' However, there are good reasons to consider forming your corporation or LLC in certain other states, including tax advantages, streamlined judicial processes, and easier business filing requirements.
For example, many business owners choose to incorporate in Delaware, which is a favored business jurisdiction for the previously mentioned and other reasons.

Delaware is widely considered to be one of the nation's most business-friendly jurisdictions. There are a number of reasons to incorporate your small business in Delaware, including:

Well-established and flexible business laws
Low franchise tax on small businesses
No tax on capital stock or assets
No state sales tax
A special business court (Court of Chancery) that minimizes the time and cost of commercial litigation
No residency requirement for shareholders, directors, and officers of a corporation or members or managers of an LLC

Creating an LLC
The Ws of Forming an LLC: Who, What, Where, When & Why
Form my LLC










Creating an LLC: Six Simple Steps
Starting your Limited Liability Company
If you want to start a business, forming a Limited Liability Company — or LLC — could be a great choice. LLCs are designed to be simple and inexpensive to setup, and are easy to run. They have many of the advantages of larger businesses and corporations without all of the rules, regulations and legal compliance commonly found with other business entities. LLCs are registered with the government in your state.
Advantages of an LLC
LLCs have many benefits for businesses, especially small businesses and startups.

LLCs are quick and easy — the paperwork involved in setting up an LLC is simple to complete, and you can complete the whole process, fast.
An LLC limits your “personal liability” — that means any liabilities your business has (debts, obligations and other liabilities) belong to it alone. Typically, even as the business owner, you will not be liable for your LLC's obligations.
LLCs are easy to maintain — you don’t need to hold annual general meetings, assign boards of directors or meet particularly onerous rules and regulations.
Flexibility and control over the LLC — LLCs are easy to manage — you can add and amend members and make other changes without too much paperwork.
LLC taxes are simple — any income earned by your LLC “flows through” to your personal tax return and is taxed as normal. Members report any profits or losses from the LLC on their personal tax returns. This can keep your accounting costs down.
You won’t be “double taxed” — some corporations have to pay tax on their profits and then individuals pay tax again when they receive stock dividends. LLC members are not subject to this double taxation.

How to Setup Your New LLC Business
There are six easy steps you need to take when setting up an LLC:
1. Name Your LLC
First, you’ll need to create an original name for your new business. This should be something distinctive that wouldn’t be confused with the name of another business or LLC. You will need to include a “designator” in the name of your business to show it’s an LLC.
This is normally through including a suffix of “LLC” or “Limited Company.” For example: Blue Widget Manufacturing, LLC or Bob Baker and Sons, Limited Company.
If you're looking for help with searching for your LLC name to see if it's taken, we've put together How to Search & Choose Your Business Entity Name in all 50 States.
2. Provide the Address for Your New LLC
Each LLC will need to have a designated business address. If you’re running a company from home, this can be the same as your home address. If you’re renting office space, it can be where your office is located. If you have multiple locations, it would be the address where your “head office” is. This will vary as some states will permit a PO Box.
3. Assign a Registered Agent for Your LLC
Every LLC must have a registered agent. For small LLCs, this is generally the same person as the managing director or owner. 
For small LLCs, this is generally the same person as the managing director or owner. The member — or owner — of an LLC can also serve as the registered agent, but some members will prefer to assign those responsibilities to another individual or company. The registered agent is simply the person who receives official legal and tax correspondence.
All of our online business formation packages include a “registered agent” service free for the first year and $99 per year thereafter.
4. Provide the Names and Addresses of LLC Members
The LLC members are typically the people who own and run the business. They are also the ones who can take profits out of the business to pay themselves. Most states require you to list the names and addresses of all members when you register the LLC. You can register these addresses as street addresses or P.O. boxes.
5. State the Purpose of Your LLC
Some states require you to explain the purpose of your company. This does not limit you to engaging solely in that type of business — It's fine to expand into new areas later on.
6. File the Articles of Organization
Once you've gathered all the information together for your LLC, you’ll need to file formal documents with your state agency. We can do this on your behalf.
For more information on the steps you need to follow when starting your LLC, see Incfile's Help Center post on steps to starting a Limited Liability Company (LLC).
Who Can Form an LLC?
Most people in good legal standing are able to form an LLC. You should consider creating an LLC if you want to limit your personal liability and personal exposure. Forming an LLC protects your personal assets from any claims or debts your business has against it.
It’s important to note that not all businesses can operate as LLCs. For example, businesses dealing with banking or insurance are typically prevented from forming as an LLC. There are also restrictions from state to state, for example California prevents some types of professionals from starting LLCs. To learn more about the specific regulations in your state when starting your LLC, check out Incfile's complete LLC state information.
Where to Form an LLC
Generally speaking, if you plan to conduct business in your home state, it makes sense to form your LLC there. Although there can be some advantages to forming an LLC in Delaware, Nevada or other “business friendly” states, in most cases those benefits won’t apply to your LLC.
Additionally, you will need to file as a “Foreign LLC” if you conduct business in other states. So if, for example, you incorporate in Delaware and then conduct business in North Carolina, you’d have to file (and pay fees to) the NC government.
When to Form an LLC
The best time to form an LLC is right now. When it comes to starting a business, you will have dozens of things on your mind as a new entrepreneur. Taking a few minutes right now to make sure you form your business properly will give you peace of mind, and let you get on with growing into a thriving company.
Ongoing Responsibilities for an LLC
Once your LLC is formed, you will have ongoing responsibilities you need to carry out. These include:

Filing an annual report with your state’s Secretary of State.
Reporting income earned (or lost) by your LLC on your personal tax return. Each member of an LLC will need to do this. If you're interested in how to save even more tax money by filing as an S Corporation, check out our S Corporation Tax Calculator.
Providing business reports as needed to other LLC members (this is not a legal; requirement, just best practice.)

You will also want to explore other common areas when starting a new business such as understanding any rules and regulations pertaining to your industry and getting appropriate insurance in place.
How to Form an LLC without Breaking the Bank
IncFile provides a cost effective service to help you create your LLC. We guide you through the process and handle most of the administrative steps, such as filing the articles of organization, on your behalf. Our basic package also provides a free registered agent service for the first year. If you're looking for help to start an LLC, our comprehensive online formation services provide outstanding value.

Commonly Asked Questions for starting an LLC





 How is an LLC Taxed?

For federal income tax purposes the profits of an LLC (Limited Liability Company) "pass through" to the personal income of the members/owners. In the case of a single member LLC it is taxed the same as a sole proprietorship (i.e. typically filed on the schedule C of the owner's personal income tax filing). In the case of a multi member member it is taxed the same as a partnership (i.e. a 1065 partnership return is filed with the IRS, with a schedule K-1 being supplied to each partner/member showing the proportional profit/loss allocated to them, with this being filed on the schedule C or E). 
NOTE: These are general tax explanations and may not apply to everyone. You should confer with the appropriate accounting/tax specialists to make sure you understand your personal tax liability.



 What is the Management Structure of an LLC?

An LLC is typically managed by its members/owners (referred to as member-managed). In that respect an LLC is unlike a corporation, which has a much more rigid and defined management structure, including directors and officers. All owners of the LLC are typically referred to as members, and they can have control and voting interest proportional to their ownership interest, or in proportions different from their ownership interest; however the members agree.



 Are Non-US Residents allowed to own a Corporation of LLC?

There are no citizenship or residence requirements for ownership of a C Corporation or an LLC. The S Corporation however does not allow nonresident aliens to be shareholders (owner), but any US citizen or resident alien may be a shareholder (owner). You would, of course, require an in state street address for the state to forward official legal and tax correspondence including service of process, known as the registered agent address, but neither residency nor citizenship is required for ownership of a C Corporation or an LLC.





 Can I form an LLC with just one member?

There was a time when almost every state required the LLC to have two or more members, but that is no longer the case. This important change came in response to revised IRS regulations that clearly permitted single-member LLCs. As a result, in most states, if you plan to be the sole owner of a business and you wish to limit your personal liability, you can choose between forming a corporation or an LLC.



 What is an Operating Agreement?

The operating agreement is akin to a partnership agreement for a General Partnership or Limited Liability Partnership (LLP). It is an internal contract amongst the members/owners of the LLC, and it lays out such things as ownership interest, member responsibilities, accounting method, adding or removing members, terms for concluding the LLC, etc. It is generally not required by a given state for forming an LLC (with the exception of New York), although it is certainly recommended. When dealing with private companies for financing issues (loans, mortgages, etc.) it may be required by that company. A customizable operating agreement is included with the LLC/Corp Kit.



 Can another business entity be a member of an LLC?

In the majority of states, The members of an LLC can be individuals, corporations, or other LLCs. These members of the LLC can be out of state residents or even foreign nationals. Furthermore there is no limit to the amount of members that an LLC can have.
The flexibility of an LLC in contrast to an S Corporation is stark considering the S corporations are limited to 75 shareholders who must either be United States citizens or Lawful Permanent Residents.

CL-1 Preparation & filing of the Initial Annual Report.




When filing for a corporation in South Carolina, the SC Secretary of State requires that an initial annual report be filed along with the necessary corporate charter documents. This initial report is the Form CL-1, and the state charges a fee of $25 for this in addition to the standard state corporate filing fee. We prepare and submit the Form CL-1 along with the Articles of Incorporation and all fees as required by the state for your new corporation.


























Preparation & filing of the Initial Annual Report




When filing for a new business in Washington, the WA Secretary of State requires that an initial annual report be filed along with the necessary corporate charter documents.

We prepare and submit the initial Annual Report along with the Articles of Incorporation and all fees as required by the state for your new business entity.


























IRS Form 2553 Preparation



The 2553 Form, known as the Subchapter S election (or Election for Small Business), is required to be filed with the IRS to obtain S-Corporation status for purposes of federal taxation.

IncFile.com will prepare the form and forward it to you (as it requires the signatures of the initial shareholders), along with instructions that include where to sign and submit the form.

IMPORTANT: Please note the Form 2553 is time sensitive and must be filed with the IRS within 75 days of your corporation filing date in order to obtain S-corporation tax status for the current year.



























NYS Form CT-6 Preparation



Unlike most states, New York has a state level of S-Corporation tax status, similar to the Federal S-corporation tax status. A Federal S-corporation may (but is not required to) elect to be taxed as a New York S-corporation by filing Form CT‑6 . When S-corporation is selected as the entity type, IncFile.com will also prepare the form CT-6 for your corporation, along with the Federal S-corporation election, free of charge. NOTE: The form will require the signature(s) of the initial shareholders. IncFile.com will prepare this form and return it to you with your filed corporation, and it will just need to be signed and dated where indicated, and submitted to the state (included with the instructions).

IMPORTANT: Please note the Form CT-6 is time sensitive and must be filed with the the state within 75 days of your corporation filing date in order to obtain the NYS S-corporation tax status for the current year.

Why Thousands of 
Small Business Owners Choose Incfile
Scroll Down






Deciding on a company formation service can be very confusing and seemingly overwhelming process.

There are a multitude of companies on the web that perform the function of starting new entities and each has its own unique offerings and packages that
can potentially you make feel that they are comparing apples to oranges. Although our modesty prohibits us from claiming that we are the best listed
below are some of the distinguishing features that we think separate us from other companies.











#1. Value – Nobody gives you more for less!



 .. more


First and foremost our basic price of a new entity formation is $49 plus state filing fees and although you may find companies claiming to do it
for less you have to be aware that many of these companies only prepare the documents and mail them to you. 
Our service is end to end we prepare your documents file them with the state and only deliver everything to you only after the company has
been filed and if for any reason we cannot get your filed we will issue a full refund to you. 
less












#2. Registered Agent Service - 1st Year Free!



 .. more


Each of our 3 packages include a 1 free year of registered agent service, if you do not need us to act as your registered agent you are not
obliged to do so and you can name yourself or whomever you wish. 
After the first year you have the option to renew the registered agent service for the annual price of $99. We do not ever under any circumstance
charge your payment card automatically if you decide to renew you will need to enter the site and process the renewal with your payment
information.
We only point this out because there are companies that will offer the registered agent service for a pre specified time lets say 6 weeks or 3
months and then auto charge your payment card for whatever there annual fee is and then keep charging every year thereafter going forward making
the assumption that the company is still active or that you have not changed the agent on file with the state.
less












#3. Transparency



 .. more


We have dedicated much time and effort to make sure that you know exactly what not only the final cost of your formation will be throughout the
order process but we also make sure that you are aware of any additional post filing fees that the state may require of you after the formation
is complete.
On the first page of our order process you will see a link at the towards the top of the page that will present itself after the state and entity
type have been selected titled "[State] Compulsory Filing Requirements".
We strongly urge you to review this link as many states i.e. Nevada exercise very expensive fees that are due within a close proximity to the
entity being filed. The link will also inform you what the annual fees and requirements for keeping the company active will be as most states
require the entity to file document known as an annual report or franchise tax, we will let you know when it is due and what it will cost. 
less












#4. Notifications



 .. more


All of our packages include lifetime notification alerts as long as we have a valid email we will also send email alerts informing our clients of
important filing dates regarding their entities. These emails are sent on a schedule that will allow you to know when an annual report or
franchise tax report is due so that you can avoid missing important filing dates. 
less












#5. Internal Documents



 .. more


It is very important that clients understand that the company formation process is more than just filing the articles of organization /
incorporation with the state. Depending on the state in which the company is filed some states may not list the members of an LLC or the
Directors and Shareholders of a corporation.
We create custom Operating Agreements for the LLLC which will list the name and percentage of ownership for each member. In addition we also
create custom bylaws and organizational meeting minutes for corporations which list the names of the Directors and Shareholders as well as the
number of shares that each shareholder owns.
The internal documents stated above are in addition to other custom documents as well such as the Statement of the Organizer / Incorporator and
banking resolutions. If changes need to be made to any of these documents we can also provide them to our clients in digital format so that they
can be customized as needed.
less












#6. Electronic Copies



 .. more


 We know that sometimes even the best organized person can misplace or lose important documents therefore we make sure to keep copies of every
filing in digital format should you need it in the future. 
less












#7. Privacy



 .. more


You can always rest assured that your personal information will remain such. We do not sell or solicit your information to any person or outside
business the only we will share any of your personal information with any outside agency is through the receipt of a subpoena.
Although we do have partners that we encourage our clients to use they will only be provided your contact information if you personally opt in.
We also do not store any payment card information in our database and scrape any other sensitive information from our site i.e. Social Security
Numbers from the database as soon as the order is completed
less












#8. Sales Practices



 .. more


We do not employ sales people any person that you speak to on the telephone regarding information about a new formation will always be
knowledgable long time employee or on of the owners of the company.
We only provide you with clear concise information that will allow you to make the best decision for your needs. Even though it is much more
profitable for us, we never have or will encourage our clients to form entities in states outside of the location where the business is
physically located as this practice adds further complexity to the process if additional steps are not taken and can leave the client exposed in
the event of litigation or the pursuance of additional licensing in the state of location.
We would strongly urge you to be wary of companies that compel you to form a business entity in this state or that state as this can have
detrimental consequences if the additional steps are not taken. Follow the link for more information regarding this
less












#9. Experience



 .. more


When we entered this industry in 2003, the landscape of competitors was completely different from the companies we see today. Through hard work and determination we weathered the incremental business cycles that all business are subject to and are still here today.
We have formed well over 100,000 companies and the majority of our staff has been with us since the beginning of the companies existence. What
that means for you is that you can rest assured that your documents will be handled by individuals who have vast knowledge and experience in
filing business entities and are familiar with the nuances of each of the 50 states.
less












#10. Humility



 .. more


At the end of the day we know that we are not perfect, we make mistakes sometimes its difficult to reach us on the phones and speak to a live
person. However if we do make a an error or fall short of expectations you can rest assured that we will do everything within in reason to
ensure that you leave a satisfied customer and have a positive experience.
Our goal is to provide to provide the most value at the lowest cost and the cost for that is that we cannot staff a pleather of call takers to
man the phones. If you do need to reach us immediately the best way to contact us for a prompt response is to use the messaging tool found at
the bottom right of each page of our site.
