The History
RE Dynasty, LLC is a multi-conglomerate holding and investing company with its headquarters being in Temple Hills, Maryland, along with other locations in Virginia and New York.The company was founded as MLM Inc. in March 2011, by long time friends Shacquan Robinson and Milton Poole but changed its name twice. Taking its present name in April 2016.In February 2011, RE Dynasty secured their first partnership with Team Beachbody - a Beachbody, LLC company, which until this day is still continuing on. This partnership has helped the Dynasty secure their position in the health and wellness and marketing industry for a long time. During the journey in the marketing industry, RE Dynasty began to increase their awareness throughout the United States. Working with clients from Maryland to California. RE Dynasty recently acquired and released other marketing projects just to further build recognition.Within the same year, RE Dynasty - then MLM, Inc. - entered into the music industry with Milton Poole acting as President of Mult-Level Music. This subsidiary was short lived, and Milton Poole branched off as "DJ Skrape" while still holding very close affiliation with Shacquan Robinson and RE Dynasty.In January 2013, Shacquan Robinson signed a partnership with Maker Studio, under the rights of MLM Inc. and the Youtube channel known as PlayBoyDre TV - Quan 2 Dope Entertainment, which quickly became a very popular vlog, fashion and subscriber request based channel. This partnership with Maker opened doors for Mr. Robinson and his agency. Partnering themselves with companies in music and tech industry. 50 Cent's SMS Audio, Apple Inc, iTunes. eMusic. Sirius XM Radio. An online tech company called HandHeldItems.com. Fashion industry companies such as Stacy Adams and SpreadShirt.com. Along with many more.This involvement in multiple industries and partnerships allowed for the company to enter into direct selling. But was placed on hold by Mr. Robinson.On June 1, 2015, Shacquan Robinson acquired the name as Robinson Enterprises after taking a bit of a fall in the fitness industry. This downfall placed the company on a major hold. Being though that at the time, fitness was the company's major business involvement. Mr. Robinson then transferred all rights, promotion and partnerships from MLM Inc. With this switch in names, a new approach was in order. With this approach, a partnership between Robinson Enterprises & Tiger Fitness was acquired.In March 2016, they announced the affiliation with an upcoming security agency in Washington DC, increasing the company's net worth by approx. 35%. On April 12, 2016, RE Dynasty acquired its fourth and current name and jumped directing into B2B marketing in the security industry. Acquiring over $40,000 in increased revenue.*See the meaning the name RE Dynasty*Later in the year, October 2016, the contract with the security agency ended and the company went on a short lived hiatus for a RE-evaluation. Shortly after, late November, RE Dynasty, LLC announced that they have created the Dynasty Emporium. The first subsidiary of RE Dynasty. Supplying consumers in multiple products through old and newly acquired partnerships, through eCommerce.RE Dynasty also announced its new service as a Notary Public for the State of Maryland, in late November.In January 2017, RE Dynasty acquired partnerships with Target, Adam & Eve Adult Shopping, and Lyft. They also Re-instated partnerships with iTunes and Tiger Fitness. The beta version of the company's website also went live. This beta site allowed for full consumer, business persons and visitor feedback to improve the site and the company itself. While also displaying the company's information and services.Also during the month of January. RE Dynasty, LLC acquired a 10% partnership with a local photography company. They also entered the housekeeping industry at undisclosed percentage with a Maryland based cleaning company. (Details still in the making).Late January, RE Dynasty acquired shares of SiriusXM Radio, Twitter and Sprint, Inc.Midway through February, RE Dynasty entered a partnership with a Swedish Fashion company called DeeWatches and a Chinese Gaming Company (details not yet published). Shortly after, Shacquan Robinson and the Dynasty became founding members of a New York based Marketing company called SelfMade.Talk of a new business venture with more foreign related companies were announced on RE Dynasty's Instagram and Twitter accounts as well. With ideas of returning to security.On March 1, 2017, RE Dynasty, LLC received an investment for over $20,000 from a private investor.

If this is your company...



We may be able to find you a more suitable carrier for your business insurance.  We have extensive data on carriers, their coverage, and company rates.  Rather than having an agent sell you, why not find which carrier is best for your business and approach them?  Contact Us to see if there is a better fit for your business.  We are not insurance agents, and are not trying to sell you anything.  We will simply tell you some carriers that may be better suited, and suggest agents in your area.

What is an Experience Mod Rating?



The Mod Rating is one of the two most important factors that effect a carrier's premium for workers comp insurance.  Each business in a state is provided a mod rating by the state's rating bureau which is a reflection of the amount of workers comp claims they have had.  If someone has an accident at work, your mod rating will increase and so will your premium.

What is an LCM?



A Loss Cost Multiplier, or LCM, is a rating for an insurance carrier that reflects their overhead in providing coverage for workers comp insurance.  It is one of the two main ratings that effect an insurance premium.  You are more likely to get a better premium from a carrier with a lower LCM, so it is important to know what your carrier's LCM is.  While a premium is generally the result of a formula, carriers are able to deviate plus or minus 25% from that formula.
