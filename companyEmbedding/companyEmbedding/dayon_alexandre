This report is not for commercial use. Thorough reviews have been conducted to assure this data accurately reflects disclosures. However for a complete and definitive understanding of the pay practices of any company, users should refer directly to the actual, complete proxy statement. 
Use of Data / Disclaimer
The information shown here is a reporting of information included in the company's proxy statement. The proxy statement includes footnotes and explanations of this information plus other information that is pertinent in assessing the overall value and appropriateness of the compensation information. For those interested in conducting a detailed compensation analysis, we recommend that you review the entire proxy statement. You may retrieve the full proxy statement by going to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) website at www.sec.gov and entering the company's name and then looking in the first column for an entry of "Form DEF 14A" (or any similar code). You may also find the annual proxy statement by going directly to the company's website.
What is a proxy statement?
A proxy statement (or "proxy") is a form that every publicly traded U.S. company is required to file with the U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) within 120 days after the end of its fiscal year. The proxy must be sent to every shareholder in advance of the company's annual shareholders meeting. All proxy statements are public filings made available to the general public by the SEC.
The proxy statement's main purpose is to alert shareholders to the annual meeting and provide them information about the issues that will be voted on during the annual meeting, including decisions such as electing directors, ratifying the selection of auditors, and other shareholder-related decisions, including shareholder-initiated initiatives. Also, proxies must disclose specific detailed information regarding the pay practices for certain executives.

LeWeb co-founder. Subscribe to my new newsletter http://leade.rs/loicnewsletterJan 14, 2016Alex Dayon, President, Products at Salesforce.comOwning your car is almost obsolete— lunch with Salesforce’s head of Product Alex DayonI had a very interesting lunch with Salesforce’s President of product and very good friend Alexandre Dayon.Look at the way car manufacturers work: they spend a ton designing and producing a car. Then they spend even more money on marketing and sales to sell it to you. Then they forget about you. Say you keep it for 3 to 5 years and you’re on the market again for a new car.Uber is making car ownership obsolete. Add the cost of the car to insurance, parking and maintenance and compare this to always using say UberX. In most cases you’re not far or Uber wins. Your car is in the garage most of the time just depreciating. So why still own a car?Because -sometimes- you need one. Like you go somewhere on a week-end or holidays. You have your family and stuff in it. Or like me, you’re kite-surfing and need your gear to stay in it in case you need to change your kite if the wind goes up. Or down.Alex showed me this Audi on demand app. Problem solved. Audi directly delivers any car to you (in San Francisco at least) and rents it per day. When you need it.Think about it for a second. You get it when you need it only. They are great cars. I just wish they would be electric or that Tesla would have the same service.This is Audi completely re-inventing its relationship to its customers and adapting to what they want now. Precisely. They want “now”. They don’t want to own, they want that cool car right now where they are only when they need it.Suddenly Audi has to know the customer and care about him in a few days again and not in 5 years. A total game changer.We talked how all large corporations are impacted by this new trend:on demandmobiletransparentreal timenon-stop relationship with the customer for life instead of “rarely” and I “sell you my product then forget about you”Alex also took the example of whole cities becoming transparent and getting information from their citizens in a crowdsourced way. Something is wrong on the street pavement? Report it in the Shiba city app in Japan and see workers fix it and post photos of the progress. See in real time how the whole city is managed and changing.This is fascinating. We’re living really exciting times.Thanks for sushi, too, Alex :-)If you liked reading this post, you might also enjoy my weekly newsletter where I describe my journey building my new startup.Share150Never miss a story from Loic Le Meur, when you sign up for Medium.
