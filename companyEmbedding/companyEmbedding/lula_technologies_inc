Lula Technologies, Inc. Wins SoFi Entrepreneur Program Pitch Competition at Babson
By Antonette Ho | November 2, 2016
Lula at SoFi Entrepreneur Program Pitch Competition
Undergraduate hatchery team Lula Technologies, Inc. (Matthew Vega-Sanz ’19 and Michael Vega-Sanz ’19) won the SoFi Entrepreneur Program Pitch Competition at Babson on October 24. Lula competed against four other graduate and undergraduate startups. The winner received a $2,000 cash prize from SoFi and automatic entry into the SoFi Entrepreneur Program. Congratulations to all participants!
 Lula Technologies, Inc.
Matthew Vega-Sanz ’19 and Michael Vega-Sanz ’19
Launching in Spring 2017, Lula is the only peer-to-peer car sharing platform for college students, and separates itself from competitors by eliminating the need for a sign up fee, annual or monthly commitment, and only requires the driver to pay for the time they are in possession of the car.
SoFi
At SoFi, we’re all about helping our members get rid of their student debt faster and reach that next goal—whatever it may be. Which means aside from great rates and big savings on student loan refi nancing, we offer a range of benefits. SoFi’s Entrepreneur Program is just one of those perks, offering founders and co-founders student loan deferment as well as access to investors, mentors, and press opportunities.

commercial door operators



DuraSwing™ 5 Full-Time Door Operator
The DuraSwing™ 5 is ideal for retrofit or new construction and automates all swing doors up to 4.0 feet wide. It is a header-mounted system, intended for high-traffic, full-time applications. However, the system can be configured for on-demand operation as well.

The DuraSwing™ 5 includes a hydraulic closing mechanism which allows it to work as an automatic door closer when the power is turned OFF. This operator is tested to exceed one million full-load open/close cycles. It includes three modular components and can be installed by a single person in an hour or less.

DuraSwing™ 4 On-Demand Door Operator
This swing door operator is also ideal for retrofit or new construction. It automates all exterior or interior swing doors up to 4.0 feet wide, including plate-glass frameless doors. The DuraSwing™ 4 is a jamb-mounted system that works with existing closers. The actuator arm does not connect to the door. It is subject to wear-and-tear only when activated.


This is truly an on-demand system that adds no resistance to normal door operation. Like the DuraSwing™ 5, this model is tested to one million cycles and is quite easy to install. 


The DuraSwing™ 4 can be weatherized with our WPK for outdoor use.

residential door operators



DuraSwing™ 4R On-Demand Door Operator
This model is ideal for interior and exterior doors up to 4 feet wide that latch when closed. It can operate in either an in-swing or out-swing configuration.

The DuraSwing™ 4R unlocks, power opens, holds open, power closes and re-locks the door. This header-mounted system consists of three modular components for easy installation and service.

The DuraSwing™ 4R comes standard with a wireless receiver, providing the capability to operate the door with a variety of hand-held remote transmitters. Up to four separate openers can be controlled by the remote. For example, the remote for a typical residential installation might operate the garage door, front door, plus two other doors.

Typical DuraSwing™ 4R kit components are shown in blue (right).


Unlike other residential door operators, the DuraSwing™ 4 can be weatherized with our WPK for outdoor use.

Elevators and Lift, Door & Gate Automation



DuraSwing™ 4 Series Door Operators for BFLD, SED, WED, Residential & LULA Elevators
Door Motion Technologies offers three applications for the DuraSwing™ 4 series product:

DuraSwing™ 4S
Safety gate (slide type) automation
DuraSwing™ 4C
Hatch door operation from the elevator or lift cab 
(cab-mounted)
DuraSwing™ 4H
Hatch door operation from the hall-side of the elevator shaft

The electronics and hardware vary slightly for each application. All three systems feature true microprocessor control, minimizing the need for manual adjustments and ensuring smooth and quiet operation.

While opening, the gate will reverse and shut down if obstructed. While closing, the gate will re-open, hold and attempt to close if obstructed. Obstruction sensitivity is programmable and force and opening width are adjustable.

The DuraSwing™ 4C is the most cost-effective, full automation application – particularly for LULA elevator types. For this application, both the safety gate and hatch door operators are mounted on the cab. This allows all in-line gates and doors to be operated by the cab-mounted equipment.
