StricklandMcGraw-Hill/Irwin, 2003 - Business & Economics - 450 pages 1 Reviewhttps://books.google.com/books/about/Strategic_management.html?id=zhK7AAAAIAAJThompson and Strickland's, Strategic Management, has always included the most recent research in strategy in a way that students can understand and apply it to business cases and problems. In addition, Thompson offers more coverage of strategy implementation than most other texts, which many instructors think is critical if students are to understand the “how” and not just the “what” and “why”. Thompson’s coverage of Michael Porter’s classic 5-forces model is clearer and more detailed than in other texts, according to reviewers. With this edition the market leader looks better than ever before, offering a new 4-color design, improved writing style, and two new chapters on global and e-commerce strategy. The Thompson and Strickland cases have always been another strong selling point. Over the years, this author team has developed a great network of case authors and is able to select from the cream of the crop. And, having taught the course themselves for many years, they are very experienced in selecting the types of cases that will spark student interest and generate lively classroom discussions. Many of the cases reflect high profile companies, products, and people that students will have heard of, know about from personal experience, or can easily identify with. The new case line-up features an exciting collection of dot.com/New Economy companies. Cases are further selected to highlight other critical types of business and trends, such as non-U.S. companies, globalization, cross-cultural situations, relatively small, entrepreneurial firms, non-profit organizations, and more.

About J. Strickland & Co.



J. Strickland & Co.


Ethnic Hair Care, Skin Care And Cosmetics Since 1936
Welcome to J. Strickland & Co. manufacturer of ethnic hair care, skin care & cosmetics. We have been manufacturing ethnic hair care, skin care and cosmetics since 1936. Since September of that year our founder, the late Mr. George B. Long, borrowed $500 to start his own business, J. Strickland & Co. has operated on the policy “To give value for money and to make a product for less.”
White Rose Petroleum Jelly and Royal Crown Hair Dressing were among the first products Mr. Long sold. Over the past 74 years several products lines have been added, including Blue Magic, Magnificent, Nadinola, etc.
J. Strickland & Co. Today
Today J. Strickland & Co. boasts the most complete line of ethnic hair care, cosmetics and skin care products sold worldwide.
That’s a long way for a company that started with $500. And it’s all due to that mindset instilled by Mr. Long: Impeccable business relations, and fine quality products for less!
At J. Strickland & Co. we’re proud of our history, but we haven’t lost sight of the road that lies ahead. The best is yet to come.
