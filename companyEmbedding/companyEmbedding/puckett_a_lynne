Colfax Names Lynne Puckett As General Counsel
RICHMOND, Va., Aug 23, 2010 /PRNewswire via COMTEX News Network/ -- Colfax Corporation (NYSE: CFX), a global leader in fluid-handling solutions for critical applications, announced that A. Lynne Puckett has been named Senior Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary effective September 27, 2010, succeeding Thomas M. O'Brien.  O'Brien, who has been with Colfax since 1985, is retiring and will remain an advisor to the Company.
Puckett has extensive experience in mergers and acquisitions, and she joins Colfax from the law firm of Hogan Lovells, where she is currently a partner.  She has represented Colfax on several acquisitions, including the recently announced acquisition of the Baric Group.  In addition to her M&A work, her experience includes a broad range of corporate and transactional matters, including venture capital financings, debt and equity offerings, and general corporate and securities law matters. A significant portion of her practice involves complex corporate restructurings and cross-border transactions. She has represented companies across many industries, ranging from large international companies to mid-sized and local non-profit companies.  Before entering the practice of law, Puckett worked for the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency, where she received the agency's Exceptional 
Performance Award in 1989. She later worked for a major U.S. defense contractor as a senior contract representative.
Clay H. Kiefaber, President and CEO of Colfax Corporation said, "Lynne is a seasoned corporate lawyer with broad-based experience in all relevant practice areas, including mergers and acquisitions, and we're delighted that she will be joining our team."
Puckett holds a J.D. from the University of Maryland School of Law and a B.S. degree from James Madison University. She is a member of the bar in Maryland and the District of Columbia.
