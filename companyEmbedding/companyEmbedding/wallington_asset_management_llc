Financial Advice on Effective Portfolio Diversification to Lower Risk and Maximize Returns on Investements















Philosophy


Our ultimate objective in using a systematic and disciplined investment process is to capture the financial goals unique to each client.
Wallington Asset Management believes in an active approach to investment management with an emphasis on quality and effective diversification. A systematic and disciplined investment process is utilized as we strive to achieve, over the long-term, a total return that exceeds a client’s benchmark return based upon popular stock and bond indexes. Commensurate with this return objective is the assumption of a reasonable and conservative risk posture through investments in high-quality common stocks, fixed income securities and/or money market instruments. While a prescribed set of guidelines determined by the client's investment policy governs the allocation of investment funds to the various asset classes, these allocations may be adjusted over time due to fluctuations in individual asset values or when our analysis indicates a fundamental imbalance in the risk-return spectrum.

What is a Fixed Income Philopsopy for High Quality Bonds and Conservative Maturity Structures?















Philosophy: Fixed Income


The defining characteristics of Wallington Asset Management’s fixed income philosophy are the use of high quality bonds and conservative maturity structures.
Wallington Asset Management utilizes a four phase approach in the management of fixed income portfolios. First, a fixed income strategy is designed to meet each client’s long-term investment objectives. This is more difficult than generally believed. Each client’s liquidity needs, tax considerations and time horizon constraints are entwined with the investment objective defined for the portfolio. Objectives may include any goal in the spectrum from stability of principal and income to the maximization of long-term nominal returns.
Once these objectives have been defined, Wallington Asset Management will then establish a duration range to manage the sensitivity of each client’s bond portfolio value to changes in interest rates. Since most research evidence indicates that a conservative bond maturity structure allows for the capture of most of the returns offered in longer-dated maturities while incurring proportionately less interest rate risk, our preference is to focus on the intermediate term maturities.
The third phase of our fixed income management employs the use of prudent portfolio strategies on an on-going basis. These strategies are drawn from macroeconomic analysis as well as yield curve and fundamental credit analysis. Our tactics may take the form of composite duration and convexity adjustment, shifts to undervalued sectors, and individual bond swaps. We seek to reap the rewards of credit upgrades and to avoid the risk of credit downgrades.
Finally, we continually monitor the performance of each holding as well as that holding’s contribution to the total interest rate risk of the fixed income portfolio. We believe this fourth step is crucial as we strive to maximize returns within a predetermined level of risk.

Financial Services for Personal, Trusts and Institutions Constructing Equity Portfolios with Value and Growth Stocks















Philosophy: Common Stock


The distinguishing characteristic of Wallington Asset Management’s equity philosophy is the employment of both value and growth stocks in constructing equity portfolios.
Wallington Asset Management employs both value and growth stock philosophies in the construction and management of equity portfolios. This blended investment philosophy toward common stocks originates from the ongoing debate between value and growth stock adherents and the inordinate amount of risk incurred when either value or growth selection is used exclusively. We believe that simultaneous investment in both value and growth stocks results in enhanced performance and serves to reduce the risk of under-performance associated with a stock portfolio exposed solely to the characteristics of either growth stocks or value stocks.
Our strategy is to select stocks of companies in those instances where we believe the market is underestimating the total return potential from holding such a security. Conversely, we eliminate those securities we believe are priced at a level reflecting unrealistic expectations. Each client’s equity portfolio maintains diversification but not in strict accordance with the sector weights reflected in the popular indexes. It is our ultimate objective to preserve capital and to outperform the market on a risk-adjusted basis over the long-term utilizing the S&P 500 Stock Index as the benchmark portfolio against which performance will be measured.



    	  		Photo: Scalini
    	  	










 



Create a Well Defined Investment Policy to Reach Long Term Financial Goals for Retirement















Philosophy: Formulation


Each investment portfolio, whether for the individual or the institutional investor, requires a well-defined investment policy to successfully fulfill financial goals over the long-term.
As independent investment professionals, we are available to work closely with our clients and their advisors to establish a suitable investment policy. In this process, items such as risk, expected rates of return, cash flow requirements and time horizons are discussed to formulate guidelines by which each investment portfolio will be managed. Specifically, it is this phase of the investment management process which dictates the general allocation of investment funds to the various asset classes (i.e., equities, fixed income, and cash). Consequently, these guidelines serve as a benchmark to realistically evaluate future investment performance.

Utilizing Asset Custodians or Brokerage Statement Services and Arrangements for Personal or Corporate















Philosophy: Reporting


Upon a client’s request, Wallington Asset Management may arrange to have the assets of a client deposited at a specified custodian. Clients not wishing to take advantage of this service may arrange to place their securities with any member firm of the New York Stock Exchange or may utilize a custodian account at any bank. These institutions are responsible for providing clients with a report of each transaction via trade confirmations as well as timely statements reflecting the activity in each account. As part of our service, Wallington Asset Management always carefully reviews these statements and confirmations.
In addition to the custodian or brokerage statements, Wallington Asset Management, through our internal portfolio accounting system, provides each client with a quarterly statement summarizing the holdings in their investment portfolio. These statements are concise, easy to comprehend and reflect the current appraised market value of the portfolio. A variety of summary or detailed reports (performance, transaction history, interest and dividends, realized gains or losses, unrealized gains or losses, etc.) are also available upon request. We also have the capability to define the time period for reporting purposes, which enables the provision of customized reporting upon request.
    	  		
    	  		For internal purposes, Wallington Asset Management generates reports on an ongoing basis to continually monitor the performance of each client’s portfolio as well as the specific holdings contained therein. This allows us to react virtually instantaneously when an investment decision is implemented. In the event a client requires multiple accounts, Wallington Asset Management is able to analyze the total exposure a client has to a particular asset class and/or individual security by grouping related portfolios together.

Company Description


Wallington Asset Management employs a GARP equity investment approach that is based on both value and growth investment strategies. The firm believes that simultaneous investment in value and growth stocks results in enhanced performance and reduces the risk of under performance associated with a stock portfolio exposed solely to the characteristics of either growth stocks or value stocks. They select the stocks of companies in which the total return potential from holding such a security is underestimated in the market. Wallington eliminates securities that are priced at a level that reflects unrealistic expectations. Each client's equity portfolio maintains diversification but not in strict accordance with the sector weights reflected in the popular indexes. Wallington's objective is to preserve capital and to outperform the market on a risk-adjusted basis over the long-term using the S&P 500 as the benchmark. Though not limited by sector, the firm tends to invest in the stocks of US large-cap companies in the health technology, producer manufacturing, consumer non-durables, electronic technology and technology services sectors. Wallington also invests in Europe, the Middle East and Asia. The firm maintains a very low turnover rate.Wallington manages fixed-income portfolios using a four-phase approach. First, a fixed-income strategy is designed to meet each client's long-term objectives. Then establish a duration range to manage the sensitivity of each client's bond portfolio value to changes in interest rates. Wallington prefers to focus on intermediate-term maturities. The third phase of the firm's fixed-income management strategy employs the use of prudent portfolio strategies on an on-going basis. These strategies are drawn from macroeconomic analysis and from yield curve and fundamental credit analysis. Wallington's strategies may take the form of composite duration and convexity adjustment, shifts to undervalued sectors and individual bond swaps. They seek the rewards of credit upgrades while avoiding the risk of credit downgrades. Finally, Wallington continually monitors the performance of each holding as well as that holding's contribution to the total interest rate risk of the fixed-income portfolio.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
