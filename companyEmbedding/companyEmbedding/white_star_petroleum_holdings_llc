Devon (DVN) to Sell Non-Core Assets to White Star Petroleum


April 21, 2016, 06:56:00 PM EDT
By Zacks Equity Research, Zacks.com

Oil and gas company
Devon Energy Corporation
DVN

has agreed to sell its non-core Mississippian assets in northern
Oklahoma to White Star Petroleum, LLC for $200 million. Net
proceeds from this transaction will be used to consolidate the
company's financial position. The transaction is expected to close
in the second quarter of 2016, with an effective date of Jan 1,
2016.


Transformational Initiatives


The ongoing softness in commodity prices, along with stiff
competition in the oil and gas industry, continues to impact
Devon's operations and financial performance. Apart from its focus
on spinning off non-core assets, Devon Energy has also adopted
cost-saving initiatives to support margins amid the difficult
commodity price environment.
At the field level, it has effectively brought its costs under
control. In 2016, Devon Energy expects to achieve cost savings of
$800 million. Moreover, it has slashed its 2016 exploration &
production (E&P) budget by nearly 75% from the 2015 level.
Notably, management has decided to streamline the company's
existing portfolio of assets to focus on its onshore core
operations in North America. The decision to sell non-core assets
is, thus, in sync with management's strategy to further develop its
core plays.
As part of the transformation process, Devon has also inked
three deals that will enable it to focus on potential emerging oil
plays, amid the global glut in crude prices.
On the non-core asset spin-off front, Devon remains on track
with its strategy to complete divestitures worth $2-$3 billion by
the year end. Moreover, the company is planning to sell its 50%
interest in the Access Pipeline in Canada and is progressing on its
goal of monetizing the remaining upstream assets in the U.S.


What Others Are Doing


In order to cope with the ongoing weakness in commodity prices,
Anadarko Petroleum Corporation
APC

, one of the world's largest independent oil and natural gas
E&P companies, plans to cut its 2016 capital spending by nearly
50%. The company also plans to monetize assets worth $3 billion in
2016. Diversified energy company, Chesapeake Energy Corp.
CHK

, has also resorted to cost saving initiatives and intends to
maintain capital expenditure in the range of $1.3-$1.8 billion,
down 57% from $3.6 billion spent in 2015.
Another reputed player in the oil & energy space, Apache
Corp.
APA

has set a capital expenditure budget of $1.4-$1.8 billion for 2016,
reflecting a 62% year-over-year reduction.
Devon Energy currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

White Star Petroleum, LLC Closes On Acquisition Of Mississippi Lime And Woodford Shale Assets; Announces Completion Of  Recapitalization Initiatives And Key Executive Appointments

July 01, 2016 09:00

OKLAHOMA CITY, July 1, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- White Star Petroleum, LLC ("White Star") today announced that it has completed the previously announced acquisition of Mississippi Lime and Woodford Shale assets (the "Acquisition") from Devon Energy Corporation (NYSE: DVN) for $200 million net of customary closing adjustments. The acquired assets include approximately 210,000 net acres in Central Northern Oklahoma, primarily located in Payne, Lincoln, Logan and Garfield Counties in Oklahoma, with most of the position held by production.  In conjunction with the Acquisition, White Star entered into a senior secured, reserves-based revolving credit facility (the "Amended and Restated Syndicated Facility") to amend and restate its existing credit facility.  The Amended and Restated Syndicated Facility has a term of four years with initial commitments of $210 million. MUFG Union Bank N.A. and Capital One Securities, Inc. served as joint lead arrangers for the Amended and Restated Syndicated Facility and MUFG Union Bank, N.A. is acting as Administrative Agent.  Concurrently with the Acquisition, White Star also extinguished substantially all of its 12.00% Second Lien Notes due 2020 (the "Second Lien Notes") through privately negotiated repurchases or exchanges for equity in White Star Petroleum Holdings, LLC ("Holdings"), White Star's parent company.  Borrowings under the Amended and Restated Syndicated Facility together with proceeds from new equity financing led by The Energy & Minerals Group ("EMG") were used to fund the Acquisition and the repurchases of Second Lien Notes.  "The closing of today's transactions represents a significant milestone for White Star and has transformed the company, positioning it for growth and continued value creation," Elliot J. Chambers, White Star's Chief Executive Officer commented. "The acquisition of Mississippi Lime and Woodford Shale assets from Devon more than doubles White Star's production, cash flow and acreage footprint. Our recapitalization initiatives reflect EMG's ongoing support for White Star and have significantly improved our leverage and liquidity profile." As part of its ongoing strategy to broaden and deepen its management team, White Star also announced the hiring of Caleb G. Morgret as Chief Financial Officer, Jeffrey J. Zanotti as Senior Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary and Richard "Ricky" D. Pollot as Chief Accounting Officer.  Morgret, 38, joined White Star on June 6, 2016.

Morgan, Mizuho Corporate Bank and UniCredit Group in London, UK, Frankfurt, Germany and Vienna, Austria. He earned an MBA from Southern Methodist University in 2016 and a BBA from the University of South Carolina in 2000. Morgret is a CFA charterholder.  Zanotti, 38, joined White Star on May 9, 2016. Zanotti previously worked for Seventy Seven Energy Inc. as Assistant General Counsel and Assistant Secretary. Prior to joining Seventy Seven Energy, Zanotti worked for Chesapeake for four years as Assistant General Counsel – Corporate & Securities and other roles of increasing responsibility.  Zanotti began his legal career in the Dallas office of Jones Day.  Zanotti earned a JD from Arizona State University in 2006 and a BA from Southern Methodist University in 2000.  Pollot, 47, joined White Star on June 6, 2016. Pollot previously worked for Mustang Fuel Corporation for 12 years, most recently as Director of Exploration and Production Accounting.

White Star closes Devon deal, names CFO








July 1, 2016



































White Star Petroleum LLC has completed the previously announced acquisition of Mississippi Lime and Woodford Shale assets from Devon Energy Corp. (NYSE: DVN) for $200 million net of customary closing adjustments. The acquired assets include approximately 210,000 net acres in Central Northern Oklahoma, primarily located in Payne, Lincoln, Logan and Garfield Counties in Oklahoma, with most of the position held by production.
In conjunction, White Star entered into a senior secured, reserves-based revolving credit facility to amend and restate its existing credit facility. The amended and restated syndicated facility has a term of four years with initial commitments of $210 million. MUFG Union Bank NA and Capital One Securities Inc. served as joint lead arrangers and MUFG Union Bank NA is acting as administrative agent. Concurrently with the acquisition, White Star also extinguished substantially all of its 12.00% Second Lien Notes due 2020 through privately negotiated repurchases or exchanges for equity in White Star Petroleum Holdings LLC, White Star's parent company.  Borrowings under the amended and restated syndicated facility together with proceeds from new equity financing led by The Energy & Minerals Group were used to fund the acquisition and the repurchases of second lien notes.
"The acquisition of Mississippi Lime and Woodford Shale assets from Devon more than doubles White Star's production, cash flow and acreage footprint. Our recapitalization initiatives reflect EMG's ongoing support for White Star and have significantly improved our leverage and liquidity profile," said Elliot J. Chambers, White Star's CEO. 
Management additions White Star has hired Caleb G. Morgret as CFO, Jeffrey J. Zanotti as senior vice president, general counsel and secretary and Richard "Ricky" D. Pollot as chief accounting officer.
Morgret joined White Star on June 6, 2016. Morgret previously worked for Chesapeake Energy Corporation for four years, most recently as vice president and treasurer. Prior to Chesapeake, Morgret worked in investment banking, having served in various roles with J.P. Morgan, Mizuho Corporate Bank and UniCredit Group in London, UK, Frankfurt, Germany and Vienna, Austria. He earned an MBA from Southern Methodist University in 2016 and a BBA from the University of South Carolina in 2000. Morgret is a CFA charterholder.
Zanotti joined White Star on May 9, 2016. Zanotti previously worked for Seventy Seven Energy Inc. as assistant general counsel and assistant secretary. Prior to joining Seventy Seven Energy, Zanotti worked for Chesapeake. Zanotti began his legal career in the Dallas office of Jones Day. Zanotti earned a JD from Arizona State University in 2006 and a BA from Southern Methodist University in 2000.
Pollot joined White Star on June 6, 2016. Pollot previously worked for Mustang Fuel Corp. for 12 years, most recently as director of exploration and production accounting. Prior to joining Mustang Fuel, Pollot worked for Ernst & Young for 13 years. Pollot earned a BBA from the University of Oklahoma in 1991 and is a certified public accountant.
Porter Hedges LLP served as legal advisor to White Star. Sullivan & Cromwell LLP served as recapitalization transactions advisor.
