Helmerich & Payne, Inc. is a petroleum contract drilling company engaged in oil and gas well drilling for exploration and production companies [2] headquartered in Tulsa, Oklahoma, with operations throughout the world. Their FlexRigs, introduced in 1998, have been used extensively in drilling unconventional shale formations, such as the Permian Basin in Texas, Bakken formation in North Dakota and the Eagle Ford formation in Texas.[3] The company is part of the S&P 500 stock market index.
History[edit]
The company was founded in 1920 as a joint venture between Walt Helmerich II and Bill Payne, who met on an oil rig in South Bend, Texas. The company moved to Tulsa six years later.[4]
After benefiting and growing as a result of shale drilling, as of 2015, the company was contracting as lower prices in crude oil led to cuts in use of their oil rigs.[5]

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.
