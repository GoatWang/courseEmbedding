Operator
Good day everyone and welcome to the Amber Road First Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. Today’s call is being recorded.
At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Lisa Sheldon. Please go ahead.
Lisa Sheldon
Thank you operator and thank you for joining us on Amber Road's first quarter 2015 earnings conference call. As a reminder, today's conference call is being broadcast via webcast. In addition, a replay of the call will be available on our website following the call. By now you should have received a copy of our press release that was distributed this afternoon. If you have not, it is available on the Investor Relation section of our website.
Before we begin, I would like to remind you that, during today's call we will be making forward-looking statements regarding future events and financial performance including our guidance for our first quarter and full fiscal year 2015. We caution you that such statements reflect our best judgment based on factors currently known to us and that the actual events or results could differ materially.
Please refer to the documents we file from time-to-time with the SEC, in particular our Form 10-K, 10-Q and our Form 8-K filed today with our press release. These documents contain and identify important risks and other factors that may cause our actual results to differ from those contained in our forward-looking statements.
Forward-looking statements made during the call are being made as of today. If this call is replayed or reviewed after today, the information presented during the call may not contain current or accurate information. We disclaim any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements. We will provide guidance on today's call, but will not provide any further guidance or updates on our performance during the quarter unless we do so in a public forum.
During the call, we will also discuss our non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A reconciliation of the GAAP and non-GAAP results is provided in today's press release. The projections that we provide today exclude stock-based compensations, affordable stock compensation and changes in fair value of contingent consideration liability, acquisition compensation costs, purchase accounting adjustments to deferred revenue and acquisition related costs, which cannot be determined at this time and are therefore not reconciled in today's press release.
With that I will turn the call over to our CEO, Jim Preuninger.
James W. Preuninger
Thanks, Lisa, and thank you all for joining us today. First quarter non-GAAP total revenue was $15.5 million and non-GAAP operating loss was $4.2 million both of which are ahead of our guidance. We completed our acquisition of ecVision and we're already benefiting from our combined offerings.
We witnessed strength in our Asia markets and we delivered our strongest bookings performance ever in the U.S. mid-market. Hover, on the enterprise side of our businesses we did not meet our first quarter’s new booking objectives and we experienced a slowdown in a few professional service projects.
Let me discuss this in more detail. We continue to drive more deals into the sales pipeline and are closing new deals across all businesses segments. However, a few larger transactions targeted for close in late March were pushed out. I believe much of this is due to the size and the scope of these projects being considered and I remain optimistic that these deals will close later this year.

Our first quarter if typically our lowest quarter from a bookings perspective and the one where we would typically have the most variability. We believe we have enough good pipelines to be in the range of our original subscription bookings target for the remainder of the year however. A booking weakness in Q1 creates a subscription and professional services revenue impact that’s difficult to make up in the next few quarters based on our revenue recognition rules.
In addition, our service revenue for the year is expected to be impacted by the lengthening of certain implementations with a few clients. As a result of these factors our current expectation is that we will not grow revenue in 2015 as fast as we've previously expected and we're tempering our full-year guidance in accordance.
While we are disappointed in this, I would like to spend a little bit of time discussing several topics that give us great confidence in our businesses moving forward.
On March 2, we announced our acquisition of ecVision a cloud based sourcing and collaborative supply chain solution Software Company. These products help many of the largest brand companies in the world to effectively manage their relationships across multiple geographies with product suppliers, raw material vendors, product testing and social compliance audit firms and global logistics companies.
Shortly after the announcement, we held several comprehensive webinars and seminars for Amber Road and ecVision customers to elaborate on the combined offering. These events were a great success and we've already identified and initiated a number of new sales cycles within our installed base of customers as well as potential customers within our sales pipeline. Our expectation for this businesses in 2015 have not changed they have only gotten better.
In recent research note Gartner wrote that they have and “in predicting the continued convergence of GTM or Global Trade Management and its traditional domains of logistics and compliance with other supply chain areas. Global trade is a natural extension of sourcing and together they form the order to delivery process, enterprise fires are more frequently exploring, acquiring all of these capabilities on one platform.”
The report continues state that our acquisition is a positive development for customers of both companies. We believe that ecVision not only expands our portfolio of global trade solutions, but with offices in Hong Kong and China it extends our presence in Asia which I have said many times before is a strategic priority for us. We continue to gain momentum in the region and during the quarter, we expanded our relationships with two very important customers and we're seeing many others expanding the number of factories in china that are using our solutions.
We also signed a health number of new clients in China, as the number one exporter and the number two importer in the world China is a very significant market for our solutions. Outside of China, I'm thrilled to announce that we sold our first trader automation deal in Taiwan, it was sold to a large semiconductor company. We're clearly seeing the success as we grow our presence in china and Asia and we will continue to invest in extending our solutions to other South East Asia countries.
We continue to see demand from our U.S. enterprise segment as the largest companies need to manage increasingly complex regulations in growing the cost of global trade in order to remain competitive. During the quarter, we closed a deal with a very large package delivery company and global provider of specialized transportation and logistics services.
We will be supplying them with our global knowledge trade content and our trade engines to power internal systems as a replacement to far less complete and inaccurate content that they have been collecting on their own. Their team realized that they had not been keeping pace with the rapid and complex changes to trade regulations and tariffs and they selected us due to our superior capabilities and the quality processes we maintain in keeping our information current. Further, our trade engines will give our content far more automation possibilities within their company.

We also want a competitive deal for our newly released United States foreign trade zone module with a leader in the marine proportion systems and services businesses. Foreign trade zone offer U.S. manufacturers the ability to greatly reduce the duties they pay, but without automation foreign trade zones are very difficult to manage.
Our foreign trade zone module provides a completely automated approach for managing bonded warehousing and foreign trade zone operations to drive lower improving costs, enhanced inventory control and provide supply chain velocity. This is an important piece of our overall offering as this newer solution has a strong value proposition in the market and we believe it presents new opportunities for Amber Road.
Building on the success we had addressing the French market from foreign locations, we decided to open a sales office in France last fall. And as you may remember in our Q4 earnings call, I announced the signing of a large transaction with the French based tire and automotive supply company. In this first quarter I visited the region and attended a seminar in Paris that we hosted we co-hosted actually with supply chain magazine concerning global supply trends and trade compliance for French based companies.
Close to 100 executives from French companies were in attendance, now is in the follow-up on several engaging sales visits afterwards. Since then we have added many French companies to our sales pipeline and I'm optimistic about the near term contribution from this country in our investments. Finally the U.S. market delivered tremendous results and had their highest bookings quarter ever.
It also gave us our largest mid-market contract to ever close which was well in excess of $1 million in total contract value. We've made significant progress in driving awareness around the benefit of our solutions and due to the success we are having you should continue to expect us to make investments in this area.
As I mentioned last quarter we began setting up operations to address global trade needs of European mid-market companies. It’s still early in this process but I'm optimistic in our ability to successfully enter this market and look forward to updating on future calls. So we continue to see multiple avenues in our business to drive topline growth and believe that we have the correct strategies in place to capitalize on our large market opportunity.
With that let me turn it over to Tom.
Thomas E. Conway
Thanks Jim. I’ll start with a more detailed overview of our first quarter 2015 financial performance and then I will provide some commentary on our second quarter and full-year 2015 outlook. Following my closing remarks, we will open up the call to your questions.
Looking at the first quarter results beginning with the statement of operations on a GAAP basis we generated revenue in the quarter of $15.2 million up 1% year-over-year. This $15.2 million was inclusive of $713,000 of contribution from ecVision. Subscription revenue in the quarter was $10.3 million in line with the first quarter of 2014, professional services revenue in the quarter was $4.9 million an 8% increase from the same period a year ago.
On a non-GAAP basis, total revenue was $15.5 million which includes an adjustment of $261,000 related to the purchase accounting deferred revenue adjustment associated with our acquisition of ecVision. Our trailing 12 months recurring revenue retention rate in the quarter was 100%, we believe this continues to demonstrate the long-term value of our customer relationship with regard to revenue and billing visibility.
On a GAAP basis, our gross profit was $7.0 million or 46% of total revenue compared to $8.7 million or 58% of total revenue in the prior year period. Subscription gross profit was $6.0 million or 58% of subscription revenue compared to $7.2 million or 68% of subscription revenue in the first quarter of 2014. Our gross profit on professional services was $1 million or 21% of professional services revenue compared to $1.6 million or 35% of professional services revenue in the same period last year.

Turning the focus operating expenses. We continue to execute on our stated strategy of making ongoing investments across our business particularly in sales and marketing and R&D as well as in China and Europe as we establish our mid-market sales office at Germany. Research and development expenses grew 66% year-over-year to $3.6 million primarily driven by ecVision’s R&D platform as well as investments to further strengthen our own solution.
Sales and marketing expenses increased 18% year-over-year to $5.7 million or 38% of revenue due to the expansion of our sales force to address our growing opportunities and investments in demand generation marketing programs. General and administrative expenses were $4.4 million in the quarter compared to $4.8 million in the year ago period. For the first quarter, GAAP operating loss was $6.7 million compared to a GAAP operating loss of $21.7 million in the first quarter of last year, which included $18.7 million in restricted stock expense.
On a non-GAAP basis, operating loss was $4.2 million in the quarter, compared to an operating loss of $604,000 in the year-ago period. Non-GAAP operating loss for the first quarter of 2015 excludes stock-based compensation, affordable stock compensation and changes in the fair value of contingent liability, purchase accounting deferred revenue adjustment, acquisition compensation costs and acquisition related costs.
GAAP net loss attributable to common stockholders was $7 million for the first quarter of 2015 and this number compares to a GAAP net loss attributable to common shareholders of $24.4 million in the prior year period. GAAP net loss per share was $0.27 in the first quarter of 2015, compared to a net loss per share of $3.95 in the first quarter of 2014. These numbers were based on 26.0 million and 6.2 million shares outstanding respectively.
On a non-GAAP basis, net loss was $4.4 million for the first quarter of 2015. This compares to a non-GAAP net loss of $816,000 in the prior year period. Non-GAAP net loss per share was $0.17 in the first quarter of 2015, compared to a loss of $0.03 per share in the prior year period. These numbers were based on 26 million and 25 million outstanding shares respectively. Our Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was loss of $2.6 million, compared to adjusted EBITDA loss of $525,000 in the same period last year.
Turning the focus to our balance sheet, as of March 31, 2015 we had cash and cash equivalents of $32.1 million compared to $41.2 million as of December 31, 2014 and $51.2 million as of March 31, 2014. We used $8.2 million in cash from our balance sheet to fund the acquisition of ecVision. Cash use and operating activities for the first quarter of 2015 was $3 million and free cash flow used was $3.1 million.
Let’s turn our focus to guidance, our expectation for non-GAAP revenue for the second quarter and full-year includes the purchase accounting deferred revenue adjustment. Our expectations of non-GAAP loss from operations and non-GAAP loss per basic share for the second quarter and full-year exclude stock based compensation, affordable stock compensation, changes in fair value of contingent consideration liability, acquisition compensation costs, purchase accounting adjustments to deferred revenue and acquisition related costs.
I’ll start with our thoughts on the second quarter of 2015. Total non-GAAP revenue in the second quarter of 2015 is expected to be in the range of $17.4 million to $17.7 million. Our non-GAAP adjusted operating loss is expected to be in the range of $4.8 million to $5.1 million. Our non-GAAP adjusted net loss per share is expected to be in the range of $0.21 to $0.22 those per share amounts assumed 26.2 million basic shares outstanding.
From a 2015 full-year perspective we expect total non-GAAP revenue to be in the range of $72.5 million to $74.5 million. We expect non-GAAP adjusted operating loss to be in the range of $13.8 million to $14.8 million. Non-GAAP adjusted net loss per share is expected to be in the range of $0.58 to $0.62 assuming 26.3 million basic shares outstanding. Our Q2 and full-year guidance reflects the impact of our Q1 bookings performance, impact that will have remainder of the year as well as the services revenues that Jim discussed.

On the expense side, the market opportunity in front us is a significant and we are committed to extending our leadership positions. We are very excited about our prospect in China and in the rest of Asia and you should expect to continue to see as invest both there and in Europe as we establish a sales presence to address the mid-market. We also remain focused on driving the awareness and adoption across the business, but we will be looking at areas in which we can prudently manage our expenses.
The net of this is that we are expecting a modest cash firm exclusive of acquisition related costs of approximately $7 million to $8 million in 2015. In summary we remain excited about our large and growing market opportunity and building a business that can achieve sustainable long term growth.
With that we’re happy to take your questions. Operator, please open the line for questions.
Question-And-Answer Session
Operator
[Operator Instructions] We’ll take our first question from Richard Davis from Canaccord.
DJ Hynes
Hey thanks guys. This is DJ Hynes on for Richard. So maybe first, Jim, on some of these enterprise deals, can you give us a little more color on the ones that pushed out kind of where we stand, are these deals still being competitively contested, is it delays in contracting or customers looking for budget for this type of stuff. Just kind of what’s the hang up and the likelihood at that you can push across the finish line here over the next couple of quarters.
James W. Preuninger
Yes. I think it’s relatively high. So by the way, our win rate in the quarter remain very high, consisted with our full-year of 2014 win rate. So we didn’t lose many deals, we just a few of them slide, and as I noted in my comments I think it’s really due to kind of the size and scope, companies are working hard to make sure that they have the right resources and commitment before they execute an agreement and we’re making sure that we have the right understanding of the project so that we’re giving them good information about timeline and things like that.
So we didn’t lose this business, it’s just been deferred perhaps one to two quarters. And I should comment the booking shortfall really amounted to probably two enterprise deals. So we closed a lot of business, U.S. mid-market did very well, we did great in Asia, we had signings in Europe, in the U.S. with some really interesting companies, but I needed two more deals to close in on our targets and that’s where we came up short.
DJ Hynes
And then, on the services side, curious if any of this implementation business is related to UGE relationship and then the follow-up to that would be why are these services engagements being pushed out?
James W. Preuninger
Yes. So we didn’t have any service engagement stop, but we do have clients that are slowing down their rate of services investment, frankly in many cases, it doesn’t mean that we’re slowing down our implementation though. We’re finding ways of being more efficient of doing things faster of utilizing more of our customer’s resources and lots of our resources, but we had really came down to two projects where through some budget cutting and the efficiencies that I’ve talked about, the projects look like they’re not going to be as large as they had been, right. So in Q2, Q3, and Q4 we’re looking at those project plans and the budgets associated with them and we’re seeing a market difference. So we took the time to understand that and adjust our guidance accordingly.
DJ Hynes
Got it and then maybe one last one for Tom, on the gross margins, a pretty significant sequential drop off, there is a lot of moving parts in that obviously you got some of our your service utilization stuff and now we’re moving ecVision into the next. Help us think about gross margins going forward, it would be great if you could give us color on both lines. I mean the subscription and the professional services for both to be sequential drops. So how do those look going forward if we think about building models?

Thomas E. Conway
Yes, thanks DJ. We should see gross improvement as we go if you recall from the last call and the call prior to that. The large customer loss that we had in 2014, we were committed to not necessarily cutting out certain costs, we were going to grow through the overhang of certain dedicated facility and personnel. So we were expecting and talked to as much to the fact that the first half of 2015, [indiscernible] was going to be challenging from a gross margin perspective, but that you should see improving margins as we go throughout the year.
On the services side of the equation, the lower than expected, with a couple of these service projects moving around in phasing led to some utilization issues. So we expect though that those margins should also begin to improve sequentially quarter-over-quarter as we move through 2015. So I think the trajectory is in fact the same as we stated earlier starting low in Q1 and growing through, it’s just that we’re starting off with a maybe a couple points lower here due to the services side.
DJ Hynes
Okay. Got it. Okay thanks for the color guys.
Thomas E. Conway
Thank you DJ.
Operator
We’ll go next to Tom Roderick from Stifel.
Thomas M. Roderick
Hey gentlemen good afternoon. So I got to apologize, I missed the first four minutes of your comments Jim as I was jumping from another call and so I missed some of the commentary around the bookings push outs, but I heard your answer to DJ’s question there. So kind of equates to a couple eEnterprise deals which maybe you could sort of help quantify the way we think about guidance relative to where most of our models were which I guess at the midpoint is maybe $4 million lower or so. Is it fair to think about this as maybe sort of half of that being subscription based revenue and half being related to professional services and I’ll leave it at that and then I'll come back for follow-on, thanks.
James W. Preuninger
Yes. So Tom that’s roughly right and the issue you have is this one quarter you don’t want to miss your bookings target its Q1, because that’s where you have the most number of months of revenue recognition and while we're pretty bullish I think about our ability to hit the full-year bookings target more weighted towards Q3 and Q4 as you probably know bookings in Q3 and Q4 had almost nothing to revenue in the current fiscal year.
So Q1 miss in booking is trough, it’s hard to recover, we're going to work real hard, but I have to somewhat cautious and prudent when I'm giving guidance here and think that you know those bookings don’t happen until the back half of the year in which time they don’t impact revenue as well, but the missed booking impacts subscription revenue and it also impacts the corresponding services that you would have done for those bookings. And then we are taking an impact on a couple of these projects where people are just slowing down a little bit on their rate of spend.
Thomas M. Roderick
So I think back to last quarter you had highlighted there was - if not actually push outs but you had a few deals that closed late in the quarter and that impacted the timing of some revenue, this quarter you see a couple of deals that are pushing out with no decisions. Is there something broader going on in the environment of the macro decision making capabilities your customers set is lower, or is there a competitive freeze being put in place by some of the bigger ERP vendors that can freeze that process. What do you think it is, or this just maybe you need to tighten up the forecasting and or create some greater incentives for the sales force? What do you think sort of fixes some of these challenges.
James W. Preuninger
Yes. So our businesses can be a bit lumpy, because look at it, a typical quarter is about four to seven large enterprise deals and anywhere between 25 and 40 either mid-market transactions or smaller tuck-in deals right. And really generally speaking those enterprise deals are going to account for about 80% of the total, so a slip of one deal or two deals has the meaningful impact and that’s what we saw in Q1.

Now I didn’t lose the businesses, in fact our win rate is very high, I mean I don’t think that’s another enterprise software company in the world that wouldn’t want to trade me win loss rates right now. So we see our pipeline growing, we got great demand both within markets where we've had the presence for some time and some of these new markets are really encouraging. I commented on our visibility, what’s happening in France and other places. So I think we're just seeing a little bit of lumpiness and unfortunately it’s come at a bad time you know Q1.
Thomas M. Roderick
Understood. One last quick follow-up from me, you have been pretty open past couple of quarters talking about the pipeline where you have a small handful of somewhat transformational deals that would be multiples of a typical enterprise customer. Can you provide us with an update on what that large transformational deal pipeline looks like, you still feel pretty good that we could see you know one maybe even two of those this year, are those decision making cycles sort of extending a little bit as well?
James W. Preuninger
No I think we will have more to talk about later this year with some deals that will have some meaningful impact to our businesses particularly as we look at our revenue growth rates in 2016, so we are competing and we are doing well there.
Thomas M. Roderick
Great, we’ll stay tuned. Thanks for the help, I appreciate it.
James W. Preuninger
Thank you Tom.

Thanks so much. Jim, obviously there are some changes in the business this year that have taken the revenue growth down to more like 12% after 20% growth the last couple of years. As we start to think longer term about this business, is this still a 20% growth business?
James W. Preuninger
I think so we’ve hit a difficult couple of quarters here, both first with the non-renewable and now with a miss in our Q1 bookings, but the fundamentals haven’t changed, the market is big, underpenetrated, we’re a very strong competitor, our price points are not going down in many cases, we’re seeing better price points, we’re seeing larger deal sizes, we’re entering new markets, we got better sales coverage, we got a bigger solution portfolio.
I mean, that the ad we have with ecVision has given us some tremendous strength in an area that we had no capability in before. And I'm pretty excited about the number of cross sell opportunities that popped up almost immediately after we made the announcement and got out and talked to with our customer base in ecVision. So we have so many levers to be pulling here to drive growth. I just need to continue to work those opportunities this year and show you those results as we start to move into 2016.
Brendan J. Barnicle
And so given it is a little bit of a lag from when you sign things before they show up in revenue as reflected in the downtick to the guidance we think about 2016, could that be a year that goes back to 20% or high teens at least?
James W. Preuninger
So we’re not in a position yet to be guiding on 2016, but I can tell you our investments and the business models that we’re running are all built around, a growth rate in that neighborhood for sure.
Brendan J. Barnicle
And then with that, is it fair to assume that this year is where the losses bottom in terms of the cash flow and operating income, adjusted EBITDA?
Thomas E. Conway
Yes, Brendon. Tom speaking, I would say that’s fair again. Not giving guidance for 2016, but based on what we feel with the investments we’re making in the geographies we’re in with the product suite and solution set we have, I think that’s the right way to think about it.
Brendan J. Barnicle
Great, guys. Thanks for the clarity. I appreciate it.

James W. Preuninger
Thank you, Brendan.

We’ll go next to Eric Lemus from Raymond James.
Eric C. Lemus
Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Another question on this two larger deals, it sounds to me like these deals are just fairly large and more complicated in nature so they are being pushed out, but was there any other issues there, as far as these prospects looking to push out the closing of these deals whether it be just fear the overall macro environment of the geo location that they are located in, anything other than just the complicated nature of those deals.
James W. Preuninger
No. I don’t think so.
Eric C. Lemus
Okay.
James W. Preuninger
I mean they are good deals, .we’re very competitive, they are multi-modules, they are at great price points, the value proposition I think is well recognized by the prospects, maybe these are large enterprises and as you know companies like that decision making isn’t generally put in one person’s hands, there is a committee and then there is a sign up process and people want to do it right.
We want to do it right too. So I know as a public company, everybody wants to push wants to push for the quarter, get all the business in and in our business as well as most application software business, it does come down to the very end of the quarter where you get the most viewer bookings, but we don’t want to make a mistake at the very end just to drive a deal and I don’t think any of our customers do either.
So we’ll do it, we will do it right, it would be right for the long-term. Particularly when I look at you know our customer retention excluding the conversation we had last November is pretty darn long, right. So we want to get it right out of the gate.
Eric C. Lemus
Sure, absolutely. Thanks for that. And then you have couple of months now with ecVision under your belt, I believe your original estimate was about $8.6 million in revenue contribution from that. Given what you are hearing in a positive response that you’ve heard from customers, is that still somewhere around where you are guys are expecting ecVision to come into for the year?
James W. Preuninger
Yes that’s right. I mean there are some good upsides potential, but look at only having owned the business for 60 days or so I’m still digesting and we’re trying to get our arms around everything but the customers that they do have in play right now are tremendous references, great help in the sales cycles, lot of them do have some new opportunity for us with our traditional GTM suite. So there’s a lot there that to go get our arms around and we’re going to do our best to make it happen this year, but I don’t see risk in the 8.6 guidance that we’ve already talked about.
Brendan J. Barnicle
Okay. Great.
Operator
[Operator Instructions] We’ll go next to Glenn Mattson from Ladenburg Thalmann.
Glenn G. Mattson
Hi, good afternoon. I think did you guys mention that there was one deal signed in Taiwan and is that the extent of the business there, as of now, I’m just curious if that’s on track with plan or ahead or behind? And given kind of somewhat higher burn than you may have expected previously, are there still plans to rollout other Asian specific country modules.
James W. Preuninger
Okay. Good two questions. One is just so you understand. We don’t have a sales office in Taiwan, and there are other South East Asia countries that will - occasionally there will be an opportunity that will popup that we’ll look to see where to service it from. It could be from one of our China offices, it could be from the European office, but we qualified the deal hard and we take a good look at it to make sure that we’re the right solution and then we’ll engage very selectively.
So we’re not trying to go harvest a lot of new business out of Taiwan, but this deal came to us and that looked great and we thought if we could a light house account, someone that would represent a good subset of our total suite and be very productive with it. It’s an opportunity for us then to go build on that and perhaps think about opening more sales presence in the region, right. So this was our first deal in Taiwan. We’ve had users of our technology in Taiwan for years, but those were deals that were sold either in the U.S. or Europe, right.

We do have till plans of expanding our China trade management solution to other countries in that region, I think we’ve talked in the past about the work we’ve done there and we have several other countries that we’re expanding into. So it’s a big market, it’s a big opportunity for us and I think we’re making the right, select investments both from a product perspective and engaging in sales and marketing where it really makes sense.
Glenn G. Mattson
Okay, great. Just curious little bit about the little competition out there, is it the same at it’s been and then I think you mentioned that you won the foreign trade zone deal as a competitive - you took it either incumbent or head-to-head against someone. Could you just talk about maybe who that was and just that better landscape in general?
James W. Preuninger
The competitive landscape really hasn’t changed, this is a great market, it’s got a lot of eyes on it and people making investments to try to catch us, thankfully, we are not standing still and we are making our investments to enhance our suite and bring our new modules. The acquisition we made I think has further extended our differentiation, but the same kind of competitors, Glenn that we’ve talked about in the past are the ones that are showing up in deals, and again we are winning well better than our fair share of them.
Glenn G. Mattson
Okay, great. Thanks. Good luck.
James W. Preuninger
Thank you Glenn.
Thomas E. Conway
Thanks Glenn.
End of Q&A
Operator
And at this time, I would like to turn the call back over to Jim Preuninger for any additional or closing remarks.
James W. Preuninger
Thank you operator. Well in closing, I’m pleased with many of the accomplishments we had in the quarter. We made our first acquisition as a public company, we grew our presence in Asia and added a significant new solutions set to our portfolio, we closed several big deals in the U.S., in Europe, grew our pipeline in those markets as well.
We closed our first big deal in Taiwan and we sold our largest U.S. mid-market delever and saw our U.S. mid-market group consistently now hit their quarterly objectives quarter-over-quarter-over-quarter. Well, our Q1 bookings did not meet our expectations; we have a good pipeline heading into the rest of 2015 that includes several large transactions. I’m very confident on our ability to capitalize on the opportunity in front of us. We appreciate your support and I look forward to talking to you, again. Thank you everyone.

Publisher's Description▼▲
What is the ultimate purpose of pastoral ministry? What emphases and priorities should take precedence? In the day-to-day emphasis on various pastoral roles and pragmatic concerns, what can sometimes get lost is the theological foundation for understanding pastoral ministry.James Thompson is a New Testament scholar with a concern for relating biblical studies to practical ministry. Here he does a careful study of several of Paul's epistles in order to see what Paul's vision and purpose were for his own ministry. He finds that Paul's aim was an ethical transformation of the communities (not just individuals) with which he worked, so that they would live lives worthy of the gospel until Christ's return. Using this as a framework, Thompson offers suggestions for practical application to contemporary ministry.


Author Bio▼▲
James W. Thompson (Ph.D., Vanderbilt University) is the Robert and Kay Onstead Distinguished Professor of Biblical Studies at Abilene Christian University. He is the author of several books, including Preaching like Paul and The Beginnings of Christian Philosophy, and coauthor of God's Holy Fire.
