Before you Hire

Here are some rules, regulations, and laws governing general contractors
in California:













Does Brown William carry a valid contracting license?



In California, any remodeling or construction project that exceeds $500 (labor and materials), requires a contractor to have an active license with the California Contractor State License Board (CSLB).
Brown William currently holds license 789975, 310206 (Electrical, General Building Contractor, Plumbing), which was Active when we last checked.











How important is contractor licensing in California?



The CSLB is one of the highest rated licensing boards in the US. Applicants are required to pass a written board exam and prove at least four years of prior, relevant work experience. In addition, the CSLB requires all license holders to maintain at least $2,500 in operating capital and provides you with a range of other consumer protections.











Your liability risk when hiring Brown William



Contractors in California are required to carry workers' compensation insurance if they have employees and proof of liability insurance with the cumulative limit of $1 million for licensees with five or fewer persons, and an additional 100,000 for each additional member over five, not to exceed $5 million total.











Financial recourse when hiring Brown William



All licensed contractors in California are required to maintain a bond, which provides you with financial recourse in case they perform defective work or violate license regulations. If you feel as though you have been taken advantage of, you should leave feedback on the contractor's BuildZoom profile and file a complaint with the CSLB.
Brown William has a $12,500 bond with Wesco Insurance Company. 











What else should I know before hiring Brown William



California contractors are required to submit their fingerprints to the board, which are then checked against criminal records held by the California Department of Justice (DOJ) and Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) prior to obtaining a valid contracting license.











How is the BuildZoom score calculated?



The BuildZoom score is based on a number of factors including the contractor's license status, insurance status, verified work history, standing with local consumer interest groups, verified reviews from other BuildZoom users and self-reported feedback from the contractor.











Why you should hire through BuildZoom



When it comes to major construction work or even minor alterations to your home, hiring the wrong contractor could result in incomplete or defective work. You may even find yourself dealing with huge liability claims. BuildZoom does the homework for you and helps you hire the right contractor.











You should get several bids before hiring a contractor



The California State License Board recommends getting at least three written bids before hiring a contractor. Do not automatically accept the lowest bid - an abnormally low bid may indicate the contractor made a mistake and is not including the same work quoted by their competitors. We've made the bid collection process extremely simple (and free). Just click here to get started.

CEO / Board of Directors


William  M.  Brown


Chairman, President


and Chief Executive Officer







BIOGRAPHY
William M. (Bill) Brown is chairman, president and chief executive officer of Harris Corporation (NYSE:HRS). Harris, with annual revenue of approximately $6 billion, is a leading global provider of communications and information technology products, software, systems and services to government, defense and commercial markets. The company has more than 17,000 employees who serve customers in more than 100 countries. Brown was appointed president and chief executive officer in November 2011 and elected chairman of the board in April 2014.
Prior to this, Brown was with United Technologies Corporation (UTC), where he held several senior leadership roles since joining the company in 1997. He most recently was senior vice president, Corporate Strategy and Development, with responsibility for the company’s global strategic planning and M&A activity.
Before that, he served five years as president of UTC’s $6.5 billion Fire & Security division, where he led 45,000 employees, operating 41 factories and 350 branches across 35 countries. In this role, he successfully executed and integrated a number of acquisitions, grew sales from $4.2 billion to $6.5 billion and tripled operating profits. During his tenure he transformed the division into a global leader in the $100 billion fire safety and electronic security market, while executing restructuring and productivity initiatives resulting in significant cost savings and return on capital improvement.
Prior to leading UTC’s Fire & Security division, Brown held U.S. and international roles at UTC’s Carrier Corporation, including president of the Company’s Asia Pacific Operations where he significantly grew sales, improved profits and expanded margins over two years. He also successfully led the turnaround of the Carrier Transicold division. Before joining UTC in 1997, he worked for McKinsey & Company as a senior engagement manager. Brown began his career at Air Products and Chemicals, Inc., where he worked as a project engineer.
He serves on the board of directors for the Celanese Corporation, the Fire Department of NYC (FDNY) Foundation and the board of trustees of both the Florida Institute of Technology and Florida Polytechnic University. He is a member of President Trump’s Manufacturing Jobs Initiative, the National Security Telecommunications Advisory Committee, the United States-Brazil CEO Forum and the Aerospace Industries Association executive committee.
He received bachelor of science and master of science degrees in mechanical engineering from Villanova University and a master’s of business administration from the University of Pennsylvania Wharton School.

                           This optimistic report on the future of the U.S. and its techno-economic leadership to world prosperity was timed to coincide
                              with the American bicentennial. The report uses statistical studies and logic to argue that intensive development of technology
                              in a post-industrial format and rational planning rather than reduced rates of economic growth and consumption are the best

                           The widespread need for a realistic perspective on the likely trends in future petroleum prices first became obvious during
                              the 1970s, and again in the mid-1980s. Businessmen associated with the petroleum trade need a rational outlook on prices;
                              judging from past experience, however, they seem ready to adopt whatever conventional wisdom emerges about likely future trends.
                              One of the purposes of this analysis is to determine what led earlier forecasts so far astray, and to set forth some important
                              lessons that could lead to an improved forecasting methodology. A second purpose is to provide an analysis of the current
                              situation in the international oil market and its implications for future petroleum prices over the near-term, mid-term, and
                              long-term. By applying some realistic judgments about the inherent uncertainties in the principal factors likely to affect
                              those prices, a perspective is developed that is intended to be helpful to buyers, sellers, and governments around the world,
                              even though it does not rest upon a single trajectory of likely future petroleum prices. Keywords: Economic analysis; Forecasting;

                           Based on the current concept that nuclear attack would occur only after an international crisis, thus providing from several
                              days to several months of strategic warning, this study maintains that damage limiting systems can be designed that would
                              reduce present estimates of about 100 million fatalities by 90 percent. Two extreme programs are considered: a 'cheap' program
                              based on urban evacuation and improvised fallout shelters, and an 'expensive' program based on urban blast shelters and active
                              defense. (Author)

                           In the context of low-budget Civil Defense (CD) programs, strategies available for postattack recovery cannot rationally be
                              separated from policies which would support a CD mobilization during an emergency. An assessment is made of 25 areas in which
                              federal policy would strongly affect survival and recovery preparations during a nuclear crisis. Many of these areas have
                              not been adequately studied; also, the needed policies do not exist for nearly all of them. The analysis finds, however, that
                              most of the missing policies might be developed during an emergency of several weeks or more, if prior studies are completed
                              to delineate the options. Two important themes evolved. One was that the survival of the federal government could not be assured
                              following a large attack but that its survivability could be greatly enhanced if the needed CD policies are established in
                              time. The second was that the federal CD role should often be a supportive one, rather than the controlling one that is generally
                              assumed. (Author)

                           Even though a major fraction of the physical resources survive a nuclear attack, the economic viability of the country is
                              not assured. For want of an effective understanding of the needs of the postattack reorganization period, the country could
                              experience economic 'starvation in the midst of plenty.' The purpose of preplanning for a Civil Defense mobilization is to
                              enable it to proceed rapidly and effectively at the time it is needed. Thus, if the preparations are satisfactory the efforts
                              which would promote the subsequent postattack recovery could reasonably be balanced and thereby not only make the recovery
                              more likely but more rapid

                              The major conclusion for civil defense planning is that small or intrawar attacks, arising out of deep crises, are the easiest
                                 and cheapest to prepare against, apparently the least unlikely, and yet among the most neglected of civil defense contingencies.
                                 While the possibility of massive surprise attack should not be ignored, the relative overemphasis upon it has hampered realistic
                                 planning efforts. A more realistic allocation of planning emphases leads to increased interest in civil defense and emergency
                                 planning programs containing some or all of the following elements: (1) a crisis mobilization base; (2) a tension mobilization
                                 base; (3) a post-attack recuperation base; (4) possible arms control and increased defense agreements, including cooperative
                                 civil defense; and (5) programs that vary protection with population density to reduce the lucrativeness of population targets.
                                 Strategic and political aspects of such program elements are discussed, and, on balance, they are recommended

                              The feasibility of designing highly effective low-cost Civil Defense systems is examined in relationship to various war outbreak
                                 scenarios and the utility of the associated preattack warning period. It is argued that with moderate confidence such highly
                                 effective systems can be designed. They would depend upon a general mobilization of civilian resources during an emergency
                                 to greatly expand and improve any existing C.D. capability. Ideally such designs can visualize attaining the goal of zero
                                 casualties; however, a dynamic plan would contain several options to handle the many imperfections which would almost certainly
                                 appear during implementation. The essential elements of the C.D. designs are examined separately for technical, political,
                                 administrative, and strategic feasibility. It is concluded that this approach offers substantial promise for future C.D. developments

                              The report emphasizes the dangers to eventual reconstruction that are posed by the disorganization inevitably following a
                                 nuclear war. What can go wrong in this reorganization period is examined by the use of scenarios and analogy. It is then suggested
                                 that during the crisis period preceding a nuclear war a number of useful actions enhancing the chance of postattack recovery
                                 should be undertaken as part of an emergency mobilization for civil defense. This mobilization might instigate actions which
                                 would help U.S. society to negotiate the reorganization period successfully. The problems of creating such countermeasures
                                 appear to be formidable but possible if: (a) the usable warning provided by the crisis is of sufficient duration (several
                                 weeks or more); and (b) the pre-planning for the mobilization action is completed in advance of the need. (Author)

                              An examination is made of the nation's potential for very rapid construction of an urban blast shelter system during severe
                                 nuclear crises. Assuming the existence of the necessary plans and preparations for a major civil defense mobilization involving
                                 nearly the entire U.S. population, it is found that the material and labor resources of the U.S. should permit an austere
                                 shelter system to be constructed within a few (i.e., 2-4) weeks. Austerity in the above sense would mean: (a) crowded shelters
                                 (2-3 people occupying a space normally allotted for one); and (b) deferring to a later time the installation of entrances,
                                 ventilation, and other habitability items. The time estimates are made on technical considerations alone. It is assumed that
                                 the important problems of planning, organizing, administrating, and decision-making would not significantly delay the program

Before you Hire

Here are some rules, regulations, and laws governing general contractors
in California:













Does Brown William carry a valid contracting license?



In California, any remodeling or construction project that exceeds $500 (labor and materials), requires a contractor to have an active license with the California Contractor State License Board (CSLB).
Brown William currently holds license 789975, 310206 (Electrical, General Building Contractor, Plumbing), which was Active when we last checked.











How important is contractor licensing in California?



The CSLB is one of the highest rated licensing boards in the US. Applicants are required to pass a written board exam and prove at least four years of prior, relevant work experience. In addition, the CSLB requires all license holders to maintain at least $2,500 in operating capital and provides you with a range of other consumer protections.











Your liability risk when hiring Brown William



Contractors in California are required to carry workers' compensation insurance if they have employees and proof of liability insurance with the cumulative limit of $1 million for licensees with five or fewer persons, and an additional 100,000 for each additional member over five, not to exceed $5 million total.











Financial recourse when hiring Brown William



All licensed contractors in California are required to maintain a bond, which provides you with financial recourse in case they perform defective work or violate license regulations. If you feel as though you have been taken advantage of, you should leave feedback on the contractor's BuildZoom profile and file a complaint with the CSLB.
Brown William has a $12,500 bond with Wesco Insurance Company. 











What else should I know before hiring Brown William



California contractors are required to submit their fingerprints to the board, which are then checked against criminal records held by the California Department of Justice (DOJ) and Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) prior to obtaining a valid contracting license.











How is the BuildZoom score calculated?



The BuildZoom score is based on a number of factors including the contractor's license status, insurance status, verified work history, standing with local consumer interest groups, verified reviews from other BuildZoom users and self-reported feedback from the contractor.











Why you should hire through BuildZoom



When it comes to major construction work or even minor alterations to your home, hiring the wrong contractor could result in incomplete or defective work. You may even find yourself dealing with huge liability claims. BuildZoom does the homework for you and helps you hire the right contractor.











You should get several bids before hiring a contractor



The California State License Board recommends getting at least three written bids before hiring a contractor. Do not automatically accept the lowest bid - an abnormally low bid may indicate the contractor made a mistake and is not including the same work quoted by their competitors. We've made the bid collection process extremely simple (and free). Just click here to get started.
