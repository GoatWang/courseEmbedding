History[edit]
Social Reality was founded in 2009 and is headquartered in Los Angeles.[2] In March 2010, Social Reality CEO and CIO, Chris Miglino and Erin de Ruggiero, started selling advertisement on Facebook with the aim of helping Facebook applications monetize their products and assess brands marketing. The company grew from selling ads to developing customized applications for large brands. From that, it developed GroupAd that offers different applications to different brands. Thereafter, to better help publishers fill out their inventory they built a RTB (Real Time Bidding) platform, SRAX. On Jan. 27, 2015 Social Reality announced its addition of Martin Sumichrast to its Board of Directors.[3]
Products[edit]
The company's first product, GroupAd, is a brand loyalty platform that provides instant rewards and feedbacks for consumers. The backbone of loyalty shows brands who their influencers are so that they can utilize this information to further hence their marketing efforts. GroupAd as a consumer facing product is a suit of marketing applications.
The second product released by the company is SRAX, a platform built to aggregate and optimize the disperse real time bidding channel so that publishers could utilize this revenue channel more effectively. Early on it focused on the selling side of the Programmatic Advertising market and it built its capabilities and expertise on the buying side as well by developing state of the art algorithm and practices to optimize the bid and targeting relationship.
Both Social Reality businesses complement each other. Brands' advertisement attain their social marketing campaigns through traditional media purchased through the buy side of the SRAX platform. GroupAd provides extensive audience data that brands can target for their ads through the SRAX platform. Ultimately SRAX and GroupAd merge toward Social Reality vision which is to both automate and make digital ads available, affordable and efficient for all brands' markets and businesses of any size.
Financing[edit]
Social Reality was profitable from its inception and utilizing the money to fund the growth of the company. Instead of seeking traditional Venture capital funds for the company, Social Reality decided to list the company in the US Over-the-counter market. It went public in October 2012 and by January 2013 it raised approximately $5.2 million [4] through various public offers. On October 13, 2016 the company was up listed to the NASDAQ Capital Market and its Class A Common Stock began trading under the symbol SRAX.[5]
Company overview[edit]
The company headquarters is in Downtown Los Angeles, in the Arts District. Social Reality also operates offices in Minneapolis, Milan, Italy and in Mexicali, Mexico. As of October 2016, the company employed 120 people.

History[edit]
Social Reality was founded in 2009 and is headquartered in Los Angeles.[2] In March 2010, Social Reality CEO and CIO, Chris Miglino and Erin de Ruggiero, started selling advertisement on Facebook with the aim of helping Facebook applications monetize their products and assess brands marketing. The company grew from selling ads to developing customized applications for large brands. From that, it developed GroupAd that offers different applications to different brands. Thereafter, to better help publishers fill out their inventory they built a RTB (Real Time Bidding) platform, SRAX. On Jan. 27, 2015 Social Reality announced its addition of Martin Sumichrast to its Board of Directors.[3]
Products[edit]
The company's first product, GroupAd, is a brand loyalty platform that provides instant rewards and feedbacks for consumers. The backbone of loyalty shows brands who their influencers are so that they can utilize this information to further hence their marketing efforts. GroupAd as a consumer facing product is a suit of marketing applications.
The second product released by the company is SRAX, a platform built to aggregate and optimize the disperse real time bidding channel so that publishers could utilize this revenue channel more effectively. Early on it focused on the selling side of the Programmatic Advertising market and it built its capabilities and expertise on the buying side as well by developing state of the art algorithm and practices to optimize the bid and targeting relationship.
Both Social Reality businesses complement each other. Brands' advertisement attain their social marketing campaigns through traditional media purchased through the buy side of the SRAX platform. GroupAd provides extensive audience data that brands can target for their ads through the SRAX platform. Ultimately SRAX and GroupAd merge toward Social Reality vision which is to both automate and make digital ads available, affordable and efficient for all brands' markets and businesses of any size.
Financing[edit]
Social Reality was profitable from its inception and utilizing the money to fund the growth of the company. Instead of seeking traditional Venture capital funds for the company, Social Reality decided to list the company in the US Over-the-counter market. It went public in October 2012 and by January 2013 it raised approximately $5.2 million [4] through various public offers. On October 13, 2016 the company was up listed to the NASDAQ Capital Market and its Class A Common Stock began trading under the symbol SRAX.[5]
Company overview[edit]
The company headquarters is in Downtown Los Angeles, in the Arts District. Social Reality also operates offices in Minneapolis, Milan, Italy and in Mexicali, Mexico. As of October 2016, the company employed 120 people.

History[edit]
Social Reality was founded in 2009 and is headquartered in Los Angeles.[2] In March 2010, Social Reality CEO and CIO, Chris Miglino and Erin de Ruggiero, started selling advertisement on Facebook with the aim of helping Facebook applications monetize their products and assess brands marketing. The company grew from selling ads to developing customized applications for large brands. From that, it developed GroupAd that offers different applications to different brands. Thereafter, to better help publishers fill out their inventory they built a RTB (Real Time Bidding) platform, SRAX. On Jan. 27, 2015 Social Reality announced its addition of Martin Sumichrast to its Board of Directors.[3]
Products[edit]
The company's first product, GroupAd, is a brand loyalty platform that provides instant rewards and feedbacks for consumers. The backbone of loyalty shows brands who their influencers are so that they can utilize this information to further hence their marketing efforts. GroupAd as a consumer facing product is a suit of marketing applications.
The second product released by the company is SRAX, a platform built to aggregate and optimize the disperse real time bidding channel so that publishers could utilize this revenue channel more effectively. Early on it focused on the selling side of the Programmatic Advertising market and it built its capabilities and expertise on the buying side as well by developing state of the art algorithm and practices to optimize the bid and targeting relationship.
Both Social Reality businesses complement each other. Brands' advertisement attain their social marketing campaigns through traditional media purchased through the buy side of the SRAX platform. GroupAd provides extensive audience data that brands can target for their ads through the SRAX platform. Ultimately SRAX and GroupAd merge toward Social Reality vision which is to both automate and make digital ads available, affordable and efficient for all brands' markets and businesses of any size.
Financing[edit]
Social Reality was profitable from its inception and utilizing the money to fund the growth of the company. Instead of seeking traditional Venture capital funds for the company, Social Reality decided to list the company in the US Over-the-counter market. It went public in October 2012 and by January 2013 it raised approximately $5.2 million [4] through various public offers. On October 13, 2016 the company was up listed to the NASDAQ Capital Market and its Class A Common Stock began trading under the symbol SRAX.[5]
Company overview[edit]
The company headquarters is in Downtown Los Angeles, in the Arts District. Social Reality also operates offices in Minneapolis, Milan, Italy and in Mexicali, Mexico. As of October 2016, the company employed 120 people.

LOS ANGELES, Nov. 3, 2014 /PRNewswire/ -- Social Reality, Inc. (OTCBB: SCRI), a leader in automated digital platform technology and social management software for Internet advertising, announced today the acquisition of Steel Media, a privately held company with $10 million in expected 2014 revenues and a 14-year track record of providing display, mobile, video and email advertising inventory to top consumer brands and ad agencies. 
Social Reality also announced $25 million in committed financing - a $20 million credit facility provided by Victory Park Capital, a Chicago-based asset management firm focused on middle market debt and equity investments, and $5 million of new equity financing provided by Siskey Capital, LLC and other existing investors.  Social Reality utilized a portion of the credit facility, together with the new equity in order to fund the acquisition of Steel Media, continue expansion of Social Reality's SSP (supply-side platform) and DSP (demand side platform) offerings sold through its proprietary real-time bidding (RTB) exchange, and to provide a strong capital base for growth, working capital and general corporate purposes. Steel Media leadership has joined Social Reality as an integral part of the newly combined entity; Richard Steel has been named President, and Chad Holsinger will serve as Chief Revenue Officer of Social Reality. Social Reality's CEO and Co-founder, Christopher Miglino, will continue to lead the company and will run the combined businesses.
"This strategic acquisition of Steel Media is an excellent fit for Social Reality, creating a powerful force in the digital advertising space. Together, our companies offer superior performance and technology for social data and Internet ad buy-and-sell solutions, delivered to agencies and brands by a seasoned and skilled digital sales team. The combined expertise of our two companies will further enhance the quality of our industry-leading technology and service, with faster delivery for our customers. We welcome the Steel Media team to Social Reality, and we look forward to executing on our combined strategic vision," said Miglino. "We appreciate the tremendous support from Victory Park Capital as our new strategic financing partner, as well as that of our new and long-term financial partners, and we look forward to their contributions as we continue to grow our business. With the enhanced revenues and positive operating cash flow from this acquisition, combined with increased leverage and ability to reach into new markets, Social Reality is well-positioned for long-term growth." 
"Our team is excited to combine forces with Social Reality. Their SRAX technology platform is the go-to digital ad exchange in the industry. Expanding Steel Media's product offerings for our customers will drive growth within the combined business," said Steel. "We're ready to make our mark, providing digital media solutions that are best-in-class, best-in-reach and best-in-speed. Our combined company now has strengths that span the complete digital spectrum."
The company's Social Reality Ad Exchange (SRAX) is an SSP that was launched in early 2013 in order to connect online publishers with demand partners and buyers through advanced programmatic technology and RTB integration. The SRAX platform has gained the reputation for making buying and selling of display, video, mobile and in-app advertising an easier and more efficient experience than other digital ad technologies. Its proprietary RTB management platform integrates social information to optimize client results from the DSP and SSP offerings. Social Reality's GroupAd product offering is a complementary social management and tracking software focused on delivering brand advocacy and customer loyalty via an integrated dashboard, to launch, distribute and optimize social and digital media campaigns.
T.R. Winston & Company, LLC served as exclusive financial advisor to Social Reality in the acquisition of Steel Media, was sole lead arranger for the term loan financing, and served as agent for the equity financing. Social Reality's legal advisors were Sidley Austin LLP and Pearlman Schneider LLP. Steel Media's financial advisor for the transaction was Petsky Prunier Securities and its legal advisor was Lowenstein Sandler LLP. Victory Park Capital's legal advisor was Katten Muchin Rosenman LLP.

Any statements contained herein which do not describe historical facts, including but not limited to, statements regarding: (i) our business; (ii) the transaction with Steel Media, including expected benefits, opportunities, synergies, financing, results and the impact on revenue, adjusted operating earnings, EBITDA, shareholder value, and the impact on our financial profile; (iii) expectations about the combined company; (iv) SCRI's intentions to provide further guidance and its intention to name the current Steel Media executives who will be joining SCRI's leadership team; (v) expectations for the Steel Media commercial platform and our entry into a segment important for future growth; (vi) our belief that this is a transformative transaction that propels us into a profitable, multi-product company positioned for continued revenue, and operating income growth, further diversification and shareholder value creation; (vii) expectations regarding  future acquisitions; (viii) beliefs about the commercial platform and the strategic fit of Steel Media; (ix) our plans to expand our portfolio through the in-license or purchase of additional products or companies; and (x) our goal of bringing to the market services and products that provide clear benefits and improve our customers' businesses, are forward-looking statements which involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those discussed in such forward-looking statements. Statements about SCRI's or Steel Media's past financial results do not, and are not meant to, predict future results. Social Reality can provide no assurance that such results and performance will continue. 
Risks and uncertainties include, among others: (1) the possibility that we may not realize the expected benefits, synergies and opportunities anticipated in connection with the transaction, including the anticipated revenue and cost synergies, and continuing revenue growth, (2) the challenges of integrating the Steel Media commercial team with Social Reality, (3) the impact on sales from competitive pricing, and sales and marketing initiatives, (4) liabilities we assume from Steel Media that may be higher than expected, (5) the possibility that sales will not meet expectations as a result of current and future competition, (6) in connection with the Steel Media acquisition, we will incur a substantial amount of indebtedness and will have to comply with restrictive and affirmative debt covenants, (7) the expectation that we will need to raise additional capital from the sale of our common stock, which will cause significant dilution to our stockholders, in order to satisfy our contractual obligations, including our debt service, earn out payments that may become payable to Steel Media's stockholder or in order to pursue business development activities, (8) due to the Steel Media transaction, we will be highly leveraged and have limited cash and cash equivalent resources which may limit our ability to take advantage of attractive business development opportunities and execute on our strategic plan, (9) our ability to execute on our long-term strategic plan or to realize the expected results from our long-term strategic plan, (10) our patents and proprietary rights both in the U.S. and outside the U.S. (including those that we acquire from the acquisition of Steel Media), (11) other risks identified in our filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), including our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and subsequent filings with the SEC. Any of the above risks and uncertainties could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, our profitability and our cash flows, which would, in turn, have a significant and adverse impact on our stock price. Use of the term "including" in the two paragraphs above shall mean in each case "including, but not limited to." We caution you not to place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date they are made.
We disclaim any obligation to publicly update or revise any such statements to reflect any change in expectations or in events, conditions or circumstances on which any such statements may be based, or that may affect the likelihood that actual results will differ from those set forth in the forward-looking statements.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.



Value Score

Growth Score

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

On a $350K home, you could get over $5,000.  Owners.com advisors are available by phone or email, and they'll manage many of the tasks you'd expect from traditional brokers – from scheduling showings to answering questions. They can also connect you with our network of real estate professionals for additional support such as escrow or title services. See Terms How will I get my rebate?Owners.com serves as your agent, and we split our commission with you 50/50 to reward you for your hard work. If your transaction involves a lender, you'll receive the rebate as a credit at closing shown on your settlement statement. The rebate is subject to approval by your lender and may not be available in all states. See our terms and conditions for details.Can I buy any house using Owners.com?We can assist you with the purchase of any home whether it is listed in the MLS or For-Sale-by-Owner as long as you aren't represented by another real estate agent. Check the property details page to see if the home is eligible for a rebate.How does Owners.com help me save?Traditional real estate firms make you pay a listing agent 3% to market your home. Then, a buyer's agent can take another 2-3% of your home's sales price. That's huge. 			 			Owners.com is different because we remove the seller's commission from the equation – saving you up to 3%. Instead, you can list your home on our site and get the help of our advisors for a flat fee.See Terms How do I list my home for sale on Owners.com?Owners.com offers a variety of seller's packages. After selecting your package, you can set up your password-protected account. Then, you can enhance your package with special add-ons to boost your home's marketability.
