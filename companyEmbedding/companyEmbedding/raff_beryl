Leadership[edit]




A Helzberg Diamonds shop in Arlington, VA


In April 2009, Beryl Raff, former executive vice president and general merchandise manager of fine jewelry at JCPenney, was named Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Helzberg.[2]
History[edit]
Soon after Helzberg's founding, Morris Helzberg became ill and the company was taken over by his son, Barnett Helzberg Sr., at the age of 14.[3] In 1963, Barnett Sr. became Chairman of the Board and his son, Barnett Helzberg Jr., took over company operations.[4] Barnett replaced his father in the Chairman position in 1988. Barnett Jr. sold the company to Berkshire Hathaway, owned by Warren Buffett, in 1995, and authored the book What I Learned Before I Sold to Warren Buffett.[5]
In 2017, Helzberg closed all stores in North Carolina. For customers who had purchased the Lifetime Care plan for their jewelry, the chain offered affected customers two options: 1) up to 12 months to travel to another store for inspections & cleanings, or 2) prepaid mail labels to send the jewelry to a Helzberg service center.
