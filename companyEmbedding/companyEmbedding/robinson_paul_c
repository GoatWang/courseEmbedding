Why is this contact information displayed? [Close]
The USPTO makes this data available for search by the public so that individuals can locate ownership information for intellectual property, much the same way a county might make real estate property ownership information available.
Since our website is synchronized with the USPTO data, we recommend making any data changes with the USPTO directly. Our website will auto-update when the USPTO data is updated.
You may also contact Trademarkia to make a request for the removal of your personally identifiable information or trademark data.  Such requests must be made in writing and will be subject to verification of ownership.  This policy allows verified trademark owners to specify: (A) that their identifiable information be masked, or (B) that their trademark pages permanently deleted from Trademarkia.com.  
                                                Requests may be made directly to customer.service@trademarkia.com and every effort will be made to honor them within 48 hours.

Consumer-Driven Health Care: Promise And Performance


James C. Robinson and 
                     
Paul B. Ginsburg



                           Kaiser Permanente Professor of Health Economics in the School of Public Health at the University of California, Berkeley.
                           
                        



James Robinson (james.robinson{at}berkeley.edu)
                     



Abstract
This paper analyzes the evolution of consumer-driven health care in terms of its original vision, its subsequent implementation,
                     and the transformations it has endured as it moves into its second decade. The market is generating product designs that combine
                     elements of consumerism with elements of managed care, but the trend is always toward a stronger role for consumer choice
                     and a weaker role for management of those choices by physicians, insurers, employers, and regulators.
