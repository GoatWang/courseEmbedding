TOUGH GRADER


                  She uses handouts to teach. We do not make use of textbooks. Tons of uneccessary homework . I love Math but she is the worst teacher I have ever had in my life.

                  Don't take her. She goes over the material so fast that you'll find yourself hard to catch up. Basically I had to teach myself.

LECTURE HEAVY


                  Her teaching is OK but she goes over the material too fast.  So if you do decide to take her class I'd say go over the materials ahead of time or you may find yourself in a difficult position. She does provide quiz study guides and I highly recommend you try to solve all the problems of the study guide. That's the only way of passing her class.

                  Prof. Wang is a fantastic professor and she's very passionate about math. Linear Algebra is a challenging and important subject and Prof. Wang provides students with an excellent foundation. She is *not* an easy professor and the subject is *not* easy either, so it's very important to come to every class and do all the work with proper effort.

                  I took professor Wang for MATH 150. She is a wonderful lecturer. Very-detailed and thorough. Moves rather quickly through her lectures but she makes sure everyone understands before she moves on. Offers a lot of extra credit opportunities. Homework is rather heavy on MATH XL. Overall, she is a great professor and very nice. Works with you too!

                  She is a great professor because she genuinely cares about her students. She is willing to do more than most professors to insure that her students understand the material and pass the class. For example, she holds review sessions on some weekends. I definitely recommend her.

                  She as a person is a wonderful individual, but i don't think that she likes teaching Math 080 (at least not the lab/on campus online version) I have a hard time with math and if you ask for help she's there, and her help is clear but as soon as class is over, shes gone.   All in all i passed her class and it wasn't a horrible experience.

                  in the first class, the professor just said that this course will be same level with UMCP . In fact, I think Alice's inear algebra is harder than UMCP.  So, if your math is very strong and your english is very good.  you can take it . If not,  you will be fail.

                  Took calc 1 with her - she teaches well and thouroughly, though that caused us to get behind early on and resulted in class going late a lot. Tests are very doable, just make sure to do the problems in your book.

Spends a lot time reducing complicated topics to simple parts. Tests can be challenging but are graded fairly. Very friendly and approachable if you have questions.

                  Professor Wang serves some pretty difficult tests and spends a lot of time on material that other professors may consider passing up. In calculus she is very very focused on proofs and on less general concepts, which may have to do with her often lagging behind other classes pace. She goes past the classes stop time consistently.
