Jill Zarin is one of the busiest wives in Manhattan, juggling a jam-packed social calendar, philanthropic efforts and many new and developing business endeavors. Jill's devotion to philanthropy arises from personal experience –- both her daughter Allyson and stepson have been diagnosed with arthritic diseases and she has made it her mission to raise money and awareness to managing and living with this disease. Born and raised in Woodmere, New York, Jill graduated from Simmons College School of Retail Management. She began her career as Assistant Buyer at Filene's and grew to become the National Sales Manager/Vice President of Great American Knitting Mills Jockey division. Jill went on to join her husband, Bobby Zarin, owner of Zarin Fabric Warehouse, an institution on New York’s Lower East Side as a marketing consultant.  With over 20 plus years of hosiery experience, Jill will be launching "SKWEEZ COUTURE by Jill Zarin" body shapewear in Spring of 2011. Through her expertise in textiles, Jill also recently launched her “Jill Zarin Home” bedding line. She is also a dedicated wife, mother, daughter and sister. Jill wrote her first book, 'Secrets of a Jewish Mother,' with her mom, Gloria Kamen, and her sister Lisa. Her credo is: "You can have it all, just not at the same time."

An exterior zippered pocket is provided for accessories. Inside the top lid are net pockets for memory cards and batteries.
