Testimonials



Bob Churchill G & S Cleaning Service, Inc.

My company has been using Procyon for 20 years or so...remarkable product. For many years, we just used it for carpet cleaning. Now we use it for cleaning many things (walls, cabinets, hard floors). We often use it with a little stripper to strip VCT floors. Heck, I've even washed my clothes in it.

I decided to clean my own stainless steel range and dishwasher today. We often use Sheila Shine, but it's oil based and often doesn't clean marks and soil off the stainless. So I asked my business partner what she uses. Though we are mostly a commercial cleaning company, she cleans a couple of houses. She suggested Procyon and microfiber rags.

It worked GREAT!! My dishwasher had stains that I could not remove. Now the darn thing looks brand new.

I've come to the conclusion that Procyon is like duct tape - one thousand and one uses! Keep up the great work.

A VERY satisfied customerRey Acevedo White Glove Carpet Cleaners in San Anselmo, CA

I'm writing to thank you for introducing me to Procyon cleaning Products. I've been in the cleaning business since 1960 and this is the first time I've been impressed by a "green cleaning product". I now use only Procyon for all my cleaning needs.

The most important reason for this letter is to thank you for helping to restore my health. For several years now, I have had trouble breathing. My lungs were always congested and so were my sinuses. I felt so listless most of the time, that I couldn't work more than four hours a day before I had to take a nap. This in spite of using two prescription inhalers and a prescription nasal spray. When I started using Procyon my symptoms all started to regress.

I have been using Procyon now for almost a year and I have not had to use any medication for the last seven months. So thanks again and please forward this information. People need to know.Spokane Public Schools
I have found your product to be very valuable in our operation. We no longer have problems with "browning" and our carpets look great. We also are saving a considerable amount of money this year. Once we were able to flush the old soap from our carpet with the PROCYON, our dilution ratio has now fallen to 2 ounces of chemical for every 5 gallons of water.Homeowners Olympia, WA

What "GREAT" stuff. We don't usually write letter to companies about their products, but we just couldn't go without letting you know what a great product your carpet "Spot & Stain Remover" is ...we had spots on our carpet that NOTHING would even start to remove. ...First spot, I sprayed cleaner on spot, gently rubbed the area, then blotted. I could not believe it. The spot was gone!!! So, went to the next stain -- much bigger than the first. Again, sprayed, gently rubbed, blotted and the spot was gone.

...Needless to say, we're great fans of your product, and felt compelled to tell you that.Homeowners in Las Vegas, NV

Your product, PROCYON carpet cleaner is awesome! Finally, a product that works as advertised ...each time I use it, I'm impressed all over again. I've given samples to my sister in Maryland, my father in Ohio, my cousin in California, my aunt in Arizona and to many of my co-workers in the emergency department where I work as a registered nurse. It's even removed blood and ink stains!Steamy Concepts in Tuscon, AZ Matt Horn Owner



At we were struggling to keep up with new trends in carpet cleaning and so began seeking out green carpet cleaning products. We tried several until we finally found Procyon®. All we can say is WOW! The Procyon® cleaning family is the best, most thorough cleaning we’ve ever experienced. And we’ve cleaned over 50,000 carpets in Arizona over the last 18 years! The soap-free cleaning has changed everything. Crunchy carpet is no longer a problem. Redos are no longer a problem. We are getting better reviews from our customers and more repeat service. We just moved from B rating in Angie’s List to an A rating! Customers are getting to know Procyon® too as it has become our flagship product. Now our Phoenix carpet cleaning technicians at Carpet Cleaning Pros Phoenix are also using nothing but Procyon®. We highly recommend Procyon® as the only carpet, tile, upholstery, area rug, and more cleaning solution. It’s the only cleaning product we will ever use again!

 The sushi restaurant was so heavily compacted with oils that it felt like walking in sticky slimy mud.


I previously used Prochem products, Bridgepoint products and Steam Pro products with what I consider were minimally good results but inferior.




Using Procyon  Powder, I was able to cut through the thick mess.




I cleaned with cold water so as to not cook on proteins.




With two applications I was done and thrilled with the results.




What had taken 5 and 6 hours in previous cleanings was done in 2.5 hours and I had a beautiful clean carpet.




 




THANK YOU  PROCYON!

 To Whom it may concern:


Finally! a one pass cleaning!




One particular Wendy's restaurant is always the worst.  I've tried many products.  I get the best result with Procyon Powder.  I get one pass cleaning, wow results!




 




Thank You! Procyon!
