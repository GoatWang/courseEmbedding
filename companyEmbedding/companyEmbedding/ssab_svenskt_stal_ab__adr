SSAB invests in High Automation Technology in Product Packing

Pesmel

















SSAB (Svenskt Stål Aktiebolag) is a producer of high-strength steel for small niche markets where the company has a leading position internationally.
SSAB group has a turnover of EUR 3,3 billion. Strip products have a share of 39 percent of the company’s total sales as one fifth comes from sheet production.
Automated Sheet Packing Lines
Pesmel Oy has been selected to supply a new automated sheet packing line to SSAB TunnplÃ¥t AB, BorlÃ¤nge, Sweden and another line with same functions as an option. SSAB has been renewing their finishing areas in the mill sites of BorlÃ¤nge and FinspÃ¥ng. Earlier in 2007, the company invested in four Pesmel coil packing lines. The new sheet packing line is a positive continuum in strengthening the partnership between SSAB and Pesmel. Start up of the line is scheduled to be at the end of 2009.
The new sheet packing line is highly automated with packing capacity of ca. 38 plate bundles an hour. The line is situated after an existing slitter. The plate bundles are packed for further transportation with plastic or paper surface protection, stretch film wrapping around the bundle with automated film roll changing, palletizing with edge protections and strapping functions, weighing, labelling and stacking. All the functions are performed automatically. The high product weight is challenging for the handling equipment as the maximum weight for one sheet bundle is 15 tons and for the stack 32 tons.
Pesmel has a long experience in implementing the latest packaging technologies with the leading industrial companies. Pesmel is one of the pioneers in supplying highly automated packing solutions for metal industry. For metal product packing and handling, Pesmel has references in Europe, USA, India and in China.
Pesmel is a global engineering and technology corporation with net sales over EUR 40 Million. The company employs people in 6 countries and has a worldwide network of representatives, who serve customers in steel, paper and logistic industries.

SSAB: SSAB’s Rights Issue Oversubscribed | Business Wire


























































      SSAB: SSAB’s Rights Issue Oversubscribed
    





June 22, 2016 02:39 AM Eastern Daylight Time



STOCKHOLM--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Regulatory News:
    

      SSAB Svenskt Stål AB (STO:SSABA) (STO:SSABB) (HEX:SSABAH) (HEX:SSABBH)
    

      The preliminary result of SSAB AB’s (publ) (“SSAB”) rights issue, for 
      which the subscription period ended on June 17, 2016, indicates that 
      472,855,180 class B shares, corresponding to approximately 98.4 per cent 
      of the class B shares offered, were subscribed for by the exercise of 
      subscription rights. Additionally, applications for subscription without 
      subscription rights of 190,420,454 class B shares, corresponding to 
      approximately 39.6 per cent of the class B shares offered, have been 
      received. Thus, the rights issue is oversubscribed. As a result of the 
      rights issue, SSAB will receive proceeds amounting to approximately SEK 
      5 billion before transaction costs.
    

      “In the current challenging situation where the steel industry is 
      suffering heavily from global overcapacity, we appreciate the trust 
      shown in us by our existing shareholders and by the interest in SSAB 
      from new investors, who decided to participate in the rights issue. 
      Completion of the rights issue and the refinancing package that we now 
      have in place will enable us to secure SSAB’s long-term possibilities to 
      continue to develop our activities to achieve our goal of 
      industry-leading profitability. A strongly improved financial position 
      will mean we are well placed to take advantage of the opportunities in 
      the market while driving growth in our well-defined focus areas,” said 
      Martin Lindqvist, President and CEO of SSAB.
    

      The final results of the rights issue will be published on or around 
      June 27, 2016. Allotment of shares that were subscribed for without 
      subscription rights will be made in accordance with the principles 
      outlined in the prospectus. Notification regarding the allotment of 
      shares to be registered at Euroclear Sweden and traded on Nasdaq 
      Stockholm will be sent only to those who have been allotted shares. 
      Notification regarding allotment of shares to be registered at Euroclear 
      Finland and traded on Nasdaq Helsinki will be sent both to those who 
      have been allotted shares and to those who have not been allotted 
      shares. As a result of the rights issue, SSAB’s share capital will 
      increase by SEK 4,229,190,380.80 from SEK 4,833,360,488.00 to SEK 
      9,062,550,868.80 in total, and the total number of shares will increase 
      by 480,589,816 from 549,245,510 to 1,029,835,326.
    

      The new class B shares subscribed for with subscription rights are 
      expected to be registered by the Swedish Companies Registration Office 
      (“SCRO”, Sw. Bolagsverket) on or about June 23, 2016. The last day of 
      trading in the interim shares (“BTA”) is expected to be on June 30, 
      2016. Trading of the new class B shares is expected to begin on Nasdaq 
      Stockholm and Nasdaq Helsinki on July 6, 2016.
    

      The new class B shares subscribed for without subscription rights are 
      expected to be registered by the SCRO on or about July 5, 2016 and are 
      expected to start trading on Nasdaq Stockholm and Nasdaq Helsinki on 
      July 7, 2016.

Analyst Ratings
Consensus Ratings for Ssab Svenskt (OTCMKTS:SSAAY) (How are Consensus Ratings Calculated?) MarketBeat calculates consensus ratings using the most recent rating from each brokerage that has rated a stock within the last twelve months. Since brokers often use different ratings systems, each rating is normalized to a standardized rating score of 1 (sell), 2 (hold), 3 (buy) or 4 (strong buy). Consensus ratings scores are calculated using the mean average of the number of normalized sell, hold, buy and strong buy ratings. Each stock's consensus rating is derived from its calculated consensus ratings score (0-1.5 = Sell, 1.5-2.5 = Hold, 2.5-3.5 = Buy, >3.5 = Strong Buy). MarketBeat's consensus price targets are a mean average of the most recent available price targets set by each analyst that has set a price target for the stock in the last twelve months.MarketBeat will no longer include ratings and price target data in its consensus calculation if a broker drops coverage and MarketBeat has received a report that coverage was dropped. Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.Ratings Breakdown: No ratings tracked in the last 12 months.Consensus Rating:N/A (Score: NaN)Consensus Price Target: N/A

How Venezuela chaos could spark oil rally OPEC has failed to achieve 
              
              Political and economic turmoil in Venezuela could fuel a rise in oil prices—something the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, despite it’s efforts to cut back production, hasn’t been able to do.

              Millennials are frequently criticized by market experts for the way they invest—or, more accurately, the way they’re not investing—but recent research indicates that at least some young market participants are going about things in a more sophisticated way than they’re typically given credit for.

The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.

VGM Score

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

Careers




Me & My City gives the first experience of working life
“Me & MyCity was such a nice place to work that even during my free time I was still doing business with customers!”
Rasmus Hiltunen, a sixth grader at Ritaharju school in Oulu, can now write on his CV that he served as SSAB’s sales manager for one day at Me & MyCity. Rasmus, together with other “SSAB employees”, managed to accumulate €10,000 profit for SSAB’s virtual cash register in one day. 
“I just went to get a lot of customers to visit our stand and asked whether they needed a new steel roof,” Rasmus explains his sales strategy.
Located in Oulu, Me & MyCity North Ostrobothia is the northernmost city and is one of eight Me & MyCities across Finland. Me & MyCity is a Finnish education innovation that has received international prizes. It is a learning environment, a miniature city, where around 50 sixth graders work in an occupation and function as consumers and citizens as part of society for a one day. During the school year 2015-2016, Me & MyCity will be visited by more than 40,000 students in Finland.
SSAB is a partner of Me & MyCity North Ostrobothnia. Each day, five sixth graders are acting in SSAB jobs, from factory manager to laboratory employee. 
Rasmus thought that the day got off to a bit of a slow start since everything was new and somewhat strange, but once the biggest excitement was over, the business started to work.
“I knew that selling is one of my strengths, and I didn’t hesitate for a moment whether or not I would be successful in my job. A good team spirit was important, we had to work together like a sports team,” Rasmus recalls.
Rasmus clearly has some salesman’s characteristics
“I was happy to close so many sales,” he says. On the other hand, Rasmus understands that there might be bigger challenges in real life. “When I grow up, I could imagine myself as a sales manager, though it might be a little trickier than here at Me & MyCity.”

Advantages of laser welding:

Different steel grades, thicknesses and strengths can be welded - sheets with different thicknesses can be joined together with a maximum thickness difference 50% thinner sheet.
More freedom in design of final product.
By combining laser welding with large-format laser cutting, we can provide prefabricated parts for large applications.
Time and money savings.
