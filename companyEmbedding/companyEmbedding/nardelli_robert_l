Bob Nardelli being introduced by General Cartwright


Robert Louis "Bob" Nardelli (born May 17, 1948, in Old Forge, Pennsylvania) is an American businessman. He was the chairman and chief executive officer of Chrysler. He had earlier served in a similar capacity at The Home Depot from December 2000 to January 2007. Prior to that, Nardelli had risen to become one of the top four executives at General Electric. Condé Nast Portfolio named Nardelli as one of the "Worst American CEOs of All Time".[1]
He attended Rockford Auburn High School in Rockford, Illinois and received his Bachelor of Science in business from Western Illinois University in Macomb, where he was a member of the Tau Kappa Epsilon fraternity. Nardelli also earned an MBA from the University of Louisville. He is married to Susan L. Schmulbach with four children and attends Roman Catholic church.[2]

General Electric[edit]
He joined General Electric in 1971 as an entry-level manufacturing engineer. From 1988 to 1991, Nardelli was an executive for a division of the construction equipment maker, J. I. Case Company, which was then part of Tenneco.
By 1995, he had risen to president and CEO of GE Power Systems, also having the title of GE senior vice president. Nardelli was often known as "Little Jack", after his mentor Jack Welch, whom Nardelli had ambitions to succeed as CEO of GE. When Jack Welch retired as chairman and CEO of GE, a lengthy and well-publicized succession planning saga ensued. Nardelli competed with James McNerney and Jeffrey R. Immelt to succeed Welch. With Immelt winning the three-way race, Nardelli and McNerney left GE (as was Welch's plan). About 10 minutes after Welch let him go, Nardelli received a job offer from Kenneth Langone, who at the time was on the boards of both GE and The Home Depot.
Home Depot[edit]
Nardelli became CEO of Home Depot in December 2000 despite having no retail experience. Using the Six Sigma management strategy used at GE, he dramatically overhauled the company and replaced its entrepreneurial culture of innovative product design with one focused on relentless cost-cutting.[3] He changed the decentralized management structure by eliminating and consolidating division executives. He also installed processes and streamlined operations, most notably implementing a computerized automated inventory system and centralizing supply orders at the Atlanta headquarters.
His stint is widely noted to be the most "repulsive" in the history of Home Depot. Nardelli's toxic actions served to kill an enduring company culture and turned Home Depot into a laggard.
Nardelli was credited with doubling the sales of the chain and improving its competitive position. Revenue increased from $45.74 billion in 2000 to $81.51 billion in 2005, while net earnings after tax rose from $2.58 billion to $5.84 billion. During Nardelli's tenure, Home Depot stock was essentially steady while competitor Lowe's stock doubled, which along with his $240 million compensation eventually earned the ire of investors.[4] His blunt, critical and autocratic management style turned off employees and the public. Nardelli was notably criticized for cutting back on knowledgeable full-time employees with experience in the trades and replacing them with part-time help with little relevant experience.[5] This move reduced costs, but hurt customer service at a time when Lowe's was making inroads nationwide. While the board strongly stood by him for most of his tenure, questions about his leadership mounted in 2006, and in an ominous portent of the near future, he was the only director present at the annual meeting. At that meeting, he only allowed shareholders to speak for one minute each.[6] When the board reportedly ousted him in January 2007,[7] Nardelli's severance package was estimated at $210 million. He was succeeded by The Home Depot vice chairman and executive vice president, Frank Blake. Blake had served as Nardelli's deputy at both GE Power Systems and Home Depot.
During his tenure at Home Depot, Nardelli met President George W. Bush at the White House in 2002 and was appointed to Bush's Council on Service and Civic Participation (although he is no longer a member).[8] Nardelli also hosted a garden reception/fundraiser for Bush at his Atlanta home on May 20, 2004.[9]
Coca-Cola[edit]
While CEO of Home Depot, Nardelli was also briefly on the Board of Directors for Coca-Cola, starting in 2001.
Chrysler[edit]
On August 5, 2007, he became chairman and CEO of Chrysler, which had recently been taken private by private equity firm, Cerberus Capital Management. His annual salary at Chrysler was $1, with other compensation not publicly disclosed. (It's rumored that the terms were that he wouldn't be paid unless Chrysler succeeded. If they did succeed, he would be paid a salary along the lines of $30 million.)[10]
On February 17, 2008, before his first Daytona 500 race as Chrysler CEO, Nardelli guaranteed that Dodge would win the race for the first time since 2002, and that he would award a $1 million bonus to the Dodge team that did it. Ryan Newman, the driver of the #12 Alltel Dodge, fulfilled this promise, and his car owner Roger Penske collected the $1 million bounty.[11]
On December 4, 2008, in an appearance on CNN's Situation Room with Wolf Blitzer, Nardelli was asked, "So what do you say about the argument that the Japanese, the Germans, Koreans make better cars than the Americans?" He responded, "We spent about half a billion dollars in the first several months. Our warranty costs are down 29%. It's an interesting comparison because in the hearing today, going around the panel, the majority of the Senators said that citing specific vehicles that they own that they've got 60, 70, 80,000 miles. The comment was you guys are making them too good and therefore, we're not buying vehicles and we're contributing to your problem. That was from the Senators on the committee today."[12]
On March 17, 2009, Nardelli said that Chrysler Financial would require a second round of loans.[13] On April 21, 2009, it was alleged by an unnamed "federal watchdog agency" that a $750 million loan from the government was turned down, on the grounds that it would have required that executive compensation be capped. According to contemporary media coverage "as part of the economic stimulus package, Congress approved compensation limits, and the Treasury is working on clarifying what the firms must do to comply with the rules. In other words, the executives were asked to sign the waivers without knowing what specific limits the Treasury might set." [14] On April 30, 2009, Chrysler filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. The same day, Nardelli announced that he would leave the company as soon as the bankruptcy was over, and his replacement was announced (Sergio Marchionne [15]), who would likely face a pay cap.[16]
Freedom Group[edit]
Robert Nardelli became CEO of the Freedom Group in September 2010 as the North Carolina-based gun maker searched for a permanent CEO. In March 2012, he stepped down as CEO of the Freedom Group, and as the head of the operations and advisory business of Cerberus Capital Management LP.[17][18]

If they did succeed, he would be paid a salary along the lines of $30 million.)[10]
On February 17, 2008, before his first Daytona 500 race as Chrysler CEO, Nardelli guaranteed that Dodge would win the race for the first time since 2002, and that he would award a $1 million bonus to the Dodge team that did it. Ryan Newman, the driver of the #12 Alltel Dodge, fulfilled this promise, and his car owner Roger Penske collected the $1 million bounty.[11]
On December 4, 2008, in an appearance on CNN's Situation Room with Wolf Blitzer, Nardelli was asked, "So what do you say about the argument that the Japanese, the Germans, Koreans make better cars than the Americans?" He responded, "We spent about half a billion dollars in the first several months. Our warranty costs are down 29%. It's an interesting comparison because in the hearing today, going around the panel, the majority of the Senators said that citing specific vehicles that they own that they've got 60, 70, 80,000 miles. The comment was you guys are making them too good and therefore, we're not buying vehicles and we're contributing to your problem. That was from the Senators on the committee today."[12]
On March 17, 2009, Nardelli said that Chrysler Financial would require a second round of loans.[13] On April 21, 2009, it was alleged by an unnamed "federal watchdog agency" that a $750 million loan from the government was turned down, on the grounds that it would have required that executive compensation be capped. According to contemporary media coverage "as part of the economic stimulus package, Congress approved compensation limits, and the Treasury is working on clarifying what the firms must do to comply with the rules. In other words, the executives were asked to sign the waivers without knowing what specific limits the Treasury might set." [14] On April 30, 2009, Chrysler filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. The same day, Nardelli announced that he would leave the company as soon as the bankruptcy was over, and his replacement was announced (Sergio Marchionne [15]), who would likely face a pay cap.[16]
Freedom Group[edit]
Robert Nardelli became CEO of the Freedom Group in September 2010 as the North Carolina-based gun maker searched for a permanent CEO. In March 2012, he stepped down as CEO of the Freedom Group, and as the head of the operations and advisory business of Cerberus Capital Management LP.[17][18]

Bob Nardelli being introduced by General Cartwright


Robert Louis "Bob" Nardelli (born May 17, 1948, in Old Forge, Pennsylvania) is an American businessman. He was the chairman and chief executive officer of Chrysler. He had earlier served in a similar capacity at The Home Depot from December 2000 to January 2007. Prior to that, Nardelli had risen to become one of the top four executives at General Electric. Condé Nast Portfolio named Nardelli as one of the "Worst American CEOs of All Time".[1]
He attended Rockford Auburn High School in Rockford, Illinois and received his Bachelor of Science in business from Western Illinois University in Macomb, where he was a member of the Tau Kappa Epsilon fraternity. Nardelli also earned an MBA from the University of Louisville. He is married to Susan L. Schmulbach with four children and attends Roman Catholic church.[2]

General Electric[edit]
He joined General Electric in 1971 as an entry-level manufacturing engineer. From 1988 to 1991, Nardelli was an executive for a division of the construction equipment maker, J. I. Case Company, which was then part of Tenneco.
By 1995, he had risen to president and CEO of GE Power Systems, also having the title of GE senior vice president. Nardelli was often known as "Little Jack", after his mentor Jack Welch, whom Nardelli had ambitions to succeed as CEO of GE. When Jack Welch retired as chairman and CEO of GE, a lengthy and well-publicized succession planning saga ensued. Nardelli competed with James McNerney and Jeffrey R. Immelt to succeed Welch. With Immelt winning the three-way race, Nardelli and McNerney left GE (as was Welch's plan). About 10 minutes after Welch let him go, Nardelli received a job offer from Kenneth Langone, who at the time was on the boards of both GE and The Home Depot.
Home Depot[edit]
Nardelli became CEO of Home Depot in December 2000 despite having no retail experience. Using the Six Sigma management strategy used at GE, he dramatically overhauled the company and replaced its entrepreneurial culture of innovative product design with one focused on relentless cost-cutting.[3] He changed the decentralized management structure by eliminating and consolidating division executives. He also installed processes and streamlined operations, most notably implementing a computerized automated inventory system and centralizing supply orders at the Atlanta headquarters.
His stint is widely noted to be the most "repulsive" in the history of Home Depot. Nardelli's toxic actions served to kill an enduring company culture and turned Home Depot into a laggard.
Nardelli was credited with doubling the sales of the chain and improving its competitive position. Revenue increased from $45.74 billion in 2000 to $81.51 billion in 2005, while net earnings after tax rose from $2.58 billion to $5.84 billion. During Nardelli's tenure, Home Depot stock was essentially steady while competitor Lowe's stock doubled, which along with his $240 million compensation eventually earned the ire of investors.[4] His blunt, critical and autocratic management style turned off employees and the public. Nardelli was notably criticized for cutting back on knowledgeable full-time employees with experience in the trades and replacing them with part-time help with little relevant experience.[5] This move reduced costs, but hurt customer service at a time when Lowe's was making inroads nationwide. While the board strongly stood by him for most of his tenure, questions about his leadership mounted in 2006, and in an ominous portent of the near future, he was the only director present at the annual meeting. At that meeting, he only allowed shareholders to speak for one minute each.[6] When the board reportedly ousted him in January 2007,[7] Nardelli's severance package was estimated at $210 million. He was succeeded by The Home Depot vice chairman and executive vice president, Frank Blake. Blake had served as Nardelli's deputy at both GE Power Systems and Home Depot.
During his tenure at Home Depot, Nardelli met President George W. Bush at the White House in 2002 and was appointed to Bush's Council on Service and Civic Participation (although he is no longer a member).[8] Nardelli also hosted a garden reception/fundraiser for Bush at his Atlanta home on May 20, 2004.[9]
Coca-Cola[edit]
While CEO of Home Depot, Nardelli was also briefly on the Board of Directors for Coca-Cola, starting in 2001.
Chrysler[edit]
On August 5, 2007, he became chairman and CEO of Chrysler, which had recently been taken private by private equity firm, Cerberus Capital Management. His annual salary at Chrysler was $1, with other compensation not publicly disclosed. (It's rumored that the terms were that he wouldn't be paid unless Chrysler succeeded. If they did succeed, he would be paid a salary along the lines of $30 million.)[10]
On February 17, 2008, before his first Daytona 500 race as Chrysler CEO, Nardelli guaranteed that Dodge would win the race for the first time since 2002, and that he would award a $1 million bonus to the Dodge team that did it. Ryan Newman, the driver of the #12 Alltel Dodge, fulfilled this promise, and his car owner Roger Penske collected the $1 million bounty.[11]
On December 4, 2008, in an appearance on CNN's Situation Room with Wolf Blitzer, Nardelli was asked, "So what do you say about the argument that the Japanese, the Germans, Koreans make better cars than the Americans?" He responded, "We spent about half a billion dollars in the first several months. Our warranty costs are down 29%. It's an interesting comparison because in the hearing today, going around the panel, the majority of the Senators said that citing specific vehicles that they own that they've got 60, 70, 80,000 miles. The comment was you guys are making them too good and therefore, we're not buying vehicles and we're contributing to your problem. That was from the Senators on the committee today."[12]
On March 17, 2009, Nardelli said that Chrysler Financial would require a second round of loans.[13] On April 21, 2009, it was alleged by an unnamed "federal watchdog agency" that a $750 million loan from the government was turned down, on the grounds that it would have required that executive compensation be capped.

The same day, Nardelli announced that he would leave the company as soon as the bankruptcy was over, and his replacement was announced (Sergio Marchionne [15]), who would likely face a pay cap.[16]
Freedom Group[edit]
Robert Nardelli became CEO of the Freedom Group in September 2010 as the North Carolina-based gun maker searched for a permanent CEO. In March 2012, he stepped down as CEO of the Freedom Group, and as the head of the operations and advisory business of Cerberus Capital Management LP.[17][18]

Bob Nardelli being introduced by General Cartwright


Robert Louis "Bob" Nardelli (born May 17, 1948, in Old Forge, Pennsylvania) is an American businessman. He was the chairman and chief executive officer of Chrysler. He had earlier served in a similar capacity at The Home Depot from December 2000 to January 2007. Prior to that, Nardelli had risen to become one of the top four executives at General Electric. Condé Nast Portfolio named Nardelli as one of the "Worst American CEOs of All Time".[1]
He attended Rockford Auburn High School in Rockford, Illinois and received his Bachelor of Science in business from Western Illinois University in Macomb, where he was a member of the Tau Kappa Epsilon fraternity. Nardelli also earned an MBA from the University of Louisville. He is married to Susan L. Schmulbach with four children and attends Roman Catholic church.[2]

General Electric[edit]
He joined General Electric in 1971 as an entry-level manufacturing engineer. From 1988 to 1991, Nardelli was an executive for a division of the construction equipment maker, J. I. Case Company, which was then part of Tenneco.
By 1995, he had risen to president and CEO of GE Power Systems, also having the title of GE senior vice president. Nardelli was often known as "Little Jack", after his mentor Jack Welch, whom Nardelli had ambitions to succeed as CEO of GE. When Jack Welch retired as chairman and CEO of GE, a lengthy and well-publicized succession planning saga ensued. Nardelli competed with James McNerney and Jeffrey R. Immelt to succeed Welch. With Immelt winning the three-way race, Nardelli and McNerney left GE (as was Welch's plan). About 10 minutes after Welch let him go, Nardelli received a job offer from Kenneth Langone, who at the time was on the boards of both GE and The Home Depot.
Home Depot[edit]
Nardelli became CEO of Home Depot in December 2000 despite having no retail experience. Using the Six Sigma management strategy used at GE, he dramatically overhauled the company and replaced its entrepreneurial culture of innovative product design with one focused on relentless cost-cutting.[3] He changed the decentralized management structure by eliminating and consolidating division executives. He also installed processes and streamlined operations, most notably implementing a computerized automated inventory system and centralizing supply orders at the Atlanta headquarters.
His stint is widely noted to be the most "repulsive" in the history of Home Depot. Nardelli's toxic actions served to kill an enduring company culture and turned Home Depot into a laggard.
Nardelli was credited with doubling the sales of the chain and improving its competitive position. Revenue increased from $45.74 billion in 2000 to $81.51 billion in 2005, while net earnings after tax rose from $2.58 billion to $5.84 billion. During Nardelli's tenure, Home Depot stock was essentially steady while competitor Lowe's stock doubled, which along with his $240 million compensation eventually earned the ire of investors.[4] His blunt, critical and autocratic management style turned off employees and the public. Nardelli was notably criticized for cutting back on knowledgeable full-time employees with experience in the trades and replacing them with part-time help with little relevant experience.[5] This move reduced costs, but hurt customer service at a time when Lowe's was making inroads nationwide. While the board strongly stood by him for most of his tenure, questions about his leadership mounted in 2006, and in an ominous portent of the near future, he was the only director present at the annual meeting. At that meeting, he only allowed shareholders to speak for one minute each.[6] When the board reportedly ousted him in January 2007,[7] Nardelli's severance package was estimated at $210 million. He was succeeded by The Home Depot vice chairman and executive vice president, Frank Blake. Blake had served as Nardelli's deputy at both GE Power Systems and Home Depot.
During his tenure at Home Depot, Nardelli met President George W. Bush at the White House in 2002 and was appointed to Bush's Council on Service and Civic Participation (although he is no longer a member).[8] Nardelli also hosted a garden reception/fundraiser for Bush at his Atlanta home on May 20, 2004.[9]
Coca-Cola[edit]
While CEO of Home Depot, Nardelli was also briefly on the Board of Directors for Coca-Cola, starting in 2001.
Chrysler[edit]
On August 5, 2007, he became chairman and CEO of Chrysler, which had recently been taken private by private equity firm, Cerberus Capital Management. His annual salary at Chrysler was $1, with other compensation not publicly disclosed. (It's rumored that the terms were that he wouldn't be paid unless Chrysler succeeded. If they did succeed, he would be paid a salary along the lines of $30 million.)[10]
On February 17, 2008, before his first Daytona 500 race as Chrysler CEO, Nardelli guaranteed that Dodge would win the race for the first time since 2002, and that he would award a $1 million bonus to the Dodge team that did it. Ryan Newman, the driver of the #12 Alltel Dodge, fulfilled this promise, and his car owner Roger Penske collected the $1 million bounty.[11]
On December 4, 2008, in an appearance on CNN's Situation Room with Wolf Blitzer, Nardelli was asked, "So what do you say about the argument that the Japanese, the Germans, Koreans make better cars than the Americans?" He responded, "We spent about half a billion dollars in the first several months. Our warranty costs are down 29%. It's an interesting comparison because in the hearing today, going around the panel, the majority of the Senators said that citing specific vehicles that they own that they've got 60, 70, 80,000 miles. The comment was you guys are making them too good and therefore, we're not buying vehicles and we're contributing to your problem. That was from the Senators on the committee today."[12]
On March 17, 2009, Nardelli said that Chrysler Financial would require a second round of loans.[13] On April 21, 2009, it was alleged by an unnamed "federal watchdog agency" that a $750 million loan from the government was turned down, on the grounds that it would have required that executive compensation be capped. According to contemporary media coverage "as part of the economic stimulus package, Congress approved compensation limits, and the Treasury is working on clarifying what the firms must do to comply with the rules. In other words, the executives were asked to sign the waivers without knowing what specific limits the Treasury might set." [14] On April 30, 2009, Chrysler filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. The same day, Nardelli announced that he would leave the company as soon as the bankruptcy was over, and his replacement was announced (Sergio Marchionne [15]), who would likely face a pay cap.[16]
Freedom Group[edit]
Robert Nardelli became CEO of the Freedom Group in September 2010 as the North Carolina-based gun maker searched for a permanent CEO. In March 2012, he stepped down as CEO of the Freedom Group, and as the head of the operations and advisory business of Cerberus Capital Management LP.[17][18]

      ■ After losing the competition to become CEO of General Electric
      (GE), Robert Nardelli was recruited by Home Depot—the
      world's largest home-improvement retailer—as CEO and later
      chairman. He overhauled the company's decentralized management
      structure and replaced its freewheeling,
    




           Robert L. Nardelli. 
          
            AP/World Wide Photos
          
          . 
        


      entrepreneurial culture and its exuberant—some would say
      rowdy—atmosphere with "Six Sigma" managerial
      procedures. Utilizing GE's classic business strategies, Nardelli in
      stalled processes and systems, streamlined operations, moved into new
      markets, and grew Home Depot through acquisitions.
    

      Robert Louis Nardelli was born on May 17, 1948, in Old Forge,
      Pennsylvania. His parents, who had grown up during the Depression,
      instilled in him a strong work ethic. His father had started at GE as an
      hourly worker and rose to plant manager. His mother kept the home for the
      two children and worked as a real estate agent. Nardelli was a mediocre
      student but a star athlete, altar boy, Boy Scout, class officer, yearbook
      editor, and ROTC cadet. He earned a football scholarship to Western
      Illinois University and worked summers paving high ways. Nardelli was
      built too small to fulfill his dream of becoming
       a professional football player and rejected a coach's career as
      too unpredictable. He joined GE as an entry-level manufacturing
      engineer—its lowest salaried position. At night he worked on his
      MBA at the University of Louisville.
    

      AMBITION WAS TO HEAD GE
    

      By the late 1970s Nardelli was asking CEO Jack Welch to analyze his job
      performance. In 1988, after Nardelli had risen to a manufacturing vice
      presidency, he asked Welch for a general management job. Welch refused,
      and Nardelli quit. When Welch tried to talk him into coming back, Nardelli
      made it clear that his ambition was eventually to become CEO of GE.
      Instead, Nardelli became an executive vice president of the Case
      Corporation, an industrial-equipment manufacturer in Racine, Wisconsin. He
      headed the company's worldwide parts and components division and
      was promoted to general manager of Case Construction Equipment, its global
      business.
    

      Nardelli returned to GE in 1991 as chief executive of CAMCO, GE's
      Canadian Appliance Manufacturing Company, based in Toronto. The following
      year he became president and CEO of GE Transportation Systems in Erie,
      Pennsylvania. There he oversaw the change in basic technology from AC to
      DC, doubled the size of the division, and took it global. He modernized
      product lines, expanded services, pacified angry unions, and more than
      doubled the division's profits.
    

      In 1995 Nardelli was named a GE senior vice president and head of GE Power
      Systems in Schenectady, New York. The hundred-year-old manufacturer of gas
      and steam turbines and generators was in deep trouble. The division was
      considered an "old economy" backwater with almost no
      potential for growth. Its regional workforce had shrunk from 29,000 in the
      mid-1970s to only 4,600, with another 28,000 employees worldwide. The
      division's deserted factories were scattered throughout an
      alienated community.
    

      OVERHAULED GE POWER SYSTEMS
    

      To cope with energy-industry cycles and government turmoil around the
      world, Nardelli broadened the company's base. He took advantage of
      opportunities created by industry deregulation and increased power
      demands. He turned outdated manufacturing facilities into high-tech
      service centers for global customers. Nardelli helped formulate a strategy
      called the "metamarket view" to develop different ways for
      the company to serve a single customer. Nardelli reinvested in the core
      products of GE Power Systems, extended its product line, and acquired more
      than 50 energy-related businesses. He shifted from selling products to
      selling services, including long-term contracts to operate facilities.
    

      In 1996 Nardelli instituted Six Sigma Quality Improvement Training at GE
      Power Systems. Pioneered at GE, Six Sigma aimed for the statistical
      near-perfect variation of 3.4 defects per million. It was a business
      process that relied on data rather than individual opinion. Six Sigma
      companies analyzed their processes to discover where defects could occur,
      measured those defects, and attempted to eliminate them.
    

      GE Power Systems became one of GE's most profitable divisions and
      one of the biggest success stories in the company's history. In
      five years Nardelli increased profits almost sevenfold, with half of the
      division's revenue coming from new products. In addition, Nardelli
      repaired relationships with employees and the local community. Old
      factories were transformed into ball fields and green space. He initiated
      annual worker training and continuing education.
    

      PASSED OVER FOR CEO
    

      In an intense three-way competition to become CEO of GE, Welch chose
      Jeffrey Immelt. Nardelli was devastated. At GE he was known as
      "Little Jack." He had worked extraordinarily hard, and Welch
      had put him through many difficult tests. In June 2002 he told Patricia
      Sellers of 
      
        Fortune
      
      : "There was always this rap against me about being functionally
      proficient but not very strategic." Nardelli also had a reputation
      for being somewhat inarticulate.
    

      Nardelli had promised Welch that he would not talk to other companies
      until Welch had made his decision. Within minutes of the announcement,
      Nardelli was offered the presidency of Home Depot. He demanded the
      CEO's job. The Home Depot board was convinced that the company
      needed a sophisticated leader from the outside. In December 2000, after 27
      years at GE, Nardelli moved to Atlanta with a compensation package
      amounting to $24 million in 2001. Although Home Depot cofounders Bernie
      Marcus and Arthur Blank continued on as cochairmen, Nardelli and the board
      soon asked Blank to leave, and Marcus later retired.
    

      Marcus and Blank had a simple business strategy: continuous expansion. In
      24 years they had grown Home Depot from a single warehouse store to a
      1,155-store giant with $46 billion in annual sales. But costs were out of
      control, same-store (stores open for at least a year) sales were flat,
      profit growth had slowed, and the share price had dropped. Lowe's,
      Home Depot's major competitor, was doing far better.
    

      BROUGHT SIX SIGMA TO HOME DEPOT
    

      After the announcement that Home Depot had hired a CEO with no retail
      experience, Nardelli tried to squelch concerns. In January 2001 he told 
      
        Fortune
      
       that his personal management style fit in with Home Depot's
      corporate culture and that of all the companies he had looked at
      "Home Depot most mirrored the way I like to operate." In
      answer to a question
       about imposing GE-style management on Home Depot, Nardelli replied that
      "to move from one social architecture and operating system and
      assume it's 100% portable and the platform of understanding is
      there at the new place—that's a terrible mistake." In
      response to a question about GE executives who were unsuccessful as
      outside CEOs, Nardelli told Patricia Sellers in a March 2001 
      
        Fortune
      
       story that those executives "didn't realize they were in a
      different environment. They did not have the respect of the culture and
      weren't sensitive to the pride of the employees."
      Nevertheless, most of the 250,000 Home Depot employees had never heard of
      Bob Nardelli, and some company veterans were openly hostile.
    

      His first day on the job, Nardelli was astonished to discover that Home
      Depot lacked the infrastructure to send a companywide e-mail. Its stores
      did not have automated inventory systems; shipments were logged with
      clipboard and pencil. Home Depot stores were run-down and had a reputation
      for poor customer service.
    

      Nardelli believed that better processes led to better quality and higher
      profits. He increased information technology spending by 20 percent. In
      2003 he spent $400 million on inventory shipping and tracking systems. He
      substituted 157 different employee evaluation forms with two. Salaried
      personnel from the CEO down were to be rated by coworkers, above and
      beneath them, and salaries were based on the scores. At a time when Home
      Depot was planning to hire about 100,000 new employees, Nardelli did not
      necessarily fire those with poor scores. He first sought the advice of
      others and told underperformers exactly what they were doing wrong.
      Nardelli created a leadership institute, modeled on GE's, to groom
      high-potential managers, teaching them all aspects of merchandizing,
      management, and, of course, Six Sigma. Although Home Depot had tried to
      implement Six Sigma earlier, it rarely had been used for retail
      businesses.
    

      RESTRUCTURED THE COMPANY
    

      Although efficiency had never been a big priority at Home Depot, it was
      Nardelli's operating principle. The company had outgrown its
      laissez-faire "do-it-yourself" management style. Nardelli
      replaced Home Depot's decentralized structure of local store
      managers with a technologically sophisticated command center. In his first
      six weeks he eliminated an entire management layer. He combined divisions
      and reassigned or eliminated group presidents, with all U.S. division
      presidents reporting directly to him. Of the 39 senior managers, 24 left
      and were replaced by managers—many of whom came from GE—with
      no retail experience.
    

      In January 2004 Nardelli told 
      
        Institutional Investor
      
       "We've gone from 1,600 separate businesses under one banner
      to one brand with 1,600 stores. We went from nine buying offices to
      one." Centralized management meant better supplier prices and
      increased margins. Orders were routed from central purchasing in Atlanta,
      through transfer centers, to stores. Local suppliers were squeezed out,
      and Nardelli began buying out wholesalers. However, the new shipping
      systems required lower inventories, leaving some stores sold out of
      popular merchandise, such as electronics. Cutting inventories while
      pushing managers to move products resulted in fewer reorders. Home
      Depot's regional managers, used to cutting their own deals with
      suppliers, resisted their loss of control; many opted out and took early
      retirement.
    

      Analysts began worrying that the company was changing too fast. Nardelli
      was criticized for dismantling the decentralized structure before
      investing in the information technology required for centralized
      management. However, between 2000 and 2002 annual earnings increased 30
      percent to $3.7 billion. By June 2002 Home Depot was 18th on the Fortune
      500, valued at $53 billion—the largest American retailer after
      Wal-Mart.
    

      Upon his arrival, Nardelli immediately instituted cost-cutting measures.
      He slashed the number of new Home Depot stores scheduled to open in 2001
      from 225 to 200. He cut fulltime jobs, capped wages, and recruited former
      military officers to run the stores. Staff morale and customer service
      began to collapse under the new regime. The number of part-time employees
      skyrocketed from 26 percent to as high as 50 percent in 2002. Nardelli
      argued that additional part-timers were needed to increase weekend staff,
      since the stores were now open on Sundays. In addition, for the first time
      Home Depot offered benefits to part-time workers and included them in its
      bonus program. Employee tuition reimbursements also were increased.
      Meanwhile, Lowe's kept full-time employment at 80 percent,
      resulting in better customer service. Nardelli eventually reversed
      direction, and the stores began to hire more full-timers.
    

      Nardelli changed Home Depot's trademark open-return policy and
      began requiring receipts for cash returns, saving the company $10 million
      annually. He ended Home Depot's traditional—but
      costly—promotional sales. After eliminating more than $1 billion in
      inventory in 2002, there was no need for inventory-clearance sales.
    

      CONCENTRATED ON CUSTOMER SERVICE
    

      In 2001 Nardelli introduced his Service Performance Initiative, which
      called for increased night restocking to avoid forklifts in the aisles and
      freed up personnel for customer service. Employees began to spend 70
      percent of their time on customers rather than on restocking.
      "Racetrack managers" at each store circulated through the
      high-volume aisles to improve service.
    

      Nardelli spent $250 million refurbishing Home Depot stores. Self-checkout
      systems were installed in 800 stores to reduce
       customer lines and free up salespeople. Two-way cordless scanners allowed
      products to be price-scanned in the shopping cart, thereby shortening
      lines. Nardelli began eliminating lowturnover items and permitted stores
      to tailor their offerings to local markets. Lowe's was considered
      to be more "femalefriendly" than Home Depot, so Nardelli
      upgraded stores and merchandise to appeal to women. Design Place
      home-decor departments opened in more stores, and small appliances,
      lighting, and lamp selections were expanded in an attempt to attract more
      female customers.
    

      EXPANDED THE BUSINESS
    

      Supplying professional builders and contractors—who spend three
      times as much as do-it-yourselfers—became a top priority for
      Nardelli in 2002. He introduced "pro desks" and PRO stores
      to compete with independent wholesalers. Centralization enabled Home Depot
      to service corporate accounts. It began selling to Disney and gained
      exclusive rights to carry Disney furnishings and paints.
    

      In 2003 Nardelli greatly increased Home Depot's services, adding
      carpet-laying, siding installation, heating, ventilation, installation of
      air-conditioning systems, high-end landscaping, appliance repair, pest
      control, home security, and tool rental. He expanded appliance sales,
      adding more brands and increasing appliance showrooms. Nardelli also
      launched an in-store campaign that promoted energy-efficient products.
    

      Nardelli concentrated new stores in urban areas with apartment dwellers.
      Home Depot came to downtown Chicago and Brooklyn, New York. Two Manhattan
      stores opened in 2004. However, some experiments with new-format stores
      failed and were replaced with traditional Home Depots. Nardelli acquired
      Total Home, Mexico's second-largest home-improvement retailer. By
      the end of 2003 Home Depot had a new store opening in Canada, the United
      States, or Mexico virtually every 43 hours. In 2004 Nardelli began to
      expand the business into China.
    

      MANAGEMENT STYLE
    

      Nardelli brought to Home Depot his strong personality, aggressiveness, and
      GE discipline. In 2001 the analyst Donald Trott told Jennifer Pellet of 
      
        Chief Executive
      
      : "With Bernie and Arthur, the approach culturally was,
      'We're part of the troops like you guys and we're
      going into battle with you.' But Nardelli does not look comfortable
      in that orange apron. His body language is more 'I am the general
      up on the hill with the binoculars; you guys go take on the
      enemy.'" Calling his executives in for weekend meetings,
      Nardelli reminded them that it was not a job but a life. Whereas Blank and
      Marcus had motivated employees with hugs and cheers, Nardelli sometimes
      motivated them by instilling fear.
    

      Whereas the 10 people who had reported to Blank were brought together for
      a quarterly business review, Nardelli had 21 individuals reporting
      directly to him at Monday-morning meetings or two-hour "market
      intelligence" conference calls. He demanded their data and action
      plans. In November 2001 Dennis M. Donovan, who came from GE with Nardelli
      as his number-two person, told 
      
        BusinessWeek
      
      : "Never show him a number you don't want to deliver,
      because he will remember." Some Home Depot veterans quit, while
      others felt respected and valued by Nardelli.
    

      Nardelli had learned from Welch that teaching was a big part of a
      CEO's job. He met with employees considered to be on the way up. In
      November 2000 Lonnie Edelheit, a senior adviser at GE, told 
      
        Capital District Business Review
      
      : "He is very open and positive. He's intense. He demands a
      lot from people, but he gives a lot too." Although he was thought
      of as an extremely serious person, Nardelli was famous for throwing lavish
      parties.
    

      Nardelli was known for his directness. He held town hall-style meetings,
      sent out biweekly company-wide e-mails, and made a habit of visiting
      individual stores. He sometimes gave pay raises on the spot, as well as
      frank assessments of employee performance and future prospects with the
      company.
    

      In March 2001 Nardelli told Sellers at 
      
        Fortune
      
      : "What I'm known for is transferring best practices.
      That's particularly important in this economic environment, when
      you have to maximize revenues through existing assets." He summed
      up his philosophy in a June 2002 
      
        Fortune
      
       interview: "There is an infinite capacity to improve upon
      everything you do."
    

      THE BOTTOM LINE
    

      Nardelli's transition proved to be much more difficult than
      expected. By January 2003 Home Depot's stock price was down 50
      percent from its December 2000 level. Analysts questioned
      Nardelli's ability to transform and run a large retail business and
      worried that he was trying to impose manufacturing-type processes on a
      retail business. Some analysts worried that the home-improvement market
      was saturated. Others blamed customer dissatisfaction with a new, overly
      ambitious inventory and staff changes that disrupted service. Nardelli
      blamed a poor economic and retail climate and deflated lumber prices that
      accounted for 15 percent of Home Depot's sales.
    

      However, by the end of 2003 Home Depot was operating more than 1,750
      stores in the United States, Canada, Puerto Rico, and Mexico and had
      posted a net income of $4.3 billion on $64.8 billion in sales, with a 162
      percent increase in profits. By January 2004 cash reserves were at a
      record $5.3 billion, compared with minus $800 million when Nardelli
      arrived. Home Depot, with more than 300,000 employees, planned to
       open 185 new stores in 2004 and was buying up abandoned Kmart properties.
      However, at Home Depot's 2004 annual meeting shareholders objected
      to Nardelli's extravagant compensation package and continued to
      complain about poor customer service.
    

      In 2003 Nardelli served as a director of the Coca-Cola Company and was a
      member of the President's Council on Service and Civic
      Participation. He also served as a member of the board of councillors of
      the Carter Center, a leadership-advisory group.

      ■ After losing the competition to become CEO of General Electric
      (GE), Robert Nardelli was recruited by Home Depot—the
      world's largest home-improvement retailer—as CEO and later
      chairman. He overhauled the company's decentralized management
      structure and replaced its freewheeling,

          . 
        


      entrepreneurial culture and its exuberant—some would say
      rowdy—atmosphere with "Six Sigma" managerial
      procedures. Utilizing GE's classic business strategies, Nardelli in
      stalled processes and systems, streamlined operations, moved into new
      markets, and grew Home Depot through acquisitions.
    

      Robert Louis Nardelli was born on May 17, 1948, in Old Forge,
      Pennsylvania. His parents, who had grown up during the Depression,
      instilled in him a strong work ethic. His father had started at GE as an
      hourly worker and rose to plant manager. His mother kept the home for the
      two children and worked as a real estate agent. Nardelli was a mediocre
      student but a star athlete, altar boy, Boy Scout, class officer, yearbook
      editor, and ROTC cadet. He earned a football scholarship to Western
      Illinois University and worked summers paving high ways. Nardelli was
      built too small to fulfill his dream of becoming
       a professional football player and rejected a coach's career as
      too unpredictable. He joined GE as an entry-level manufacturing
      engineer—its lowest salaried position. At night he worked on his
      MBA at the University of Louisville.
    

      AMBITION WAS TO HEAD GE
    

      By the late 1970s Nardelli was asking CEO Jack Welch to analyze his job
      performance. In 1988, after Nardelli had risen to a manufacturing vice
      presidency, he asked Welch for a general management job. Welch refused,
      and Nardelli quit. When Welch tried to talk him into coming back, Nardelli
      made it clear that his ambition was eventually to become CEO of GE.
      Instead, Nardelli became an executive vice president of the Case
      Corporation, an industrial-equipment manufacturer in Racine, Wisconsin. He
      headed the company's worldwide parts and components division and
      was promoted to general manager of Case Construction Equipment, its global
      business.
    

      Nardelli returned to GE in 1991 as chief executive of CAMCO, GE's
      Canadian Appliance Manufacturing Company, based in Toronto. The following
      year he became president and CEO of GE Transportation Systems in Erie,
      Pennsylvania. There he oversaw the change in basic technology from AC to
      DC, doubled the size of the division, and took it global. He modernized
      product lines, expanded services, pacified angry unions, and more than
      doubled the division's profits.
    

      In 1995 Nardelli was named a GE senior vice president and head of GE Power
      Systems in Schenectady, New York. The hundred-year-old manufacturer of gas
      and steam turbines and generators was in deep trouble. The division was
      considered an "old economy" backwater with almost no
      potential for growth. Its regional workforce had shrunk from 29,000 in the
      mid-1970s to only 4,600, with another 28,000 employees worldwide. The
      division's deserted factories were scattered throughout an
      alienated community.
    

      OVERHAULED GE POWER SYSTEMS
    

      To cope with energy-industry cycles and government turmoil around the
      world, Nardelli broadened the company's base. He took advantage of
      opportunities created by industry deregulation and increased power
      demands. He turned outdated manufacturing facilities into high-tech
      service centers for global customers. Nardelli helped formulate a strategy
      called the "metamarket view" to develop different ways for
      the company to serve a single customer. Nardelli reinvested in the core
      products of GE Power Systems, extended its product line, and acquired more
      than 50 energy-related businesses. He shifted from selling products to
      selling services, including long-term contracts to operate facilities.
    

      In 1996 Nardelli instituted Six Sigma Quality Improvement Training at GE
      Power Systems. Pioneered at GE, Six Sigma aimed for the statistical
      near-perfect variation of 3.4 defects per million. It was a business
      process that relied on data rather than individual opinion. Six Sigma
      companies analyzed their processes to discover where defects could occur,
      measured those defects, and attempted to eliminate them.
    

      GE Power Systems became one of GE's most profitable divisions and
      one of the biggest success stories in the company's history. In
      five years Nardelli increased profits almost sevenfold, with half of the
      division's revenue coming from new products. In addition, Nardelli
      repaired relationships with employees and the local community. Old
      factories were transformed into ball fields and green space. He initiated
      annual worker training and continuing education.
    

      PASSED OVER FOR CEO
    

      In an intense three-way competition to become CEO of GE, Welch chose
      Jeffrey Immelt. Nardelli was devastated. At GE he was known as
      "Little Jack." He had worked extraordinarily hard, and Welch
      had put him through many difficult tests. In June 2002 he told Patricia
      Sellers of 
      
        Fortune
      
      : "There was always this rap against me about being functionally
      proficient but not very strategic." Nardelli also had a reputation
      for being somewhat inarticulate.
    

      Nardelli had promised Welch that he would not talk to other companies
      until Welch had made his decision. Within minutes of the announcement,
      Nardelli was offered the presidency of Home Depot. He demanded the
      CEO's job. The Home Depot board was convinced that the company
      needed a sophisticated leader from the outside. In December 2000, after 27
      years at GE, Nardelli moved to Atlanta with a compensation package
      amounting to $24 million in 2001. Although Home Depot cofounders Bernie
      Marcus and Arthur Blank continued on as cochairmen, Nardelli and the board
      soon asked Blank to leave, and Marcus later retired.
    

      Marcus and Blank had a simple business strategy: continuous expansion. In
      24 years they had grown Home Depot from a single warehouse store to a
      1,155-store giant with $46 billion in annual sales. But costs were out of
      control, same-store (stores open for at least a year) sales were flat,
      profit growth had slowed, and the share price had dropped. Lowe's,
      Home Depot's major competitor, was doing far better.
    

      BROUGHT SIX SIGMA TO HOME DEPOT
    

      After the announcement that Home Depot had hired a CEO with no retail
      experience, Nardelli tried to squelch concerns. In January 2001 he told 
      
        Fortune
      
       that his personal management style fit in with Home Depot's
      corporate culture and that of all the companies he had looked at
      "Home Depot most mirrored the way I like to operate." In
      answer to a question
       about imposing GE-style management on Home Depot, Nardelli replied that
      "to move from one social architecture and operating system and
      assume it's 100% portable and the platform of understanding is
      there at the new place—that's a terrible mistake." In
      response to a question about GE executives who were unsuccessful as
      outside CEOs, Nardelli told Patricia Sellers in a March 2001 
      
        Fortune
      
       story that those executives "didn't realize they were in a
      different environment. They did not have the respect of the culture and
      weren't sensitive to the pride of the employees."
      Nevertheless, most of the 250,000 Home Depot employees had never heard of
      Bob Nardelli, and some company veterans were openly hostile.
    

      His first day on the job, Nardelli was astonished to discover that Home
      Depot lacked the infrastructure to send a companywide e-mail. Its stores
      did not have automated inventory systems; shipments were logged with
      clipboard and pencil. Home Depot stores were run-down and had a reputation
      for poor customer service.
    

      Nardelli believed that better processes led to better quality and higher
      profits. He increased information technology spending by 20 percent. In
      2003 he spent $400 million on inventory shipping and tracking systems. He
      substituted 157 different employee evaluation forms with two. Salaried
      personnel from the CEO down were to be rated by coworkers, above and
      beneath them, and salaries were based on the scores. At a time when Home
      Depot was planning to hire about 100,000 new employees, Nardelli did not
      necessarily fire those with poor scores. He first sought the advice of
      others and told underperformers exactly what they were doing wrong.
      Nardelli created a leadership institute, modeled on GE's, to groom
      high-potential managers, teaching them all aspects of merchandizing,
      management, and, of course, Six Sigma. Although Home Depot had tried to
      implement Six Sigma earlier, it rarely had been used for retail
      businesses.
    

      RESTRUCTURED THE COMPANY
    

      Although efficiency had never been a big priority at Home Depot, it was
      Nardelli's operating principle. The company had outgrown its
      laissez-faire "do-it-yourself" management style. Nardelli
      replaced Home Depot's decentralized structure of local store
      managers with a technologically sophisticated command center. In his first
      six weeks he eliminated an entire management layer. He combined divisions
      and reassigned or eliminated group presidents, with all U.S. division
      presidents reporting directly to him. Of the 39 senior managers, 24 left
      and were replaced by managers—many of whom came from GE—with
      no retail experience.
    

      In January 2004 Nardelli told 
      
        Institutional Investor
      
       "We've gone from 1,600 separate businesses under one banner
      to one brand with 1,600 stores. We went from nine buying offices to
      one." Centralized management meant better supplier prices and
      increased margins. Orders were routed from central purchasing in Atlanta,
      through transfer centers, to stores. Local suppliers were squeezed out,
      and Nardelli began buying out wholesalers. However, the new shipping
      systems required lower inventories, leaving some stores sold out of
      popular merchandise, such as electronics. Cutting inventories while
      pushing managers to move products resulted in fewer reorders. Home
      Depot's regional managers, used to cutting their own deals with
      suppliers, resisted their loss of control; many opted out and took early
      retirement.
    

      Analysts began worrying that the company was changing too fast. Nardelli
      was criticized for dismantling the decentralized structure before
      investing in the information technology required for centralized
      management. However, between 2000 and 2002 annual earnings increased 30
      percent to $3.7 billion. By June 2002 Home Depot was 18th on the Fortune
      500, valued at $53 billion—the largest American retailer after
      Wal-Mart.
    

      Upon his arrival, Nardelli immediately instituted cost-cutting measures.
      He slashed the number of new Home Depot stores scheduled to open in 2001
      from 225 to 200. He cut fulltime jobs, capped wages, and recruited former
      military officers to run the stores. Staff morale and customer service
      began to collapse under the new regime. The number of part-time employees
      skyrocketed from 26 percent to as high as 50 percent in 2002. Nardelli
      argued that additional part-timers were needed to increase weekend staff,
      since the stores were now open on Sundays. In addition, for the first time
      Home Depot offered benefits to part-time workers and included them in its
      bonus program. Employee tuition reimbursements also were increased.
      Meanwhile, Lowe's kept full-time employment at 80 percent,
      resulting in better customer service. Nardelli eventually reversed
      direction, and the stores began to hire more full-timers.
    

      Nardelli changed Home Depot's trademark open-return policy and
      began requiring receipts for cash returns, saving the company $10 million
      annually. He ended Home Depot's traditional—but
      costly—promotional sales. After eliminating more than $1 billion in
      inventory in 2002, there was no need for inventory-clearance sales.
    

      CONCENTRATED ON CUSTOMER SERVICE
    

      In 2001 Nardelli introduced his Service Performance Initiative, which
      called for increased night restocking to avoid forklifts in the aisles and
      freed up personnel for customer service. Employees began to spend 70
      percent of their time on customers rather than on restocking.
      "Racetrack managers" at each store circulated through the
      high-volume aisles to improve service.
    

      Nardelli spent $250 million refurbishing Home Depot stores. Self-checkout
      systems were installed in 800 stores to reduce
       customer lines and free up salespeople. Two-way cordless scanners allowed
      products to be price-scanned in the shopping cart, thereby shortening
      lines. Nardelli began eliminating lowturnover items and permitted stores
      to tailor their offerings to local markets. Lowe's was considered
      to be more "femalefriendly" than Home Depot, so Nardelli
      upgraded stores and merchandise to appeal to women. Design Place
      home-decor departments opened in more stores, and small appliances,
      lighting, and lamp selections were expanded in an attempt to attract more
      female customers.
    

      EXPANDED THE BUSINESS
    

      Supplying professional builders and contractors—who spend three
      times as much as do-it-yourselfers—became a top priority for
      Nardelli in 2002. He introduced "pro desks" and PRO stores
      to compete with independent wholesalers. Centralization enabled Home Depot
      to service corporate accounts. It began selling to Disney and gained
      exclusive rights to carry Disney furnishings and paints.
    

      In 2003 Nardelli greatly increased Home Depot's services, adding
      carpet-laying, siding installation, heating, ventilation, installation of
      air-conditioning systems, high-end landscaping, appliance repair, pest
      control, home security, and tool rental. He expanded appliance sales,
      adding more brands and increasing appliance showrooms. Nardelli also
      launched an in-store campaign that promoted energy-efficient products.
    

      Nardelli concentrated new stores in urban areas with apartment dwellers.
      Home Depot came to downtown Chicago and Brooklyn, New York. Two Manhattan
      stores opened in 2004. However, some experiments with new-format stores
      failed and were replaced with traditional Home Depots. Nardelli acquired
      Total Home, Mexico's second-largest home-improvement retailer. By
      the end of 2003 Home Depot had a new store opening in Canada, the United
      States, or Mexico virtually every 43 hours. In 2004 Nardelli began to
      expand the business into China.
    

      MANAGEMENT STYLE
    

      Nardelli brought to Home Depot his strong personality, aggressiveness, and
      GE discipline. In 2001 the analyst Donald Trott told Jennifer Pellet of 
      
        Chief Executive
      
      : "With Bernie and Arthur, the approach culturally was,
      'We're part of the troops like you guys and we're
      going into battle with you.' But Nardelli does not look comfortable
      in that orange apron. His body language is more 'I am the general
      up on the hill with the binoculars; you guys go take on the
      enemy.'" Calling his executives in for weekend meetings,
      Nardelli reminded them that it was not a job but a life. Whereas Blank and
      Marcus had motivated employees with hugs and cheers, Nardelli sometimes
      motivated them by instilling fear.
    

      Whereas the 10 people who had reported to Blank were brought together for
      a quarterly business review, Nardelli had 21 individuals reporting
      directly to him at Monday-morning meetings or two-hour "market
      intelligence" conference calls. He demanded their data and action
      plans. In November 2001 Dennis M. Donovan, who came from GE with Nardelli
      as his number-two person, told 
      
        BusinessWeek
      
      : "Never show him a number you don't want to deliver,
      because he will remember." Some Home Depot veterans quit, while
      others felt respected and valued by Nardelli.
    

      Nardelli had learned from Welch that teaching was a big part of a
      CEO's job. He met with employees considered to be on the way up. In
      November 2000 Lonnie Edelheit, a senior adviser at GE, told 
      
        Capital District Business Review
      
      : "He is very open and positive. He's intense. He demands a
      lot from people, but he gives a lot too." Although he was thought
      of as an extremely serious person, Nardelli was famous for throwing lavish
      parties.
    

      Nardelli was known for his directness. He held town hall-style meetings,
      sent out biweekly company-wide e-mails, and made a habit of visiting
      individual stores. He sometimes gave pay raises on the spot, as well as
      frank assessments of employee performance and future prospects with the
      company.
    

      In March 2001 Nardelli told Sellers at 
      
        Fortune
      
      : "What I'm known for is transferring best practices.
      That's particularly important in this economic environment, when
      you have to maximize revenues through existing assets." He summed
      up his philosophy in a June 2002 
      
        Fortune
      
       interview: "There is an infinite capacity to improve upon
      everything you do."
    

      THE BOTTOM LINE
    

      Nardelli's transition proved to be much more difficult than
      expected. By January 2003 Home Depot's stock price was down 50
      percent from its December 2000 level. Analysts questioned
      Nardelli's ability to transform and run a large retail business and
      worried that he was trying to impose manufacturing-type processes on a
      retail business. Some analysts worried that the home-improvement market
      was saturated. Others blamed customer dissatisfaction with a new, overly
      ambitious inventory and staff changes that disrupted service. Nardelli
      blamed a poor economic and retail climate and deflated lumber prices that
      accounted for 15 percent of Home Depot's sales.
    

      However, by the end of 2003 Home Depot was operating more than 1,750
      stores in the United States, Canada, Puerto Rico, and Mexico and had
      posted a net income of $4.3 billion on $64.8 billion in sales, with a 162
      percent increase in profits. By January 2004 cash reserves were at a
      record $5.3 billion, compared with minus $800 million when Nardelli
      arrived. Home Depot, with more than 300,000 employees, planned to
       open 185 new stores in 2004 and was buying up abandoned Kmart properties.
      However, at Home Depot's 2004 annual meeting shareholders objected
      to Nardelli's extravagant compensation package and continued to
      complain about poor customer service.
    

      In 2003 Nardelli served as a director of the Coca-Cola Company and was a
      member of the President's Council on Service and Civic
      Participation. He also served as a member of the board of councillors of
      the Carter Center, a leadership-advisory group.

Hang onto those old Rems boys.  They'll be worth a lot after he sells the company to the Chinese - or butchers it and closes the shop.

It's too bad really, with Remington finally jumping into the handgun game....

Sad. Nardelli will wring cash out and leave a poor-service shell. Again.

Same guy.  Cerberus is the group that owns Chrysler, and also Freedom Group.  I believe Nardelli will still be a board member.

I've been leery of what Freedom Group will do to "our" industry since their outset.  IMO, one of the great strengths of the shooting sports is that the industry is still firmly rooted in relatively small businesses, bearing "old-fashioned" values with respect to quality and service.  You can actually get a person on the phone.  They stand by their products.  You can get information easily.

What's happened with Freedom?  Well, I know a few plants have already been "synergized," though the rest remains to be seen.  I truly hope this level of corporate "structure" stays an anomaly in the field of firearms.

Oh, geez, I hope it's not the same guy.  But how many people at that level in business are named "Nardelli"?

Isn't this the guy that ruined Home Depot and Chrysler? I hope not.
