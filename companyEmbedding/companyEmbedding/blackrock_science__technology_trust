Overview






Investment Approach
BlackRock Science and Technology Trust (BST), is a perpetual closed-end equity fund. BST commenced operations in October 2014 with the investment objectives of providing income and total return through a combination of current income, current gains and long-term capital appreciation. Under normal market conditions, the Trust will invest at least 80% of its total assets in equity securities issued by U.S. and non-U.S. science and technology companies in any market capitalization range, selected for their rapid and sustainable growth potential from the development, advancement and use of science and/or technology (high growth science and technology stocks), and/or potential to generate current income from advantageous dividend yields (cyclical science and technology stocks). As part of its investment strategy, the Trust intends to employ a strategy of writing (selling) covered call options on a portion of the common stocks in its portfolio.

Important announcement regarding BST private placement holdings: 
As of 08/18/15, the Trust was invested in five private placements, representing approximately 3.2% of the Trust’s AUM. The private investments include Didi Kuaidi, Illumio, Snapdeal, Uber and Zuora. The Trust participated in two private deals over the past couple months, Didi Kuaidi and Snapdeal, and continues to evaluate prospective new deals, looking to potentially make additional investments in the future.

Missing calendar year returns data 






The performance quoted represents past performance and does not guarantee future results. Investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate so that an investor’s shares, may be worth more or less than the original cost. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance quoted. 
Returns are shown net of advisory fees paid by the fund and net of the fund’s operating fees and expenses. Investors who purchase shares of the fund through an investment adviser or other financial professional may separately pay a fee to that service provider. Past performance is not indicative of future results.






Growth of Hypothetical $10,000 The growth of hypothetical $10,000 chart reflects a hypothetical $10,000 investment and assumes reinvestment of dividends and capital gains. Fund expenses, including management fees and other expenses were deducted.

Total Distribution Current year distributions are not classified as “Income,” “Short-Term Capital Gains,” “Long-Term Capital Gains,” or “Return of Capital” until calendar year-end.











Past distributions are not indicative of future distributions.

If a Fund estimates that it has distributed more than its income and net realized capital gains in the current fiscal year; a portion of its distribution may be a return of capital. A return of capital may occur, for example, when some or all of a shareholder's investment is paid back to the shareholder. A return of capital distribution does not necessarily reflect a Fund's investment performance and should not be confused with 'yield' or 'income'. When distributions exceed total return performance, the difference will reduce the Fund's net asset value per share. Although the character of income will not be determined until the end of the fund’s fiscal year, please refer to the 'Closed-End Fund Resources' section of the BlackRock website for Section 19 notices that provide estimated amounts and sources of the fund's distributions, which should not be not be relied upon for tax reporting purposes. A Form 1099-DIV for the calendar year will be sent to shareholders to illustrate how the Fund’s distributions should be reported for federal income tax purposes.

Important Information

 

Carefully consider the Funds' investment objectives, risk factors, and charges and expenses before investing. This and other information can be found in the Funds' prospectuses or, if available, the summary prospectuses which may be obtained by visiting the iShares Fund and BlackRock Fund prospectus pages. Read the prospectus carefully before investing.


Common shares for most of the closed-end funds identified above are only available for purchase and sale at current market price on a stock exchange. A closed-end fund’s dividend yield, market price and NAV will fluctuate with market conditions. The information for these funds is provided for informational purposes only and does not constitute a solicitation of an offer to buy or sell Fund shares.


Performance results reflect past performance and are no guarantee of future results. Investment return and principal value of shares will fluctuate so that shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. All returns assume reinvestment of all dividends. Performance information shown without sales charge would have been lower if the applicable sales charge had been included. Performance during periods of exceptional market conditions should not be expected to be repeated in a normal market environment. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance data quoted. Investing involves risk, including possible loss of principal.Fund details, holdings and characteristics are as of the date noted and subject to change. Yields are based on income earned for the period cited and on the Fund's NAV at the end of the period. Some BlackRock funds make distributions of ordinary income and capital gains at calendar year end. Those distributions temporarily cause extraordinarily high yields. There is no assurance that a fund will repeat that yield in the future. Subsequent monthly distributions that do not include ordinary income or capital gains in the form of dividends will likely be lower.


The Funds are distributed by BlackRock Investments, LLC (together with its affiliates, “BlackRock”).

BlackRock Science and Technology Trust Announces Initial Distribution






December 08, 2014 06:00 PM Eastern Standard Time



NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--The Board of Trustees of BlackRock Science and Technology Trust 
      (NYSE:BST) (the “Trust”) announced today the Trust’s initial monthly 
      distribution, payable on December 31, 2014. Details are as follows:

      * The yield on the IPO price shown above is calculated by 
      dividing the initial dividend rate by the Trust’s IPO price of $20.00 
      per share and annualizing the results.
    

      The Trust has adopted a level distribution plan, consistent with its 
      investment objectives and policies to support a level distribution of 
      income, capital gains and/or return of capital (a “Plan”). The fixed 
      amount distributed per share is subject to change at the discretion of 
      the Trust’s Board of Trustees. Under the Plan, the Trust will 
      distribute all available investment income to its shareholders, 
      consistent with its investment objectives and as required by the 
      Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. If sufficient investment 
      income is not available on a monthly basis, the Trust will distribute 
      long-term capital gains and/or return capital to its shareholders in 
      order to maintain a level distribution.

Forward-Looking Statements


      This press release, and other statements that BlackRock or the Trust may 
      make, may contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the 
      Private Securities Litigation Reform Act, with respect to the Trust or 
      BlackRock’s future financial or business performance, strategies or 
      expectations. Forward-looking statements are typically identified by 
      words or phrases such as “trend,” “potential,” “opportunity,” 
      “pipeline,” “believe,” “comfortable,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “current,” 
      “intention,” “estimate,” “position,” “assume,” “outlook,” “continue,” 
      “remain,” “maintain,” “sustain,” “seek,” “achieve,” and similar 
      expressions, or future or conditional verbs such as “will,” “would,” 
      “should,” “could,” “may” or similar expressions.
    

      BlackRock cautions that forward-looking statements are subject to 
      numerous assumptions, risks and uncertainties, which change over time. 
      Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and 
      BlackRock assumes no duty to and does not undertake to update 
      forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from 
      those anticipated in forward-looking statements and future results could 
      differ materially from historical performance.
    

      With respect to the Trust, the following factors, among others, could 
      cause actual events to differ materially from forward-looking statements 
      or historical performance: (1) changes and volatility in political, 
      economic or industry conditions, the interest rate environment, foreign
