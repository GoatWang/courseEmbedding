Recovery of Redwood Mortgage Investors VIII




(Last Updated On: July 17, 2015)Have you suffered financial losses as a result of your purchase of Redwood Mortgage Investors VIII (RMI VIII)? If so, The White Law Group may be able to help you recover your investment losses through a FINRA arbitration claim against the broker dealer that recommended this product.
According to Redwood’s website, the company, founded in 1978, is a mortgage lender that provides ” tailor-made loan solutions secured by residential, multi-family, commercial and mixed-use properties [.]’ The loans are secured by California real estate and funded through mortgage pools.
Investors who purchased RMI VIII bought the limited partnership at $1.00 per unit. Unfortunately for investors, according to lpsales.com, recent sales on the secondary market value RMI VIII units at around $0.27/unit.
According to a letter to investors, “In March 2009, to conserve the partnership’s cash and to build cash reserves, withdrawals of limited partners’ capital were suspended and monthly cash distributions were reduced.”The letter goes on to state that it was necessary for all assets to remain invested.
Limited partnerships, especially real estate investments, are complex high risk products that are typically intended for sophisticated and institutional investors. Unfortunately some brokers downplay the risk and mislead investors into thinking these are “safe” investments. Limited partnerships are arguably unsuitable for most investors, especially conservative investors.
Broker dealers have a fiduciary duty to perform adequate due diligence to determine that investments have a reasonable likelihood of success. In addition, broker dealers are required by FINRA to sell limited partnerships only to accredited investors that meet suitability standards. The investors’ age, risk tolerance, net worth, and investment experience should be taken into account in order to determine whether a particular investment recommendation is suitable.
Brokers that overlook FINRA suitability requirements or mislead investors regarding risks can be liable for investment losses through FINRA arbitration.
To determine whether you may be able to recover investment losses incurred as a result of your purchase of RMI VIII or another Redwood Mortgage Investors partnership, please contact The White Law Group at 312-238-9650 for a free consultation.
The White Law Group, LLC is a national securities fraud, securities arbitration, investor protection, and securities regulation/compliance law firm with offices in Chicago, Illinois and Boca Raton, Florida.

WHO WE ARE
Redwood Mortgage Corp. is an established financial organization with over 30 years of experience in arranging and funding mortgage loans secured by California real estate. Our company was founded on the idea that mortgages, selected by experienced, knowledgeable professionals, would provide a steady source of income for its investors.

This formula for success has generally served both our investors and borrowers well.

		For the borrower, we provide tailor-made loan solutions secured by residential, multi-family, commercial and mixed-use properties funded through mortgage pools. For the investor, we provide a level of investor confidence and customer service based on our integrity and positive portfolio performance. As a result, Redwood Mortgage Corp. has earned a position of industry trust of which we are very proud.

OUR ROOTS GO WAY BACK



Today, Russ’s son, Michael Burwell, leads the company along with a team of highly skilled professionals, many of whom have worked together at Redwood Mortgage for over 25 years.


	When Russ Burwell Founded Redwood Mortgage Corp. in 1978, he had two goals:


Provide homeowners, homebuyers and entrepreneurs a source of capital, and

Provide investors with a consistent source of income


	Russ achieved those goals by designing an investment program backed by a portfolio of carefully selected, short-term loans secured by deeds of trust on high-quality California properties.

	That was over 30 years ago. Since then, Redwood Mortgage Corp. has arranged, underwritten and serviced over a billion dollars in loans and sponsored ten investment programs, including its current program, Redwood Mortgage Investors IX, LLC.

FIRMLY ESTABLISHED VALUES

	As President and CEO of Redwood Mortgage, Michael Burwell continues to strengthen and advance the company legacy of conservative investments, sound underwriting procedures and strong sense of family, ethics and community. Throughout the years, Redwood has remained committed to those values. Our roots in California real estate have grown strong because of it.

	We are proud of our heritage and the trust that homeowners, businesses, and investors have placed in us. We believe our growth will continue with the same steady and consistent investment approach that has served us so well in the past.

	When you invest with Redwood Mortgage, you invest with the confidence that comes from experience gained in over 30 years and ten investment programs.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
