HidrateMe Smart Water Bottle




Minneapolis, MN

Hardware






$627,644


pledged of $35,000 goal




8,015

Drinking water is the simplest thing we can do to feel our best every day. But with daily distractions, millions of us don't take care of ourselves the way we should. We simply forget. That's why we built HidrateMe, a connected water bottle that tracks your water intake and makes sure that you're hydrated all day long.




 The HidrateMe bottle is a 24 oz. - 710 ml. reusable water bottle, made out of BPA free Tritan plastic. It's dishwasher safe and comes with a leak proof cap. The sensor stick inside the bottle automatically tracks how much you drink throughout the day. It sends information to the Hidrate app on your phone and glows when its time to drink more water. The battery is easily replaceable and sold in most stores, and it lasts over a year, so you never need to recharge it.We carry our water bottles with us everywhere, that's why we designed a bottle that could transition from the office to the gym. It's a natural extension of yourself.






















































It's sleek, elegant, and smart. Surprise! There's a ripple design under the lid! We love the little things that makes you smile. The HidrateMe has a pour style mouth piece that's simple to use.

The Hidrate app is fun and easy to use. Here is a little demo video of the app and how the bottle works and syncs via Bluetooth. Plus it glows if you haven't had anything to drink for an extended period of time to remind you to stay hydrated.

Our app is as friendly and playful as it is easy and effective to use. Oh and the best part, the app is completely FREE and works on iPhone and Android! The app will be available for download winter 2015.Designed with you in mind, our app has a friendly and thoughtful user interface. Starting with your height, weight, age and activity level the app calculates just how much water you should be drinking throughout the day.Its easy to see your progress towards your goals, and you also receive reminders if you fall off track. The app also integrates with your wearables to help tune your water goals even more accurately to your activities. Using your location, the app can adjust your daily water goal depending on the temperature, humidity, and elevation of your surroundings.















































































We unlocked our first stretch goal and asked everyone to vote on a new color. Here it is - PURPLE!




$600K STRETCH GOAL - Don't Leave Me Behind (App feature)As promised, we're launching a NEW stretch goal for $600K. This one is going to be for a software feature: Don't Leave Me Behind. This feature makes sure that you will never lose your water bottle again. With this feature, you will get a reminder and location to where the bottle was last "seen" if you left your water bottle somewhere for an extended period of time.WE RAISED 600K SO IT'S HAPPENING!



















We're young entrepreneurs who are passionate about design, community, and the small things in life that help us all feel better. We all met at the University of Minnesota, in the start up capital of The North. Our team includes left to right: Alexander "Ham" Hambrock, Coleman Iverson, Nadya Nguyen, Daniel Worku, and Alexandra Feeken. We're a team of engineers, designers, marketers, and developers. 




In September 2014 our CEO Nadya pulled together a team of fellow University of Minnesota students for the Google Startup weekend in Minneapolis, Minnesota to build the first smart water bottle prototype. In just 54 hours we built a water bottle that tracked water intake and synced to a mobile app on a smartphone.




We won third place and people began asking when the water bottles would be available for purchase. That’s the moment we knew they were on to something. The team worked evenings and weekends for 7 months before being accepted into the Sprint Mobile Health Accelerator powered by Techstars. 




We quit our jobs and left everything behind to work on a product that we believed in. The program is a 3 month-long intensive on-site experience in Kansas City, MO in which 10 mobile-health companies selected from around the world receive funding and mentorship to accelerate their businesses.
























We reiterated multiple bottle designs before deciding to go with the final Hidrate Me. The lid was another challenge in itself and we 3D printed and tested several before finalizing our design. 
































  







  



Risks and challenges
Manufacturing the Bottle
Many small companies face difficulties when it comes to manufacturing new products, from design problems to unexpected costs. That's why we've made it a priority from the very beginning to involve manufacturers every step of the way, catching issues before they had a chance to become problems. Members of our team have seen multiple products through from concept to manufacturing. 
Shipping in Winter 2015
We plan to place the manufacturing order by the end of June 2015. We'll be reviewing samples in August and September. December of 2015 / January 2016 is our shipping estimate when we account for both making revisions and getting the first shipment in from the factory.
Battery Life
Our testing shows that the included battery will power the Hidrate Me bottle for well over a year. We are still doing additional testing and tweaking to make sure that the battery life will be at least a year.

    I may seem dumb....

I have been doing a lot of traveling, and unfortunately, I am not always able to keep track of how much fluid I've been drinking in a given day.  I usually try to drink as much as possible, but then again, I don't like to be stopping to go to a bathroom every 20 minutes, either.  Enter the Spark 2.0, which through the app's simple circular tracking bar, I know if I have been drinking enough for the time of day, temperature, and the number of steps I've taken.  It is incredibly helpful to have my Spark water bottle reminding me to keep drinking, as there have been too many days of running around a desert and flopping down for the night with a splitting dehydration headache.  The app is also very consistant at syncing with Fitbit, so if I am looking at the weekly fitness goals, I can see if I have been keeping up my water consumption by looking at the Fitbit dashboard.  I highly recommend this waterbottle.

    Well worth the wait!

Initially I was disappointed that my husband purchased this bottle as a Mother's Day gift and he wasn't aware of the backlog on orders.  So fast forward 2 months and I'm so pleased with my hydrate 2.0!  The motivational messages really have you reaching for the bottle and once you get it calibrated you're on your way

    Love it

I have purchased my water bottle in January.   I just love it.  it's great that you can add friends to it and watch how much they are drinking along with you.  if anyone is looking for friends to add here is my email address.  bttrflykm@hotmail.com

    A teacher's best friend!

I absolutely love my bottle, because I usually don't drink enough water during the day when I'm teaching and sometimes come home with a horrible headache! Now I simply put my bottle on my desk and my students alert me as soon as it starts to light up and then I simply have to make time to drink or my students will complain!  No more headaches since I have the bottle and now all my colleagues want one too! Please deliver in Europe soon, because I was lucky enough to get one via a friend in the US, but my colleagues want one too and they don't have the right connections!

    Wonderful overall

I love this water bottle, it has put me back on track drinking water. And I love the app, however I wish it kept the streak going longer than each week, such as weeks or months or ever years if you make it that far. I will say I had a few times with syncing in the beginning but the tech. support people were wonderful and I also had a faulty lid but they fixed that issue. The only thing I have noticed since those two issues were resolved is the rubber band thing that helps flip the lid open broke a few months after I got the replacement lid and I was surprised since I only hand wash my bottle and its parts and I take excellent care of my bottle since I love it so much. So now I have to manually flip my lid open since it won't flip/pop open anymore since the band broke. And it syncs to my Fitbit which I love, though I do wish it would log the water in myfitnesspal also since I love in that as well. But overall I love this bottle and will definitely always have one.

    LOVE it!!

I purchased my bottle after my second kidney stone results came back. My doctor said my body was not processing salt properly and that I needed to drink at least 58 ounces of water a day. I tried to keep track on my own, but would loose track throughout the day. I purchased this bottle and fell in love!!!! I have drank more water since getting than I ever have!!!!! I love how it flashes and sends me a text to remind me to drink more!!!!!

    Hidrate spark helps my sick child

I just wanted to say how much the hidrate spark has helped my five year old daughter. In the last two years she has been very sick due to chronic kidney infections and has had many er visits doctors visits and one week stay in the hospital due to her not ever being thirsty or wanting to drink. We finally got to the bottom of why she was getting so sick and it was bc no matter how hard we tried she just never wanted to drink anything and when she doesn't drink she gets sick within a day or so to the point of vomiting. I have purchased many cups and water bottles over the last two years trying to entice her to drink and each time being a failure. They specialist told us that if she doesn't drink like she needs to she will end up with a kidney transplant by the time she is a teenager. One day I happened to see the video about the hidrate spark bottle on Facebook and went out on a limb and purchased the water bottle and to see how much it is holding she and I accountable and how she likes to beat the "clock" to drink her water she had beat her goal each day this week and I am so proud and also thankful for your invention. I have recommended your water bottle to several of my clients bc I am so happy with the results. Thank you so much hidrate spark for helping my baby stay healthy!!!

    Awesome Product

When I saw this I thought, how much water can it really help me drink, well the answer is a whole heck of a lot!  I drink at least twice as much as I used to and now feel the benefits. If you are on the fence, DO IT.

    Love!

I love my new water bottle. Never leave home without and have been definitely been drinking more water. The only thing I don't like is the finish on the bottle is peeling from going in and out of the cup holder in my car.

Marsha said:
    Love, would go any other brand!

Knowing I am getting my 64 ounces water everyday.  And one thing more, I have dropped mine so many times already and still works. Not even a chip.
I have to agree when you drank water else without your glass and forgot to add it in before 12:00 a.m. You don't make your goal.

Jenn said:
    Absolutely in Love!

Absolutely am in love with this water bottle!  Well worth the wait, although I wish I had ordered two now.  The notifications that are sent to my phone are funny but helpful.  It took a little bit to get it to sync to my Fitbit app but once I did I've been using both religiously now.  Love, love, love! ❤️ I will say that if more than one is purchased there should be a discount.

    Great bottle and all bottle should have a way to track like this!

So I'm an OG backer as we like to say since I backed this way back in Kickstarter days! The first bottle was an amazing thing to carry around with and when it would glow and people ask what is going on with your bottle. :) Had a few problems which you can understand being the first and customers service was a tad bit rough in the beings as well. Glad to say the version 2.0 of bottle fixed almost all the problems the first one had and customer service has improved. They just updated the app which fixed allot of the problems we had with that but still needs improving. Things still needed for the app to integrate with more apps, Misfit, LostIT, MyFitnesspal these are some that just need to be within any health app. Thank you for the hard work your doing to bring us the best water bottle on the market today, and please keep up the work to improve the software experience which I think is the main focus should be on for awhile.

    First product effective in getting me to drink water!

This thing is great!!! Had it about a week and it has helped me get my rear in gear to drink water more regularly. Love the feel of the bottle, it fits in my cup holder in my car, nice color and works great with the app and my apple health. Definitely recommend it!

    Love my bottle!!

I ordered the teal, it took a while to come in due to demand, but Hidrate Spark constantly communicated via emails about the status. I never felt like I wouldn't get it. I love It! You can change the settings to fit you best and the notifications are cool. Definitely recommend!

    Works GREAT and its Tough!

I waited many weeks before writing this review. I thought I drank a lot of water, but now I know otherwise! This bottle works like a charm and is VERY well made. Today I accidentally knocked it off my kitchen table onto a ceramic tile floor. The stem got dislodged. I was mortified. Put it back in and it is working fine and not a crack or dent in the bottle after that rough tumble!! Love that it syncs with the Fibit App!

    Amazing!!!!

I absolutely love this product!!! I purchased my hidrate buddy a few months ago. When I received it two days ago I was so elated. It took a little while to realized the batteries installed were just to show you how to place the additional batteries in. Now I understand why I was having migraine and muscle spasms! I'll give it a couple of months before another review. Thanks hidrate!!! I think I'll buy a second bottle just in case by daughter snags it!!!

I bought mine and absolutely love it! Best investment ever. The reminders are so cute and I can't tell u how much I'm glad I spent the money. I told all my friends about it and they are thinking about joining me in my quest to become healthier one sip at a time!!!

    Great bottle & company!

I love this bottle. This is exactly what I needed to get me to drink more water and it works! I went from drinking 0 to at least 2 cups a day which is a big deal for me. I'm continuing my goal to drink more. I love how it lights up and how it syncs to my fitbit. Also this company is really thoughtful. They were having issues with bottles being shipped with half powered batteries so they started shipping batteries along with the bottles and then when I was having issues with my bottle they spent a few days helping me out to fix it. Just shows how thoughtful they are and how they want to do right by the customer. You won't regret buying this bottle :)

    Amazing Customer Service

OMG
So the background is that my girlfriend and I celebrate our anniversary on a monthly basis. Cheesy, I know, but we find it helps us grow in our relationship and reaffirm our love for each other. This month I bought her a Hidrate water bottle to celebrate us being together 18 months! I knew she was wanting a "Smart" water bottle and after several hours of research, I decided to purchase her a Hidrate water bottle. It was going to be perfect and in the color she loves. Well I thought, hey, purchase this a week in advance and it should be no problem right? I didn't realize how popular this magnificent bottle was and saw that it could potentially be a long time before I received the bottle...Well after a couple days of not receiving an email stating it had shipped, I decided to take matters into my own hands and reach out to the company to maybe get the water bottle delivered by our anniversary. After only a few hours, I received an email stating they would try hard to get it shipped out ASAP but couldn't make any guarantees... I honestly doubted the company would honor my request but low and behold I received the best email the next day that it had been shipped!!! OMG!!! I constantly checked the tracking number and the next day the tracking information said the expected delivery was going to be on our ANNIVERSARY!!! Well it WAS delivered to my place in time and I actually met the postman at my mailbox because I was so eager to receive it. LOL. I CAN'T SAY IT ENOUGH HIDRATE... THANK YOU FOR MAKING THIS POSSIBLE AND YOU TRULY TAKE CARE OF YOUR CUSTOMERS!!!

    WORTH THE WAIT

I just received my bottle today and am already obsessed! It is worth the wait! Syncs very fast with the app and motivates me to drink more often. Great product! :)

    LOVE my Hidrate Spark!

I debated for a few months before I finally bought my bottle.  After reading reviews and researching the product I finally decided to get one.  I am so happy I did.  This is the best water bottle ever!  I did have to wait a few weeks for shipping, but it was well worth the wait.  I chose the purple bottle and I was worried I wouldn't see the flashing reminders very well through the dark bottle but you can see them just fine.  I like to drink my water through a stray, but the opening on this bottle works for me and I don't miss my straw at all.  The texture of the bottle is awesome, and has gotten the attention of many people who see me with it.  The finger strap is something I really like too.  It makes it super easy to carry the bottle when my hands are full.  It's very easy to set up and clean the bottle, as well as change the batteries.  The app is great, easy to use and pleasing to the eye.  I love how it syncs with my Fitbit and adjusts my water needs based on my activity.  The push reminders are THE BEST!!!  I even take screen shots and share them with friends.  I have had a few connectivity issues, but they seem to work themselves out.  I have also had to contact customer service and got quick responses.  I highly recommend this bottle, it's amazing!

    Awesome

I bought these a few months ago...but got sick and never got to use them.  Feeling better, I just connected it to my iphone, which literally took seconds....the app is absolutely amazing.  The bottle fits great in my hand.  I highly recommend this water bottle...it's very cool and will help keeping me hydrated, per the doctors orders.

    Super excited

OMG I cannot wait to get this! I was told about it today and as soon as I had time I came home and ordered it. I think this can really help me, I have lost 45 pounds so far and I am the worst with remembering to drink water. I am very excited to start drinking more to keep loosing weight.

    Beyond Amazing

I bought this water bottle because I needed a new one and thought it would be cool to know how much I drank. I was WAY below what I thought and now feel noticeably better because I am getting the proper amount of water. Not only is the bottle amazing but the customer service is more like 10 stars. I emailed about a shipping location change because I was moving and instead of changing the location they said they will send it out immediately and will rush it to my address before I move. Fast forward two months and my boyfriend knocks it off the counter and breaks the lid (ugh men) and I emailed asking if I could purchase just a replacement lid and they said that because they didn't want my boyfriend to be in the "doghouse" forever they would send me a free lid! How fricken awesome!!! Customer service like this is hard to find nowadays. Great company, great product!

    Without it I'm thirsty!

Like others have said, I had no idea how little water I was drinking until I got this. Now that I've been without it now for a couple of weeks I am not drinking enough water because right now, in the morning, I can't even drink my coffee because I am dying of thirst. I am so thankful that Customer Service is so wonderful in helping me get my Hidrate back together quickly after an accident. Their response time is excellent. Much quicker than my own. I can't wait to get it back together again so that I can get back on track because I'm still not completing my goal but I'm doing better over each week that passes. I do wish I could add my intake for days past because I have forgotten my bottle once or twice at work and didn't remember til the next day that I needed to add my intake. Otherwise, love it! I'm so thirsty without its glowing goodness to remind me!

    I would marry this bottle

I love this bottle. It's smart, funny, beautiful, instagrammable, and nice to hold. Basically the perfect partner. 
Everyone who sees this bottle (it really catches the eye when it starts blinking when reminding me to drink) wants one. At least 6 people in the past 2 weeks have bought this bottle after seeing mine (where's my referral bonus?).

    Weird to love this so much!

I really love my new water bottle! So easy to setup, works great and just makes me happy!  It really is very nicely designed, the feel of it is awesome and just so nice.  The push notifications are awesome, makes me smile instead of it being so official to "drink water"....  keep it up!  
Next idea: Put in a carbon stick to purify :)

Fantastic product! Simply put this is the Best water bottle I have ever owned.

Well done to Hidrate, awesome IOT device, keep up the great work!

    Keeps me on track

I had no idea how little water I was drinking! This bottle and app keep me in track. I take it everywhere with me. Being a nurse it's hard to stay hydrated during your shifts, but this helps me stay on track so I'm not so thirsty at the end of the day. I love that it know how much water I need and
Changes based on activity and location. It also helps me not to overeat. Sometimes I feel hungry when I really just need water.

    Love my bottles / great for family competitions

Love the bottles, and customer service is bar none!!!!!  Hot Pink and White are the colors.
My husband and I are competing at times to see who is actually drinking more water, nice feature. My only issue is that the app does not link to MyFitness Pal to track the water, the only feature it may use is the "steps counter" which I am already wearing  a Garmin VivoFit HR for that.  The only issue i see in the future is removing the sensor stick, as mine came pre-assembled to the lid, i'm not sure I can get it off to switch to the new lid.  The only other odd thing is the glow is happening after or before notifications to drink. Perhaps on the next version - a stronger fill line indication ( it's very hard to spot on my colored bottle - maybe a dark black and have the line thickness on the plastic all the way around the bottle.

Meg said:
    Great with one exception

I love my hydrate spark bottle. My only complaint is with the app. There is no way to adjust the water intake once it rolls to the next day. For example, I forgot my bottle at home the other day and did not add my intake, now that it has rolled to the next day it will forever be a 0% for that day and ruin my stats. It would be a really simple fix to let you go back and adjust!

    Innovative and Fashionable

I workout daily and i generally carry a gallon jug around at the office . I always feel weird carrying a jug around like some tool, ooh look at me I have a gallon of water. This bottle is fashionable in that it's sleek, and I love its tracking capability and integration with my apple watch. The reminder notifications are hilarious as well whoever wrote the content for them is witty and when the bottle sends you a reminder you will generally laugh out loud . I do wish I could have more than just the red and white glow notification in the bottle but apparently that is still being developed . This is a must have .

    Love this bottle

I purchased this bottle in hopes that it would help me keep track of the water that I drank each day.  This bottle is truly amazing and I love this bottle.  I highly recommend purchasing this bottle.

    Love

It feels like a game,at least to me, try to get my water in before the bottle blinks or sends a reminder to my apple ⌚️ or . When I hit the goal that I set- love watching the "fireworks".

    Love this bottle!

I bought this bottle for my mom and she absolutely loves it. She loves the app too. The only recommendations she has are that she thinks the bottle should have another small hole above the drinking hole in order to be able to drink more at once (kind of like how coffee cup covers are) and also on the app, being able to take water intake away. She said she spilled it one day and it records that that's the amount you drank. I know you're able to add more water but she feels you should be able to take some away too. Can't wait to get one for myself!

    Fun with Friends!

I am really enjoying this water bottle! The best feature is that you can follow your friends. I bought one for myself and my best friend. She and I keep track of each other's progress and encourage each other to drink more. I've used another water tracking bottle, but I prefer Hidrate Spark for a couple reasons, one being the ability to track friends, but also the app is much better than the other bottle I used to use. I love the blinking lights on the bottle too! Definitely worth buying! Love it!

    Excellent Water Bottle

I absolutely love this water bottle! I was lucky enough to get "Teal" but see now that it is sold out.  This water bottle is fun and the app is easy to use.  It also pairs with my FitBit app.  Would definitely purchase another one in the future!  Great conversation piece!

    Drinking & tracking hydration water has never been so much fun!

I'm a huge tracker. I track my goals, my sleep, my meals, my exercise, my cycle; everything! I love being aware of my habits so that I can progress towards a better and healthier lifestyle. For the longest I've worked to get better at tracking my water intake. I've tried a lot of different methods; the rubber band method, the strategically placed glasses, carrying around a gallon jug. All of these methods, while they helped me to drink more, were horrible for awareness. I would lose count all the time or not meet my goal and feel defeated. With the hidrate spark not only do I have an exact awareness of my water intake, but I also have FUN tracking and monitoring my progress. I LOVE that I get little victory glows from the bottle when I meet my daily goal. It's almost like the bottle is my own personal hydration coach. I've met my goal 100%+ everyday since owning the bottle. I love that the app adjust my goal appropriately when I am physically active. They say that we're made up of something like 90% water and that proper hydration impacts our health, weight, skin, mood, etc. I can attest that since having this bottle I've been generally more active, joyful and positive. I take it every where, even restaurants! I simply ask for water with no ice and pour it into my bottle. I've been recommending it to friends and family and I'm definitely getting some folks a hidrate spark for christmas!

    Keeping Me Healthy

I love my Hidrate Spark Bottle! I know that I am getting all the water need throughout the day. As an older person, it is helpful for me to drink all my water earlier in the day. The bottle keeps me on track without being distracted from work. I couldn't be happier!

                        Hidrate Inc. has received 1 out of 5 stars based on 3 Customer Reviews and a BBB Rating of F.
                        






                            Comprised of 67% BBB Rating and 33% Customer Review Rating.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating represents the customer's opinion of the business. The Customer Review
                            Rating percentages are based on the total number of positive, neutral, and negative reviews posted.
                        

                            The BBB letter grade represents the BBB's opinion of how the business is likely to interact with its customers.
                            The BBB grade is based on BBB file information about the business.
                            In some cases, a business' grade may be lowered if the BBB does not have sufficient
                            information about the business despite BBB's requests for that information from the business.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating plus the BBB Rating is not a guarantee of a business'
                            reliability or performance. BBB recommends that consumers consider a business'
                            BBB Rating and Customer Review Rating in addition to all other available information
                            about the business.

Smart water bottle keeps you hydrated all day





Drinking water is the simplest thing we can do to feel our best every day. However, with daily distractions, millions of us don't take care of ourselves the way we should. We simply forget. That's why Hidrate built HidrateMe, a connected water bottle that tracks water intake and makes sure that users are hydrated all day long.

HidrateMe Smart Water Bottle

Drinking water is the simplest thing we can do to feel our best every day. But with daily distractions, millions of us don't take care of ourselves the way we should. We simply forget. That's why we built HidrateMe, a connected water bottle that tracks your water intake and makes sure that you're hydrated all day long.




 The HidrateMe bottle is a 24 oz. - 710 ml. reusable water bottle, made out of BPA free Tritan plastic. It's dishwasher safe and comes with a leak proof cap. The sensor stick inside the bottle automatically tracks how much you drink throughout the day. It sends information to the Hidrate app on your phone and glows when its time to drink more water. The battery is easily replaceable and sold in most stores, and it lasts over a year, so you never need to recharge it.We carry our water bottles with us everywhere, that's why we designed a bottle that could transition from the office to the gym. It's a natural extension of yourself.






















































It's sleek, elegant, and smart. Surprise! There's a ripple design under the lid! We love the little things that makes you smile. The HidrateMe has a pour style mouth piece that's simple to use.

The Hidrate app is fun and easy to use. Here is a little demo video of the app and how the bottle works and syncs via Bluetooth. Plus it glows if you haven't had anything to drink for an extended period of time to remind you to stay hydrated.

Our app is as friendly and playful as it is easy and effective to use. Oh and the best part, the app is completely FREE and works on iPhone and Android! The app will be available for download winter 2015.Designed with you in mind, our app has a friendly and thoughtful user interface. Starting with your height, weight, age and activity level the app calculates just how much water you should be drinking throughout the day.Its easy to see your progress towards your goals, and you also receive reminders if you fall off track. The app also integrates with your wearables to help tune your water goals even more accurately to your activities. Using your location, the app can adjust your daily water goal depending on the temperature, humidity, and elevation of your surroundings.















































































We unlocked our first stretch goal and asked everyone to vote on a new color. Here it is - PURPLE!




$600K STRETCH GOAL - Don't Leave Me Behind (App feature)As promised, we're launching a NEW stretch goal for $600K. This one is going to be for a software feature: Don't Leave Me Behind. This feature makes sure that you will never lose your water bottle again. With this feature, you will get a reminder and location to where the bottle was last "seen" if you left your water bottle somewhere for an extended period of time.WE RAISED 600K SO IT'S HAPPENING!



















We're young entrepreneurs who are passionate about design, community, and the small things in life that help us all feel better. We all met at the University of Minnesota, in the start up capital of The North. Our team includes left to right: Alexander "Ham" Hambrock, Coleman Iverson, Nadya Nguyen, Daniel Worku, and Alexandra Feeken. We're a team of engineers, designers, marketers, and developers. 




In September 2014 our CEO Nadya pulled together a team of fellow University of Minnesota students for the Google Startup weekend in Minneapolis, Minnesota to build the first smart water bottle prototype. In just 54 hours we built a water bottle that tracked water intake and synced to a mobile app on a smartphone.




We won third place and people began asking when the water bottles would be available for purchase. That’s the moment we knew they were on to something. The team worked evenings and weekends for 7 months before being accepted into the Sprint Mobile Health Accelerator powered by Techstars. 




We quit our jobs and left everything behind to work on a product that we believed in. The program is a 3 month-long intensive on-site experience in Kansas City, MO in which 10 mobile-health companies selected from around the world receive funding and mentorship to accelerate their businesses.
























We reiterated multiple bottle designs before deciding to go with the final Hidrate Me. The lid was another challenge in itself and we 3D printed and tested several before finalizing our design. 
































  







  



Risks and challenges
Manufacturing the Bottle
Many small companies face difficulties when it comes to manufacturing new products, from design problems to unexpected costs. That's why we've made it a priority from the very beginning to involve manufacturers every step of the way, catching issues before they had a chance to become problems. Members of our team have seen multiple products through from concept to manufacturing. 
Shipping in Winter 2015
We plan to place the manufacturing order by the end of June 2015. We'll be reviewing samples in August and September. December of 2015 / January 2016 is our shipping estimate when we account for both making revisions and getting the first shipment in from the factory.
Battery Life
Our testing shows that the included battery will power the Hidrate Me bottle for well over a year. We are still doing additional testing and tweaking to make sure that the battery life will be at least a year.
