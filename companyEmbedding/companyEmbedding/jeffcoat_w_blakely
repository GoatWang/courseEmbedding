I encourage our younger, most talented planners to take the reins on significant global projects, reassuring them there is a safety net for reaching out and testing their ideas. I love encouraging and guiding them through projects and watching them succeed. Their pride becomes my pride.

I continue to be enamored with the power of technical collaboration, when skilled individuals apply themselves to a vision bigger than themselves.

Think carefully about what you do best, what you want to do, and work hard to find the right match with the needs of a consulting engineering company. Then, learn about each firm’s values and approach to business and follow your instincts - you know those tough love lessons you learned in the military - they still apply.
