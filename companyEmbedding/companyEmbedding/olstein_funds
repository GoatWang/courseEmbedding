The Olstein Funds

















































 

 

 












Olstein All Cap Value Fund emphasizes investments in the undervalued
            equity securities of companies with discernible financial strength, unique business
            fundamentals, a competitive edge and an ability to generate free cash flow. When
            evaluating an investment opportunity, the Fund first considers downside risk,  (determined by the quality of a company's balance sheet; quality of
            its earnings and conservatism of its reporting practices) before considering any
            potential for capital appreciation.
            







Analysis focuses on how a company's operations generate sustainable free cash flow;
                                how much of that cash is available to investors and the level of ongoing investment
                                required to maintain
            and grow free cash flow.
Valuations based on free cash flow. Reliable valuations require: determining if
                                a company's accounting policies reflect business reality; assessing a company's
                                Quality of Earnings; accounting adjustments to eliminate management bias, and identifying
                                positive
                                
                                or negative factors that may affect future free cash flow.

Forensic analysis of financial statements reveals the success of a company's strategy,
                                sustainability of its performance and impact of management decisions on future cash
                                flow and is more useful to an investor than management forecasts or earnings guidance.

    future results. The investment return and principal value of an investment will
    fluctuate so that an investor's shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less

        The Russell 3000 Value Index measures the performance of the broad value segment of U.S. equity value universe. It includes those Russell 3000 companies with lower price-to-book ratios and lower forecasted growth values. The Russell 3000 Value Index is constructed to provide a comprehensive, unbiased, and stable barometer of the broad value market. The Russell 3000� Index is an unmanaged index that measures the performance of the 3,000 largest U.S. companies based on total market capitalization, and represents approximately 98% of the investable U.S. Equity market.  Investors cannot actually make investments in either index.





          Performance data quoted represents past performance.

          The Olstein Funds follow a value-oriented investment approach.  However, a particular value stock may not increase in price as the Investment Manager anticipates and may actually decline in price if other investors fail to recognize the stock's value or if a catalyst that the Investment Manager believes will increase the price of the stock does not occur or does not affect the price of the stock in the manner or to the degree that the Investment Manager anticipated.  Also, the Investment Manager's calculation of a stock's private market value involves estimates of future cash flow which may prove to be incorrect and, therefore, could result in sales of the stock at prices lower than the Fund's original purchase prices.  There is no assurance that the fund will achieve its investment objective.

Summary







 


Overall Rating

2 out of 5 Stars

Morningstar has awarded this fund 2 stars based on its risk-adjusted performance compared to the 1223 funds within its Morningstar Category.



How is it determined?


The Overall Morningstar RatingTM for a fund is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its 3-, 5-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics, which are based on risk-adjusted returns, as of the date stated.

 funds
                       




What does it mean?


A fund's Morningstar Rating is a quantitative assessment of a fund's past performance that accounts for both risk and return, with funds earning between 1 and 5 stars. As always, this rating system is designed to be used as a first step in the fund evaluation process. A high rating alone is not sufficient basis upon which to make an investment decision.











 


Returns


LOW
AVG
HIGH


Below Average


This fund scores Below Average because it delivered returns that were in the bottom 22.5% when compared to other funds within its Morningstar category.





How is it calculated?



This rating is based on a fund's Morningstar Return (its annualized return in excess to the return of the 90-day U.S. Treasury bill over a three-, five-, or ten-year period). The Morningstar Returns in each category are then scored against each other on a bell curve. In each Morningstar Category:� top 10% - High� next 22.5% - Above Average� middle 35% - Average� next 22.5% - Below Average� bottom 10% - Low




What does it mean?



While past performance is no guarantee of future results, the Morningstar Return shows how the fund has done in the past in comparison to similar funds in its peer group. It does not, however, show the effects of risk.Therefore, the Morningstar Return is most helpful when used in conjunction with the Morningstar Risk Score. For example, an investor could use these two scores when comparing between funds that have the same Morningstar Star Rating and similar Morningstar Risk Adjusted Returns but different levels of risk.










 


Expenses


LOW
AVG
HIGH


High


This fund's expenses are rated as High because they are above the 80th percentile when compared with other funds in the category.





How is it calculated?


This Morningstar data point compares the fund's net expense ratio to the net expense ratio of all the other funds within its Morningstar Category grouping.





What does it mean?


Excessive expenses can detract from overall returns and can be a drain on performance. While you should not base any investment decision entirely on expenses or expense ratios, a fund's expense structure may be one factor to consider.











 


Risk of this Type of Fund


LOWER
HIGHER





Morningstar assigns a risk level to each of its mutual fund categories. These risk levels range from 1 for those funds with least amount of risk to 10 for those with the greatest amount of risk.






How is it calculated?



Morningstar calculates these risk levels by looking at the Morningstar Risk of the funds in the Category over the previous 5-year period. Morningstar Risk is the difference between the Morningstar Return, based on fund total returns, and the Morningstar Risk Adjusted Return, based on fund total returns adjusted for performance volatility. The Category Risk Level is based on the equal weighted average Morningstar Risk of the funds in the category.  Morningstar's Research Committee evaluates the Category Morningstar Risk and assigns the Category Risk Level after further qualitative judgment.




What does it mean?



This score can help you understand the risk involved with a particular Morningstar category of funds, which may be helpful in evaluating the risk associated with a specific investment. The Category Risk Level is based on the equal weighted average performance of the funds in the category. It does not reflect the risk associated with any individual fund or the relative risk of a fund within a particular Morningstar category.  Because the score is based on past performance, it may not reflect the future risk of the category. In addition to risk, you should evaluate a fund's investment objective, strategy, fees and other characteristics before making your investment decision.Learn more

Fund Overview




Objective



The investment seeks long-term capital appreciation and its secondary objective is income.




Strategy



The fund seeks to achieve its objectives by investing primarily in a diversified portfolio of common stocks that the fund's investment adviser, Olstein Capital Management, L.P. ("OCM"), believes are significantly undervalued. It will invest in companies without regard to whether they are conventionally categorized as small, medium, or large capitalization or whether they are characterized as growth (growth is a component of the fund's definition of value), value, cyclical, or any other category.


Risk



Value and growth stocks can perform differently from other types of stocks. Growth stocks can be more volatile. Value stocks can continue to be undervalued by the market for long periods of time. Stock markets are volatile and can decline significantly in response to adverse issuer, political, regulatory, market, economic or other developments. These risks may be magnified in foreign markets. Additional risk information for this product may be found in the prospectus or other product materials, if available.

Risk


LOW
AVG
HIGH


High

This fund scores High because Morningstar has rated its risk above the 80th percentile when compared to other funds within its Morningstar category.




How is it calculated?


Risk is calculated using the Sharpe ratio, which compares portfolio returns to a rate comparable to U.S. Treasury bonds, relative to the fund's overall volatility. For this measure, Morningstar has compared the Sharpe ratio of this fund against all other funds that invest in it's Morningstar Category.




What does it mean?


A higher Sharpe implies better risk-adjusted returns. Therefore, if a fund has a Sharpe ratio higher than its category average, it's returns relative to it's risk were better than other similar funds. If its Sharpe ratio is lower, that's usually a sign that the risk-adjusted returns were lower than other similar funds.










 


Returns


LOW
AVG
HIGH


Below Average


This fund scores Below Average because it delivered returns that were in the bottom 22.5% when compared to other funds within its Morningstar category.





How is it calculated?



This rating is based on a fund's Morningstar Return (its annualized return in excess to the return of the 90-day U.S. Treasury bill over a three-, five-, or ten-year period). The Morningstar Returns in each category are then scored against each other on a bell curve. In each Morningstar Category:� top 10% - High� next 22.5% - Above Average� middle 35% - Average� next 22.5% - Below Average� bottom 10% - Low




What does it mean?



While past performance is no guarantee of future results, the Morningstar Return shows how the fund has done in the past in comparison to similar funds in its peer group. It does not, however, show the effects of risk.Therefore, the Morningstar Return is most helpful when used in conjunction with the Morningstar Risk Score. For example, an investor could use these two scores when comparing between funds that have the same Morningstar Star Rating and similar Morningstar Risk Adjusted Returns but different levels of risk.










 


Risk of this Type of Fund


LOWER
HIGHER





Morningstar assigns a risk level to each of its mutual fund categories. These risk levels range from 1 for those funds with least amount of risk to 10 for those with the greatest amount of risk.






How is it calculated?



Morningstar calculates these risk levels by looking at the Morningstar Risk of the funds in the Category over the previous 5-year period. Morningstar Risk is the difference between the Morningstar Return, based on fund total returns, and the Morningstar Risk Adjusted Return, based on fund total returns adjusted for performance volatility. The Category Risk Level is based on the equal weighted average Morningstar Risk of the funds in the category.  Morningstar's Research Committee evaluates the Category Morningstar Risk and assigns the Category Risk Level after further qualitative judgment.




What does it mean?



This score can help you understand the risk involved with a particular Morningstar category of funds, which may be helpful in evaluating the risk associated with a specific investment. The Category Risk Level is based on the equal weighted average performance of the funds in the category. It does not reflect the risk associated with any individual fund or the relative risk of a fund within a particular Morningstar category.  Because the score is based on past performance, it may not reflect the future risk of the category. In addition to risk, you should evaluate a fund's investment objective, strategy, fees and other characteristics before making your investment decision.Learn more

The Morningstar RatingTM for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for funds with at least a three-year history. (Exchange-traded funds and open-end mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes.) It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a fund's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of  funds in each fund category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

Neither Morningstar nor its content providers are responsible for any damages or losses arising from any use of this information. Fidelity does not review the Morningstar data and, for fund performance, you should check the fund's current prospectus or other product materials for the most up-to-date information concerning applicable loads, fees and expenses.

The "Mutual Funds" area at the top of each page allows access to mutual fund holdings with individual and joint Fidelity non-retirement accounts. Individual stock positions, ETFs and 529 funds are not available through this view. For the full list of your holdings visit Portfolio Summary.Mutual Funds are priced as of the previous business day's market close when the market is open. Mutual fund positions are priced as of the official market close (typically 4p.m.) and prices are generally available between 5 p.m. and 6p.m.

The performance data featured represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results.  Investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate; therefore, you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares.  Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance data quoted.











1. Transaction Fee:A transaction fee is similar to a  brokerage fee or commission which you pay when you buy or sell a stock. For some funds available through Fidelity you are required to pay a transaction fee. However, you will not pay a sales load on Transaction Fee (TF) funds. You will only be charged a transaction fee when you buy a FundsNetwork TF fund, not when you sell one. All other fees and expenses described in a fund's prospectus still apply. You can choose to buy or sell shares directly from the fund itself or its principal underwriter or distributor without paying a transaction fee to Fidelity.Online Transaction Fees:  $49.95 for most funds.  Certain funds will have a transaction fee of $75. To identify any applicable transaction fees associated with the purchase of a given fund, please refer to the "Fees and Distributions" tab.Fidelity Automated Service Telephone (FAST): 25% off representative-assisted rates, Maximum: $187.50, Minimum:$75Representative-Assisted: 0.75% of principal, Maximum: $250, Minimum: $100Automatic Investment: $5 per transaction, after the initial investment.Sales load:A sales charge added to the price of the fund. Funds have different sales charge structures, including front-end loads, back-end loads (deferred), and no loads. Sales loads can either be charged when a fund is purchased, commonly known as a front-end load, or when a fund is sold, known as a deferred load. Not  all funds charge a load. Refer to the Loads, Expense and Minimums section of the fund's prospectus for details on these amounts. Although no load funds do not have a front-end or deferred load, they may incur other fees, such as a 12b-1 fee.
2. Total returns are historical and include change in share value and reinvestment of dividends and capital gains, if any. Cumulative total returns are reported as of the period indicated.  Life of fund figures are reported as of the commencement date to the period indicated and are cumulative if the fund is less than one year old. Total returns do not reflect the fund's [%] sales charge. If sales charges were included, total returns would have been lower.
3. The Morningstar Category Average is the average return for the peer group based on the returns of each individual fund within the group, for the period shown. This average assumes reinvestment of dividends.
4. This chart illustrates the performance of a hypothetical $10,000 investment made in this investment product (and a benchmark or category average, if shown) from the beginning date shown or on the inception date of the product (whichever is later).  The inception date used for products with underlying funds, or multiple shares classes, or are offered as a separate account, strategy or sub account, may be the inception date of the underlying fund, the earliest share class of the product, or the date composite performance for the product was first made available. The product's returns may not reflect all its expenses. Any fees not reflected would lower the returns. Benchmark returns include reinvestment of capital gains and dividends, if any, but do not reflect any fees or expenses. It is not possible to invest in an index. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. This chart is not intended to imply any future performance of the investment product.
5. Initial minimum investments into group retirement accounts such as Fidelity Simplified Employee Pension-IRA, Keogh, Self-Employed 401(k), and Non-Fidelity Prototype Retirement accounts are $500 or higher. Additional investments into Regular, IRA, and Group accounts are $250 or higher.
6. Any holdings, asset allocation, diversification breakdowns or other composition data shown are as of the date indicated and are subject to change at any time. They may not be representative of the fund's current or future investments. Some breakdowns may be intentionally limited to a particular asset class or other subset of the fund's entire portfolio, particularly in multi-asset class funds where the attributes of the equity and fixed income portions are different. Under the asset allocation section, international (or foreign) assets may be reported differently depending on how an investment options reports its holdings.  Some do not report international (or foreign) holdings here, but instead report them in a "Regional Diversification" section.  Some report them in this section as an to the equity, bond and other allocation shown.  Others report international (or foreign) holding as a subset of the equity and bond allocations shown.  If the allocation without the foreign component (or round to) 100%, then international (or foreign) is a subset of the equity and bond percentage shown.
7. Percent Rank in Category is the fund's total-return percentile rank relative to all funds that have the same Morningstar Category.  The highest (or most favorable) percentile rank is 1 and the lowest (or least favorable) percentile rank is 100. The top-performing fund in a category will always receive a rank of 1. % Rank in Category is based on total returns which include reinvested dividends and capital gains, if any, and exclude sales charges.
8. StyleMap� depictions of mutual fund characteristics are produced using data and calculations provided by Morningstar, Inc. StyleMapsSM estimate characteristics of a fund's equity holdings over two dimensions: market capitalization and valuation. The percentage of fund assets represented by these holdings is indicated beside each StyleMap. Current StyleMap characteristics are calculated each time Morningstar receives updated portfolio holdings from a fund and are denoted with a dot. Historical StyleMap characteristics are calculated for the shorter of either the past 3 years or the life of the fund, and are represented by the shading of the box(es) previously occupied by the dot. StyleMap characteristics represent an approximate profile of the fund's equity holdings (e.g., domestic stocks, foreign stocks, and American Depositary Receipts), are based on historical data, and are not predictive of the fund's future investments. Although the data are gathered from reliable sources, accuracy and completeness cannot be guaranteed.
9. Please note Regional Diversification information is based on the equity components only.


Generally, data on Fidelity mutual funds is provided by FMR, LLC, Morningstar ratings and data on non-Fidelity mutual funds is provided by Morningstar, Inc. and data on non-mutual fund products is provided by the product's investment manager, trustee or issuer or the plan sponsor whose plan is offering the product to  participants.  Although Fidelity believes the data gathered from these third-party sources is reliable, it does not review such information and cannot warrant it to be accurate, complete or timely.  Fidelity is not responsible for any damages or losses arising from any use of this third-party information.

Before investing, consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the fund or annuity and its investment options. Contact Fidelity for a free prospectus and, if available, summary prospectus containing this information. Read it carefully.

Olstein Fund Bets on Consumer: Five Spot









Gregg Greenberg




Sep 1, 2009 1:00 AM EDT













 




























































 MILWAUKEE ( TheStreet) -- Eric Heyman, co-manager of the Olstein Strategic Opportunities Fund ( OFSAX), says it's a good time to be "skeptically bullish." He expects companies that make consumer discretionary products to gain as the economy improves. The fund has risen 31% this year, better than 90% of its Morningstar ( MORN) rivals. Over the past year, it has fallen 15%, better than 82% of its Morningstar peers. Welcome to TheStreet.com's Fund Manager Five Spot, where America's top mutual fund managers give their best stock picks in five fast and furious questions.  Are you a bull or a bear?  Heyman: As bottom-up value investors with a long-term investment horizon, we're typically neutral about the market's overall direction. That being said, in light of the extreme volatility we've experienced over the past 12 months, we do believe the market will continue to settle down with further rehabilitation of credit markets and a reduction in unemployment. But we're pleased the market has once again begun to focus on individual company valuations, so you can call us skeptically bullish.  What is your top stock pick?  Heyman: One area in which we have historically done well is identifying corporate turnarounds. A company that we believe is in the process of successfully transforming itself is Teleflex ( TFX). Beginning in 2007, management has transformed Teleflex from a diversified industrial products and medical company, to a company that now derives 70% of its profits from medical devices and surgical instruments. We believe Teleflex is an undervalued medical products company capable of generating over $5 per share of free cash flow in 2010.

 Don't get Bob Olstein started on Netflix. Or Cisco. Or Tesla. 




  When it comes to investing, the veteran fund manager said there are three key things he looks at: 
  "Price, price and price." 

That's why he prefers Walt Disney — which he says still has 30 percent of upside — to Netflix., which is currently trading north of 300 times estimated 2016 earnings. 
(To watch Kelly's full, in-depth interview with Bob Olstein, click here. 
)
As for any problems with Disney's juggernaut ESPN, he argues its slow growth is already priced in, and that he'll trade growth for strong free cash flow — another of his musts — any day. 
Tesla Motors? "Elon Musk is probably one of the brightest human beings in the history of mankind," Olstein said. But, "free cash flow is our mantra." 
Olstein, whose Purchase, New York-based Olstein Funds oversees a number of mutual funds, such as the all-cap value fund he launched in 1995, shared his views in the latest CNBC PRO "Value Spark" interview 
. 




  Never one to keep quiet about injustices he perceives, Olstein also inveighed against market forecasters, passive investing, exchange-traded funds, earnings manipulation, heavy stock-based compensation and what he calls the Wall Street "spin machine." 
  Take Cisco Systems, "I'm supposed to trust Wall Street research that in a nine-month period changed its value of Cisco" by $50 billion — twice, he admonished.  
"We like to sit out here, rip balance sheets and income statements apart, make investment decisions rather than market decisions," he said.  
  Indeed, that is why Olstein vehemently defends the cost of his mutual funds (his all-cap fund has a "high" fee, according to Morningstar, with a 2.26 percent expense ratio).  
"Do you believe that if you're sick you should go to the cheapest doctor? We spend our fees on doing research," and picking good stocks to invest in, he said.  
And funds like his are better and even safer for many retail investors than newer, cheaper exchange-traded funds, he argued.  
   "In ETFs, we've had two little mini crashes already," he said. On top of that, "anybody who tries to trade our fund ... always sells us at bottoms, and buys us at tops."

            Value Spark: Bob Olstein on the mutual fund industry   
			                        Thursday, 23 Jun 2016 | 10:00  AM ET |  00:55 




  The only advantage of an ETF over a mutual fund, Olstein said, is "for trading." His all-cap fund, he added, has turned a $10,000 investment in 1995 into $68,000 after fees today.  
As for the poor performance lately of many actively managed funds, particularly hedge funds, he said "it's probably true that only 15 percent to 20 percent" of the professionals are above average.     
He is equally upset by market professionals who make calls or predictions on where the market is headed, adding "I don't care whether it's Bill Gross ... or [Jeffrey] Gundlach ... or Stanley Druckenmiller."  
   While many of them have been successful traders or even have made prescient calls on the market in the past, he said, the idea that the market can be consistently forecast is as plausible as discovering a fountain of youth.  
   Getting back to his current stock picks, Olstein actually likes Cisco today, along with Legg Mason, Oracle, Zimmer Biomet Holdings, Keysight Technologies and retailers like Kohl's, Macy's and Bed Bath & Beyond.  
Isn't Bed Bath an example of "dying" old-school retail? Not to Olstein, who emphasizes that he sees the company generating $6 per share in free cash flow in the next couple years, and that the shares are worth more like $70 versus the $40 they trade for today.  
He is staying away from the big banks, though. "We got burned by derivatives in 2008," he said. "I don't understand them, I don't want to understand them." So, he is avoiding the big banks "only because of the derivative exposure." 
On the markets overall, Olstein added a final warning.  
The benchmark S&P 500 "was much more conservative 20 years ago," he said. Today, it has prominent members like Netflix, Amazon.com and Facebook — "growthy" companies trading at high multiples in new fields like social networking.  
   "I don't think the market's a bubble," he said, "it's just a different mentality."
