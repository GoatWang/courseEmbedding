Now let me turn the call over to Michael Davin.
Michael R. Davin
Thank you, Scott and good morning everyone. Strong demand in our domestic business drove another quarter of double-digit top line growth. Total revenue increased 10% to $78.4 million, a record for the third quarter from the $71.5 million in the same period of last year. North American product revenue was up 29% year-over-year led by contributions from our PicoSure, MonaLisa Touch and Icon products.
Q3 mark the 20th consecutive year-over-year quarterly increase for our domestic business. This performance speaks to our commitment to delivering innovative, high quality laser systems that are significantly improving esthetic health of consumers. Outside of North America, product revenue was essentially flat, compared to the third quarter of last year. Reflecting unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates and recent on unrest in the Middle East as well as a continued economic weakness in China. On a constant currency basis, international product revenue was up 6% year-over-year.
Looking at the proportion of revenue by region, North America accounted for 63% of product sales in the third quarter compared with 57% in the same period a year earlier. The higher percentage of business from North America contributed to an improvement in our adjusted gross margin, which improved 20 basis points to 58.6% in the quarter.

On the bottom line, our plan to increasing sales and marketing investments primarily related to the SculpSure launch, impacted net income performance in Q3. As Tim explained at last month’s Investor Day in New York, we expect to recover the operating leverage as we move forward with the SculpSure launch.
Turning to recent developments, the preliminary U.S. release of SculpSure, the world's first hyperthermic laser for non-invasive fat reduction of the flanks and abdomen is underway. We began initial shipments in Q3 and we've trained sales personnel in a number of key territories as well as play systems with several industry luminaries. The response from physicians and patients has been extremely favorable.
In recent weeks, SculpSure was also demonstrated at the American society for Dermatologic Surgery Annual Meeting in Chicago and the 2015 meeting of the American Society of Plastic Surgeons in Boston. Internationally, SculpSure was unveiled at this month's 25th European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology Congress in Copenhagen. In addition, training has been conducted at our direct sales offices in Europe and Australia. This follows our recite in Q3 of CE Mark approval for SculpSure, a key milestone in the commercialization of the product throughout the European union.
As we highlighted at our Investor Day, our marketing strategy with SculpSure centers on delivering a world-class platform directly to the physician. Our turnkey approaching includes resources and the field dedicated to marketing support to help practitioners to establishing grow their SculpSure practices as well as clinical specialists in the field who will provide ongoing clinical support to help and ensure that concerned customers are taking full advantage of SculpSure’s versatility and unique treatment options.
Now let me update you on the progress of MonaLisa Touch. Our fractional CO2 laser therapy for gynecologic health, Q3 marked the third full quarter, we have distributed the product in North America and the sales ramp continues to be positive. As I mentioned on our second quarter earnings call, our 13% dedicated specialty sales forces in place and we are very pleased with the success of recent marketing initiatives, including webinars, workshops and tradeshows and driving interest in the technology.
From the research perspective, a scientific poster on MonaLisa Touch was presented this month at the 2015 Annual Meeting of the North American Menopause Society. The poster presented the findings from a U.S. study of 27 patients with Genitourinary Syndrome of Menopause or GSM, who are treated with a MonaLisa Touch. The study conducted by Gynecologist Eric Sokol of Stanford University School of Medicine and Mickey Karram of The Christ Hospital in Cincinnati, concluded that the laser is an effective and safe method for the treatment of symptoms associated with GSM.
A total of 96% of patients reported that they were either satisfied or very satisfied with their treatment, while no patients reported that they were dissatisfied. MonaLisa Touch will also be the subject of symposium and an abstract presentation at a major gynecology meeting in Las Vegas next month. The symposium will review outcome data from Italian and U.S. studies on the use of the MonaLisa Touch laser therapy and discuss the effect of the MonaLisa touch laser treatment on a variety of gynecologic conditions.
Another important and recent development for us was the China Food and Drug Administration clearance of our 755 nanometer wavelength PicoSure for laser tattoo removal. This clearance is part of our broader strategy to market and distribute PicoSure internationally for a broad range of applications, including treatment of wrinkles and acne scars as well as the removal of pigmented lesions.

You will recall the 755 nanometer PicoSure received U.S. FDA clearance in late 2012 for the removal of tattoos and benign pigmented lesions and subsequently received marketing clearance in Canada, Australia, Korea and Taiwan. Last year with the addition of the FOCUS Lens Array our disposable energy delivery system, PicoSure gained expanded U.S. clearances for the treatment of wrinkles and acne scars. So the takeaway here is that we continue to have multiple growth opportunities with the PicoSure product.
In summary, we enter our seasonally strongest quarter with solid momentum. The full U.S. launch of SculpSure is on schedule for the first quarter of 2016, which we plan to coincide with the rollout of the product to our European direct offices in France, Germany as well as Australia. The key objectives with respect to SculpSure for the year ahead include, securing additional international registrations, gaining expanded clearances for treatment areas in addition to flanks and abdomen, pursuing aesthetic indications beyond non-invasive fat reduction and adding new distribution channels.
Now let me turn the call over to Tim for his financial review. Tim.
Timothy W. Baker
Thanks Mike and good morning everyone. As Mike noted, our third quarter revenue increased 10% as compared to the third quarter of 2014 to $78.4 million, which marks a Q3 record of Cynosure. Product revenue rose 16% to $64.6 million or 82% of total revenue. Revenue from parts, service and disposables increased 17% to $12.9 million primarily reflecting PicoSure's FOCUS Lens Array and consumables associated with the Ellmen product line.
Looking at product revenue by region, North America increased 29% over the prior year to $40.8 million and accounted for 63% of total product revenue. Revenue from products sold outside of North America was essentially flat compared to Q3 of 2014 at $23.8 million or 37% of total product revenue, primarily as a result of unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates as well as continued economic weakness in the EMEA and China. On a constant currency basis, international product revenue increased 6% from the third quarter of 2014.
Net income for the third quarter was $3.2 million or $0.14 per diluted share compared with net income of $3.1 million and also $0.14 per diluted share for the prior year period. Excluding acquisition cost, non-cash unrealized foreign exchange measurement losses and amortization of intangibles, non-GAAP net income for the third quarter of 2015 was $4.9 million or $0.21 per diluted share using an effective tax rate of 30%. This compared with $5.5 million or $0.25 per diluted share for the third quarter of 2014, also using effective tax rate of 30%.
As Mike mentioned, the variance primarily reflects sales and marketing investments associated with the SculpSure launch. Please see this morning's release for a reconciliation of third quarter 2015 non-GAAP result to the most directly comparable GAAP results.
Gross margin for the third quarter was 56.6% compared with 56.3% for the same period in 2014. On an adjusted basis, excluding non-cash charges related to the amortization of intangibles, gross margin was 58.6% in the third quarter of 2015 compared with 58.4% in the same period a year earlier. Excluding amortization and acquisition cost, operating expenses as a percentage of revenue were 49.5% compared with 47.1% in the third quarter of last year.
Sales and marketing expenses for the third quarter of 2015 were $26.8 million with 34.2 of revenue reflecting the ongoing addition of sales and marketing personnel and marketing initiatives associated with the launch of SculpSure. GAAP operating margin was 6.2% for the third quarter of 2015 compared with 7.3% for the third quarter of 2014.

Excluding acquisition and amortization expense, adjusted operating margin was 9.1% for the third quarter of 2015 compared with 11.4% for the third quarter of 2014, again reflecting investments in sales and marketing. We expect to see improved operating leverage in Q4 and into 2016.
For the third quarter of 2015, we incurred approximately $2.3 million in non-cash charges associated with the amortization of intangibles of which $1.6 million was charged to cost of goods sold. We expect to incur similar amortization cost for the fourth quarter of 2015. Our balance sheet remains strong. We generated $11 million in cash flow from operation resulting in cash and investments totaling $153.3 million at September 30 to compare with $133.4 million at year-end 2014.
We did not purchase any shares in the third quarter under our previously authorized share buyback program and at September 30 had approximately $4 million available under our $35 million share repurchase program. Day sales outstanding were 53 days at the end of Q3 down from 57 days for Q3 of 2014.
Before we go to Q&A, I want to let you know that Mike and I will be participating in two upcoming conferences in New York City. On Monday November 16, we will be meeting with investors at the Brean Capital 2015 Life Science Summit and the following day we will be presenting at the SAFO 2015 Healthcare Conference.
With that, Mike and I will be happy to take your questions. Operator.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session [Operator Instructions]. Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Richard Newitter with Leerink Partners. Please proceed with your question.
Richard Newitter
Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. Solid quarter I was hoping to maybe start on the OUS just I know that's been a little bit of a trouble spot for you guys, but you saw some improvement this quarter so I would love I think now you are into positive territory on a constant currency basis. Maybe you could just tell us a little bit about what you are seeing in some of the regions, last quarter you said you had some macro issues. How much of this is potentially some share gains and what should we expect for this business going forward?
Michael R. Davin
Yes, Rich. Obviously we are still striving for a better performance in the international markets, but we believe much of the performance is in relationship in macro environments, but we just really don’t have any control over the situation especially China and in the Middle-East. Our largest distributor actually comes out of the Middle-East and our largest subsidiary is our China business, our four different China offices there. So I don’t believe there has been a lot of positive news coming out recently in those two geographical areas that lead us to believe that there is going to be a significant improvement in business.
But we even made some changes ourselves, whether it's been our strategy and how we are going to go after the business in those regions or recent clearances, for example, in China the PicoSure clearance that we received right at the end of the quarter we believe will be a nice stimulus for new growth, which would be completely new to that region now having the first ever PicoSure device cleared in China as it relates to Middle-East.
We believe things will calm down there a little bit, and we've had great meetings with the leadership and our distributor there and so they are seeing a little bit of improvement and historically Q4 has done a strong quarter there. Europe we would say is stable and we hope to see a stronger quarter coming out of Q4, but a lot of that again is going to depend on what happens from the macro perspective.
Richard Newitter

Okay so still challenged, but clearly you guys are at least for Cyno making some progress. Got it, okay. If I could just turn just quickly to FX. Tim what was the overall FX impact to worldwide sales what was your constant currency growth for the overall top line and what if any impact was there to EPS
Timothy W. Baker
So overall it was about $2.1 million on the revenue line from FX perspective, again on the FX, again not as impact because you have got again our subsidiaries all operating and local currency from P&L perspective. So on the EPS line its fairly neutral, but on the top line its $2.1 million of which $1.6 related to product sales, laser product sales.
Richard Newitter
Okay, very helpful then just one quick one Tria, I think last year you guys had a particularly tough comp, because you had some Tria revenue. Can you just tell us maybe your underlying performance might have actually been understated this quarter, could you break that contribution out in the prior year quarter and what your growth would have been excluding that?
Timothy W. Baker
Well, I'll let you do the math, but last year Q3 2014 we had $3 million Tria settlement which obviously did not repeat this year. So you have a $3 million onetime pick up in Q4 and Q3 of 2014 related to the Tria settlement.
Richard Newitter
Okay, so maybe you guys even did closest to mid-teens growth when you back that out?
Timothy W. Baker
Yes.
Richard Newitter
Okay and then just lastly, on U.S. North America coming in at 29% that's obviously an incredibly strong performance once again. Can you give us any granularity on the contribution to that growth, MonaLisa clearly continues to gain attraction based on our checks? Can you give us any directional color on how much of the growth is coming from MonaLisa versus some of the maybe the Ellmen versus kind of your core business?
Michael R. Davin
Yes Rich as you know we don't breakout revenue by product, but we are very pleased not only with Q3's performance in North America, but the year. I think the year we’re up 39% in North America for the first nine months, which was excellent and we do believe its across the board. As I mentioned, whether it's Icon’s performance, PicoSure's performance, certainly MonaLisa Touch as well as the Ellmen contributions as Tim mentioned, ConBio continues to do well for us.
We just have a very diversified product portfolio right now with several different levers that are doing extremely well in North America. And as you know, North America received clearances for these devices, usually well ahead of our international markets and that's why we are very pleased to get the clearance for PicoSure in China, but I just think overall a great contribution from our North American distribution and being very focused on the complete product portfolio, I'm getting real nice performance across the board.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Difei Yang with Brean Capital. Please proceed with your question.
Difei Yang
Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. So for the pending European launch of offshore, how should we think about the potential uptake curve? Is there anything that we should think about European market dynamics might be different from North American market?
Michael R. Davin
Yes, so as I mentioned, we trained our direct offices on SculpSure at the European Academy of Dermatology Meeting which was in Copenhagen in the middle of October. The training went very well, so our direct offices in Germany, Spain, U.K. and France and we also had our Australian office there for training as well anticipating Australian clearance hopefully fairly soon.
The training was very well and our folks in Europe are engaged now in building the infrastructure similar to what we are creating here in the U.S. from the marketing initiatives as well as the clinical initiatives and distribution initiatives. They are very excited to have the product and what we are hearing from luminaries in Europe is they really buy into the hyperthermic approach versus other approaches that are on the market today. And really understand the physics behind using a hyperthermic-based device and they love the versal applicator system.

We believe the market is also very, very large. The one difference there that we don't see as much of here in the United States is there are number of competitive products especially from [Criogen] (Ph) perspective, there is probably four different Criogen products in the market there, but we don't really see those products here in the United States. So we believe that also offers us leverage with having the hyperthermic device, having the versal applicator system, having the shorter treatment time to physician against what we believe is a fairly confused market in the Europe with a number of not only of Criogen devices, but other types of devices that have been introduced by small companies to address body contouring.
So our offices are very excited about the launch as we mentioned, we really wont to see any traction as it relates to the release of the product there until Q1.
Difei Yang
Thank you for the additional color. Just a follow-up with regards to the U.S. market for non-invasive fat reduction, we have a number of different approaches and from the initial launch, do you hear from the position that they tend to like different modality of the machines in their office or do they tend to just make a decision go with one technology?
Michael R. Davin
No, I mean, we are very early as we mentioned in the Investor Day in terms of the penetration of technology as it relates to the addressable market in North America and definitely from a global perspective. We've really believe there has been one company that has the majority the market share and there has been other product that have been introduced to the market but for variety of reasons they haven’t been that successful.
So I believe now that our solution is available and a number of our doctors that whether its luminary related or some of our early shipments, they either own other technology or they don’t, but some of them do own the leading technology on the market and they are excited about offering, what SculpSure brings to their patients from a differentiation perspective. Especially the versal applicator system where they can treat multiple anatomical areas at one time and they also see enormous value in the shorter treatment time where they can really drive throughput, not only for non-invasive body contouring procedures but they are able to free up treatment rooms for other cosmetic indications such as fillers, injectables, skin rejuvenation. So we are very early in the game, we don’t believe at all that physicians will be centric to one technology, we believe the market and the opportunity is so significant that they will have multiple different types of technology to address this high volume indication.
Difei Yang
Okay thank you. And one last question. When do you think - I assume would be sometime next year that you might be able to guide us with regards to how SculpSure is doing on the uptake side, will that happen sometime in 2016?
Michael R. Davin
Yes as traditional with Cynosure you in past flagship product launches, we will keep everybody informed on our course of action, which we are really not deviating with SculpSure versus any other product we launch and that’s to see the market with our key opinion leaders to continue to drive excellent clinical data as it relates to the product. We expect they have the very exciting American Society for Laser Medicines and Surgery Meeting for SculpSure, which will held in Boston this year and late March and April. We are getting our distribution well positioned and trained globally and so we will keep everybody updated the new infrastructural investments we are making from a marketing and clinical perspective and so we will keep you posted from that perspective. In terms of breaking out the financials as it relates to SculpSure we will handle SculpSure in a traditional manner as we have every other flagship product we've launched over the past ten-years.

Difei Yang
Okay thank you and congrats on a great quarter.
Scott Solomon
Thank you very much.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of John Block with Stifel. Please proceed with your questions.
John Block
Great thanks and good morning guys. Maybe be just two or three. First on MonaLisa, we believe the result have been very solid in aiding the North America results, can you comment on your ability to possibly secure the worldwide rights for that product and in a 13 North American reps for MonaLisa, what are the thoughts about expanding that really at a higher level. How do you balance the incremental dollar between SculpSure and MonaLisa?
Michael R. Davin
Right now, we have the exclusive distribution John in North America and we are pending the Heath Canada clearance for the product and as it relates to other opportunities outside of North America. We believe there are some opportunities where we will be able to distribute the technology from the supplier, but right now, we are dedicated right now in selling at just in the United States and we are anticipating Health Canada soon.
But yes, there is an opportunity to have additional international market opportunities and we are in discussions as it relates to that opportunity with the supplier. As it relates to the 13 specialist, we really just completed the hiring of those folks at the end of Q1. So this is really two quarters that they have been in the field, we have done this before in creating a bifurcated distribution, whether it was only introduced to pinpoint [Veronica] (Ph) mycosis or our specialty sales force our minimally invasive products with Cellulaze and with Smartlipo. So we will size accordingly, I think probably there is an interest to while I know images to explore developing that distribution even greater based on the success we are having. But we believe right now we are sized appropriately, but as we look to 2016, there is a good possibility that we may add additional feet on the street dedicated to this opportunity.
John Block
Okay, perfect that was very helpful and then just to shift gears to SculpSure for a second. Can you just talk about the additional indications for SculpSure and maybe any timing or color there. I guess where I'm go with it, I believe in seeing the system in Boston, the current system can be used off label for thought, but how about some momentum just when I look at that system, are you going to need a new hand piece or an on add-on to treat something like submental?
Michael R. Davin
Yes so we are looking at a number of options as it relates to this technology not only for treating other anatomical areas but also for broadening the technology for the use in enhanced body contouring indications. So we are not going to get into what those are for obvious reason, but one of the beauties of a hyperthermic device versus other technology in the market that’s extremely limited in its capabilities to be diversified is that we can modify the technologies so that can do other things and certainly our 25-years history of using hyperthermic approaches or laser based devises we are well aware and our knowledge of 10-years of being the leader in minimally invasive fat removal with Smartlipo, we have a lot of experience and knowledge on potential other opportunities for this device. So we are exploring those right now aggressively from a research prospective and development prospective. As it relates to other anatomical areas, we are pursuing rest of body clearance. We also know that submental is a very important area of treatment and yes we are defiantly exploring that opportunities as well with the current platform.
John Block
Great and last one, I promise and then I’ll just jump back in the queue. Tim for you just, on the share report. I think you said nothing was done in the quarter, I believe just $4 million on the prior that expires in November, if I’m correct, and then you just any thoughts you have - not asking 2016 guidance, but any cadence to leverage, I mean just when we think about how you are bringing on the spend and ramp in some of these new product like SculpSure? Thanks guys.

Timothy W. Baker
So John relative to the side back you are we have $4 million left, I believe it does not expire in November, it goes at least throughout the next year. we have not purchased anything year-to-date in this year as pricing at this levels, but there is 4 million still available and I think it goes to August of next year.
In terms of the spend, as we talked about at the SculpSure Investor Meeting in September, we did talked about kind of initial investment and looked at a sales and marketing as a percentage at revenue at 35% target for this quarter, which came in at 34% so we are a little better than that. But I’ll talk you about in terms of the investment, in terms of marketing spend and hiring these additional personnel as Mike talked about, putting these direct resources in the field whether it would be sales resources, marketing resources, clinical resources, our whole approach is to bring these recourses to the customer and that takes that short term investment upfront. So we do see that happening now, we saw that this past quarter, we do see that continuing in Q4, but as we mentioned in September, we do expect to see that begins to leverage as early as Q4 as we increased the shipment level of SculpSure leading to the full launch in Q1. But just even on incremental SculpSure revenue, we anticipate in Q4, we think we will see some revenue leveraging that down to more on that 32% to 34% on sales and marketing. So we do expect to see leverage fairly quickly and improving even more as we go out into 2016.
John Block
Great. Thank you.

Our next question comes from a line of Suraj Kalia with Northland Securities. Please proceed with your question.
Suraj Kalia
Good morning gentlemen. Congrats on a nice quarter once again.
Scott Solomon
Thanks Suraj.
Suraj Kalia
So Michael, a couple of question for you and then I’ll go over to Tim. Nine months into the rollout of MonaLisa Touch Michael, and I know you guys don’t give specific, can you give us some directional color just for us to get a handle on the adoption rate. Yes we are getting the anecdotal information from the field, but can you give us some idea in terms of these when you centers have shown interest, these many procedures per center, just some color to give us a qualitative aspect on MonaLisa Touch in the U.S?
Michael R. Davin
Sure Suraj, and as you the introduction in MonaLisa Touch is a complete departure from our traditional business, which is a cosmetic industry and so we are very excited to have this be our first fore into women health and that’s really what this about its women's health. So if you just look at the opportunity that MonaLisa Touch potentially could address, which is really vaginal atrophy. There is 58 million American women that are postmenopausal of which 50% or greater experience some form of vaginal atrophy.
And so the addressable market is very large, but keep in mind there are a number of products on the market today, estrogen replacement therapy, other products like Asaphena and other drugs out there that are providing a solution to women to address this indications. So MonaLisa Touch now falls from a device prospective into a category of an opportunity for physicians who use this device to treat vaginal atrophy. So we are very early in the game, we're pleased not only with how the product is doing from a sales perspective, but we are more importantly pleased with how well it's doing from a clinical prospective.
And the satisfaction I mentioned earlier from the physicians and a patients is extremely high. I guess the only caution I have out there is there is not a lot clinical data that’s been driven by United States physicians as it relates to using this technology to treat this indication and most of the data is coming out of Europe. Although the data is very credible coming out of Europe from very well-known Euro gynecologist in that country.

Cynosure is very focused on driving clinical studies with U.S. KOLs key opinion leaders to once again to demonstrate the validity of this technology from a clinical prospective. So with a marathon amount of sprint the market is huge, if you look at the number of gynecologists in the United States is well over 30,000 gynecologist, although 50% of them work at hospital ad not private practices, this is a private practice procedures. So we have a complete business plan around this, we are very focused on the long-term strategy, we are very pleased of where we are, but we really are nine months into the distribution.
And we will continue to give you color on the investments we are making to drive a clinical validation, to continue to develop key opinion leaders, we've placed a number of systems in academic institutions with high profile, Euro gynecologist and gynecologist to help us better to understand how broad is technology can really be and the treatment of this high volume indication for women's health. So that's just where we are right now, we will continue to keep you posted in the coming quarters.
Suraj Kalia
Okay, and Michael again for SculpSure admittedly it's very early in the launch. Can you give us some color that the initial interest, is it from accounts that are already strong in crude sculpt or is the initial interest from De Novo Greenfield accounts that are either have experience in some sort of hyperthermic device and its venturing out into non-invasive fat reduction.
Michael R. Davin
Yes. Once again, the market we believe is huge, if you just look at North America as we said on the Investor Day, we believe the core market of dermatologist and plastic surgeons which is 20,000 now, there is less than 10% penetrated and then the noncore physician market, which is almost 300,000 physicians with less than 1% penetrated. If you look at Cynosure's performance over the last several years, 60% of our revenue comes from the noncore market, maybe look at our global installed base its almost 60,000 devices, one of the advantageous we have is our ability to go directly to our very satisfied installed base and position this technology to them. They know Cynosure has an outstanding reputation of introducing safe and effective and clinically validated technology to them in the past for a variety of high line indications and they expect that exact same deliverable from Cynosure's to them with SculpSure.
So were leveraging all of that. We are going directly after our installed base, another thing, most of that do not have another product because they have been waiting for Cynosure to introduce a product. Some do have other products, but are very intrigued by what hypothermic is going to bring to their practice. So across the board a lot of interest in the technology, we are thrilled to finally get this product rolling into the market, we are very excited about Q1 being our first full launch into the markets as we discussed earlier and we will keep you posted as things develop.
Suraj Kalia
Fair enough. Mike one question for you and one last question for Tim. I'll hop back in queue. So Mike in Q2 and forgive me if my numbers are a little off here, OUS revs as reported were down 10% year-over-year. If I remember correctly, FX impact was negative 6% or so this quarter my math at least the reported OUS revs are down 1%, so FX it looks like had a negative 7% impact. I guess the question, I know it was asked earlier, let me rephrase, do you think we are at the point where OUS is stabilizing for Cynosure, because if you keep putting up such strong U.S. growth even if OUS stabilizes the net impact on your P&L is going to be pretty significant. So can you give us some color whether we are definitively at that point where things are stabilizing OUS?

Michael R. Davin
Well I defer to Tim on the numbers who threw out there, because I'm not the expert there, but assuming you are accurate with the numbers you have put out from an FX impact on the business. Looking ahead though, I mentioned earlier, not having control over the macro situations in these markets, we do believe we are well positioned from an infrastructural standpoint, from regulatory clearances that we not only receive, but we will be receiving going forward, our offices are well established in those markets for years. 81% of our revenue comes from our direct offices where we have real control over the messaging and the distribution and our business strategy. As you know in the past, if you look at even 2010 and 2011, the majority of our revenue is coming out of our international offices.
So one of the beauties of being multinational and being diversified is you are going to have these ebbs and flows from a macro perspective where certain regions or continents are going to be stronger than others. We are hopeful as we go into 2016 that the overall macro environment gets better, but we don’t have any control over that but we do know one thing. We are going to continue to get registrations for products, we are going to get SculpSure out into those markets next year and there are other opportunities to get registrations for products where we are direct that are going to drive new revenue opportunities that we don’t currently have.
But on the macro side as you know as well as I do, we just have to see how things play out, so they could have detriment on the business if we continue to see some of these fluctuations that we are seeing in currency or unrest that we just have no control over.
Suraj Kalia
Fair enough. And Tim one quick one, I promise I'll hop back in queue. My apologizes, I missed part of this. I know there was commentary about U.S. product revs being 63% of product sales. Can you help me reconcile the gross margin being relatively flat, because obviously there is an impact from FX, product mix, so on and so forth. If you could just give a little more granularity there would be greatly appreciated. Congrats again. Thanks for taking my questions.
Scott Solomon
Thank you.
Timothy W. Baker
Sure. As we mentioned yes, product sales in North America is 63% of total laser product sales for the quarter, 37% being international. We did see an uptick of 20 basis points in our margin, I think overall I think we would see stable pricing in the U.S. markets, we are currently seeing some pricing pressures in those international markets as you just went over with Mike, but overall we are seeing a positive trend in our margin each quarter. We are seeing sequentially going up 10, 20, 30 basis points, we think that will continue as again when we rollout these new products and as the international markets strengthen.
Maybe one point back on the international is we are seeing - the nice part about our diversification strategy is that we obviously are in a number of international markets and we are seeing bright spot there too, it’s not all dark internationally. I mean our Asia Pac subsidiaries as well as our Asia Pac distributors showed good growth year-over-year and actually for the quarter our Middle East distributors for the quarter showed good growth year-over-year. So we do see some good pockets and some stabilization, there are clearly some weak points particularly in Europe or European subs and some direct European distributors, but overall we are seeing some nice stabilization and bright spots in some of the other parts of the word.
Scott Solomon
Thank you.
Operator
Our next question comes from a line of Anthony Vendetti with Maxim. Please proceed with your question.
Anthony V. Vendetti

Thanks. So maybe just a follow up on that Tim and then some broader question. So gross margins, as you said you going up 10 to 20 basis points, do you expect that to continue, is that due to pricing power that you have with the new products or just in terms of they are just higher margin product MonaLisa Touch, SculpSure, PicoSure?
Timothy W. Baker
Yes I think it's all of the above, I think it's product mix and obviously brining a new products like MonaLisa, like PicoSure even Icon, we are still getting very good pricing and Icon is marked leading in product and as we introduce SculpSure, we expect that to be a accretive to our margin clearly with the PACs coming into the play, which will obviously accretive to our margin and the system itself will be accretive to our margin. So we think we have a some nice catalysts out there in terms of product introductions and pricing of those products as well as back to international markets. We are seeing some bright spots there, which are recovering some pricing. So based on that mix, we expect to see that be incremental to our gross margin. So we think we will continue to improve gross margin, again we are doing a 20 to 30 basis points each quarter over the last three quarters, so we expect that trend to continue.
Anthony V. Vendetti
Okay and then just broadly on SculpSure, I know in the introduction on your September 15, Analyst Day, you talked about offering a discount for the PACs for the consumable piece as an initial promotion. Is that promotion through the end of the year and then what has been at least in the initial launch, and I know it's a soft launch right now or pre-launch. What has been the ASP for SculpSure on the system?
Timothy W. Baker
So in terms of the promotion on the PACs or the pre-promotion in PAC is $50 per applicator, we are to your point Anthony offering a $35 per applicator through the end of this year. So that promotion will continue to the end of this year.
As it relate to ASP, we don’t obviously disclose ASP, but I will tell you is a number of customers are very excited about the promotion program, we have a lot of impound interest and we are very pleased with the reception of this promotion program that we have offered and a lot of our existing customers are very excited about it and we are getting a lot of a good interests on it and we expect to see that to continue to the end of the year.
Anthony V. Vendetti
Okay and then just Mike, I know we spent some time this year talking a lot about MonaLisa Touch and I know it's a new market for you and going to a lot of these different conferences. I know the market is large, but would you characterize the initial launches as better than internal expectations and just if you can give a little more color on MonaLisa Touch pricing list ASP and then I know like you said you don’t give out that product sales, but is it in this quarter or at least through the year, would you its exceed internal expectations?
Michael R. Davin
Yes so MonaLisa Touch as I mentioned we are to remind everybody just nine months into the launch of the product, typical with Cynosure launch a number of initiatives that we engage in from a marketing and distribution prospective those are in place and going well. The list price on the box is a 140,000 typical of our North American sales force, they are doing a great job in driving the value proposition of what this product offers the physician and so our ASPs are strong.
Once again we don’t disclose ASPs, but they are strong and we are very pleased with once again this being a new category for us, so there is a kind of a shift in the mindset and how we market a product like this, dealing directly with a gynecologist in a procedure that is more specific to their medical discipline than cosmetics. And so there is a learning course, it's going very well and we want to continue to stay the course with our strategy, which is a long-term approach to enter this market and to gain market share. But more importantly as I mentioned physician and patients are thrilled with the results and that as you know is going to drive the momentum of this opportunity going forward.

Anthony V. Vendetti
Okay and then just another question on SculpSure, so FDA approval I think - early FDA approval which has been for several months now its caught everyone quite surprise at least it was earlier than I think maybe even you expected certainly than I expected. And it seems like the full launch is first quarter 2016 particularly in Europe, obviously you are taking orders now in the U.S. Is there any reason to believe that fourth quarter, which is obviously the strongest quarter of the year wouldn't be a strong quarter in the U.S for SculpSure?
Michael R. Davin
Antony as you know, yes first of all we were very pleased with how quickly we received the FDA clearance and it was well ahead of schedule and kudos to our regulatory team and our clinical team in driving that process. But as I have mentioned several times, we have always been on a parallel path with the introduction of SculpSure to the market from a development strategy as well as from a regulatory strategy. So the development strategy is still on schedule and we have not alluded to international - the first full quarter really being international focus in terms of product revenue.
We are speaking about the full launch really being engaged in the first quarter of 2016, so we saw some revenue in this quarter, we definitely saw nice order flow this quarter, we've made a distribution very aware and customers aware that we are still on the same production schedule with full ramp on production in Q1 whether that’s U.S or whether that’s international. So we are taking orders with the expectation of shipments really not ramping up until Q1.
Anthony V. Vendetti
Okay and then and just lastly probably more of a Tim question. So organic revenue growth, if we just look at organically I know there were some question in the beginning, if we strip out some of royalties or one time payments or stuff like that. If we just look at organic revenue growth whether its organic product revenue growth or total organic revenue growth. What would be the right number for that Tim?
Timothy W. Baker
Yes I think you got to as look at our - define our business, right our business is bringing in new technology, brining new products and if we take out one timers like Tria, last year in Q3, you take that out and our overall revenue growth was up 14% year-over-year instead of the 10% as reported. So you can take out those type of thing, I mean I think in the end of day our business is about introducing new technologies and broadening our markets, so there wasn’t really an acquisition.
Ellman was really immaterial, we had some Ellman last year Q3, which we disclosed in our filings last year it was about $2.5 million of revenue last year in Ellman. Again, that business is a nice business for us, but it’s not a material business to our product line. So I think if you look overall, it is an organic growth rate right now when you look at our 14%, because that’s our business and that’s the products that we are selling. So I think you have to look at the business more holistically and again you can take out one timers like the Tria which again obviously helps us to the 14%, but |we think overall that is our business.
Anthony V. Vendetti
Okay and then just lastly Tim on the difference between GAAP and non-GAAP. I don’t think there were any charges this quarter so the differences is the stock based comp or is there anything else in there?
Timothy W. Baker
No difference is amortization of the intangibles that we have every quarter since the Palomore deal and the unrealized measurement gains and losses on FX. So stock based comp is included in the numbers as we reported adjust.
Anthony V. Vendetti
Okay but there were no charge no one-time charges?
Timothy W. Baker
No, correct.

Anthony V. Vendetti
Okay great. Alright, thanks.
Scott Solomon
Thanks Ant.

Our next question comes from the line of Zach Ajzenman with Griffin Securities. Please proceed with your question.
Zachary R. Ajzenman
Thanks good morning. First question assuming the difficult environment in China would continue. How long would it take PicoSure ramp to begin to [nursely] (Ph) offset the weakness in that region?
Michael R. Davin
Yes it is difficult question, I don’t first of all to mind you and others, say clearance we received for PicoSure in China was for the removal of tattoos. We believe the broader opportunity in that market Asia Pac and China obviously included if the skin rejuvenation pigmented lesion market and so we are limited in terms of how we can position PicoSure to go after the higher volume indications in China which would be the non-pigmented lesions and skin rejuvenation.
We are in the process of driving that process for those clearances, but we don’t have as of yet. So we are somewhat limited with the tattoo removal clearance. Although with the clearance at least having the device cleared, we are able to go after certain aspects of the market there more of the private sector market and position the technology for tattoo removal, but physicians can also use the technology off label, but we cannot market it as such. So it will definitely be a stimulus for the Chinese business, but it’s not going to be as significant as the stimulus we will see once we get the skin rejuvenation clearances.
Zachary R. Ajzenman
Okay got you. One on SculpSure, I don’t want to beat the dead horse, but the sales and marketing as a percentage of sales this past quarter was a little light relative to the guidance provided at the Investor Day meeting. Were there personnel and marketing spend related to SculpSure that were pushed out or the company is pulling the range elsewhere?
Michael R. Davin
No I think Zach we are pretty much right on, we had shown as 35% on the kind of the overhead chart that we showed, but we are talking about is a range of 34% to 36% and we came in at 34%. So no just really rounding on the dollars, no change, no slowdown, we did the marketing spend in Q3 that we anticipated, we hired 17 people related to SculpSure in the quarter as anticipated. So, I think everything rolled out as we talked about in September, just rounded down at 34% versus 35%
Zachary R. Ajzenman
Okay got you. And just a couple of more, beginning in Q1 of this year Icon began to be specifically included in the prepared remarks of the driver. What are some of the variables that to help us to better understand, how or why it’s become notable one referencing healthy traction here in North America?
Michael R. Davin
Yes, Icon, if you go back from you acquired Palomar, one of the main interest from a product perspective of that acquisition was the Icon platform, which is also the Starlux platform and [Slux] (ph) platform so it’s had a legacy reputation and Icon being the successor of really being a very versatile platform to treat a variety of cosmetic indications especially centered around skin rejuvenation, because of its multiple delivery systems. Where we are seeing excellent traction of that product is in the non-core physician market that maybe for the first time wanting to acquire a technology for treatment of cosmetic procedures in their practice and they like the versatility of this platform where it allows them to treat a variety of cosmetic indication. So, it's getting real good uptake in the non-core physician market, which we’re also just seeing growth in naturally because of introduction of the Affordable Care Act and once again reduction in insurance paid medicine fees to these physicians. So overall, its performing extremely well in the non-core physician market, as we would have anticipated based on the unique nature of that platform and its versatility to treat a wide range of indications.

Zachary R. Ajzenman
Got you, and last one just on the capital structure, $154 million of cash in equivalents or about 20% of the market cap, can you update us on some of the most recent thoughts and views on how you guys are thinking about deploying that capital?
Michael R. Davin
Yes you know in the past, our main use of the cash has been stock buyback, we've acquired our equity back and as Tim mentioned, we have a plan that's open right now with still $4 million in the balance and we will continue to review that opportunity at the board level and certainly buy our equity back at certain levels. And then the other use of cash is spend in relationship to mergers and acquisitions, as you know, we've acquired four companies in the last four years, we're still very actively pursuing opportunities from an M&A perspective. And we will keep you posted as those things develop, but that's really been the other use of our cash. So to this point, we don't see any changes as it relates to how we will use our cash.
Zachary R. Ajzenman
All right. Thanks guys.

Our next question comes from the line of Jim Sidoti with Sidoti & Company. Please proceed with your question.
James Sidoti
Good morning. Can you hear me?
Michael R. Davin
Yes Jim.
Timothy W. Baker
Hey Jim.
James Sidoti
Hey it’s been a long call, but I just want one follow-up on that last question, between MonaLisa, SculpSure, the rollout of PicoSure in China, do you think you have enough on your plate right now that you can continue to grow at your historical rates without acquisitions or do you think you will continue to pursue acquisitions, even though the new product pipeline is so right now?
Michael R. Davin
That's a great question, Jim and I would say my 12-years of being here this is if not the most exciting, one of the most exciting times in Cynosure. So it relates to our product portfolio, the unique nature of our product portfolio and the opportunities that product portfolio provides to our global market, in terms of our presence around the globe, in terms how we are channeling this technology to go after a driving revenues. So, we've a lot going on and obviously SculpSure, we're very excited about the launch of that product and we believe the opportunity there is enormous.
So, we're going to stay very focused on the organic opportunities, but as you know, as we came out of the recession in 2009, the strength of our balance sheet allowed us to acquire some very attractive technologies and to be able to channel those into our company and through our distribution and drive some of the growth that we've certainly been experiencing over the last couple of years. And at a high level that’s still part of our strategy to continue to look at M&A, although we do believe our industry is fairly consolidated, so we have a little different perspective now on maybe how we will use that cash and maybe entering into different verticals and different opportunities versus the traditional opportunities we've look at in the past.
But your point is valid and we're very committed to staying focused on these multiple levers that we have to continue to drive the growth for Cynosure and if the right opportunity comes along from a merger or from an acquisition perspective, we're ready in position to be able to make the move.
James Sidoti
All right. Thank you guys.

Our next question comes from the line of Emmanuel de Figueiredo with LBV Asset Management. Please proceed with your question.
Emmanuel de Figueiredo
Yes, hello. Can I ask a question on China and Hong Kong and if you can give a bit of granularity on what you saw in Q3 and what your people are telling you for the balance of the year?
Michael R. Davin
Sure, so, what we've seen in China is more from the macro perspective is there has been a slowdown obviously in the growth of the economy, there has been a devaluation of the currency, which naturally I believe creates some anxiety amongst the consumer and therefore buying decisions are slowed down or all of our procedures are cash reimbursed and that's pretty much the case as well in China.

And so I just think there is an uneasiness right now on what is the long term outlook for the Chinese economy and that will obviously put pause in places as it relates to people's buying decisions, whether it's physicians or patients pulling back a little bit and being more conservative as it relates to the spending discretionary income for these types of procedures. So I think all-in-all we’re still very bullish on the China market, we opened our fourth office this year, we’re excited about getting the Pico clearance, we’re excited about further expanding that product’s clearances going forward and we think that will be a great stimulus for growth in the China market.
We’re excited to get SculpSure approved into that market, one of the other challenges of China today though is the regulatory process has been significantly increased in terms of the term it takes to get the product approved through the Chinese FDA. So that will slow down a little bit the entry of new products for the market from a registration process, but overall, we’re still very bullish on China, it's just the macro environment has created a bit of a pause and a slowdown we believe in the buying decisions and also the appetite of the consumer to pursue cosmetic procedures. So they better understand how the economy is going to play out in the future.
Emmanuel de Figueiredo
But can you confirm that you are still experiencing constant currency growth there or its gone negative?
Timothy W. Baker
No, we are seeing constant currency growth, small numbers single-digits and obviously much less than we had seen over the last three or four years. So growth is clearly slowing, but we are still in a positive trend.
Emmanuel de Figueiredo
Great. And just two follow-ups on MonaLisa, the first one is when do you think realistically - I mean at the moment you have a monopoly in this pathology, but when do you think realistically one of your competitors will come with another laser and what sort of patent protection you have?
Michael R. Davin
Yes. Actually we wouldn’t say it's a monopoly, there are competitive devices out there today, there are three that I know of that are available on the market, outside of MonaLisa Touch and so I think the market is very large and similar to the noninvasive body contouring there is room for more than one player. And our strategy we believe is one and which is maybe a little different in the way the others are approaching the opportunity and we are going to continue to drive that strategy and we are going to continue to invest in better understanding how this technology can have broader opportunities as it relates to addressing these very important women’s health indications, but there is competition out there today and so we are up against that has as we speak.
Emmanuel de Figueiredo
Okay. And my last one is on MonaLisa. You have repeatedly said it's only been nine months, but looking into 2016, would it be reasonable to assume that you could grow this 50% or you think that's completely off wrong, I should be more conservative.
Timothy W. Baker
You should be more conservative.
Emmanuel de Figueiredo

Our next question comes from the line of [Andy Sobiech] (Ph) a Private Investor. Please proceed with your question.
Unidentified Analyst
Thank you. I'm going to try to keep these real quick just a couple Tim for you. Can you give us any estimate for the incremental cost in sales and marketing associated with SculpSure for 4Q above the expense that was incurred in this quarter?
Timothy W. Baker
Sure. So at our Investor presentation in September we laid out kind of what we saw as incremental cost for Q3, Q4 and Q1 of 2016. So in Q3, we looked at about a million dollars of marketing spend plus about $200,000 in headcount hire and that's about where we came in. for Q4, we are anticipating additional $1.1 million in marketing with additional million dollars of headcount cost as we ramped up these people. And then going into Q1, we looked at 1.6 of headcount and 2.3 of direct marketing programs so 3.9.

So we looked at it kind of over Q3, Q4 and Q1 incremental spending of $7.2 million up and above our normal spend rates, but as we mentioned earlier, we expect to see that begin to leverage as early as Q4 as we begin to roll some SculpSure shipments out the door.
Unidentified Analyst
Yes. And that bring me to my second question for you. The systems that were place with luminaries, those were basically evaluation units I understand maybe a half of dozen or so. Did any of those convert to revenue or will they convert to a purchase in the current quarter?
Michael Davin
Yes Andy, its Michael. Typical whenever we launch a new product it's very common for us to seed luminaries and I could say those were not for revenue, but they are in exchange for [indiscernible] equity mainly driving clinical studies for us to further expand the clinical validation as a platform, some research projects that we are working on right now to look at additional indication, also we place units for training and for educational purposes. So the devices that are out there as it relates to that category of luminaries, there was no revenue recorded, there was no revenue generated from those units.
Unidentified Analyst
Thank you for clarifying that. I'm going to pass it along, it’s been a long call.

This report is not for commercial use. Thorough reviews have been conducted to assure this data accurately reflects disclosures. However for a complete and definitive understanding of the pay practices of any company, users should refer directly to the actual, complete proxy statement. 
Use of Data / Disclaimer
The information shown here is a reporting of information included in the company's proxy statement. The proxy statement includes footnotes and explanations of this information plus other information that is pertinent in assessing the overall value and appropriateness of the compensation information. For those interested in conducting a detailed compensation analysis, we recommend that you review the entire proxy statement. You may retrieve the full proxy statement by going to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) website at www.sec.gov and entering the company's name and then looking in the first column for an entry of "Form DEF 14A" (or any similar code). You may also find the annual proxy statement by going directly to the company's website.
What is a proxy statement?
A proxy statement (or "proxy") is a form that every publicly traded U.S. company is required to file with the U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) within 120 days after the end of its fiscal year. The proxy must be sent to every shareholder in advance of the company's annual shareholders meeting. All proxy statements are public filings made available to the general public by the SEC.
The proxy statement's main purpose is to alert shareholders to the annual meeting and provide them information about the issues that will be voted on during the annual meeting, including decisions such as electing directors, ratifying the selection of auditors, and other shareholder-related decisions, including shareholder-initiated initiatives. Also, proxies must disclose specific detailed information regarding the pay practices for certain executives.
