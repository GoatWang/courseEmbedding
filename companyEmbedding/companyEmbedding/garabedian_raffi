First Solar Appoints Raffi Garabedian Chief Technology Officer; Dave Eaglesham Retires

 TEMPE, Ariz.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--

      First Solar, Inc. (NASDAQ: FSLR) today announced the retirement of Dave

      Eaglesham, Chief Technology Officer, and the appointment of Raffi

      Garabedian as his successor. Garabedian joined First Solar in 2008 as

      Director of Disruptive Technologies, and was promoted to Vice President

      of Advanced Technologies in 2010, overseeing the Company's advanced

      research and development (R&D) operations in Santa Clara, Calif.



      Eaglesham joined First Solar in 2006, and during his six years as First

      Solar's top technologist the Company's R&D group has achieved multiple

      world records for cadmium-telluride (CdTe) cell and module efficiency.

    


      "We thank Dave for his tremendous contribution to our success and his

      unwavering commitment to our mission, and we wish him the very best,"

      said Mike Ahearn, First Solar's Chairman. "Raffi is an experienced

      technology leader with a proven track record in our R&D organization,

      and we are confident in his ability to execute and extend our technology

      roadmap going forward."

    


      "I am very proud of what we have achieved, not only in the lab, but on

      production lines and in solar power plants around the world," said

      Eaglesham. "Raffi has been an integral part of our success, and I am

      very confident in his ability to lead our R&D program and to carry on

      our tradition of innovation."

    


      Garabedian earned a BSEE degree from Rensselaer Polytechnic University

      and an MSEE degree from the University of California at Davis. Prior to

      joining First Solar, he was founder and CEO of Touchdown Technologies, a

      semiconductor test equipment company. Prior to that, Garabedian worked

      in the semiconductor and microelectromechanical systems (MEMS)

      industries for over 15 years, developing new products ranging from

      automotive sensors to telecommunications switching systems, and holds

      more than 20 issued patents in these fields.

    

First Solar utilizes a continuous manufacturing process which transforms

      a sheet of glass into a complete solar module in less than 2.5 hours,

      which contributes to the company's industry-leading energy payback time

      and the low carbon footprint of systems using First Solar PV modules.

      First Solar also implemented the industry's first comprehensive,

      prefunded solar module collection and recycling program. Anyone wishing

      to dispose of First Solar modules can request collection at any time, at

      no additional cost, and First Solar will pick up the modules and recycle

      up to 90% (by mass) of the material for use in new products, including

      new solar modules and new glass products.

      (PV) solar systems which use its advanced thin-film modules. The
