Choate Rosemary Hall


                  From its shared roots over a century ago as The Choate School and Rosemary Hall, through the merger in 1974, to the Choate Rosemary Hall of today, the name represents the best in American secondary education.

The more than 17,000 graduates can attest to the quality of Choate's academic program, but that is only one aspect of the education a student receives. Through interactions with members of the entire Choate community, students mature into young adults who not only have stretched their minds, but have grown personally, artistically, and athletically.

A Tradition of Excellence

William Gardner Choate, who established The Choate School, his wife Mary Atwater Choate and Caroline Ruutz-Rees, founders of Rosemary Hall, had a shared vision: offering students opportunities to advance themselves. Just as a strong foundation at Choate prepares students for college, so too did the convictions of the founders establish the pursuit of excellence that remains a hallmark of Choate today.

How is excellence manifested? The Class of 2011 had 8 National Merit Finalists; 10 Semifinalists and 47 Commended Scholars. Choate offers more Advanced Placement (AP) courses than any of our peer schools, with 94 percent earning 3 or better, which traditionally results in college credit; more than 78 percent of those students earned 4 or 5. Choate has an economics teams that competes nationally with outstanding results, and championship mathematics, computer science, and debate teams that compete at the local, state, and/or New England regional level. At Choate, the arts are unparalleled, and our athletics program is recognized nationwide for its high quality.

Analyst Ratings
Consensus Ratings for Forrester Research (NASDAQ:FORR) (How are Consensus Ratings Calculated?) MarketBeat calculates consensus ratings using the most recent rating from each brokerage that has rated a stock within the last twelve months. Since brokers often use different ratings systems, each rating is normalized to a standardized rating score of 1 (sell), 2 (hold), 3 (buy) or 4 (strong buy). Consensus ratings scores are calculated using the mean average of the number of normalized sell, hold, buy and strong buy ratings. Each stock's consensus rating is derived from its calculated consensus ratings score (0-1.5 = Sell, 1.5-2.5 = Hold, 2.5-3.5 = Buy, >3.5 = Strong Buy). MarketBeat's consensus price targets are a mean average of the most recent available price targets set by each analyst that has set a price target for the stock in the last twelve months.MarketBeat will no longer include ratings and price target data in its consensus calculation if a broker drops coverage and MarketBeat has received a report that coverage was dropped. Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.Ratings Breakdown: 1 Buy RatingConsensus Rating:Buy (Score: 3.00)Consensus Price Target: N/A
