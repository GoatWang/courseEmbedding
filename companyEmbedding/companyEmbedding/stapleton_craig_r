Biography[edit]
Early life[edit]
Craig Stapleton was born in Kansas City, Missouri. His grandfather, Benjamin F. Stapleton, was a politician who served five terms as mayor of Denver.[2] He received his secondary school education at Phillips Exeter Academy and a B.A. (magna cum laude) from Harvard University. He received his M.B.A. from Harvard Business School.[3] His wife, Dorothy Walker Stapleton, is a first cousin of former U.S. president George H.W. Bush.
Career[edit]
He served as President of Marsh and McLennan Real Estate Advisors of New York from 1982 until 2001. From 1989 to 1998 Stapleton co-owned the Texas Rangers baseball team with George W. Bush.[3] He has served on the board of directors for several companies including Allegheny Properties, Metro PCS, TB Woods and Winston Partners.[3] In July 2009, he became a co-owner of the St. Louis Cardinals.[4]
During the administration of George H.W. Bush, Stapleton sat on the Board of the Peace Corps. He served as ambassador to the Czech Republic from August 2001 to December 2003.[5] In 2004, he was the Connecticut State Chairman for the Bush-Cheney reelection campaign. In June 2005 he was appointed ambassador to France and served until January 29, 2009.[5] He is a member of CERGE-EI Foundation supporting economic education in transition and developing countries.
In 2007 he recommended to the Bush administration that they wage a trade war on European crops, due to European resistance to genetically modified foods such as MON 810, thus denying a key US export.[6]
"Ambassador Stapleton goes on to write, quote, "Country team Paris recommends that we calibrate a target retaliation list that causes some pain across the EU since this is a collective responsibility, but that also focuses in part on the worst culprits. The list should be measured rather than vicious and must be sustainable over the long term, since we should not expect an early victory," he wrote."
Stapleton made an appearance on the Food Network show, The Next Iron Chef in 2007. The final three chefs remaining in the competition each prepared a three-course American-themed dinner for the ambassador and 20 guests. The competition took place in the ambassador's official residence.[7]
Personal life[edit]
He and his wife live in Greenwich, Connecticut and have two adult children; his son Walker Stapleton was elected Colorado State Treasurer in 2010.

Job Details
               French Institute Alliance Française (FIAF) is a 501(c)(3) not-for-profit organization incorporated in the State of New York. FIAF's mission is to create and offer New Yorkers innovative and unique programs in education and the arts that explore the evolving diversity and richness of French cultures. FIAF seeks to generate new ideas and promote cross cultural dialogue through partnerships and new platforms of expression. Founded at the turn of 20th century, the French Institute and the Alliance Française de New York operated as two separate organizations, the first promoting French arts, the second teaching French. In 1971 they merged to form what has become one of the largest and most respected centers of French-American activities in the U.S: the French Institute Alliance Française. Located at 22 East 60th Street between Park and Madison Avenues on New York City's Upper Eastside, our beautiful Beaux Arts building is reminiscent of the architecture of Haussmann Paris. Over 6000 students learn French at our Language Center, New York's leading center for French language. The Haskell Library is the most comprehensive private French library in the United States. The 400-seat Florence Gould Hall Theater, where we present LIVE performing arts events and New York's only year-round French cinema series CinéSalon; Tinker Auditorium where we present culinary, literary, and other cultural events; the dramatic penthouse space, Le Skyroom (featuring a demonstration kitchen) where we present exclusive Art de Vivre events; and the recently opened FIAF Gallery ensure FIAF's place as a vibrant cultural force for New Yorkers of all ages and backgrounds.
