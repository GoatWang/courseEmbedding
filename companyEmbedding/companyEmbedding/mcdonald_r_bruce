Loss of McDonald's contract puts small printer in danger



John SchmeltzerTribune staff reporter




 For more than 30 years, Chicago's Robert Bruce Co. has been the sole supplier of stationery supplies and business cards for the giant McDonald's Corp. and many of its franchisees. Its business relationship was based for much of that time upon a handshake with the Oak Brook-based company's founder, Ray Kroc.  Now, in a struggle that pits David against the Goliath, the tiny South Side company, which last year received two-thirds of its $1.5 million in sales from McDonald's, is fighting for its future--and has filed suit against the hamburger chain. "I can't understand why they want to destroy or bankrupt a small company," said Robert Mendez, who said the company's name is based upon his first name and the first name of his son, Bruce Mendez.

 In a lawsuit filed in Cook County Circuit Court, the company is seeking more than $1 million in damages, including more than $500,000 to cover the cost of gift bags, cards and various pieces of corporate stationery that Robert Bruce has been ordered to destroy. "I'm not sure we would have spent $60,000 last year developing a Web site that permits them to order supplies electronically if I knew they were going to do this," Robert Mendez said, adding that employees are concerned about their future. The relationship began unraveling in August, when McDonald's asked Robert Bruce to deliver 25 samples of several dozen items. Two months after the samples were delivered, the Mendezes said, they learned McDonald's was seeking bids for a new supplier.

 Despite assurances that they would be given an opportunity to bid, their attorney, Zane Smith, says McDonald's kept secret the awarding of the contract to a St. Paul firm until early January. McDonald's also formally terminated a trademark license that permitted the Robert Bruce firm to produce documents bearing McDonald's world-famous arches and other symbols and ordered the destruction of the warehouse inventory. More puzzling, Smith said, is that McDonald's blocked Robert Bruce from continuing to do business with franchisees, all of whom, under their contracts, can go to any supplier for their printing needs. A spokesman for McDonald's denied the company had acted improperly in terminating the Robert Bruce contract. "McDonald's had a mutually beneficial business relationship with Robert Bruce, and we made a business decision to terminate our contract with them, and we terminated our contract properly," said Bill Whitman, a McDonald's spokesman. Robert Calvin, a professor of entrepreneurship and marketing at the University of Chicago Graduate School of Business, said the plight facing the Robert Bruce firm is one other small-business owners frequently face. "Many small businesses are very dependent upon one or two customers," Calvin said. "One of the things we talk about is the need for small-business owners to focus. They can't be all things to all people, so they have to target their customer and market," he said. "But the flip side of that is that one of the major disadvantages of the strategy is their lack of diversification in either products or customers." That is the situation now facing Mendez and his son, who said they were consumed with servicing their best customer. Finding new customers isn't going to be easy, they said, adding that they hope that McDonald's will relent and allow them to sell to the franchise operators. "People don't send letters anymore," said Robert Mendez, noting that many companies and individuals are now relying almost entirely upon e-mail. "This really is a dying industry."

Bruce R. MacDonald has been a metal smith for over twenty years, producing works that are, in his words, "engineered to bring the concept of beauty in its true timeless sense into our daily reality."  
 
MacDonald's work has won numerous awards over the years.  Most recently he received the 2002 Niche Design Award, although he claims his favorite was "The Most Innovative Use of Materials Award" at the Philadelphia Furniture Show curated by the chairman of the industrial design department of the Rhode Island School of Design.  He says it's "nice to be recognized" for his work combining so many different materials.  "Juxtaposition is high energy," he says.
 
He recently completed a commissioned sculpture for the head of the Human Genome Project commemorating the fiftieth anniversary of Watson and Crick's discovery of DNA (MacDonald's DVD rack also evokes DNA with its sculpted helix form).  Bruce also created the lifetime achievement award for the Manchester Film Festival in fall of 2002.  "I enjoy the dynamic of industrial design work for outside clients, my own production line and the pull of one-of-a-kind commissioned pieces," he says.  "Keeps the tools sharp." 
 
He maintains a studio in Burlington, Vermont producing a range of different designs.  Bruce and his wife Ann have a house in the woods on the shore of Lake Champlain where they are surrounded by art and the natural world, as well as their four kids.
