We now look forward to partnering with CCMP and MSD Partners to continue our investments in product innovation, geographic expansion, and synergistic acquisitions.” “We are thrilled to partner with Clark and his team to acquire Hayward, which has built an outstanding leadership position and brand loyalty in the pool equipment market.

      the United States, Canada, Europe and Australia. Driven by its superior 
      engineering and manufacturing capabilities, customer relationships and 
      successful acquisition integration, Hayward has achieved an average 
      annual growth rate above 10% since the Davis family initially purchased 
      control of the business in 1964.
    

      “We are thrilled to partner with Clark and his team to acquire Hayward, 
      which has built an outstanding leadership position and brand loyalty in 
      the pool equipment market. Since the purchase of control of Hayward by 
      the Davis family in 1964, the Company has grown from a regional pool 
      equipment supplier to a global leader with a track record of product 
      innovation and world class supply chain and manufacturing capabilities,” 
      said Mark McFadden, a Managing Director at CCMP. “We look forward to 
      working with Clark and his highly talented team to build on the 
      company’s outstanding record of growth.”
    

      “We are delighted to have the opportunity to partner with Hayward’s 
      management in this seminal event in the Company’s distinguished history, 
      and we are pleased to be trusted with the stewardship of the business in 
      the next chapter of its evolution,” said Kevin Brown, a Managing 
      Director in the Private Capital Group at MSD Partners. “Hayward is a 
      perfect fit with MSD Private Capital Group’s strategy of investing in 
      companies that can deliver stability and growth over the long term, and 
      we look forward to supporting its continued growth.”
    

      “I am extremely proud of the accomplishments realized by our team in 
      positioning Hayward as a leading provider of pool equipment throughout 
      the world. As I approach retirement, I am very confident this next 
      generation of ownership will carry on the Hayward tradition and that our 
      legacy is in excellent hands,” said Robert Davis, Co-Chairman of the 
      Board of Hayward.
    

      Clark Hale, President and CEO of Hayward added "Hayward and its 
      employees are forever grateful for the vision and leadership that Oscar 
      and Robert Davis have provided. We now look forward to partnering with 
      CCMP and MSD Partners to continue our investments in product innovation, 
      geographic expansions, and synergistic acquisitions.”
    

      The transaction is expected to close in the third quarter of 2017, 
      subject to customary closing conditions. Houlihan Lokey is serving as 
      financial advisor to CCMP, MSD Partners, and AIMCo on the transaction,

NEW YORK, Sept. 19, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- MSD Partners, L.P. and MSD Capital, L.P. today sent the following letter to the Special Committee of the Board of Directors of NorthStar Asset Management Group Inc. (NYSE:    NSAM). MSD Partners, L.P., MSD Capital, L.P. and their respective affiliates collectively own 19,280,449 shares of NorthStar's common stock, which represents approximately 10.2% of the company's outstanding common stock.

Special Committee of the Board of Directors NorthStar Asset Management Group Inc.399 Park Avenue, 18th FloorNew York, New York 10022
Gentlemen:
MSD Partners, L.P., MSD Capital, L.P. and their respective affiliates collectively own 19,280,449 shares of the common stock of NorthStar Asset Management Group Inc. ("NSAM"), which represents approximately 10.2% of NSAM's outstanding common stock.  As the largest stockholder of NSAM, we have been considering the proposed combination of NSAM, Colony Capital, Inc. ("Colony") and NorthStar Realty Finance Corp. that was announced on June 3, 2016.  As you are aware, we have been a long-term investor in NSAM.
We agree that the proposed combination has the potential to create significant value though scale, cost synergies, strategic focus and enhanced valuation.  The combination could be a positive transformational transaction for all three companies.  However, we also believe that, as currently structured, the proposed combination does not provide sufficient value to NSAM's stockholders.   In addition, the currently proposed governance structure for the combined company falls short of good governance norms in many key respects.  We believe these shortcomings will hinder the interest of all three companies' stockholders in achieving the type of full valuation for the combined company that is rightfully accorded to public companies with the highest governance standards and with the best possible management alignment with shareholders.  
We have communicated to both the Special Committee's advisors and the management of Colony that we do not intend to vote for the transaction as currently proposed.  We are available to engage in discussions at your convenience and to consider any modifications to the transaction that may be proposed and presented to NSAM stockholders.
Notwithstanding these efforts, and particularly given that other NSAM stockholders have stated publicly that they intend to vote against the proposed transaction, it remains possible that NSAM stockholders will not approve the pending combination.  We trust that you will be exercising all of your duties as directors of NSAM in good faith to ensure that NSAM is best positioned to maximize value for its stockholders in such a scenario.  As the company's largest stockholder, we expect you to provide the oversight necessary to ensure that NSAM's management is focused solely on value maximization for all stockholders, and that you will not allow any conflicts of interest, especially those that might arise from the potential triggering of severance and change of control payments, to impair what is in the best interests of NSAM and all of its stockholders.
We look forward to discussing these important matters.
Very truly yours,
MSD Partners, L.P. and MSD Capital, L.P.

Hayward Industries Inc, a U.S. maker of residential and commercial swimming pool equipment and industrial flow control products, has agreed to be acquired by a private equity consortium. No financial terms were released. The consortium is led by U.S. private equity firms CCMP Capital Advisors and MSD Partners and includes Alberta Investment Management Corp (AIMCo), a Canadian pension fund. Elizabeth, New Jersey-based Hayward, a family-owned business, said the deal will support investments in product innovation, geographic expansion and acquisitions.
PRESS RELEASE
Hayward announces acquisition by CCMP Capital Advisors, LP and MSD Partners, L.P.
ELIZABETH, N.J., June 19, 2017 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — Hayward Industries, Inc. (“Hayward” or “the Company”) today announced that a partnership led by CCMP Capital Advisors, LP and MSD Partners, L.P. and including Alberta Investment Management Corporation, has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Hayward.
Founded in 1925, Hayward is a global market leader in the residential and commercial swimming pool equipment industry with the most recognized brand and largest installed base in North America. Under the Davis family leadership for more than 50 years, Hayward has grown through organic development and strategic acquisitions to expand its product offering to include a complete line of pumps, filters, heaters, cleaners, sanitizers, IoT driven automation and controls, lighting and accessories, and has built its global footprint through acquisitions in North America, Canada, Europe and Australia. Driven by its superior engineering and manufacturing capabilities, customer relationships and successful acquisition integration, Hayward has achieved an average annual growth rate above 10% since the Davis family initially purchased control of the business in 1964. 





“I am extremely proud of the accomplishments realized by our team in positioning Hayward as a leading provider of pool equipment throughout the world. As I approach retirement, I am very confident this next generation of ownership will carry on the Hayward tradition and that our legacy is in excellent hands,” said Robert Davis, Co- Chairman of the Board of Hayward. Clark Hale, President and CEO of Hayward added, “Hayward and its employees are forever grateful for the vision and leadership that Oscar and Robert Davis have provided. We now look forward to partnering with CCMP and MSD Partners to continue our investments in product innovation, geographic expansion, and synergistic acquisitions.”
“We are thrilled to partner with Clark and his team to acquire Hayward, which has built an outstanding leadership position and brand loyalty in the pool equipment market. Through two generations of Davis family leadership, the Company has grown from a regional pool equipment supplier to a global leader with a track record of product innovation and world class supply chain and manufacturing capabilities,” said Mark McFadden, a Managing Director at CCMP. “We look forward to working with Clark and his highly talented team to build on the company’s outstanding record of growth.”
“We are delighted to have the opportunity to partner with Hayward’s management, in this seminal event in the Company’s distinguished history, and we are pleased to be trusted with the stewardship of the business in the next chapter of its evolution,” said Kevin Brown, a Managing Director in the Private Capital Group at MSD Partners. “Hayward is a perfect fit with MSD Private Capital Group’s strategy of investing in companies that can deliver stability and growth over the long term, and we look forward to supporting its continued growth.” 





Recent acquisitions by Hayward Industries include Poolvergnuegen, a suction cleaner manufacturer in the United States, as well as Kripsol, a Spanish based manufacturer of residential and commercial pumps and filters, and Sugar Valley, a Spanish based manufacturer of intelligent automation systems, water chemistry and sanitization products.
In recent years, Hayward has introduced category leading products such as the OmniLogic® pool control system, TriStar® variable speed pumps which are rated highest in energy efficiency by the U.S. EPA, V-Flex pool cleaners, and HCP 3000 Series commercial pumps. The transaction is expected to close in the third quarter of 2017, subject to customary closing conditions. Goldman Sachs is serving as financial advisor to Hayward and McCarter & English, LLP is acting as legal counsel.
