HealthCor Management, L.P.
Fundamental Healthcare Investment ManagerEstablished 2005About UsHealthCor is an experienced value based investor that is dedicated to identifying global healthcare and life science equity securities that are mispriced.HealthCor Management, L.P.'s ("HealthCor") two co-founders, Joe Healey and Art Cohen, have an extensive career of equity investing in the sector through numerous market cycles and have co-invested together for over 15 years as a team.  From its base in New York City, HealthCor launched its long-short equity hedge fund strategy on September 1, 2005.
Since then, HealthCor has leveraged its security selection expertise across a platform of healthcare focused products.  HealthCor became registered with the Securities Exchange Commission as an investment adviser on March 30, 2012 under the U.S. Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended.Investment ApproachHealthCor uses a bottom-up fundamental research driven approach to security selection.HealthCor’s investment professionals  leverage their specialized knowledge of key medical, scientific, regulatory and intellectual property data with a bottom-up fundamental research driven approach to security selection.  Idea generation is catalyst driven and every position is judged on its own ability to generate profits consistent with its risk reward profile. The firm is characterized by intensive financial analysis and places a premium on strong balance sheets, cash flow, top line organic growth and earnings revisions as well as management teams that seek to grow shareholder value. HealthCor takes into account industry themes such as utilization, consolidation, and regulatory activity when investing and concentrates in high conviction names which demonstrate margin of safety attributes.The firm invests on a balanced basis across the sector where it organizes itself around the major sub-sectors of:

Pharmaceuticals
Medtech
Biotech
Services

StrategyHealthCor’s investment strategies have different risk reward objectives consistent with their mandates. The long-short equity strategy for example, seeks to achieve superior risk-adjusted returns through investments in equity and equity-related instruments and has demonstrated a proven ability to preserve capital in down markets. The strategy employs a modest amount of leverage and a large short portfolio predominantly consisting of stock specific ideas each intended to generate profits.   All HealthCor strategies benefit from the same rigorous bottom-up fundamental research process focused on generating the best ideas for security selection while employing a disciplined and structured approach to portfolio management. In addition, HealthCor acts as a sub-adviser to several multi-manager mutual funds and a UCITS fund. Separately, HealthCor's affiliate, HealthCor Partners Management, L.P., manages a private equity strategy which is a separately registered entity.Idea generation is catalyst driven and every position is judged on its own ability to generate profits consistent with its risk reward profile.Executive Committee & Senior Management

GovernanceHealthCor has  an Advisory Committee as part of its ongoing effort to align interests and pursue best practices that benefit its stake holders.The Advisory Committee is an additional layer of oversight and corporate governance with respect to the management of the hedge fund strategy and is comprised of four industry experts who are independent of HealthCor.
The Advisory Committee’s industry experts have extensive experience in the areas of:

Hedge Fund Law
Accounting
Manager Research
Due Diligence
Corporate Governance

HealthCor, as well as HealthCor Offshore GP, LLC (the General Partner of the hedge fund strategy), works with the Advisory Committee to provide it with information necessary to enable the Advisory Committee to make informed decisions.In addition, HealthCor  recognizes the risk and benefits that responsible investing adds to returns and thus integrates Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) considerations into its investment process. The firm's co-founders have co-invested in healthcare and life sciences through numerous market cycles together for over 15 years.Giving BackHealthCor’s values go beyond strong productive teamwork in the workplace and extend to organizations where the firm feels it can have an impact.HealthCor, through an affiliated entity, HealthCor Foundation Trust, strongly believes in supporting the communities where we work and live and the community interests of our employees.  Through the HealthCor Foundation Trust Matching Gift Program, employees can double the impact of their charitable giving by leveraging the firm’s support.  To date the firm has donated to over a 100 charities.
Additionally, these values are exemplified in the work by the HealthCor Foundation Trust which helped to fund the Young Scholars’ Academy for Discovery & Exploration’s student library which opened in early 2015. The HealthCor Foundation Trust also awards donation opportunities to eligible charities as prizes to the winners of employee-wide athletic competitions (charities are selected by the competition winners).Contact UsFor inquiries, please contact Lori Price, Director of Research, by completing the form below:
