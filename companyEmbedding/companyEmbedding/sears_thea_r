In addition, choose from 10-piece 1/2-inch Craftsman Evolv deep impact socket sets for work in the garage. Whether you've suffered a flat tire while traveling or need a quality tool for auto repair work at the shop, find the tools you need to make light work of any repair job.
For woodworking or metal work, Craftsman and DeWalt drills give you the power you need to drill through almost any surface. Furthermore, corded and cordless drills are available depending on your particular need. For more freedom of movement on the jobsite, DeWalt features a heavy-duty cordless drill complete with keyless ratcheting and dual speeds. The Craftsman 3/8-inch reversible corded drill features the power you need but with a lightweight, ergonomic design for complete comfort as you work.
Whether it's a socket set or a compact drill, you need a place to store and organize your tools. With tool chest combos from Craftsman and International, you have plenty of storage space for everything in the workshop. Smaller toolboxes are ideal for transporting your tools from the garage to the jobsite, but Craftsman 42-inch tool storage towers offer high-quality alternatives to smaller boxes and chests. Select from five-drawer tool centers complete with drawer slides and wheels for easy transport throughout the workshop. Moreover, tool chest combos support up to 300 pounds or more, so you can store much heavier tools such as power saws and 100-piece mechanic sets.
From professional Craftsman tools to high-quality tool chests, you have access to everything you need for DIY or professional work. Shop Sears online or at the store for more affordable power tools and durable tool chests.

Beautify your home with the latest lawn and garden equipment from Sears 
Taking care of your garden or yard can be a tough task, but the right lawn and garden equipment can save on time and energy with great results. Whether you're looking to just cut the grass and clear weeds or clean up snow in the winter, Sears has all the supplies that you need to complete any task with confidence. You'll be able to stock your garden shed with high-quality mowers, chainsaws and much more. 
Choosing the right landscaping tools depends solely on your requirements. A lawn mower is a great way to keep your grass well kempt throughout the year. You can minimize physical labor with a standard or zero-turn tractor. This machine comfortably maneuvers around tight obstacles and can tackle large pieces of property. When your bushes or trees start to get unwieldy, a pole saw or trimmer can give shrubbery and branches a pristine look in a matter of moments. 
Aside from traditional gardening tools, you should also have enough supplies for the winter. Shovels are ideal for smaller properties, and the latest electric and gas snow blowers allow you to clear heavy snow and ice from large driveways with ease. No matter what task is at hand, different accessories can maintain and enhance your outdoor space. Enjoy a beautiful home with high quality lawn and garden equipment from Sears.

Whether moving into a brand-new apartment or renovating a space in your existing home, these pieces can transform plain spaces into something extraordinary.
Quality furniture adds comfort and style to any room of the house. Contemporary bedrooms look fantastic with a wooden platform bed covered with a plush mattress and layers of crisp bedding. Outfit the bathroom with fluffy white towels, absorbent rugs and even embellished storage units that match the bathroom vanity.
A soft couch, an oversized throw and a set of decorative pillows create a cozy retreat in front of the entertainment center. Add a few recliners to provide extra seating for friends and family during movie night. Pieces featuring clean, crisp lines offer a modern twist, while soft neutrals work beautifully in a transitional space.
Whip up memorable meals in the kitchen with cookware and kitchen appliances, then plate each dish on sophisticated serveware. Guests will enjoy great food and wonderful conversation even more at a gorgeous dining table with matching chairs in the dining room.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
