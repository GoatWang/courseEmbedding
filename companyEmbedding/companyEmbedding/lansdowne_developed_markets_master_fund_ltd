Lansdowne's European Equity Fund was down 11.9 percent and its Developed Markets Strategic Investment Fund was down 8.2 percent.  Landsdowne's long-only funds were also down, with the European Long Only Fund losing 4.6 percent and the Developed Markets Long Only Funds down 5.6 percent. A spokesman for the firm declined to comment. Last year, all Landsdowne's funds were in positive territory, with the flagship Developed Markets Fund up 16.9 percent, the European Equity Fund up 28.2 percent, the Energy Dynamics Fund returning 14.8 percent and the Global Financials Fund 1.8 percent, according to performance statistics seen by Reuters.

Lansdowne Developed (IRSH)



Lansdowne Developed

Appointment of Prime Broker and Custodian

RNS Number : 1346Y Lansdowne Developed Markets Fund Ld 18 February 2013  





 
 




FUND ANNOUNCEMENT












For Immediate Release


                                          18 February, 2013












Lansdowne Developed Markets Fund Limited 
(the "Fund")
 
Lansdowne Developed Markets Master Fund Limited 
(the "Master Fund")














Re:  Appointment of Merrill Lynch International to act as a prime broker and custodian to the Master Fund




 
 
The Board of Directors of the Fund wishes to announce that with effect from 18 February, 2013 Merrill Lynch International will provide services as a prime broker and custodian to the Master Fund pursuant to a prime brokerage agreement dated 11 February, 2013 (the "MLI Prime Brokerage Agreement").
 
The Master Fund has appointed Merrill Lynch International ("MLI") as Prime Broker and Custodian pursuant to an International Prime Brokerage Agreement supplemented by MLI's standard Terms and Conditions of Business (the "Prime Brokerage Agreement"). Under the terms of the Prime Brokerage Agreement the services provided by MLI will include the clearing and settlement of transactions, financing and securities lending and in connection therewith MLI will act as custodian of the Master Fund's assets.
MLI will, in accordance with the rules of the Financial Services Authority ("FSA Rules "), identify, record and hold the Master Fund's investments separately from any of MLI's own investments and other assets, such that the identity and location of the investments can be identified at any time.  However, owing to the nature of the law or market practice in certain jurisdictions outside the United Kingdom, MLI may believe that, in certain situations, either it is in the Master Fund's best interests for the relevant investments  to be registered or recorded in the name of MLI or in the name of a third party or, for reasons of applicable law and market practice, it is not feasible to do otherwise.  In such circumstances, the Master Fund's investments will or may be so registered or recorded. As a consequence, such investments may not be segregated from MLI's own investments and, in the event of MLI's default, may not be as well protected from claims made on behalf of the general creditors of MLI.
Any cash which MLI holds or receives on the Master Fund's behalf under the Prime Brokerage Agreement will not be treated as client money and will not be subject to the client money protections conferred by the FSA Rules. As a consequence, the Master Fund's cash will not be segregated from MLI's own cash and will be used by MLI in the course of its business, and the Master Fund will therefore rank as one of MLI's general creditors in relation thereto.
MLI may hold the Master Fund's investments with any person appointed by MLI as sub-custodian, including affiliates of MLI.  MLI (and such sub-custodian it appoints) may deposit the Master Fund's investments with any securities depositories on such terms as such systems customarily operate and as permitted by applicable law.
MLI shall use all due skill, care and diligence in the selection and appointment of any sub-custodian and be responsible to the Master Fund, for the duration of the sub-custody arrangement, for satisfying itself as to the ongoing suitability of any such sub-custodian to provide custodial services to the Master Fund.  MLI will make appropriate periodic enquiries to confirm that the obligations of such sub-custodian continue to be competently discharged. MLI will be responsible for the acts and omissions of any sub-custodian which is an affiliate of, or a nominee controlled by, MLI to the same extent as MLI is liable for its own acts and omissions under the Prime Brokerage Agreement.
MLI shall not be liable for losses arising out of the acts or omissions or insolvency of any sub-custodian that is not an affiliate of MLI, save where MLI has breached its obligations under the Prime Brokerage Agreement regarding the selection, appointment and ensuring the ongoing suitability of the sub-custodian or where MLI has been negligent in the selection of any such sub-custodian.
As security for the payment and discharge of all liabilities of the Master Fund to MLI and its affiliates, all investments and cash held by or to the order of MLI and its affiliates, owed by MLI and its affiliates to the Master Fund or credited to any account in the books of MLI and any affiliate for the benefit of the Master Fund, and all the Master Fund's right, title and interest in and under certain other agreements with MLI and its affiliates, will be charged by the Master Fund in favour of MLI and will therefore constitute collateral for the purposes of the FSA Rules. Investments and cash may also be deposited by the Master Fund with MLI as margin and will also constitute collateral for the purposes of the FSA Rules.
The Master Fund's investments held by MLI may be used by MLI for its own purposes or the purposes of any third party, provided that any such use shall not exceed 125 per cent of the Master Fund's "Indebtedness" (as defined in the Prime Brokerage Agreement), whereupon such investments will become the property of MLI and the Master Fund will have a right against MLI for the return of equivalent assets. In the event of an insolvency of MLI, the Master Fund will rank as an unsecured creditor in relation thereto and, in such case, the Master Fund may not be able to recover such equivalent assets in full.
Neither MLI  nor any affiliate will be liable for any loss to the Master Fund resulting from any act or omission of MLI or an affiliate under the Prime Brokerage Agreement or in connection with provision of any services pursuant to the Prime Brokerage Agreement, or a breach of the Prime Brokerage Agreement by MLI or an affiliate, or any discrepancy or error in any transaction report or statement of account, unless such loss results from the negligence, wilful default or fraud of MLI or any of its affiliates. Neither MLI nor any affiliate will be liable for any loss to the Master Fund resulting from the acts or omissions or insolvency of any sub-custodian which is not an affiliate of MLI, save where MLI has breached its obligations under the Prime Brokerage Agreement regarding the selection, appointment and ensuring the ongoing suitability of the sub-custodian or MLI has been negligent in the selection of any such sub-custodian.
Except to the extent resulting from the negligence, bad faith, wilful default or fraud of, or breach of its obligations regarding the selection, appointment and ensuring the ongoing suitability of any sub-custodian, MLI and its affiliates, and their respective officers, directors, employees and agents (each an "Indemnified Party"), the Master Fund will indemnify each Indemnified Party against all losses suffered or incurred by, or asserted against, an Indemnified Party in connection with, resulting or arising from or relating to the Prime Brokerage Agreement, the settlement of any transaction and in connection with the performance of services provided pursuant to the Prime Brokerage Agreement.
MLI is a wholly owned indirect subsidiary of Bank of America Corporation, a publicly traded company which, together with its affiliates, provide a range of banking, investing, asset management and other financial and risk-management products and services. Bank of America Corporation stock is a component of the Dow Jones Industrial Average and is listed on the New York Stock Exchange. MLI is regulated in the United Kingdom by the Financial Services Authority.  As at the date of this announcement MLI has financial resources in excess of US$200 million and has a short term credit rating of 'P-1' or 'A-1' or 'F-1' for short term debt from Moody's, Standard & Poor's or Fitch.
The MLI Prime Brokerage Agreement may be terminated by (a) MLI serving written notice of termination on the Master Fund of not less than 20 business days prior to such termination becoming effective, or (b) the Master Fund by serving written notice of termination on MLI of not less than 5 business days prior to such termination becoming effective.
 
MLI will be paid for its services by the Master Fund at normal commercial rates.
 
Lansdowne Partners Limited Partnership, the investment manager, will, in its sole discretion, allocate assets between the Master Fund's prime brokers according to prevailing trading and economic conditions.
