                  Summary Written By: Laura S. 
                  Jack Davenport, (William R. Moses) is a Journalist from Chicago 
                    who's had a major falling out with his wife, Meg, (Megan Follows), 
                    following a big company Christmas party. He has decided to 
                    take on a project for the next few weeks covering a story 
                    in Dallas, Texas which is tailored towards Christmas Holiday. 
                    He had received a photo in the mail and the photo had something 
                    to do with his past. He decides to go to Clearwater, Texas 
                    to look up his birth records and try to find out who his natural 
                    parents are or were. 
























While he's there he meets a Pastor of the Clearwater Community 
                    Church (Played by Contemporary Christian singer, Steven Curtis 
                    Chapman), who becomes a good friend and tries to help Jack 
                    out. Along the path to discovering the truth behind his past, 
                    he stumbles into some misfortunes, but he keeps his faith 
                    strong with the help of his Pastor friend. This movie is a 
                    very heart warming, delightfully wonderful movie with so much 
                    potential. This movie is based on the Max Lucado book THE 
                    CHRISMAS CROSS. Shooting location was in Tulsa, Oklahoma. 
                    Bill Moses playing the main character in this film did a dynamic 
                    job! KUDOS TO YOU BILL! KEEP UP THE EXCELLENT WORK!

            This author had the view that the plagues were more figurative than literal. That God may have just capitalized on a natural occurance. He also leaned toward saying that the Bible was subjective to the author's point of view and details may be inaccurate. I believe that the Bible is God's inspired Word and the details are correct as God inspired the writer.

Looking for any one who has Y-DNA test results for descendents of William Christian, Isle of Man, born 1579-1655, (1608-1663) birth date questionable.  I would like to compare DNA results.  My 46 marker Y-DNA matches up to William Christian.  But would like to compare with others who have taken the test.

Hello,  We have an on-line research group focusing on the Tazewell County, VA area and surrounding counties. We have 40 members; many of them descended from Thomas Bailey Christian (although I am not.)   Recently someone posted regarding the DNA results suggesting that TBC could have been related to William Christian. Could you please tell me where I can go to follow the DNA results.

That is my problem as well trying to connect the Tazewell and the Charles City Christians to each other.May I ask what your line is.  Also are we refering to the same William Dhone Christian, born April 15, 1608, Iswle of Man and died 1709 in Charles City, Virginia.I have a number of Y-DNA-Chromosome-46-Marker matches showing a descendancy from Charles Hunt Christian, Goochland, Charles City VA, son of Thomas Christian, 1636-1694,  Son of William Christian, 1608-1663, Isle of Man.  All of my Y-DNA matches come back to the Eastern Virginia Christian families.  Yet my DNA match for Paternal lineage comes back to the Tazewell Virginia Christian familie.  I took the Ancestry.com BETA DNA ethnicity test and have many matches for the Christian family.  Ironically the Y-DNA test which is only 46 markers is one that deals strictly with the PATERNAL or male line.  The BETA DNA test deals with over 700,000 markers including both male and female lines DNA.  The BETA results almost always end up being handed down through the female lines.  All of my BETA 4th cousin matches seem to belong to Tazewell, Kentucky or Tennessee.  5th Cousin or greater include Eastern Virginia, NC, SC, Georgia, Alabama, Missouri, etc.After reviewing so many Y-DNA and BETA DNA matches I am convinced that Addison "Attie" Bailey Christian was my great, great, grandfather and that he was not Native American on his male or paternal line.  I believe that Addison Christian the son of Mastin Harman Christian and (Margaret Marie Peggy Robinett /Jane McKinster)the son of Thomas Bailey Christian and Louisa Katherine Harman were actually related to the Charles City Virginia Christians.  I believe at this time (there is no definitive evidence to prove otherwise) that Thomas Bailey Christian was not the son of Elinipsico Cornstalk or of Chief Cornstalk, but was a captive while child being held by the Cornstalk family.Another interesting fact is that I am starting to recieve BETA DNA matches showing Louisa Harman and Margaret Robinett.  I have a number of Skaggs showing up as distant relatives as well.  My BETA Ethnicity test results clearly show that there is no Native American DNA in my blood line.I may be the proof of the connection between the Tazewell Christians and the Charles City, Goochland Christians.  My goal now is to find ddirect descendents of Thomas Bailey Christian that has or are willing to take the Y-DNA 46 marker test to verify or disprove my assumptions.  If I am correct virtually all of the Christian families in Virginia and (including Tazewell) West Virginia descend from the same Christian line.It is so easy to make mistakes in such research, I am challenging anyone out there that can do so, to prove me wrong and send me back to the drawing board.  The more peoople who take the DNA tests the more accurate the rresults can be.

I also reportedly descend from CHRISTIANs from the Isle of Man whose descendants were in the Stanton area of Augusta Co, VA before 1750. Would this limb be included in any of the groups you refer to?Hal McCawley halmac@cox.net Oceanside, CA

Hal,   Your Christian line may connect with the line we are researching who were further west in Tazewell Co, VA. I am a genealogist and formed an on-line research group to focus on the ancestors in and around Tazewell. We have been researching for a year Thomas Bailey Christian and his siblings.

Appreciate the message.  Yes, my Y-DNA shows that I am of the Christian family on my paternal side, the Simpson family on my great, great, grandmothers's side.  I also have a cousin that is a direct descendant of Thomas Bailey Christian.  My great, aunt Piety Simpson married Daniel Christian in 1900.  Daniel was a great grandson of Thomas Bailey Kumskaka Christian.  This cousin also took the Y-DNA test and the BETA DNA test.  John Walden Simpson JR. the son of Elizabeth Christian married Jane Lucinda Mullins, Piety Simpson was their daughter.Daniel Christian is listed on the Christian Family Tree.

I have a Darryl Brian Christian that is a 3 generation Y-DNA match that I have been trying to locate.  He is listed as living in Los Angelas.

I have been unable to locate him as well.I know I have Christian's from Amherst, Buckingham, Goochland, Charles City, Tazewell, Indian Creek, Maiden Spring, Sinking Waters. Buchanan. (Marshall ellis "Dick" Christian, Sacramento Calif.) Montgomery Virginia, Bedford, Lynchburg, Cumberland Virginia.I don't see any Agusta at this time.

Hi, I too am researching my family line.  I am a Christian and I am trying to find the connections to the Isle of Man, and also to Denmark.  I am in Australia.  Has anyone got any information or advice on where I should begin searching.I am also very interested in the Christian line as there is a medical condition that has been passed down through this line, but not necessarily recorded because it was an unknown factor until recent years. I am particularly interested if anyone would be interested in letting me know, privately of course, if they feel this point is of interest to them.Thanks and I hope to hear from someone soon.  :)

First, I have no documents for this, but hopeful information might lead to someone else who may have a document regarding the following or might be able to take a look. Like everyone else would love for the Thomas Christian mystery to be cleared up. I also descend from Thomas B Christian through son Moses Christian.Would anyone see a possibility that Henry Harman married Martha Bailey would interconnect somehow to Thomas Christian. Daniel Harman and Martha Bailey lived in Rowan Co, Abbott's Creek North Carolina.I have seen posts that Henry Harmans father Daniel was killed by Indians, What possibility would it be that Christians, Harmans and Bailey's could have lived around same area and been killed at same time that Daniel Harman was killed? Most families lived close and traveled together.I also know that Thomas married Louisa Harman. Another note is that it appears Daniel Harman had a brother Samuel that married Mary Robinett,You also mention the surname Skaggs, Louisa Harmans' mother was Lydia Skaggs daughter of James Skaggs and Rachel

Caleb (Randy Wayne, To Save A Life) is a young skater who's ill mother (Roseanna Arquette, Pulp Fiction) and absent father (John Schneider, October Baby), leaves him reaching for the only hope he has - becoming a sponsored skater. After discovering a stack of old letters, he set out to find the father he never knew and inadvertently begins a journey he never could have expected. Caleb's story explores what happens when we let go of our anger and pain and forgive those who have hurt us the most, just as God forgives us. Rated PG-13. Dove approved (12+). Approx. 108 minutes.

 From the studio that brought you War Room and Miracles from Heaven comes a captivating new film!  All Saints is based on the inspiring true story of salesman-turned-pastor Michael Spurlock (John Corbett, My Big Fat Greek Weeding), the tiny church he was ordered to shut down, and a group of refugees from Southeast Asia. Together, they risked everything to plant seeds for a future that might just save them all. Look for it in theaters nationwide August 25!
