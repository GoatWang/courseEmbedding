              Molly Beerman Named Vice President and Controller of Alcoa Corporation            







    Tuesday, December 6, 2016 4:10 pm EST  









NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Alcoa Corporation (NYSE:AA) today announced that Molly Beerman has been 
      named Vice President and Controller of the Company, and she will serve 
      as principal accounting officer, effective Dec. 9.
    

      “Molly is a seasoned financial professional with a successful track 
      record at Alcoa of driving process and operational improvements," said 
      Alcoa Chief Financial Officer William Oplinger. "In addition to her 
      accounting acumen, Molly’s experience makes her ideally qualified to 
      take on this leadership role at Alcoa as we review our systems to run 
      our new Company more cost-effectively and efficiently.”
    

      Ms. Beerman succeeds Robert Collins who has been Controller since 2013 
      and will be taking a role outside of the Company.
    

      “Bob made a significant contribution to our Company during his 11-year 
      Alcoa career,” Oplinger said. “Most recently, he played an instrumental 
      role in the separation of Alcoa Inc. into two independent, 
      publicly-traded companies. We thank him for his years of dedication and 
      hard work and wish him well in his next endeavor.”
    

      Since November 2016, Ms. Beerman served as Director of Global Shared 
      Services Strategy and Solutions and led the overall planning and 
      implementation of financial and procurement activities in alignment with 
      the Company’s overall business strategy. Prior to that, she served in a 
      consulting role to the Alcoa Inc. finance department relating to the 
      separation transaction.
    

      From 2001 to 2012, she held numerous leadership positions with Alcoa 
      Inc., including as Director of Alcoa’s Global Procurement Center of 
      Excellence. In this role, Ms. Beerman designed operational efficiency in 
      requisition-to-payment and supplier management. She was also Manager of 
      North America Financial Accounting Services, where she led the team that 
      provided accounting services to numerous locations. Ms. Beerman first 
      joined Alcoa Inc. in 2001 as Manager, Corporate Financial Systems, 
      responsible for the global consolidation of financial statements.
    

      From 2012 to 2015, Ms. Beerman was Vice President of Finance and 
      Administration for The Pittsburgh Foundation, a non-profit organization. 
      Earlier in her career, she served in financial management positions at 
      Carnegie Mellon University, PNC Bank and the Pittsburgh office of 
      Deloitte.
    

      Ms. Beerman has a bachelor’s degree in Business Administration, 
      Accounting from Duquesne University in Pittsburgh, and she is a 
      Certified Public Accountant in Pennsylvania.

-1.80%


 today announced that Molly Beerman has been 
      named Vice President and Controller of the Company, and she will serve 
      as principal accounting officer, effective Dec. 9.


                                        








This Smart News Release features multimedia. View the full release here: 
        http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20161206006271/en/
















“Molly is a seasoned financial professional with a successful track 
      record at Alcoa of driving process and operational improvements," said 
      Alcoa Chief Financial Officer William Oplinger. "In addition to her 
      accounting acumen, Molly’s experience makes her ideally qualified to 
      take on this leadership role at Alcoa as we review our systems to run 
      our new Company more cost-effectively and efficiently.”


                                        








Ms. Beerman succeeds Robert Collins who has been Controller since 2013 
      and will be taking a role outside of the Company.


                                        








“Bob made a significant contribution to our Company during his 11-year 
      Alcoa career,” Oplinger said. “Most recently, he played an instrumental 
      role in the separation of Alcoa Inc. into two independent, 
      publicly-traded companies. We thank him for his years of dedication and 
      hard work and wish him well in his next endeavor.”


                                        








Since November 2016, Ms. Beerman served as Director of Global Shared 
      Services Strategy and Solutions and led the overall planning and 
      implementation of financial and procurement activities in alignment with 
      the Company’s overall business strategy. Prior to that, she served in a 
      consulting role to the Alcoa Inc. finance department relating to the 
      separation transaction.


                                        








From 2001 to 2012, she held numerous leadership positions with Alcoa 
      Inc., including as Director of Alcoa’s Global Procurement Center of 
      Excellence. In this role, Ms. Beerman designed operational efficiency in 
      requisition-to-payment and supplier management. She was also Manager of 
      North America Financial Accounting Services, where she led the team that 
      provided accounting services to numerous locations. Ms. Beerman first 
      joined Alcoa Inc. in 2001 as Manager, Corporate Financial Systems, 
      responsible for the global consolidation of financial statements.


                                        








From 2012 to 2015, Ms. Beerman was Vice President of Finance and 
      Administration for The Pittsburgh Foundation, a non-profit organization. 
      Earlier in her career, she served in financial management positions at 
      Carnegie Mellon University, PNC Bank and the Pittsburgh office of 
      Deloitte.


                                        








Ms. Beerman has a bachelor’s degree in Business Administration, 
      Accounting from Duquesne University in Pittsburgh, and she is a 
      Certified Public Accountant in Pennsylvania.

NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--

      “Molly is a seasoned financial professional with a successful track 
      record at Alcoa of driving process and operational improvements," said 
      Alcoa Chief Financial Officer William Oplinger. "In addition to her 
      accounting acumen, Molly’s experience makes her ideally qualified to 
      take on this leadership role at Alcoa as we review our systems to run 
      our new Company more cost-effectively and efficiently.”


      Ms. Beerman succeeds Robert Collins who has been Controller since 2013 
      and will be taking a role outside of the Company.


      “Bob made a significant contribution to our Company during his 11-year 
      Alcoa career,” Oplinger said. “Most recently, he played an instrumental 
      role in the separation of Alcoa Inc. into two independent, 
      publicly-traded companies. We thank him for his years of dedication and 
      hard work and wish him well in his next endeavor.”


      Since November 2016, Ms. Beerman served as Director of Global Shared 
      Services Strategy and Solutions and led the overall planning and 
      implementation of financial and procurement activities in alignment with 
      the Company’s overall business strategy. Prior to that, she served in a 
      consulting role to the Alcoa Inc. finance department relating to the 
      separation transaction.


      From 2001 to 2012, she held numerous leadership positions with Alcoa 
      Inc., including as Director of Alcoa’s Global Procurement Center of 
      Excellence. In this role, Ms. Beerman designed operational efficiency in 
      requisition-to-payment and supplier management. She was also Manager of 
      North America Financial Accounting Services, where she led the team that 
      provided accounting services to numerous locations. Ms. Beerman first 
      joined Alcoa Inc. in 2001 as Manager, Corporate Financial Systems, 
      responsible for the global consolidation of financial statements.


      From 2012 to 2015, Ms. Beerman was Vice President of Finance and 
      Administration for The Pittsburgh Foundation, a non-profit organization. 
      Earlier in her career, she served in financial management positions at 
      Carnegie Mellon University, PNC Bank and the Pittsburgh office of 
      Deloitte.


      Ms. Beerman has a bachelor’s degree in Business Administration, 
      Accounting from Duquesne University in Pittsburgh, and she is a 
      Certified Public Accountant in Pennsylvania.


About Alcoa Corporation

      it had completed the separation from its parent company Alcoa Inc. (now

      publicly-traded company.


      Alcoa (NYSE: AA) is a global industry leader in bauxite, alumina and 
      aluminum products, with a strong portfolio of value-added cast and 
      rolled products and substantial energy assets. Alcoa is built on a

      130 years to the world-changing discovery that made aluminum an

      industry, and throughout our history, our talented Alcoans have followed
