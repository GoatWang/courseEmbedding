Philosophy
Process
Sub-Strategies





 
















               Southpaw Asset Management, LP, either directly or on behalf of one or more of its affiliated private investment funds (collectively "Southpaw") buy trade claims of numerous types from creditors in bankruptcy cases for immediate cash payments. The types of claims we may buy include: 
               
General unsecured claimsPriority claimsAdministrative claims (i.e. §503(b)(9) claims)Contract and Lease rejection claimsPromissory notes"Seller notes"Bank debtSecured claimsMechanics lien claimsLitigation judgments

Southpaw provides liquidity for trade claim creditors by paying cash up front. When buying trade claims, Southpaw acts only as a principal, on behalf of its affiliated accounts. Southpaw does not act as an agent or broker for third parties. This means that we use the capital of our firm or our affiliated private investment funds to buy the claims. When you deal with us, you know you are speaking directly to the buyer with the money and decision-making authority, not a broker who is looking to make a commission by finding someone else to buy the claim. With over $1 billion of assets under management, we are able to purchase both large and small claims. Moreover, our reputation within the industry for integrity and honesty is a priority for us in all of our business dealings. Put simply, we do exactly what we say we are going to do. We pride ourselves on our ability to provide a simple, fair process that allows trade creditors to be paid quickly, usually by wire transfer of immediately available funds within two business days after signing an agreement to transfer your claim.If you would like to get further information about selling your claim in a bankruptcy case, please contact Jeff Cohen at (203) 862-6208 or by email at .

OVERVIEW
Southpaw Asset Management LP ("Southpaw") is an investment manager focused on opportunistic corporate credit investments primarily in stressed and distressed securities. Southpaw places an emphasis on capital preservation through a disciplined, fundamental, bottoms-up based selection process and intensive risk management.Southpaw was founded in 2005 by Howard Golden and Kevin Wyman (the "Founders"). The Founders have lengthy industry experience at firms including Chase Securities, Inc., Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette, Inc., CIBC Oppenheimer Corp. and MJ Whitman Senior Debt Corp.Immediately prior to forming Southpaw in 2005, Mr. Golden and Mr. Wyman served as Managing Directors of Ramius Capital Group, LLC. During their five-year tenure at Ramius, they co-founded and headed the RCG Carpathia Master Fund, Ltd. and related assets (the "Carpathia Funds"). The Carpathia Funds employed a Credit Opportunities/Distressed strategy with total assets under management in excess of $650 million.The Founders are supported by a seasoned analyst team and experienced operations and support professionals.
 
EDGE
Southpaw provides meaningfully differentiated exposure both in traditional corporate stressed and distressed opportunities and through our historically uncorrelated portfolio of liquidations and litigations. Our size allows us to be discriminating credit pickers of both large and small capitalization investment opportunities. Our disciplined approach to asset growth enables us to maximize position and portfolio liquidity by effectively managing position size. Capital preservation is a prime objective for the firm and the portfolio does not utilize leverage. A key risk management tool is Southpaw’s co-management approach, which requires a joint decision by the Founders on every buy and sell. The Portfolio Managers and many of the investment professionals have substantial creditor committee experience along with long standing sell-side relationships, which provides Southpaw with better execution and a "first look" on many investment opportunities.
 
THE STORY OF OUR NAME
Our Founders, Howard Golden and Kevin Wyman, are both left-handed, or "Southpaws".A left-handed individual is often referred to as a Southpaw, particularly in a sports context. It is widely accepted that the term originated through the game of baseball. Ballparks were often designed so that batters faced east, which prevented the afternoon or evening sun from shining in their eyes. This meant that left-handed pitchers were throwing with an arm facing to the south – hence, the term, "Southpaw". In boxing, someone who boxes left-handed is frequently referred to as a Southpaw as well.

	Southpaw Asset Management LP - Investment Strategy
























Overview

Investment Team



Philosophy
Process
Sub-Strategies





 
















PHILOSOPHY
We seek to construct a diversified portfolio of securities with a focus on senior "top of the capital structure" positions primarily in bank debt, bonds and "busted" convertibles as well as uncorrelated liquidations and litigations. We seek to identify both long and short alpha generating, individual ideas rather using an "asset class" based approach. Our disciplined asset growth strategy is designed to enable us to have the freedom to participate in both larger and smaller issues and in turn avoid becoming "prisoners of our size". We excel at exploiting inefficiencies in securities that are under-followed, under-researched and uncorrelated to other portfolios.
 
PROCESS
The investment professionals conduct rigorous analysis of individual long and short positions with a focus on underlying credit characteristics, business fundamentals and specific catalysts. We strictly adhere to a disciplined pricing approach that maintains a "buyer's market" mentality. We capitalize on deep relationships with broker-dealers to maximize liquidity and execution. In addition, we utilize our expansive network to provide access to limited distribution and "below the radar" investments.
 
SUB-STRATEGIES

Event DrivenThese investments are selected based upon an anticipated catalyst (industry-wide and/or company-specific). The underlying business plays little or no role in the objective and risks associated with the investment. Catalysts include liquidations, litigation, in and out-of-court restructurings, regulatory events, legislative action and asset sales. 
Special SituationsThese investments are made in undervalued businesses based upon fundamental credit analysis with specific attention to free cash flow and hard assets. Southpaw retains the flexibility to pursue both large and small capitalization opportunities.
Credit ShortThese investments capitalize on overvalued securities when price no longer correlates to the company's creditworthiness and is driven more by capital inflows within certain asset classes and general competition for assets among investors. Short positions may also be used strategically to hedge certain long positions or as an overall hedge to the portfolio.
Capital Structure ArbitrageThese investments capitalize on situations where the pricing of different types of securities within the capital structure of the same company become dislocated due to (i) an overreaction to specific credit or industry news or (ii) macro factors such as capital flows or world events.
