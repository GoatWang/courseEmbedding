Josh Resnick’s Jericho Builds Strong Trading Record


					January 21, 2014

Josh Resnick


Jericho Capital Asset Management





					Resnick, who specializes in technology, media and telecom stocks, has been outperforming many of the industry’s best long-short managers, including the Tiger Cubs.
				



Joshua Resnick is building one of the hedge fund
    industry’s best long-short track records.
The head of New York–based Jericho Capital Asset
    Management, which now manages close to $2 billion, posted
    a net gain of 33.85 percent in 2013 after gaining 24.4 percent
    the prior year. That’s compared with a 27.5
    percent gain for the MSCI World Index and a 32.4 percent gain
    for the S&P 500 index. What’s more, Resnick
    has generated a 154.7 percent return since he launched his
    hedge fund in July 2009.
Of course, it helps that he has not had to maneuver through
    a bear market, having launched his fund three or so months
    after the start of the current bull market. Even so, Resnick
    has been able to outperform many of the better-known long-short
    managers, including most of the Tiger Cub community —
    managers whose roots go back to Julian Robertson
    Jr.’s legendary firm, Tiger Management Corp.
    — even though he has a fairly significant short book
    as well.
Resnick’s third-quarter letter, obtained by
    Alpha, provides a glimpse into his deft stock-picking
    ability. In that three-month period, the fund made nearly half
    of its profits for the year, rising 14.7 percent net of fees.
    Resnick’s long portfolio generated 25.3 percent
    gross gains, offset by a 7.4 percent loss on the short
    side.
In the fourth quarter, Jericho’s longs
    generated a gross 55.8 percent gain on an average gross long
    exposure of 102.1 percent. However, the firm said shorts cut
    into profits by 13.6 percent, calling 2013 "the most difficult
    environment for short-selling since Jericho’s
    inception."
Resnick specializes in technology, media and
    telecommunications stocks, but he told clients in his
    fourth-quarter letter that he made money in every major sector
    and in every geographical region, including Latin America and
    emerging markets in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, where
    he notes the equity markets "were lackluster."
"The fund’s fourth quarter performance was
    well-balanced as we generated gains in every major region and
    in each industry," the letter states. The fund’s
    most profitable area in the fourth quarter was western European
    media. "No single position was a disproportionate driver of our
    gains in the quarter," it adds.
Resnick’s most profitable position in the third
    quarter was a long position in Alcatel-Lucent, which he began
    buying in November 2012 after what he described as "a
    disastrous" earnings miss in the third quarter of 2012 sent the
    stock to an all-time low.
On the other hand, Resnick acknowledged that making money on
    the short side was "challenging," explaining what most
    long-short managers have been complaining about — easy
    money has tended to lift all boats, driving "the most benighted
    secular losers" to double and triple from their lows. But
    Resnick stressed that he was sticking with his short strategy,
    focusing on identifying companies "facing idiosyncratic
    challenges which should be sustained regardless of the
    macroeconomic environment or the financing market," he
    explains.
Resnick graduated from Emory University in 1995 with a BA in
    economics. After spending two years as a financial analyst at
    Bear Stearns in its media and entertainment group, he worked in
    20th Century Fox Television’s business development
    group, reviewing mergers, acquisitions, joint ventures and
    investments, according to an article that appeared in
    Variety in 1999. He was involved in several
    high-profile deals, including News Corp.’s 50
    percent asset purchase of Fox Entertainment Group/Liberty
    Media, the sale of American Sky Broadcasting to EchoStar
    Communications, and the partnership between the National
    Geographic Channel and NBC, according to the trade
    newspaper.
Resnick went on to become a managing director of KPE
    Ventures, a now-defunct venture capital fund that specialized
    in media, entertainment and technology. He then moved over to
    TCS Capital Management, a hedge fund, where he spent seven and
    a half years, eventually rising to managing director. He left
    in December 2008.
It is not clear where Jericho made most of its money in
    2013. However, according to regulatory filings, Resnick
    liquidated sizable stakes in Google and TripAdvisor in the
    third quarter. So no matter when he sold during that
    three-month period, he stood to book huge gains on the
    positions. He also did well with two other large holdings
    through at least September — McGraw-Hill Cos., owner
    of Standard & Poor’s, and casino operator
    Melco Crown Entertainment.
Jericho’s third-quarter letter also provides a
    hint of where the hedge fund made money on the short side in
    the fourth quarter. One particularly intriguing position
    Resnick outlines is his bet against what he calls patent
    assertion entities, more commonly known as patent trolls. He
    explains that these companies develop or acquire patents and
    then try to monetize them through settlements and licensing
    agreements, often by threatening costly litigation. "Because
    PAEs do not make products or offer services, they are exposed
    to neither counter-infringement suits nor reputational risk,"
    he explains. "Hence, they are well-positioned to engage in such
    antagonistic tactics."
A record 5,189 patent suits were filed in 2012, according to
    Resnick, who cites a study from PricewaterhouseCoopers. The
    number of suits tripled between 2010 and 2012. At the same
    time, the technological revolution has spawned an explosion in
    the number of broadly defined patents, Resnick adds.
So where is the short opportunity? Resnick makes the case
    that regulators and markets will take action "to make the PAE
    business model untenable." He asserts that all signs suggest we
    are "rapidly approaching such a negative inflection point in
    the PAE life cycle."
Resnick noted that in 2013 alone, Congress introduced six
    bills aimed at curbing PAE activity, backed by corporate giants
    such as Amazon.com, eBay, Facebook, Google,
    Macy’s, Microsoft Corp. and Wal-Mart Stores.
    Meanwhile, these days, sellers of patents are starting to
    demand immediate outlays, Resnick points out, adding that
    prices are rising rapidly. "As the market matures, we believe
    the arbitrage opportunities for PAEs are growing increasingly
    scarce," he adds.
Yet, he says the investment community does not understand
    the industry. Coverage is limited, and the few sell-side
    analysts that do follow PAEs specialize in the industries
    targeted by the PAEs. And they are generally bullish on the
    PAEs’ prospects, "deriving their valuation
    estimates from historical trends and from simplistic per-patent
    valuation analyses," Resnick asserts. "Few on the sell-side
    have considered whether the PAE business model is sustainable,"
    he adds.
Resnick then makes the case that six PAE companies that
    accounted for a combined $4.2 billion in equity value at
    the time have little, if any, underlying value in their
    businesses. The companies are Acacia Research Corp.,
    InterDigital, Rambus, RPX Corp., Tessera, and Vringo. Sure
    enough, in the fourth quarter alone, two of the stocks tanked
    — Acacia fell 37 percent and InterDigital fell 21.6
    percent — while the other four were either flat or
    slightly up or down.
