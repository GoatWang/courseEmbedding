Jeffrey Goldstein Reviews






JSucci
June 15, 2011


Deplorable Actions
								
				
For those people who have dealt with private investigator Jeffrey Goldstein, please respond immediately to this website in retaliation of his deplorable and abrupt attitude towards business owners.

 Attention all business owners and/or contractors: this person does not pay for services rendered and threatens bodily harm to workers. Mr. Goldstein is unprofessional, slanderous and irrational. As far as we know this man has potential to create harm to others both mentally and physically, including his own family. My workers have personally witnessed his destructive behavior.

Please do not hesitate to call me to discuss my previous work history with Mr. Goldstein.
