Laureen Ong, the former president of Travel Channel, has joined the board of directors of WWE.
The appointment of the longtime cable vet comes as WWE is looking to grow subscriptions to its digital network, launched in February, that features access to its library of shows, original programming and all of its pay-per-view events, including “WrestleMania.”
WWE is turning to Ong for its experience in sales, marketing, programming, management and knowledge of foreign markets.

Ong became president and CEO of the Travel Channel in 2010, following its sale to Scripps Networks from Discovery Communications. She spent three years at the company.







Before that, Ong was chief operating officer of Hong Kong-based Star Group, overseeing media and entertainment operations for News Corp.’s satellite TV channels in 55 countries.
She also helped launch the National Geographic Channel as the network’s founding president and oversaw its distribution, which grew to 60 million households within six years, including into online, video-on-demand and other new-media platforms.
“We are pleased to elect Laureen to WWE’s board of directors,” said Vince McMahon, WWE chairman and CEO, in a statement. “Laureen brings more than 30 years of global media experience that will be very beneficial to the future growth of our company.”

In June 2012, Atrinsic filed a voluntary petition under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York.
