                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

Rating Agencies ” or “ Rating Agency
” shall mean only those rating agencies that are engaged by
the applicable Depositor from time to time to rate the securities
issued in connection with such Securitization.

 

“ Rating Agency
Confirmation ” shall mean each of the applicable Rating
Agencies for each Securitization shall have confirmed in writing
that the occurrence of the event with respect to which such Rating

confirmation by such Rating Agency (only) be obtained will be
deemed not to apply for purposes of this Agreement. For purposes of

otherwise engage in any request for such confirmation hereunder
shall not be deemed a waiver, declination or refusal to review or
otherwise engage in any subsequent request for such Rating Agency
Confirmation hereunder and the condition for such Rating Agency
Confirmation pursuant to this Agreement for any subsequent request
shall apply regardless of any previous waiver, declination or
refusal to review or otherwise engage in such prior

serviced as follows:

 

(i)          from
and after the WFCM 2016-NXS6 Securitization Date, but prior to the
Note A-1 Securitization Date, by the WFCM 2016-NXS6 Master Servicer
and the WFCM 2016-NXS6 Special Servicer pursuant to the terms of

PSA.

 

Each Holder agrees to reasonably
cooperate with each Servicer with respect to its exercise of its
rights and obligations under the Servicing Agreement.

 

(b)          The
Servicing Agreement and each Related Non-Lead PSA shall contain
terms and conditions that are customary for securitization
transactions involving assets similar to the Mortgage Loan and that
are otherwise (i) required by the Code relating to the tax
elections of the respective Trust Fund, (ii) required by law
or changes in any law, rule or regulation or (iii) requested
by the Rating Agencies rating the related Securitization. In
addition, the Servicing Agreement and each Related Non-Lead PSA

Section 19 . The Note A-1 Holder shall have the

to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each Holder hereby
irrevocably and unconditionally consents to the appointment of the
Master Servicer and the Trustee under the Servicing Agreement by
the Depositor and the appointment of the Special Servicer by the
Directing Holder and agrees to reasonably cooperate with the Master
Servicer and the Special Servicer with respect to the servicing of
the Mortgage Loan in accordance with the Servicing Agreement. Each
Holder hereby appoints the Master Servicer, the Special Servicer
and the Trustee under the Servicing Agreement as such
Holder’s attorney-in-fact to sign any documents reasonably
required with respect to the administration and servicing of the
Mortgage Loan on its behalf under the Servicing Agreement (subject

in such Servicing Agreement).

Note A-1 Holder shall cause the Mortgage Loan to be serviced
pursuant to a servicing agreement that is substantially similar to
the Servicing Agreement (and, if any Non-Lead Note is in a
Securitization, subject to receipt of a Rating Agency Confirmation
from the Rating Agencies that

 





 -17-






 


 

were engaged by the Depositor to
rate such Securitization) and all references herein to the “
Servicing Agreement ” shall mean such subsequent
Servicing Agreement; provided , however , that until
a replacement Servicing Agreement has been entered into (and such
written confirmation has been obtained), the Note A-1 Holder
shall cause the Mortgage Loan to be serviced pursuant to the
provisions of the Servicing Agreement as if such agreement was
still in full force and effect with respect to the Mortgage Loan;
provided , further , however , that until a
replacement Servicing Agreement is in place, the actual servicing
of the Mortgage Loan may be performed by any Qualified Servicer
appointed by the Note A-1 Holder and does not have to be
performed by the service providers set forth under the Servicing
Agreement that was previously in effect.

 

(e)          Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained herein (including
Sections 4 and 14(a) ), each Servicing Agreement
shall provide that the Servicer shall be required to service and
administer the Mortgage Loan in accordance with the Servicing
Standard as set forth in such Servicing Agreement, and any Holder
who is not the Borrower or an Affiliate of the Borrower shall be
deemed a third-party beneficiary of such provisions of the
Servicing Agreement that run to the benefit of such Holder. It is
understood that any Non-Lead Note Holder may separately appoint a
servicer for its Non-Lead Note, by itself or together with other
assets, but any such servicer will have no responsibility hereunder
and shall be compensated solely by the applicable Non-Lead Note
Holder from funds payable to it hereunder or otherwise.

 

(f)          The
Holders acknowledge that the Servicer is to comply with this
Agreement and the Mortgage Loan Documents in connection with the
servicing of the Mortgage Loan.

 

(g)         If
any Note is included as an asset of a real estate mortgage
investment conduit (a “ REMIC ”), within the
meaning of Section 860D(a) of the Code, then, any
provision of this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding:
(i) the Mortgage Loan shall be administered such that the
Notes shall qualify at all times as (or as interests in) a
“qualified mortgage” within the meaning of
Section 860G(a)(3) of the Code, (ii) any real property
(and related personal property) acquired by or on behalf of the
Holders pursuant to a foreclosure, exercise of a power of sale or
delivery of a deed in lieu of foreclosure of the Mortgage or lien
on such property following a default on the Mortgage Loan shall be
administered so that the interest of the pro rata share of
each Holder therein shall at all times qualify as
“foreclosure property” within the meaning of
Section 860G(a)(8) of the Code, and (iii) no Servicer may
modify, waive or amend any provision of the Mortgage Loan, consent
to or withhold consent from any action of the Borrower, or exercise
or refrain from exercising any powers or rights that the Holders
may have under the Mortgage Loan Documents, if any such action
would constitute a “significant modification” of the
Mortgage Loan, within the meaning of
Section 1.860G-2(b) of the regulations of the United
States Department of the Treasury, more than three (3) months after
the startup day of the REMIC that includes any Note (or any portion
thereof). Each Holder agrees that the provisions of this paragraph
shall be effected by compliance with any REMIC provisions in the
Servicing Agreement relating to the administration of the Mortgage
Loan.

 

(h)          In
the event that one of the Notes is included in a REMIC, the other
Holders shall not be required to reimburse such Holder or any other
Person for payment of any taxes imposed on such REMIC or Advances
therefor or for any interest on such Advance or for

 





 -18-






 


 

deficits in other items of
disbursement or income resulting from the use of funds for payment
of any such taxes, nor shall any disbursement or payment otherwise
distributable to the other Holders be reduced to offset or make-up
any such payment or deficit.

 

3.

Note A-3, Note A-4, Note A-5, Note A-6, Note A-7, Note A-8,
Note A-9, Note A-10, Note 11, Note A-12 and Note A-13 shall be of
equal priority, and no portion of any of Note A-1,
Note A-2, Note A-3, Note A-4, Note A-5, Note A-6, Note
A-7, Note A-8, Note A-9, Note A-10, Note 11, Note A-12 and Note
A-13 shall have priority or preference over any portion of the
other Note or security therefor. Except for the Excluded Amounts,
all amounts tendered by the Borrower or otherwise available for

under any guaranty, letter of credit or other instrument serving as
security on the Mortgage Loan, proceeds under title, hazard or
other insurance policies or awards or settlements in respect of
condemnation proceedings or similar exercise of the power of
eminent domain shall be distributed by the Master Servicer and
applied to each Note on a Pro Rata and Pari Passu Basis.

 

The Servicing Agreement may provide
for the application of Penalty Charges paid in respect of the
Mortgage Loan to be used to (i) pay the Master Servicer, the
Trustee or the Special Servicer for interest accrued on any
Property Advances, (ii) to pay the parties to any
Securitization for interest accrued on any P&I Advance,
(iii) to pay certain other expenses incurred with respect to
the Mortgage Loan and (iv) to pay to the Master Servicer
and/or the Special Servicer as additional servicing compensation,
except that, for so long as any Note is not included in a
Securitization, any Penalty Charges allocated to such Note that are
not applied pursuant to clauses (i)-(iii) above shall be remitted
to the respective Holder and shall not be paid to the Master
Servicer and/or the Special Servicer without the express consent of
such Holder.

 

4.          
Workout . Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
herein, but subject to the terms and conditions of the Servicing
Agreement and Section 14 of this Agreement, and the
obligation to act in accordance with the Servicing Standard, if the
Lead Note Holder, or any Servicer, in connection with a workout or
proposed workout of the Mortgage Loan, modifies the terms thereof
such that (i) the Mortgage Loan Principal Balance is
decreased, (ii) the Mortgage Interest Rate is reduced,
(iii) payments of interest or principal on any Note are
waived, reduced or deferred or (iv) any other adjustment is
made to any of the payment terms of the Mortgage Loan, such
modification shall not alter, and any modification of the Mortgage
Loan Documents shall be structured to preserve, the equal
priorities of each Note as described in Section 3
.

 

5.          
Accounts; Payment Procedure . The Servicing Agreement shall
provide that the Master Servicer shall establish and maintain the
Collection Account or Collection Accounts, as applicable. Each
Holder hereby directs the Master Servicer, in accordance with the
priorities set forth in Section 3 hereof, and subject
to the terms of the Servicing Agreement, (i) to deposit into
the applicable Collection Account within the time period specified
in the Servicing Agreement all payments received with respect to
the Mortgage Loan and (ii) to remit from the applicable
Collection Account for deposit or credit on the applicable Master
Servicer Remittance Date all payments received with respect to and
allocable to each Note, by wire transfer to

 





 -19-






 


 

accounts maintained by the
applicable Holder; provided that delinquent payments
received by the Master Servicer after the related Master Servicer
Remittance Date shall be remitted by the Master Servicer to such
accounts within the time period specified in the Servicing
Agreement.

 

If any Servicer holding or having
distributed any amount received or collected in respect of any Note
determines, or a court of competent jurisdiction orders, at any
time that any amount received or collected in respect of any such
Note must, pursuant to any insolvency, bankruptcy, fraudulent
conveyance, preference or similar law, be returned to the Borrower
or paid to any Holder or any Servicer or paid to any other Person,
then, notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, no
Servicer shall be required to distribute any portion thereof to
such Holder, and such Holder shall promptly on demand repay to such
Servicer the portion thereof that was distributed to such Holder
together with interest thereon at such rate, if any, as such
Servicer shall have been required to pay to the Borrower, any
Holder, any Servicer or such other person or entity with respect
thereto. Each Holder agrees that if at any time it shall receive
from any sources whatsoever any payment on account of the Mortgage
Loan in excess of its distributable share thereof, it will promptly
remit such excess to the Master Servicer. The Master Servicer shall
have the right to offset any amounts due hereunder from any Holder
with respect to the Mortgage Loan against any future payments due
to such Holder under the Mortgage Loan, provided , that the
obligations of each Holder under this Section 5 are
separate and distinct obligations from one another and in no event
shall any Servicer enforce the obligations of any Holder against
any other Holder. The obligations of each Holder under this
Section 5 constitute absolute, unconditional and
continuing obligations and each Servicer shall be deemed a
third-party beneficiary of these provisions.

 

6.          
Future Advances . (a) The Future Funding Note Holder hereby
agrees to advance to the Borrower any Future Advance required to be
made under the Future Funding Note and the Mortgage Loan Documents,
it being the specific intent of the parties hereto that the Holders
of the Funded Notes shall not be liable for making any Future
Advance. The Future Funding Note Holder shall remit each Future
Advance on the date that such Future Advance is required to be made
pursuant to the Mortgage Loan Documents and the Future Funding
Note. The parties hereto agree that (i) the determination of
whether the Borrower is entitled to receive any Future Advance
shall rest solely with the Future Funding Note Holder, which shall
be responsible for conducting any and all due diligence, loan
documentation and pre-funding requirements in connection therewith
and (ii) the Future Funding Note Holder shall be solely responsible
for funding the Future Advance following such determination that
the Borrower is entitled to receive such Future Advance. For so
long as the Future Advance Obligation has not been fully discharged
and any Securitization is outstanding, the Future Funding Note
shall only be transferred to (i) a transferee that has (A) a
long-term unsecured debt rating of at least “AA” or the
equivalent from each Rating Agency then rating any Certificates and

which,
in the case of each of clauses (i), (ii), and (iii) of this definition, has at least $650,000,000 in total assets (in name

or commercial loans similar to the Mortgage Loan.
 
“Qualified
Trustee” shall mean (i) a corporation, national bank, national banking association or a trust company, organized

or, if any of such entities shall for any reason no longer perform the functions of a securities rating agency, any other nationally
recognized statistical rating agency reasonably designated by any Holder to rate the securities issued in connection with the
Securitization of the related Note; provided, however, that, unless specified otherwise, at any time during which
any Note is an asset of a Securitization, “Rating Agencies” or “Rating Agency” shall mean
only those rating agencies that are engaged by the applicable Depositor from time to time to rate the securities issued in connection
with such Securitization.

a downgrade, qualification or withdrawal of the applicable rating or ratings ascribed by such Rating Agency to any of the Certificates
then outstanding. In the event that no Certificates are outstanding or none of the Notes are included in a Securitization, any
action that would otherwise require a Rating Agency Confirmation shall require the consent of the Note A-1 Holder, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.
 
For
the purposes of this Agreement, if any Rating Agency (1) waives, declines or refuses, in writing, to review or otherwise engage
any request for a confirmation hereunder from such Rating Agency that a proposed action will not result in a qualification, downgrade
or withdrawal of its then current rating of the securities issued pursuant to the related Securitization, or (2) does not reply
to such request or responds in a manner that indicates that such Rating Agency is neither reviewing such request nor waiving the
requirement for Rating Agency Confirmation and the related timing, notice and other applicable provisions set forth in the Servicing
Agreement and the Non-Lead Servicing Agreements, as applicable, have been satisfied, then for such request only, the condition
that such confirmation by such Rating Agency (only) be obtained will be deemed not to apply for purposes of this Agreement. For
purposes of clarity, any such waiver, declination or refusal to review or otherwise engage in any request for such confirmation
hereunder shall not be deemed a waiver, declination or refusal to review or otherwise engage in any subsequent request for such
Rating Agency Confirmation hereunder and the condition for such Rating Agency Confirmation pursuant to this Agreement for any
subsequent request shall apply regardless of any previous waiver, declination or refusal to review or otherwise engage in such
prior request.

“Servicing
Fee” shall mean the fee of the Master Servicer pursuant to the terms of the Servicing Agreement, which will generally
be calculated as the product of (i) the Servicing Fee Rate and (ii) the outstanding principal balance of the Mortgage Loan as

2.       Servicing
of the Mortgage Loan. (a)  Each Holder acknowledges and agrees that, subject in each case to the specific terms
of this Agreement, the Mortgage Loan shall be serviced as follows:
 
(i)       from
and after the Note A-1 Securitization Date, but prior to the Note A-2 Securitization Date, by the Note A-1 Master Servicer and

Each
Holder agrees to reasonably cooperate with each Servicer with respect to its exercise of its rights and obligations under the
Servicing Agreement.
 
(b)       The
Note A-1 PSA, Note A-2 PSA and the Note A-3 PSA shall contain terms and conditions that are customary for securitization transactions
involving assets similar to the Mortgage Loan and that are otherwise (i) required by the Code relating to the tax elections
of the Note A-1 Trust Fund, the Note A-2 Trust Fund and Note A-3 Trust Fund, (ii) required by law or changes in any law,
rule or regulation or (iii) requested by the Rating Agencies rating the Note A-1 Securitization, the Note A-2 Securitization

as are set forth in Section 18. The Note A-2 Holder shall have the right to designate the Master Servicer and
Special Servicer for the Note A-2 Securitization as long as each such party is a Qualified Servicer.
 
(c)       Subject
to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each Holder hereby irrevocably and unconditionally consents to the appointment
of the Master Servicer and the Lead Trustee by the Depositor and the appointment of the Special Servicer by the Directing Holder
and agrees to reasonably cooperate with the Master Servicer and the Special Servicer with respect to the servicing of the Mortgage
Loan in accordance with the Servicing Agreement. Each Holder hereby appoints the Master Servicer, the Special Servicer and the
Lead Trustee as such Holder’s attorney-in-fact to sign any documents reasonably required with respect to the administration
and servicing of the Mortgage Loan on its behalf under the Servicing Agreement (subject at all times to the rights of the Holders
as set forth herein and in such Servicing Agreement).
 
(d)       If,
at any time the Lead Note is no longer in a Securitization, the Note A-2 Holder shall cause the Mortgage Loan to be serviced
pursuant to a servicing agreement that is substantially similar to the Servicing Agreement (and, if any Non-Lead Note is in a
 

-14-
 
 
Securitization, subject to receipt of a Rating Agency Confirmation from the Rating Agencies that were engaged by the Depositor
to rate such Securitization) and all references herein to the “Servicing Agreement” shall mean such subsequent
Servicing Agreement; provided, however, that until a replacement Servicing Agreement has been entered into (and
such written confirmation has been obtained), the Note A-2 Holder shall cause the Mortgage Loan to be serviced pursuant to
the provisions of the Servicing Agreement as if such agreement was still in full force and effect with respect to the Mortgage
Loan; provided, further, however, that until a replacement Servicing Agreement is in place, the actual servicing
of the Mortgage Loan may be performed by any Qualified Servicer appointed by the Note A-2 Holder and does not have to be
performed by the service providers set forth under the Servicing Agreement that was previously in effect.
 
(e)       Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained herein (including Sections 4 and 13(a)), each Servicing Agreement shall
provide that the Servicer shall be required to service and administer the Mortgage Loan in accordance with the Servicing Standard
as set forth in such Servicing Agreement, and any Holder who is not the Borrower or an Affiliate of the Borrower shall be deemed
a third-party beneficiary of such provisions of the Servicing Agreement that run to the benefit of such Holder. It is understood
that any Non-Lead Note Holder may separately appoint a servicer for its Non-Lead Note, by itself or together with other assets,
but any such servicer will have no responsibility hereunder and shall be compensated solely by the applicable Non-Lead Note Holder
from funds payable to it hereunder or otherwise.
 
(f)       The
Holders acknowledge that the Servicer is to comply with this Agreement and the Mortgage Loan Documents in connection with the
servicing of the Mortgage Loan.
 
(g)       If
any Note is included as an asset of a real estate mortgage investment conduit (a “REMIC”), within the meaning
of Section 860D(a) of the Code, then, any provision of this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding: (i) the Mortgage
Loan shall be administered such that the Notes shall qualify at all times as (or as interests in) a “qualified mortgage”
within the meaning of Section 860G(a)(3) of the Code, (ii) any real property (and related personal property) acquired
by or on behalf of the Holders pursuant to a foreclosure, exercise of a power of sale or delivery of a deed in lieu of foreclosure
of the Mortgage or lien on such property following a default on the Mortgage Loan shall be administered so that the interest of
the pro rata share of each Holder therein shall at all times qualify as “foreclosure property” within the meaning
of Section 860G(a)(8) of the Code, and (iii) no Servicer may modify, waive or amend any provision of the Mortgage Loan,
consent to or withhold consent from any action of the Borrower, or exercise or refrain from exercising any powers or rights that
the Holders may have under the Mortgage Loan Documents, if any such action would constitute a “significant modification”
of the Mortgage Loan, within the meaning of Section 1.860G-2(b) of the regulations of the United States Department of the
Treasury, more than three (3) months after the startup day of the REMIC that includes any Note (or any portion thereof). Each
Holder agrees that the provisions of this paragraph shall be effected by compliance with any REMIC provisions in the Servicing
Agreement relating to the administration of the Mortgage Loan.
 
(h)       In
the event that one of the Notes is included in a REMIC, the other Holders shall not be required to reimburse such Holder or any
other Person for payment of any
 

-15-
 
 
taxes imposed on such REMIC or Advances therefor or for any interest on such Advance or for deficits
in other items of disbursement or income resulting from the use of funds for payment of any such taxes, nor shall any disbursement
or payment otherwise distributable to the other Holders be reduced to offset or make-up any such payment or deficit.
 
3.       Priority
of Notes. Note A-1, Note A-2 and Note A-3 shall be of equal priority, and no portion of any of Note A-1, Note
A-2 or Note A-3 shall have priority or preference over any portion of the other Note or security therefor. Except for the Excluded
Amounts, all amounts tendered by the Borrower or otherwise available for payment on the Mortgage Loan, whether received in the
form of Monthly Payments, a balloon payment, Liquidation Proceeds, proceeds under any guaranty, letter of credit or other instrument
serving as security on the Mortgage Loan, proceeds under title, hazard or other insurance policies or awards or settlements in
respect of condemnation proceedings or similar exercise of the power of eminent domain shall be distributed by the Master Servicer
and applied to Note A-1, Note A-2 and Note A-3 on a Pro Rata and Pari Passu Basis.
 
The
Servicing Agreement may provide for the application of Penalty Charges paid in respect of the Mortgage Loan to be used to (i) pay
the Master Servicer, the Trustee or the Special Servicer for interest accrued on any Property Advances, (ii) to pay the parties
to any Securitization for interest accrued on any P&I Advance, (iii) to pay certain other expenses incurred with respect
to the Mortgage Loan and (iv) to pay to the Master Servicer and/or the Special Servicer as additional servicing compensation,
except that, for so long as any Note is not included in a Securitization, any Penalty Charges allocated to such Note that are
not applied pursuant to clauses (i)-(iii) above shall be remitted to the respective Holder and shall not be paid to the Master
Servicer and/or the Special Servicer without the express consent of such Holder.
 
4.       Workout. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained herein, but subject to the terms and conditions of the Servicing Agreement and Section 13
of this Agreement, and the obligation to act in accordance with the Servicing Standard, if the Lead Note Holder, or any Servicer,
in connection with a workout or proposed workout of the Mortgage Loan, modifies the terms thereof such that (i) the Mortgage
Loan Principal Balance is decreased, (ii) the Mortgage Interest Rate is reduced, (iii) payments of interest or principal
on Note A-1, Note A-2 or Note A-3 are waived, reduced or deferred or (iv) any other adjustment is made to any of the
payment terms of the Mortgage Loan, such modification shall not alter, and any modification of the Mortgage Loan Documents shall
be structured to preserve, the equal priorities of Note A-1, Note A-2 and Note A-3 as described in Section 3.
 
5.       Accounts;
Payment Procedure. The Servicing Agreement shall provide that the Master Servicer shall establish and maintain the Collection
Account or Collection Accounts, as applicable. Each of the Note A-1 Holder, the Note A-2 Holder and the Note A-3 Holder hereby
directs the Master Servicer, in accordance with the priorities set forth in Section 3 hereof, and subject to the terms
of the Servicing Agreement, (i) to deposit into the applicable Collection Account within the time period specified in the Servicing
Agreement all payments received with respect to the Mortgage Loan and (ii) to remit from the applicable Collection Account for
deposit or credit on the applicable Master Servicer Remittance Date all payments received with respect to and allocable to Note A-1,
Note A-2 and Note A-3 by wire transfer to
 

-16-
 
 
accounts maintained by the Note A-1 Holder, the Note A-2 Holder and the Note A-3
Holder, respectively; provided that delinquent payments received by the Master Servicer after the related Master Servicer Remittance
Date shall be remitted by the Master Servicer to such accounts within the time period specified in the Servicing Agreement.
 
If
any Servicer holding or having distributed any amount received or collected in respect of Note A-1, Note A-2 or Note A-3
determines, or a court of competent jurisdiction orders, at any time that any amount received or collected in respect of Note A-1,
Note A-2 or Note A-3 must, pursuant to any insolvency, bankruptcy, fraudulent conveyance, preference or similar law, be returned
to the Borrower or paid to the Note A-1 Holder, the Note A-2 , the Note A-3 Holder or any Servicer or paid to any other
Person, then, notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, no Servicer shall be required to distribute any portion thereof
to the Note A-1 Holder, the Note A-2 Holder or the Note A-3 Holder, as applicable, and the Note A-1 Holder, the Note
A-2 Holder or the Note A-3 Holder, as applicable, shall promptly on demand repay to such Servicer the portion thereof that has
been distributed to the Note A-1 Holder, the Note A-2 Holder or Note A-3 Holder, as applicable, together with interest thereon
at such rate, if any, as such Servicer shall have been required to pay to the Borrower, the Note A-1 Holder, the Note A-2
Holder, the Note A-3 Holder, any Servicer or such other person or entity with respect thereto. Each of the Note A-1 Holder,
the Note A-2 Holder and the Note A-3 Holder agrees that if at any time it shall receive from any sources whatsoever any payment
on account of the Mortgage Loan in excess of its distributable share thereof, it will promptly remit such excess to the Master
Servicer. The Master Servicer shall have the right to offset any amounts due hereunder from the Note A-1 Holder, the Note
A-2 Holder or the Note A-3 Holder, as applicable, with respect to the Mortgage Loan against any future payments due to the Note A-1
Holder, the Note A-2 Holder or the Note A-3 Holder, as applicable, under the Mortgage Loan, provided, that the obligations
of the Note A-1 Holder, the Note A-2 Holder and the Note A-3 Holder under this Section 5 are separate and distinct
obligations from one another and in no event shall any Servicer enforce the obligations of any Holder against any other Holder.
The obligations of the Note A-1 Holder, the Note A-2 Holder and the Note A-3 Holder under this Section 5 constitute
absolute, unconditional and continuing obligations and each Servicer shall be deemed a third-party beneficiary of these provisions.
 
6.       Limitation
on Liability. Subject to the terms of the Servicing Agreement, no Holder (including the Master Servicer or the Special
Servicer on its behalf) shall have any liability to any other Holder with respect to any Note, except (1) with respect to
the Advance reimbursement provisions set forth in Section 17 and (2) with respect to losses actually suffered
due to the gross negligence, willful misconduct or material breach of this Agreement on the part of such Holder (including the
Master Servicer or the Special Servicer on its behalf, except that the Master Servicer’s or Special Servicer’s liability
is further limited or expanded as set forth in the Servicing Agreement).
 
7.       Representations
of the Holders. (a)  Each of the initial Holders hereby represents and warrants to, and covenants with each
other Holder that, as of the date hereof:
 
(i)       It
is duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State under which it is organized.
 

-17-
 
 
(ii)       The
execution and delivery of this Agreement by such Holder, and performance of, and compliance with, the terms of this Agreement
by such Holder, will not violate its organizational documents or constitute a default (or an event which, with notice or lapse
of time, or both, would constitute a default) under, or result in the breach of, any material agreement or other instrument to
which it is a party or that is applicable to it or any of its assets, in each case which materially and adversely affect its ability
to carry out the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
 
(iii)       Such
Holder has the full power and authority to enter into and consummate all transactions contemplated by this Agreement, has duly
authorized the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and has duly executed and delivered this Agreement.
 
(iv)       This
Agreement is the legal, valid and binding obligation of such Holder enforceable against such Holder in accordance with its terms,
except as such enforcement may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws affecting
the enforcement of creditors’ rights generally, and by general principles of equity (regardless of whether such enforceability
is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law), and except that the enforcement of rights with respect to indemnification
and contribution obligations may be limited by applicable law.
 
(v)     
  It has the right to enter into this Agreement without the consent of any third party.
 
(vi)       It
is the holder of the respective Note for its own account in the ordinary course of its business.

(viii)      It
is a Qualified Transferee.
 
8.       Independent
Analyses of each Holder. Each Holder acknowledges that, except for the representations made in Section 7,
it has, independently and without reliance upon any other Holders and based on such documents and information as such Holder has
deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis and decision to purchase its respective Note. Each Holder hereby acknowledges
that the other Holders shall have no responsibility for (i) the collectability of the Mortgage Loan, (ii) the validity,
enforceability or legal effect of any of the Mortgage Loan Documents or the title insurance policy or policies or any survey furnished
or to be furnished in connection with the origination of the Mortgage Loan, (iii) the validity, sufficiency or effectiveness
of the lien created or to be created by the Mortgage Loan Documents, or (iv) the financial condition of the Borrower. Each
Holder assumes all risk of loss in connection with its respective Note for reasons other than gross negligence, willful misconduct
or breach of this Agreement by any other Holder or gross negligence, willful misconduct or bad faith by any Servicer.
 

-18-
 
 
9.       No
Creation of a Partnership or Exclusive Purchase Right. Nothing contained in this Agreement, and no action taken pursuant
hereto, shall be deemed to constitute among any Holder (or the Master Servicer, Special Servicer or Trustee on its behalf) and
any other Holders a partnership, association, joint venture or other entity. Each Holder (or the Master Servicer, Special Servicer
or Trustee on its behalf) shall have no obligation whatsoever to offer to the other Holders the opportunity to purchase notes
or interests relating to any future loans originated by such Holder or any of its Affiliates, and if any Holder chooses to offer
to any of the other Holders, the opportunity to purchase notes or interests in any future mortgage loans originated by such Holder
or its Affiliates, such offer shall be at such purchase price and interest rate as such Holder chooses, in its sole and absolute
discretion. None of the Holders shall have any obligation whatsoever to purchase from any other Holder any notes or interests
in any future loans originated by any other Holder or any of its Affiliates.
 
10.       Not
a Security. None of Note A-1, Note A-2 or Note A-3 shall be deemed to be a security within the meaning of the Securities
Act of 1933 or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
 
11.       Other
Business Activities of the Holders. Each Holder acknowledges that the other Holders may make loans or otherwise extend
credit to, and generally engage in any kind of business with, any Affiliate of the Borrower, and receive payments on such other
loans or extensions of credit to any Affiliate of the Borrower and otherwise act with respect thereto freely and without accountability,
but only if none of the foregoing violate the Mortgage Loan Documents, in the same manner as if this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby were not in effect.
 
12.       Transfer
of Notes. (a)  Each Holder may Transfer up to 49% (in the aggregate) of its beneficial interest in its Note
whether or not the related transferee is a Qualified Transferee without a Rating Agency Confirmation. Each Holder shall not Transfer
more than 49% (in the aggregate) of its beneficial interest in its Note unless (i) prior to a Securitization of any Note,
the other Holder has consented to such Transfer, in which case the related transferee shall thereafter be deemed to be a “Qualified
Transferee” for all purposes under this Agreement, (ii) after a Securitization of any Note, a Rating Agency Confirmation
has been received with respect to such Transfer, in which case the related transferee shall thereafter be deemed to be a “Qualified
Transferee” for all purposes under this Agreement, (iii) such Transfer is to a Qualified Transferee, or (iv) such Transfer
is in connection with a sale by a Securitization trust. Any such transferee must assume in writing the obligations of the transferring
Holder hereunder and agree to be bound by the terms and provisions of this Agreement and the Servicing Agreement. Such proposed
transferee (except in the case of Transfers that are made in connection with a Securitization) shall also remake each of the representations
and warranties contained herein for the benefit of the other Holder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, without the non-transferring
Holder’s prior consent (which will not be unreasonably withheld), and, if such non-transferring Holder’s Note is in
a Securitization, without a Rating Agency Confirmation from each Rating Agency that has been engaged by the Depositor to rate
the securities issued in connection with such Securitization, no Holder shall Transfer all or any portion of its Note to the Borrower
or an Affiliate of the Borrower and any such Transfer shall be absolutely null and void and shall vest no rights in the purported
transferee.
 

-19-
 
 
(b)       Except
for a Transfer made in connection with a Securitization, or a Transfer made by an initial Holder to an Affiliate, at least five
(5) days prior to a transfer of any Note, the transferring Holder shall provide to the other Holders and, if any Certificates
are outstanding, to the Rating Agencies, a certification that such transfer will be made in accordance with this Section 12,
such certification to include (1) the name and contact information of the transferee and (2) if applicable, a certification
by the transferee that it is a Qualified Transferee.
 
(c)       The
Holders acknowledge that any Rating Agency Confirmation may be granted or denied by the Rating Agencies in their sole and absolute
discretion and that such Rating Agencies may charge the transferring Holder customary fees in connection with providing such Rating
Agency Confirmation.
 
(d)       Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained herein, each Holder may pledge or transfer (a “Pledge”) its Note to any
entity (other than the Borrower or any Affiliate of the Borrower) that has extended a credit facility to such Holder or has entered
into a repurchase agreement with such Holder and that, in each case, is either a Qualified Transferee or a financial institution
whose long-term unsecured debt is rated at least “A” (or the equivalent) or better by each Rating Agency (a “Note
Pledgee”), or to a Person with respect to which a Rating Agency Confirmation has been obtained, on terms and conditions
set forth in this Section 12(d), it being further agreed that a financing provided by a Note Pledgee to any Holder
or any Affiliate that controls such Holder that is secured by such Holder’s interest in its respective Note and is structured
as a repurchase arrangement, shall qualify as a “Pledge” hereunder on the condition that all applicable terms and
conditions of this Section 12 are complied with. A Note Pledgee that is not a Qualified Transferee may not take title
to a Note without a Rating Agency Confirmation. Upon written notice, if any, by the pledging Holder to the other Holders and the
Servicer that a Pledge has been effected (including the name and address of the applicable Note Pledgee), the other Holders agree
to acknowledge receipt of such notice and thereafter agree: (i) to give such Note Pledgee written notice of any default by
the pledging Holder in respect of its obligations under this Agreement of which default such Holder has actual knowledge and which
notice shall be given simultaneously with the giving of such notice to the pledging Holder; (ii) to allow such Note Pledgee
a period of ten (10) Business Days to cure a default by the pledging Holder in respect of its obligations to the other Holders
hereunder, but such Note Pledgee shall not be obligated to cure any such default; (iii) that no amendment, modification,
waiver or termination of this Agreement or the Servicing Agreement (if the pledging Holder had the right to consent to such amendment,
modification, waiver or termination pursuant to the terms hereof) shall be effective against such Note Pledgee without the written
consent of such Note Pledgee, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed and which consent shall
be deemed to be given if Note Pledgee shall fail to respond to any request for consent to any such amendment, modification, waiver
or termination within 10 days after request therefor; (iv) that the other Holders shall accept any cure by such Note Pledgee
of any default of the pledging Holder which such pledging Holder has the right to effect hereunder, as if such cure were made
by such pledging Holder; (v) that the other Holders or Servicer shall deliver to Note Pledgee such estoppel certificate(s)
as Note Pledgee shall reasonably request, provided that any such certificate(s) shall be in a form reasonably satisfactory
to the other Holders; and (vi) that, upon written notice (a “Redirection Notice”) to the Servicer by such
Note Pledgee that the pledging Holder is in default beyond any applicable cure periods with respect to the pledging Holder’s
obligations to such Note Pledgee pursuant to the applicable credit agreement or other
 

-20-
 
 
agreements relating to the Pledge between
the pledging Holder and such Note Pledgee (which notice need not be joined in or confirmed by the pledging Holder), and until
such Redirection Notice is withdrawn or rescinded by such Note Pledgee, Note Pledgee (or at any time that pledging Holder otherwise
directs that such payment be made to Note Pledgee pursuant to a separate notice) shall be entitled to receive any payments that
any Servicer would otherwise be obligated to make to the pledging Holder from time to time pursuant to this Agreement or any Servicing
Agreement. Any pledging Holder hereby unconditionally and absolutely releases the other Holders and any Servicer from any liability
to the pledging Holder on account of any Holder’s or Servicer’s compliance with any Redirection Notice believed by
any Servicer or other Holder in good faith to have been delivered by a Note Pledgee. Note Pledgee shall be permitted to exercise
fully its rights and remedies against the pledging Holder (and accept an assignment in lieu of foreclosure as to such collateral),
in accordance with applicable law, the pledge agreement, repurchase agreement or similar agreement between the pledging Holder
and the Note Pledgee and this Agreement. In such event, or if the pledging holder otherwise assigns its interests to the Note
Pledgee, the other Holders and the Servicer shall recognize such Note Pledgee (and any transferee (other than the Borrower or
any Affiliate of the Borrower) that is also a Qualified Transferee at any foreclosure or similar sale held by such Note Pledgee
or any transfer in lieu of foreclosure), and such Person’s successor and assigns, as the successor to the pledging Holder’s
rights, remedies and obligations under this Agreement, and any such Note Pledgee or Qualified Transferee shall assume in writing
the obligations of the pledging Holder hereunder accruing from and after such Transfer (i.e., realization upon the collateral
by such Note Pledgee) and agrees to be bound by the terms and provisions of this Agreement. The rights of a Note Pledgee under
this Section 12(d) shall remain effective as to any Holder (and any Servicer) unless and until such Note Pledgee shall
have notified such Holder (and any Servicer, as applicable) in writing that its interest in the pledged Note has terminated.
 
13.       Exercise
of Remedies by the Servicer. (a)  Subject to the terms of this Agreement and the Servicing Agreement and subject
to the rights and consents, where required, of the Directing Holder, the Servicer shall have the sole and exclusive authority
with respect to the administration of, and exercise of rights and remedies with respect to, the Mortgage Loan, including, without
limitation, the sole and exclusive authority to (i) modify or waive any of the terms of the Mortgage Loan Documents, (ii) consent
to any action or failure to act by the Borrower or any party to the Mortgage Loan Documents, (iii) vote all claims with respect
to the Mortgage Loan in any bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar proceedings and (iv) to take legal action to enforce
or protect the Holders’ interests with respect to the Mortgage Loan or to refrain from exercising any powers or rights under
the Mortgage Loan Documents, including the right at any time to call or waive any Events of Default, or accelerate or refrain
from accelerating the Mortgage Loan or institute any foreclosure action, and the Holders shall have no voting, consent or other
rights whatsoever with respect to the Servicer’s administration of, or exercise of its rights and remedies with respect
to, the Mortgage Loan other than as provided in the Servicing Agreement. Subject to the terms and conditions of the Servicing
Agreement, the Servicer shall have the sole and exclusive authority to make Property Advances with respect to the Mortgage Loan.
Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, each Holder agrees that it shall have no right to, and hereby presently and irrevocably
assigns and conveys to the Servicer the rights, if any, that such Holder has to (A) call or cause the Servicer to call an
Event of Default under the Mortgage Loan, or (B) exercise any remedies with respect to the Mortgage Loan or the
 

-21-
 
 
Borrower,
including, without limitation, filing or causing the Lead Note Holder or such Servicer to file any bankruptcy petition against
the Borrower. Each Holder shall, from time to time, execute such documents as any Servicer shall reasonably require to evidence
such assignment with respect to the rights described in clause (iii) of the first sentence in this Section 13(a).
 
(b)           The
Lead Servicer and the related Trustee shall not have any fiduciary duty to the Non-Lead Note Holders in connection with the administration
of the Mortgage Loan (but the foregoing shall not relieve the Lead Servicer and the related Trustee from their respective obligation
under the Servicing Agreement to make any disbursement of funds as set forth herein).
 
(c)           The
Holders hereby acknowledge that the Servicing Agreement shall provide that, subject to the satisfaction of the conditions set
forth in the next sentence, upon the Mortgage Loan becoming a Defaulted Mortgage Loan, if the Special Servicer determines to sell
the Defaulted Mortgage Loan (or the Lead Note), it will be required to sell the entire Defaulted Mortgage Loan as a single whole
loan (i.e., the Lead Note and Non-Lead Notes). Any such sale of the entire Defaulted Mortgage Loan is subject to the satisfaction
of the following:
 
(i)            Each
Non-Lead Note Holder has provided written consent to such sale; or
 
(ii)           The
Special Servicer has delivered the following notices and information to each Non-Lead Note Holder:
 
(1)       at
least 15 Business Days prior written notice of any decision to attempt to sell the Defaulted Mortgage Loan;
 
(2)       at
least 10 days prior to the proposed sale date, a copy of each bid package (together with any amendments to such bid packages)
received by the Special Servicer in connection with any such proposed sale;
 
(3)       at
least 10 days prior to the proposed sale date, a copy of the most recent Appraisal for the Mortgage Loan, and any documents in
the Servicing File reasonably requested by a Non-Lead Note Holder; and
 
(4)       until
the sale is completed and a reasonable period of time (but no less time than is afforded to other offerors and the Directing Holder)
prior to the proposed sale date, all information and other documents being provided to other offerors and all leases or other
documents that are approved by the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer in connection with the proposed sale.
 
Any
Non-Lead Note Holder may waive any delivery or timing requirements set forth above only for itself. Subject to the foregoing,
each of the Lead Note Holder, the Directing Holder, the Non-Lead Note Holders and the Non-Directing Holders shall be permitted
to submit an offer at any sale of the Defaulted Mortgage Loan (unless such Person is the Borrower or an agent or Affiliate of
the Borrower).
 

-22-
 
 
The
Non-Lead Note Holders hereby appoint the Lead Note Holder as their agent, and grant to the Lead Note Holder an irrevocable power
of attorney coupled with an interest, and its proxy, for the purpose of soliciting and accepting offers for and consummating the
sale of the Non-Lead Notes. Each Non-Lead Note Holder further agrees that, upon the request of the Lead Note Holder, such Non-Lead
Note Holder shall execute and deliver to or at the direction of Lead Note Holder such powers of attorney or other instruments
as the Lead Note Holder may reasonably request to better assure and evidence the foregoing appointment and grant, in each case
promptly following such request, and shall deliver the related original Non-Lead Note, endorsed in blank, to or at the direction
of the Lead Note Holder in connection with the consummation of any such sale.
 
The
authority of the Lead Note Holder to sell the Non-Lead Notes, and the obligations of the Non-Lead Note Holders to execute and
deliver instruments or deliver the Non-Lead Notes upon request of the Lead Note Holder, shall terminate and cease to be of any
further force or effect upon the date, if any, upon which the Lead Note is repurchased by Natixis, as the initial Note A-2
Holder from the trust fund established under the Servicing Agreement in connection with a material breach of representation or
warranty made by the initial Note A-2 Holder with respect to the Lead Note or material document defect with respect to the
documents delivered by the initial Note A-2 Holder with respect to the Lead Note upon the consummation of the Lead Securitization.
 
(d)       Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained herein, the exercise by the Servicer on behalf of the Holders of its rights under this Section 13
shall be subject in all respects to any section of the Servicing Agreement governing REMIC administration, and in no event
shall the Servicer be permitted to take any action or refrain from taking any action if taking or failing to take such action,
as the case may be, would violate the laws of any applicable jurisdiction, breach the Mortgage Loan Documents or be inconsistent
with the Servicing Standard or violate any other provisions of the Servicing Agreement or violate the REMIC provisions of the
Code or any regulations promulgated thereunder, including, without limitation, the provisions of Section 2(g) of this Agreement.
 
14.       Rights
of the Directing Holder. (a) The Directing Holder shall be entitled to exercise
the rights and powers granted to the Directing Holder hereunder and the rights and powers granted to the “Directing Holder,”
“Controlling Class Certificateholder,” “Controlling Class Representative” or similar party under, and
as defined in, the Servicing Agreement with respect to the Mortgage Loan. In addition, the Directing Holder shall be entitled
to advise (1) the Special Servicer with respect to all matters related to a Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan and (2) the
Special Servicer with respect to all matters for which the Master Servicer must obtain the consent or deemed consent of the Special
Servicer, and, except as set forth below (i) the Master Servicer shall not be permitted to take any Major Action unless it
has obtained the prior written consent of the Special Servicer and (ii) the Special Servicer shall not be permitted to consent
to the Master Servicer’s taking any Major Action nor will the Special Servicer itself be permitted to take any Major Action
as to which the Directing Holder has objected in writing within ten (10) Business Days (or 30 days with respect to an Acceptable
Insurance Default) after receipt of the written recommendation and analysis and such additional information requested by the Directing
Holder as may be necessary in the reasonable judgment of the Directing Holder in order to make
 

-23-
 
  
a judgment with respect to such
Major Action. The Directing Holder may also direct the Special Servicer to take, or to refrain from taking, such other actions
with respect to the Mortgage Loan as the Directing Holder may deem advisable, subject to the terms of the Servicing Agreement.
 
(b)       If
the Directing Holder fails to notify the Special Servicer of its approval or disapproval of any proposed Major Action within ten
(10) Business Days (or 30 days with respect to an Acceptable Insurance Default) after delivery to the Directing Holder by the
applicable Servicer of written notice of a proposed Major Action together with any information requested by the Directing Holder
as may be necessary in the reasonable judgment of the Directing Holder in order to make a judgment, then upon the expiration of
such ten (10) Business Day (or 30 days with respect to an Acceptable Insurance Default) period, such Major Action shall be deemed
to have been approved by the Directing Holder.
 
(c)       In
the event that the Special Servicer or Master Servicer (in the event the Master Servicer is otherwise authorized by the Servicing
Agreement to take such action), as applicable, determines that immediate action, with respect to the foregoing matters, or any
other matter requiring consent of the Directing Holder is necessary to protect the interests of the Holders (as a collective whole)
and the Special Servicer has made a reasonable effort to contact the Directing Holder, the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer,
as the case may be, may take any such action without waiting for the Directing Holder’s response.
 
(d)       No
objection, direction or advice contemplated by the preceding paragraphs may require or cause the Master Servicer or the Special
Servicer, as applicable, to violate any provision of the Mortgage Loan Documents, applicable law, the Servicing Agreement, this
Agreement, the REMIC provisions of the Code or the Master Servicer or Special Servicer’s obligation to act in accordance
with the Servicing Standard or expose the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer to liability, or materially expand the scope
of the Master Servicer’s or the Special Servicer’s responsibilities under the Servicing Agreement.
 
(e)       The
Directing Holder shall have no liability to the other Holders or any other Person for any action taken, or for refraining from
the taking of any action or the giving of any consent or the failure to give any consent pursuant to this Agreement or the Servicing
Agreement, or errors in judgment, absent any loss, liability or expense incurred by reason of its willful misfeasance, bad faith
or gross negligence. The Holders agree that the Directing Holder may take or refrain from taking actions, or give or refrain from
giving consents, that favor the interests of one Holder over the other Holder, and that the Directing Holder may have special
relationships and interests that conflict with the interests of another Holder and, absent willful misfeasance, bad faith or gross
negligence on the part of the Directing Holder agree to take no action against the Directing Holder or any of its officers, directors,
employees, principals or agents as a result of such special relationships or interests, and that the Directing Holder will not
be deemed to have been grossly negligent or reckless, or to have acted in bad faith or engaged in willful misfeasance or to have
recklessly disregarded any exercise of its rights by reason of its having acted or refrained from acting, or having given any
consent or having failed to give any consent, solely in the interests of any Holder.
 
15.       Appointment
of Special Servicer. Subject to the terms of the Servicing Agreement, the Directing Holder shall have the right at any
time and from time to time, with or
 
-24-
 
 
without cause, to replace the Special Servicer then acting with respect to the Mortgage
Loan and appoint a Qualified Servicer as the replacement Special Servicer in lieu thereof. The Directing Holder shall
designate a Person to serve as Special Servicer by delivering to the other Holders and the parties to the Note A-1 PSA, the
Note A-2 PSA and the Note A-3 PSA a written notice stating such designation and by satisfying the other conditions required
under the Servicing Agreement (including, without limitation, a Rating Agency Confirmation, if required by the terms of the
Servicing Agreement), if any.
 
16.       Rights
of the Non-Directing Holders. (a)  The Servicing Agreement shall provide that the Servicer shall be
required:
 
(i)       to
provide copies of the same notices, information and reports that it is required to provide to the Directing Holder pursuant to
the Servicing Agreement with respect to any Major Actions or the implementation of any recommended actions outlined in an Asset
Status Report relating to the Mortgage Loan to the Non-Directing Holders (but without regard to whether or not the Directing Holder
actually has lost any rights to receive such information as a result of a Consultation Termination Event), within the same time
frame as specified with respect to the Directing Holder (but without regard to whether or not the Directing Holder actually has
lost any rights to receive such information as a result of a Consultation Termination Event), provided, however,
that if a Non-Lead Note has been included in a Securitization, then for any information for which the Special Servicer would be
required to provide to the related Non-Directing Holder, the Special Servicer shall provide such notice to the master servicer
of the other Securitization transaction, who shall forward such notice as and when required under the terms of the related Securitization
documents; and
 
(ii)       to
consult with each Non-Directing Holder on a strictly non-binding basis, if, having received such notices, information and reports,
such Non-Directing Holder requests consultation with respect to any such Major Action or the implementation of any recommended
actions outlined in an Asset Status Report relating to the Mortgage Loan, and consider alternative actions recommended by such
Non-Directing Holder; provided that after the expiration of a period of ten (10) Business Days from the delivery to each
Non-Directing Holder of written notice of a proposed action, together with copies of the notice, information and report required
to be provided to the Directing Holder, the Servicer shall no longer be obligated to consult with the Non-Directing Holders, whether
or not the Non-Directing Holders have responded within such ten (10) Business Day period (unless the Servicer proposes a new course
of action that is materially different from the action previously proposed, in which case such ten (10) Business Day period shall
be begin anew from the date of such proposal and delivery of all information relating thereto).
 
(b)       Notwithstanding
the foregoing non-binding consultation rights of the Non-Directing Holders, the Servicer may take any Major Action or any action
set forth in the Asset Status Report before the expiration of the aforementioned ten (10) Business Day period if the Servicer
determines that immediate action with respect thereto is necessary to protect the interests of the Holders.
 

-25-
 
 
(c)       In
addition to the foregoing non-binding consultation rights, the Non-Directing Holders shall have the right to annual conference
calls with the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer upon reasonable notice and at times reasonably acceptable to the Master
Servicer or the Special Servicer, as applicable, in which servicing issues related to the Mortgage Loan are discussed.
 
(d)       In
no event shall the Servicer be obligated at any time to follow or take any alternative actions recommended by any of the Non-Directing
Holders.
 
(e)       Any
Non-Directing Holder that is the Borrower or an Affiliate of the Borrower shall not be entitled to any of the rights set forth

terms of a Non-Lead Servicing Agreement, the related Non-Lead Master Servicer and/or the related Trustee may be obligated to
make P&I Advances with respect to a Non-Lead Note. The Lead Servicer and/or the related Trustee will not be required to
make any P&I Advance with respect to any Non-Lead Note and the related Non-Lead Master Servicer and/or the related
Trustee will not be required to make any P&I Advance with respect to any Lead Note, any other Non-Lead Note or any
Property Advance. The Lead Servicer, each Non-Lead Master Servicer and any Trustee will be entitled to interest on any
Advance made in the manner and from the sources provided in the Note A-1 PSA, the Note A-2 PSA or the Note A-3 PSA, as
applicable.
 
(b)       The
Lead Servicer and the related Trustee, as applicable, will be entitled to reimbursement for a Property Advance, first from
the Collection Account established with respect to the Mortgage Loan, and then, if such Property Advance is a Nonrecoverable
Advance, if such funds on deposit in the Collection Account are insufficient, from general collections of the Lead Securitization
as provided in the Servicing Agreement.
 
(c)       To
the extent amounts on deposit in the Collection Account with respect to the Mortgage Loan are insufficient to reimburse the Lead
Servicer for any Property Advance and/or interest thereon and the Lead Servicer or the related Trustee, as applicable, obtains
funds from general collections of the Lead Securitization as a reimbursement for a Property Advance or interest thereon, each
Non-Lead Note Holder (including any Securitization into which any Non-Lead Note is deposited) shall be required to, promptly following
notice from the Lead Servicer, pay to the Lead Securitization for its pro rata share of such Property Advance and/or interest
thereon at the Reimbursement Rate. In addition, each Non-Lead Note Holder (including any Securitization into which any Non-Lead
Note is deposited) shall promptly reimburse the Lead Servicer or the related Trustee for such Non-Lead Note Holder’s pro
rata share of any fees, costs or expenses incurred in connection with the servicing and administration of the Mortgage Loan
as to which the Lead Securitization or any of the parties thereto are entitled to be reimbursed pursuant to the terms of the Servicing
Agreement (to the extent amounts on deposit in the Collection Account with respect to the Mortgage Loan are insufficient for reimbursement
of such amounts).
 

-26-
 
 
(d)       The
parties to each of the Note A-1 PSA, the Note A-2 PSA and the Note A-3 PSA shall each be entitled to make their own recoverability
determination with respect to a P&I Advance based on the information that they have on hand and in accordance with the Note
A-1 PSA, the Note A-2 PSA and the Note A-3 PSA, as applicable.
 
(e)       If
the Lead Servicer or the related Trustee elects to defer the reimbursement of a Property Advance in accordance with the terms
of the Servicing Agreement, the Lead Servicer or the related Trustee shall also defer its reimbursement of each Non-Lead Note
share from the Non-Lead Note Holders.
 
18.       Provisions
Relating to Securitization.
 
(a)       New
Notes. For so long as Natixis or an Affiliate of Natixis (an “Initial Note Holder”) is the owner of any
Notes, such Initial Note Holder shall have the right, subject to the terms of the Mortgage Loan Documents, to cause the Borrower
to execute amended and restated notes (“Amended Notes”) or additional notes (“New Notes”)
reallocating the principal of the Note or Notes that it owns (but in no case any Note that it does not then own) among Amended
Notes and New Notes or severing a Note into one or more further “component” notes in the aggregate principal amount
equal to the then outstanding principal balance of the Note or Notes being amended or created, provided that (i) the aggregate
principal balance of the Amended Notes and New Notes following such amendments is no greater than the principal balance of the
Amended Notes and New Notes prior to such amendments, (ii) all New Notes continue to have the same interest rate as Amended Note
of which it was a part prior to such amendments, (iii) all New Notes pay pro rata and on a pari passu basis with
the Amended Notes and such reallocated or component notes shall be automatically subject to the terms of this Agreement and (iv)
the Initial Note Holder holding the New Notes shall notify each other Holder, as applicable, and, if any other Note has been included
in a securitization, the parties under each applicable pooling and servicing agreement, in writing of such modified allocations
and principal amounts. In connection with the foregoing, (1) the Master Servicer is hereby authorized to execute amendments to
the Loan Agreement and this Agreement (or to amend and restate the Loan Agreement and this Agreement) on behalf of any or all
of the Holders solely for the purpose of reflecting such reallocation of principal or such severing of a Note, (2) if a Note is
severed into “component” notes, such component notes shall each have their same rights as the respective original
Note, (3) the definition of the term “Securitization” and all of the related defined terms may be amended (and new
terms added, as necessary) to reflect the New Notes and (4) if Natixis is the current Directing Holder, it may designate the holder
for of a different Note to be the Directing Holder. Rating Agency Confirmation shall not be required for any amendments to this
Agreement required to facilitate the terms of this Section 18(a). The Initial Note Holder whose Note is being reallocated
or split pursuant to this Section 18(a) shall reimburse the other Holders for all costs and expenses incurred by the other
Holders in connection with the reallocation or split.

(ii)       if
the applicable master servicer, special servicer or trustee determines that a proposed P&I Advance, if made, or any outstanding

other servicers written notice of such determination within 2 Business Days after such determination was made;
 
(iii)       in
the event such Non-Lead Note Holder is responsible for its proportionate share of any Nonrecoverable Advances (or any other portion
of a Nonrecoverable Advance) (and advance interest thereon) or other fee or expense pursuant to Section 17, and funds received
with respect to such Non-Lead Note are insufficient to cover such amounts, (x) the related master servicer will be required to
pay the Master Servicer, Special Servicer or Lead Trustee, as applicable, out of general funds in the collection account (or equivalent
account) established under the Non-Lead Servicing Agreement and (y) if the Lead Servicing Agreement permits the Master Servicer,
Special Servicer or Lead Trustee to pay itself from the Lead Securitization Trust’s general account then the master servicer

in the collection account (or equivalent account) established under the Non-Lead Servicing Agreement;
 
(iv)       each
of the Master Servicer and the Special Servicer shall be indemnified (as and to the extent the Lead Securitization Trust is required

connection with (A) any amendment of the Servicing Agreement, a party to such Servicing Agreement is required to provide a copy
of the executed amendment to the depositor under each Non-Lead Servicing Agreement and one or more parties to the related Non-Lead
Servicing Agreement (which may be by e-mail), together with a copy of such amendment in electronic format, no later than the effective
date of such amendment, and (B) the termination, resignation and/or replacement of the Master Servicer or Special Servicer under

(xiii)       “servicer
termination events” (or any analogous term under the Servicing Agreement) include customary market termination events with
respect to failure to make advances, failure to remit payments to the Non-Lead Note Holders as required, failure to deliver (or
cause to be delivered) materials or information required in order for the Non-Lead Note Holders or the depositor under a Non-Lead
Servicing Agreement to timely comply with its obligations under the Exchange Act, the Securities Act or Form SF-3, and for rating
agency triggers with respect to any Certificates, subject to customary grace periods (provided that, in the case of failures related
to the securities laws, such grace periods will not cause a depositor under a Non-Lead Servicing Agreement to fail to comply with
the applicable provisions of such securities laws);
 
(xiv)       if
a Non-Lead Note becomes the subject of an “asset review” under a Non-Lead Servicing Agreement, the applicable parties
to the Servicing Agreement are required to reasonably cooperate with the related asset representations reviewer or other applicable
party to such Non-Lead Servicing Agreement in connection with such asset review, including with respect to providing access to
related underlying documents to the

extent the asset representations reviewer or such other applicable party to the Non-Lead Servicing
Agreement has not obtained such documents from the related Non-Lead Note Holder and such documents are in the possession of the
applicable party to the Servicing Agreement;
 
(xv)       if
any “servicer termination event” on the part of the Special Servicer shall occur and be continuing that affects the
Holders of the Non-Lead Notes, then, so long as the Special Servicer is not otherwise terminated, such Holders of Non-Lead Notes
or the trustees under the related Non-Lead Servicing Agreement, as applicable, shall be entitled to direct the Trustee to terminate
the Special Servicer with respect to the Mortgage Loan; a replacement Special Servicer shall be appointed in accordance with the
Servicing Agreement; any Special Servicer appointed to replace the Special Servicer with respect to the Mortgage Loan cannot at
any time be (without the prior written consent of the Holders of the Non-Lead Notes) the person (or Affiliate thereof) that was
terminated at the direction of the Holders of the Non-Lead Notes; and
 
(xvi)       have
provisions materially consistent with those set forth in the Note A-1 PSA with respect to:
 
(A)       
servicing transfer events that would result in the transfer of the Mortgage Loan to special servicing status;
 
(B)

(C)       
requirements to obtain an appraisal or appraisal update following a transfer of the Mortgage Loan to special servicing status

in the Note A-1 PSA), primary servicing, special servicing, workout and liquidation fees (and, in any event, the fees at which
such compensation accrue or are determined shall not exceed 0.0025%, 0.25%, 1.00% and 1.00%, respectively),
 
provided,
however, that (1) this clause (xv) shall not be construed to prohibit differences in timing, control or consultation triggers
or thresholds, terminology, allocation of ministerial duties between multiple servicers or other service providers or certificate
holder or investor voting or consent thresholds, or to prohibit or restrict additional approval, consent, consultation, notice
or rating agency confirmation requirements; and (2) in the event of any conflict between this sentence and any other provision
of this Agreement, such other provision of the Agreement shall control.
 

-32-
 
 
(e)       The
Note A-3 PSA shall have provisions for the benefit of the parties to the Note A-2 PSA that are substantially similar to those
provisions in the Note A-1 PSA, including but not limited to indemnifications, advance reimbursements and designation of third
party beneficiaries.
 
(f)       If
any provision required to be included in a Non-Lead Servicing PSA or the Lead Securitization PSA is not included therein as required
in this Agreement, each Holder agrees that each such provision shall be deemed to be incorporated as a provision of and made a
part of such Non-Lead Servicing PSA or Lead Securitization PSA, as the case may be.

hereto. Additionally, from and after a Securitization, except to cure any ambiguity or to correct any error or as set forth
in Section 18(a), (b) and (c), this Agreement may not be modified unless a Rating Agency Confirmation has been delivered with
respect to each Securitization, except that no Rating Agency Confirmation shall be required in connection with a modification
to cure any ambiguity or to correct or supplement any provision herein that may be defective or inconsistent with any other
provisions herein or with the Servicing Agreement.

Fitch to Rate Credit Suisse Commercial Mtge Securities Corp. 2016-NXSR P-T Ctfs; Presale Issued | Business Wire


























































      Fitch to Rate Credit Suisse Commercial Mtge Securities Corp. 2016-NXSR 
      P-T Ctfs; Presale Issued
    





December 07, 2016 12:24 PM Eastern Standard Time



CHICAGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Link to Fitch Ratings' Report: CSMC 2016-NXSR (US CMBS)https://www.fitchratings.com/site/re/891454



      Fitch Ratings has issued a presale report on the Credit Suisse 
      Commercial Mortgage Securities Corp. Commercial Mortgage Pass Through 
      Certificates, Series 2016-NXSR.
    

      Fitch expects to rate the transaction and assign Rating Outlooks as 
      follows:
    

      --$22,779,000 class A-1 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$85,980,000 class A-2 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$115,000,000 class A-3 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$174,907,000 class A-4 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$26,116,000 class A-SB 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$455,124,000(b) class X-A 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$30,324,000 class A-S 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$455,124,000(c) class V1-A 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$40,961,000 class B 'AA-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$40,961,000(b) class X-B 'AA-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$40,961,000(c) class V-1B 'AA-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$31,100,000 class C 'A-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$31,100,000(c) class V-1C 'A-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$31,100,000(a) class D 'BBB-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$31,100,000(a)(c) class V1-D 'BBB-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$18,963,000(a)(b) class X-E 'BB-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$6,827,000(a)(b) class X-F 'B-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$18,963,000(a) class E 'BB-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$6,827,000(a) class F 'B-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      (a) Privately placed and pursuant to Rule 144A.
    

      (b) Notional amount and interest-only.
    

      (c) Exchangeable certificates
    

      These expected ratings are based on information provided by the issuer 
      as of Dec. 6, 2016.
    

      Fitch does not expect to rate the $22,757,039(a) class NR, 
      $22,757,039(a)(b) class X-NR, $48,547,039(a)(c) class V-1E, and 
      $606,832,040(a)(c) class V-2 certificates.
    

      The certificates represent the beneficial ownership interest in the 
      trust, primary assets of which are 33 loans secured by 54 commercial 
      properties having an aggregate principal balance of approximately $606.8 
      million as of the cut-off date. The loans were contributed to the trust 
      by Column Financial, Inc., Natixis Real Estate Capital LLC, and UBS AG, 
      New York Branch.
    

      Fitch reviewed a comprehensive sample of the transaction's collateral 
      including site inspections on 76.7% of the properties by balance, cash 
      flow analysis of 86.6%, and asset summary reviews on 86.6% of the pool.
    

      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    

      Fitch Leverage: The transaction has similar leverage to other recent 
      Fitch-rated transactions. The Fitch LTV for the trust of 106.8% is 
      slightly higher than the YTD 2016 average of 105.3%. The Fitch DSCR for 
      the trust of 1.23x is slightly higher than the YTD 2016 average of 
      1.20x. However, the Fitch leverage is lower when compared to the YTD 
      2016 average Fitch DSCR and LTV for Fitch-rated deals excluding 
      credit-opinion loans at 1.12x and 111.2%. The current transaction does 
      not include any credit-opinion loans.
    

      Highly Concentrated Pool: The pool size is relatively smaller by balance 
      and loan count at $606.8 million and 33, respectively. The top 10 loans 
      comprise 66.2% of the pool, which is greater than the recent averages of 
      54.9% for YTD 2016 and 49.3% for 2015. Additionally, the loan 
      concentration index (LCI) and sponsor concentration index (SCI) are 561 
      and 709, respectively, greater than the respective YTD 2016 averages of 
      423 and 495.
    

      Limited Amortization: Based on the scheduled balance at maturity, the 
      pool will pay down by only 9.3%, which is below the YTD 2016 average of 
      10.5%. Nine loans, representing 47.7% of the pool, are full-term 
      interest-only (including four loans comprising 21.9% of the pool which 
      have an anticipated repayment date [ARD] structure following the 
      interest-only term), and eight loans, representing 10.8% of the pool, 
      are partial interest only.
    

      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    

      For this transaction, Fitch's net cash flow (NCF) was 8.6% below the 
      most recent year's net operating income (NOI); for properties for which 
      a full-year NOI was provided, excluding properties that were stabilizing 
      during this period. Unanticipated further declines in property-level NCF 
      could result in higher defaults and loss severities on defaulted loans 
      and in potential rating actions on the certificates.
    

      Fitch evaluated the sensitivity of the ratings assigned to CSMC 
      2016-NXSR certificates and found that the transaction displays average 
      sensitivity to further declines in NCF. In a scenario in which NCF 
      declined a further 20% from Fitch's NCF, a downgrade of the junior 
      'AAAsf' certificates to 'Asf' could result. In a more severe scenario, 
      in which NCF declined a further 30% from Fitch's NCF, a downgrade of the 
      junior 'AAAsf' certificates to 'BBB+sf' could result. The presale report 
      includes a detailed explanation of additional stresses and sensitivities.
    

      USE OF THIRD-PARTY DUE DILIGENCE PURSUANT TO SEC RULE 17G-10
    

      Fitch was provided with third-party due diligence information from KPMG 
      LLP. The third-party due diligence information was provided on Form ABS 
      Due Diligence-15E and focused on a comparison and re-computation of 
      certain characteristics with respect to each of the 33 mortgage loans. 
      Fitch considered this information in its analysis and the findings did 
      not have an impact on the analysis. A copy of the ABS Due Diligence 
      Form-15E received by Fitch in connection with this transaction may be 
      obtained through the link contained on the bottom of the related rating 
      action commentary.
    

      REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES AND ENFORCEMENT MECHANISMS
    

      A description of the transaction's representations, warranties and 
      enforcement mechanisms (RW&Es) that are disclosed in the offering 
      document and which relate to the underlying asset pool is available by 
      accessing the appendix referenced under "Related Research" below. The 
      appendix also contains a comparison of these RW&Es to those Fitch 
      considers typical for the asset class as detailed in the Special Report 
      titled "Representations, Warranties and Enforcement Mechanisms in Global 
      Structured Finance Transactions," dated May 31, 2016.

      Copyright © 2016 by Fitch Ratings, Inc., Fitch Ratings Ltd. and its 
      subsidiaries. 33 Whitehall Street, NY, NY 10004. Telephone: 
      1-800-753-4824, (212) 908-0500. Fax: (212) 480-4435. Reproduction or 
      retransmission in whole or in part is prohibited except by permission. 
      All rights reserved. In issuing and maintaining its ratings and in 
      making other reports (including forecast information), Fitch relies on 
      factual information it receives from issuers and underwriters and from 
      other sources Fitch believes to be credible. Fitch conducts a reasonable 
      investigation of the factual information relied upon by it in accordance 
      with its ratings methodology, and obtains reasonable verification of 
      that information from independent sources, to the extent such sources 
      are available for a given security or in a given jurisdiction. The 
      manner of Fitch's factual investigation and the scope of the third-party 
      verification it obtains will vary depending on the nature of the rated 
      security and its issuer, the requirements and practices in the 
      jurisdiction in which the rated security is offered and sold and/or the 
      issuer is located, the availability and nature of relevant public 
      information, access to the management of the issuer and its advisers, 
      the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as audit 
      reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports, 
      engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third 
      parties, the availability of independent and competent third-party 
      verification sources with respect to the particular security or in the 
      particular jurisdiction of the issuer, and a variety of other factors. 
      Users of Fitch's ratings and reports should understand that neither an 
      enhanced factual investigation nor any third-party verification can 
      ensure that all of the information Fitch relies on in connection with a 
      rating or a report will be accurate and complete. Ultimately, the issuer 
      and its advisers are responsible for the accuracy of the information 
      they provide to Fitch and to the market in offering documents and other 
      reports. In issuing its ratings and its reports, Fitch must rely on the 
      work of experts, including independent auditors with respect to 
      financial statements and attorneys with respect to legal and tax 
      matters. Further, ratings and forecasts of financial and other 
      information are inherently forward-looking and embody assumptions and 
      predictions about future events that by their nature cannot be verified 
      as facts. As a result, despite any verification of current facts, 
      ratings and forecasts can be affected by future events or conditions 
      that were not anticipated at the time a rating or forecast was issued or 
      affirmed.
    

      The information in this report is provided "as is" without any 
      representation or warranty of any kind, and Fitch does not represent or 
      warrant that the report or any of its contents will meet any of the 
      requirements of a recipient of the report. A Fitch rating is an opinion 
      as to the creditworthiness of a security. This opinion and reports made 
      by Fitch are based on established criteria and methodologies that Fitch 
      is continuously evaluating and updating. Therefore, ratings and reports 
      are the collective work product of Fitch and no individual, or group of 
      individuals, is solely responsible for a rating or a report. The rating 
      does not address the risk of loss due to risks other than credit risk, 
      unless such risk is specifically mentioned. Fitch is not engaged in the 
      offer or sale of any security. All Fitch reports have shared authorship. 
      Individuals identified in a Fitch report were involved in, but are not 
      solely responsible for, the opinions stated therein. The individuals are 
      named for contact purposes only. A report providing a Fitch rating is 
      neither a prospectus nor a substitute for the information assembled, 
      verified and presented to investors by the issuer and its agents in 
      connection with the sale of the securities. Ratings may be changed or 
      withdrawn at any time for any reason in the sole discretion of Fitch. 
      Fitch does not provide investment advice of any sort. Ratings are not a 
      recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any security. Ratings do not 
      comment on the adequacy of market price, the suitability of any security 
      for a particular investor, or the tax-exempt nature or taxability of 
      payments made in respect to any security. Fitch receives fees from 
      issuers, insurers, guarantors, other obligors, and underwriters for 
      rating securities. Such fees generally vary from US$1,000 to US$750,000 
      (or the applicable currency equivalent) per issue. In certain cases, 
      Fitch will rate all or a number of issues issued by a particular issuer, 
      or insured or guaranteed by a particular insurer or guarantor, for a 
      single annual fee. Such fees are expected to vary from US$10,000 to 
      US$1,500,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent). The assignment, 
      publication, or dissemination of a rating by Fitch shall not constitute 
      a consent by Fitch to use its name as an expert in connection with any 
      registration statement filed under the United States securities laws, 
      the Financial Services and Markets Act of 2000 of the United Kingdom, or 
      the securities laws of any particular jurisdiction. Due to the relative 
      efficiency of electronic publishing and distribution, Fitch research may 
      be available to electronic subscribers up to three days earlier than to 
      print subscribers.
    

      For Australia, New Zealand, Taiwan and South Korea only: Fitch Australia 
      Pty Ltd holds an Australian financial services license (AFS license no. 
      337123) which authorizes it to provide credit ratings to wholesale 
      clients only. Credit ratings information published by Fitch is not 
      intended to be used by persons who are retail clients within the meaning

Commercial Mortgage Pass Through Certificates, Series 2016-NXSR.Fitch expects to rate the transaction and assign Rating Outlooks as follows:--$22,779,000 class A-1 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;--$85,980,000 class A-2 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;--$115,000,000 class A-3 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;--$174,907,000 class A-4 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;--$26,116,000 class A-SB 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;--$455,124,000(b) class X-A 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;--$30,324,000 class A-S 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;--$455,124,000(c) class V1-A 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;--$40,961,000 class B 'AA-sf'; Outlook Stable;--$40,961,000(b) class X-B 'AA-sf'; Outlook Stable;--$40,961,000(c) class V-1B 'AA-sf'; Outlook Stable;--$31,100,000 class C 'A-sf'; Outlook Stable;--$31,100,000(c) class V-1C 'A-sf'; Outlook Stable;--$31,100,000(a) class D 'BBB-sf'; Outlook Stable;--$31,100,000(a)(c) class V1-D 'BBB-sf'; Outlook Stable;--$18,963,000(a)(b) class X-E 'BB-sf'; Outlook Stable;--$6,827,000(a)(b) class X-F 'B-sf'; Outlook Stable;--$18,963,000(a) class E 'BB-sf'; Outlook Stable;--$6,827,000(a) class F 'B-sf'; Outlook Stable;(a) Privately placed and pursuant to Rule 144A.(b) Notional amount and interest-only.(c) Exchangeable certificatesThese expected ratings are based on information provided by the issuer as of Dec. 6, 2016.Fitch does not expect to rate the $22,757,039(a) class NR, $22,757,039(a)(b) class X-NR, $48,547,039(a)(c) class V-1E, and $606,832,040(a)(c) class V-2 certificates.The certificates represent the beneficial ownership interest in the trust, primary assets of which are 33 loans secured by 54 commercial properties having an aggregate principal balance of approximately $606.8 million as of the cut-off date. The loans were contributed to the trust by Column Financial, Inc., Natixis Real Estate Capital LLC, and UBS AG, New York Branch.Fitch reviewed a comprehensive sample of the transaction's collateral including site inspections on 76.7% of the properties by balance, cash flow analysis of 86.6%, and asset summary reviews on 86.6% of the pool.KEY RATING DRIVERSFitch Leverage: The transaction has similar leverage to other recent Fitch-rated transactions. The Fitch LTV for the trust of 106.8% is slightly higher than the YTD 2016 average of 105.3%. The Fitch DSCR for the trust of 1.23x is slightly higher than the YTD 2016 average of 1.20x. However, the Fitch leverage is lower when compared to the YTD 2016 average Fitch DSCR and LTV for Fitch-rated deals excluding credit-opinion loans at 1.12x and 111.2%. The current transaction does not include any credit-opinion loans.Highly Concentrated Pool: The pool size is relatively smaller by balance and loan count at $606.8 million and 33, respectively. The top 10 loans comprise 66.2% of the pool, which is greater than the recent averages of 54.9% for YTD 2016 and 49.3% for 2015. Additionally, the loan concentration index (LCI) and sponsor concentration index (SCI) are 561 and 709, respectively, greater than the respective YTD 2016 averages of 423 and 495.Limited Amortization: Based on the scheduled balance at maturity, the pool will pay down by only 9.3%, which is below the YTD 2016 average of 10.5%. Nine loans, representing 47.7% of the pool, are full-term interest-only (including four loans comprising 21.9% of the pool which have an anticipated repayment date [ARD] structure following the interest-only term), and eight loans, representing 10.8% of the pool, are partial interest only.RATING SENSITIVITIESFor this transaction, Fitch's net cash flow (NCF) was 8.6% below the most recent year's net operating income (NOI); for properties for which a full-year NOI was provided, excluding properties that were stabilizing during this period. Unanticipated further declines in property-level NCF could result in higher defaults and loss severities on defaulted loans and in potential rating actions on the certificates.Fitch evaluated the sensitivity of the ratings assigned to CSMC 2016-NXSR certificates and found that the transaction displays average sensitivity to further declines in NCF. In a scenario in which NCF declined a further 20% from Fitch's NCF, a downgrade of the junior 'AAAsf' certificates to 'Asf' could result. In a more severe scenario, in which NCF declined a further 30% from Fitch's NCF, a downgrade of the junior 'AAAsf' certificates to 'BBB+sf' could result. The presale report includes a detailed explanation of additional stresses and sensitivities.Read MoreUSE OF THIRD-PARTY DUE DILIGENCE PURSUANT TO SEC RULE 17G-10Fitch was provided with third-party due diligence information from KPMG LLP. The third-party due diligence information was provided on Form ABS Due Diligence-15E and focused on a comparison and re-computation of certain characteristics with respect to each of the 33 mortgage loans. Fitch considered this information in its analysis and the findings did not have an impact on the analysis. A copy of the ABS Due Diligence Form-15E received by Fitch in connection with this transaction may be obtained through the link contained on the bottom of the related rating action commentary.REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES AND ENFORCEMENT MECHANISMSA description of the transaction's representations, warranties and enforcement mechanisms (RW&Es) that are disclosed in the offering document and which relate to the underlying asset pool is available by accessing the appendix referenced under "Related Research" below. The appendix also contains a comparison of these RW&Es to those Fitch considers typical for the asset class as detailed in the Special Report titled "Representations, Warranties and Enforcement Mechanisms in Global Structured Finance Transactions," dated May 31, 2016.Additional information is available at www.fitchratings.com.Applicable CriteriaCounterparty Criteria for Structured Finance and Covered Bonds (pub. 01 Sep 2016)https://www.fitchratings.com/site/re/886006Criteria for Analyzing Multiborrower U.S. and Canadian Commercial Mortgage Transactions (pub. 01 Jul 2016)https://www.fitchratings.com/site/re/882237Criteria for Rating Caps and Limitations in Global Structured Finance Transactions (pub. 16 Jun 2016)https://www.fitchratings.com/site/re/882401Global Structured Finance Rating Criteria (pub. 27 Jun 2016)https://www.fitchratings.com/site/re/883130North America and Asia-Pacific Multiborrower CMBS Surveillance Criteria (pub. 01 Dec 2016)https://www.fitchratings.com/site/re/891159Rating Criteria for U.S. Commercial Mortgage Servicers (pub. 14 Feb 2014)https://www.fitchratings.com/site/re/735382Related ResearchCSMC 2016-NXSR -- Appendixhttps://www.fitchratings.com/site/re/891610Additional DisclosuresDodd-Frank Rating Information Disclosure Formhttps://www.fitchratings.com/creditdesk/press_releases/content/ridf_frame.cfm?pr_id=1016034ABS Due Diligence Form 15E 1https://www.fitchratings.com/creditdesk/press_releases/content/ridf15E_frame.cfm?pr_id=1016034&flm_nm=15e_1016034_1.pdfSolicitation Statushttps://www.fitchratings.com/gws/en/disclosure/solicitation?pr_id=1016034Endorsement Policyhttps://www.fitchratings.com/regulatoryALL FITCH CREDIT RATINGS ARE SUBJECT TO CERTAIN LIMITATIONS AND DISCLAIMERS.

For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

Kroll Bond Rating Agency Assigns Preliminary Ratings to CSMC 2016-NXSR

      Kroll Bond Rating Agency (KBRA) is pleased to announce the assignment of
      preliminary ratings to 19 classes of the CSMC 2016-NXSR transaction.
      CSMC 2016-NXSR is a $606.8 million CMBS conduit transaction
      collateralized by 33 commercial mortgage loans secured by 54 properties.
      On the securitization closing date, Natixis Real Estate Capital LLC
      intends to retain certificates representing 5.0% of the amount of each
      class of securities issued in the transaction in order to satisfy the
      definition of an “eligible vertical interest” under the US credit risk
      retention rules (as if such rules were applicable to this transaction).
    

      The properties in the collateral pool are located in 21 states, with
      three state exposures that each represents more than 10.0% of the pool
      balance: New York (21.4%), New Jersey (13.9%) and Illinois (12.4%). The
      pool has exposure to most of the major property type sectors, with four
      that each represent more than 10.0% of the pool balance: retail (37.7%),
      lodging (16.2%), office (16.2%), and mixed-use (13.6%). The loans have
      principal balances ranging from $2.3 million to $60.0 million for the
      largest loan in the pool, Novo Nordisk (9.9%), a 761,824 sf, Class-A
      suburban office complex located in Plainsboro Township, New Jersey. The
      five largest loans, which also include Rentar Plaza (9.9%), Gurnee Mills
      (9.9%), QLIC (8.2%), and Walgreens Portfolio I (5.4%), represent 43.2%
      of the initial pool balance, while the 10 largest loans represent 66.2%.
    

      KBRA’s analysis of the transaction incorporated our multi-borrower
      rating process that begins with our analysts’ evaluation of underlying
      collateral properties’ financial and operating performance, which
      determine KBRA’s estimate of sustainable net cash flow (KNCF) and KBRA
      value using our CMBS
      Property Evaluation Methodology. On an aggregate basis, KNCF was
      5.2% less than the issuer cash flow. KBRA capitalization rates were
      applied to each asset’s KNCF to derive values that were, on an aggregate
      basis, 39.8% less than third party appraisal values. The pool has an
      in-trust KLTV of 101.8% and an all-in KLTV of 103.7%. The model deploys
      rent and occupancy stresses, probability of default regressions, and
      loss given default calculations to determine losses for each collateral
      loan, which are then used to assign our credit ratings.
    

      For complete details on the analysis, please see our presale report, CSMC
      2016-NXSR published today at www.kbra.com.
      The report includes our KBRA
      Comparative Analytic Tool (KCAT), an easy to use, Excel based
      workbook that provides the following information:
    


        KBRA Deal Tape – Contains KBRA loan level details for every loan in
        the pool, and the ability for users to input adjustments to KNCF and
        KBRA Cap Rates and see the related impact on key deal metrics.
      

        KBRA Credit Metrics Comparison Tool – Enables the user to compare the
        subject transaction to a user-defined transaction comp set. The
        feature provides many of the fields that are provided in our CMBS
        Monthly Trend Watch publication.
      

        Excel based property cash flow statements for the top 20 loans.

You will need to pay a deposit of up to $1,000 when accepting the terms of any loan or line of credit.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
