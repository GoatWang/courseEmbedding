	  	Mr. John F. McManus
	  	
	  



















John F. McManus joined the staff of The John Birch Society in 1966. In 1973, Robert Welch, the Societyâs Founder, appointed him Director of Public Affairs. In this post, he became the Societyâs chief media representative throughout the nation and appeared on hundreds of radio and television programs.

Mr. McManus has written and produced numerous audio-visual programs, including the popular DVD Overview of America, which is a moving tribute about Americaâs Constitutional roots. He has also written several books including Financial Terrorism (1993), Changing Commands: The Betrayal of Americaâs Military (1995), William F. Buckley, Jr.: Pied Piper for the Establishment (2002), and The Insiders 5th Edition (2004). He is in wide demand as a speaker.

He is a regular contributor of articles to The New American, JBS Blog, and JBS Bulletin. Mr. McManus was named president of The John Birch Society in 1991, then president emeritus in 2016.

Description


Product Details




                    The solitude and quiet peace of a flickering candle has long been a symbol of remembrance.
The Memorial Candle Program has been designed to help offset the costs associated with hosting this Tribute 
Website in perpetuity. Through the lighting of a memorial candle, your thoughtful gesture will be recorded
 and the proceeds will go directly towards helping ensure that the 
family and friends of John Thomas McManus can continue to memorialize, re-visit, interact with each 
other and enhance this tribute for future generations.

                



Candle will be lit for the limited time of one month


Candle will be lit for the limited time of one year


Candle will be lit indefinitely

Candle message preserved on the memorial site for perpetuity
