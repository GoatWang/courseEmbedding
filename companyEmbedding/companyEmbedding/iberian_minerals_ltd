Iberian Minerals Ltd.



03/07/2017 | Press release | Distributed by Public on 03/06/2017 20:56
Iberian Minerals Corporate Update







      TSXV: IML OTCQB: SLDRF
    

      For Immediate Release
    

      Iberian Minerals CEO Provides Corporate Update
    

      Edmonton, Alberta- March 7, 2017 - Iberian Minerals Ltd. (the "Company" or "Iberian") (TSX Venture: IML) (OTCQB: SLDRF), an innovative developer and provider of environmentally-friendly advanced gold mining extraction technologies, today released a Corporate Update from Greg Pendura, its CEO.


      Dear investors and fellow shareholders;
    

      Updates on our Spanish assets will be addressed shortly. I want to focus this Corporate update on the anticipated spin- out of our EnviroLeach subsidiary to enable everyone to fully understand and appreciate the future working relationship between Iberian Minerals/Mineworx and EnviroLeach and the significant benefits that both companies and our shareholders will experience with this alliance. It is an exciting time for Iberian. The company continues to cultivate and develop strong relationships with advanced stage mining companies with the goal to become a near-term, cost effective and profitable gold producer utilizing our proprietary technologies.
    

      With the spin-out of our EnviroLeach subsidiary, Iberian's wholly owned subsidiary - Mineworx will hold an exclusive license in perpetuity to use the EnviroLeach, patent-pending, non-cyanide gold leaching process. The EnviroLeach process will become a valued added innovation to Iberian's existing business model, which currently features the Mineworx, patent-pending HM X-tract and HM X-mill technologies.
    

      Mineworx Business Model
    

      The unique Mineworx business model is to seek out advanced-stage mineral deposits on which to employ its portable processing technologies and to partner with the existing owners and operators to advance these deposits to profitable production in a timely manner.
    

      In addition, Mineworx will become the exclusive technology/systems integrator for the continued design, development and installation of the EnviroLeach process pilot plants and full-scale production facilities. This relationship will leverage and extend the Iberian team's expertise in design-build capabilities to the development of specialized industrial modular process systems and facility construction for the deployment of EnviroLeach systems globally in both the mining and E- Waste management sectors. We are confident that this new "green" initiative will drive new immediate and long term revenue channels to Iberian.


      Our aggressive plans for 2017 encompass steps to attain near-term cash flow and enhance growth in both the mining and technology divisions. Iberian will continue to build a portfolio of near-term, small to mid-sized mining assets which will utilize our environmentally friendly and proprietary extraction technologies. In addition further benefits will result from the exposure to the E-Waste management sector resulting in the additional revenue streams from our new technology integration division.
    

      Iberian continues to be an early and primary mover in these areas with patent pending and proprietary environmentally friendly mobile extraction and grinding technologies. With few competitors or competition in these areas currently, these advantages will act as a barrier to entry for future competitors.
    

      After receiving the anticipated shareholder voting approvals at the upcoming March 14th Special Meeting, Iberian will engage in the spin-out of its subsidiary, EnviroLeach Technologies Inc. This transaction will result in the Iberian shareholders receiving approximately one share of EnviroLeach for every 10 shares of Iberian owned. Iberian will also receive 2 million shares of EnviroLeach, cash payments of $1.6 million and the exclusive license to continually use the EnviroLeach product along with any enhancements on all present and future Iberian/Mineworx mining projects. The Company will provide a further update on the anticipated EnviroLeach stock exchange listings for our Canadian and U.S. shareholders very shortly.
    

      This transaction has been carefully evaluated by the Board of Directors and is considered favorable to Iberian and the shareholders of Iberian for numerous reasons, including:
    



          attractive and immediate value to the Iberian shareholders
        



          enhanced business model
        



          less dilution of ownership
        



          less dilutive risk exposure
        



          enhanced diversity of holdings
        



          more favorable and less dilutive financing terms
        



          enhanced liquidity of both companies
        



          more focused business units
        



          higher valuations for both companies due to the variance of sector specific valuation metrics
        



          the broadening of the potential shareholder base of EnviroLeach to include a larger base of non-mining centric funds.
        

          The benefits to Iberian/Mineworx include:
        



          enhanced business model
        



          diminished industry specific risk
        



          leverage of existing technology and teams
        



          exposure to the growing E-Waste sector
        



          increased revenues and enhanced market valuation metrics.

By diverting surface water and pumping groundwater, mining operations can reduce both the quantity and quality of water available downstream for aquatic ecosystems and other industrial and municipal water users, especially in areas with arid climates. In response to water scarcity in many mining regions, Mineworx is working on developing technologies for innovative water conservation practices to help reduce water use.Innovations that Respect CommunitiesIberian Minerals and Mineworx is dedicated to partnering with local communities and businesses to contribute to their economic and institutional development.Efficient MiningIberian Minerals and Mineworx are committed to supporting the sustainability of the natural environment, the people who rely on that environment and to ensuring the health and safety of our workforce and the communities in which we operate.Restoring environmental function at mine sitesMining is a relatively temporary activity, and mine sites have finite operating lives which are determined by the size and quality of the ore deposit being mined.

 Stock Analyses:






























Iberian Minerals Ltd (TSX: IML)

 Home > Iberian Minerals Ltd (TSX: IML)













Aug 3, 2016 @ 4:14pm: CAD$0.075

 







With a market cap of approximately USD$15 million, Iberian Minerals (TSX:IML) has the potential for price explosion. The company Iberian Minerals has a misleading name (in my view) because the greatest value I see in the company is in a wholly-owned subsidiary called MineWorX. MineWorX Technologies owns patent-pending gold-mining and extraction processes. Their technology has the potential to lower costs, reduce pollution, reduce the time for permitting and increase the concentration of metal extracted from ore in a shorter period of time than current extraction technologies. Their technologies could improve the profitability for tens of thousands of existing mines across North America and the world and allow thousands of currently-unprofitable mines to be reopened and operated profitably.





















This company has a USD$15 million market cap: if it were a sure thing, the market cap would be, I’m guessing, in the hundreds of millions. Whether their technologies will work or not must be considered entirely speculative until they are proven. This company offers the potential for tremendous profits, and it is also entirely speculative. I like the management.

(VPG), who are currently operating a hard rock gold processing plant on location. The historic gold property is approximately 275 contiguous acres and located at Wickenburg, Arizona, approximately 70 miles northwest of Phoenix.
