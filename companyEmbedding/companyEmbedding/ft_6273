The rug  we received looked nothing like this.  It was totally red. I took it to Home Depot to return and they talked with the HD warehouse and it was reported that this rug is no longer being manufactured.  Yet the rug we received is not on the website.   Therefore we returned the rug.  Why would HD have a rug like the one above of their website and discontinue it.  This makes for poor merchandising and customer service.

Excellent printing quality is obtained due to high clarity and better layout.Himod FT6273 is intended for applications like: fine shrink films with higher stiffness and transparency, stiff films with excellent optical properties for automated packaging machinery, and lamination film/food packaging.Information provided by the Manufacturer.

                    Come and see the historic and cute boutique like style of old town, Kapaa.  Lined with coconut trees and boutique shops and restaurants this quant little town is my home.  I grew up on the East side of Kauai, the Kapaa area.  Kapaa is central and is convenient to the main city of Li'hue as well as a direct drive to the nostalgic North Shore where the infamous  Hanalei bay lies and the fabulous five star hotel, The St. Regis.

                    Kapaa, also spelled Kapa'a, means "solid" in Hawaiian. Travelers find this small town, nestled at the base of Nounou (the Sleeping Giant) Mountain on Kauai tourist friendly with its diverse array of hotels, shopping centers, and restaurants. The Kinipopo Shopping Village is a favorite for its fun eateries and small keepsake shops. Look for the "Kauai Made" logo for products made by local craftsmen using traditional materials.
