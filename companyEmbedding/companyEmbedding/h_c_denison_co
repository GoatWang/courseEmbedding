 SERVICE  • INTEGRITY

            EXPERIENCE
We take our company motto
            very seriously and strive to
            meet it daily. H. C. Denison Company
            is a small, independent brokerage
            firm in an industry dominated by
            gigantic competitors.
            This unique position offers
          numerous benefits to investors. 






















H.C. Denison Co. History




















As the 
            oldest independently owned, full line  investment 
            firm based in Wisconsin today, H.C. Denison provides uniquely 
            personalized service to its clients, regardless of the size and 
            value of their portfolio. Direct access to its clients account 
            information allows for consistent review, thorough cost basis 
            analysis, personalized distribution of income, and a 
            multi-generational approach to asset preservation. The firm helps 
            each client define their needs and goals, then picks investments to 
            match their objectives. Through constant monitoring of tax law and 
            market changes, H.C. Denison keeps its clients informed so they can 
            update their portfolio as needed to preserve their assets.
In 
            an era when many other investment firms have merged, been consumed 
            by larger firms, or reinvented their identities, H.C. Denison Co. is 
            proud to be serving fifth generation accounts under the same 
            respected name as it celebrates its 80th anniversary in business. 
            Chairman Konrad Testwuide describes the key operating philosophy 
            valued by the firm: H.C. Denison can better serve its customers by 
            remaining independent and providing an environment where the client 
            can still talk personally with the owner. Innovation has been a 
            constant in H.C. Denison Co.s history. For example, in 1986, nearly 
            14 years prior to Y2K, James Testwuide made a visionary leadership 
            decision: to establish a clear route to Y2K compatibility. That 
            investment was well worth its return in terms of efficiency and 
            client satisfaction. The company has moved forward with proprietary 
            customized software which provides quick access to information for 
            efficient, effective asset management. Yet, despite its commitment 
            to technology, personal contact is still valued by the company: a 
            friendly human voice answers the phone every day at H.C. Denison 
            Co.
James Testwuide sums up H.C. Denisons commitment 
            to its clients in these words: Weve learned from the past, and 
            will mine the experience of our rich history to help our clients 
            prosper. We will eagerly approach the challenges of the future, 
            while remaining cognizant that our clients opportunities for 
            success lie in the present. We hope you will join us and become a 
            part of our history.
Member SIPC • Member FINRA


As we 
            celebrate our 80th anniversary in business in an environment of 
            uncertain financial conditions, one thing is certain: H.C. Denison 
            Co. will continue to provide sound investment advice for the 
            conservative needs of our valued clients.
