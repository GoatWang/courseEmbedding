The living room is an important hub of the home. At the end of a long day, the whole family often congregates there to do homework, read, watch TV or play. Even though it's often a large space, it can be challenging to create a room that accommodates all the necessities. Fortunately, making the right purchases, thinking creatively about storage and reconsidering the layout can help make your  living room functional and aesthetically pleasing. More

Invest in some double-duty furniture.When the space you have isn’t quite enough, it’s important to find furniture that has more than one purpose. Adding double-duty pieces is a great way to conserve room and save money, especially with a large or growing family. Instead of buying a traditional sofa, invest in a sofa bed or daybed for overnight guests. Find an ottoman with hidden storage that can act as extra seating, as well as stash extra blankets and throws. Finally, benches with room for wicker baskets and bins help with organization and seating, too.Take advantage of your entire family room layout.The center of a living room is often filled with sofas, armchairs, area rugs and coffee tables, so use the room’s corners to create individual nooks. In one corner, place a chaise lounge, side table and table lamp for the readers in the family. In another corner, place a small computer table and laptop for gaming and homework. And for the adults, use one corner to house a bar cart stocked with all the essentials.Go big with built-ins.As one of the most frequently used rooms in the house, living rooms often collect an abundance of books, electronics and knickknacks. Avoid turning it into a glorified storage unit by splurging on built-ins. Although they might be pricey, built-in cabinets, shelves and entertainment centers provide plenty of storage and give the impression of an organized, put-together room (even if that’s not the case). Built-ins also save space, so you won’t have to worry about finding room for a bookshelf, sideboard or media console.Offer plenty of alternative seating.When you have a large group over during holidays or special events, it’s key to have enough seating for everyone. For a space-efficient option, use small ottomans, poufs and cubes, or even floor cushions and pillows when the crowd is extra large. Store benches along the perimeter of the room so they’re easy to grab and move during a party, and ensure you have a basic sofa (or two) and armchairs. For even more seating, store folding chairs in a nearby closet or take chairs from the dining room.Bring in  decorative accessories.There’s no need to skimp on the accessories, even when space is limited. Small things, such as colorful throw pillows, soft throws, shiny candleholders and trendy trays, can pack a very large punch and can help your space feel like home. Picture frames and wall art are great ways to personalize a room, and area rugs and curtains can add larger pops of color.

Do you want something that can double as a focal point? If so, find something with exposed wood and less padding, or a piece upholstered in a unique materials, such as a vibrant velvet. Do you want to sink into your new  seat with a glass of wine at the end of a long day? If relaxation is your main goal, you’ll want a design where comfort is key — think thick cushions, wide armrests, or even a giant papasan chair. Consider the following types of chairs for your home:Armchairs: Just like the name says, these feature two arms, and are synonymous with comfy living room chairs. They come in many styles, but the most common are the soft and inviting oversized chairs that sport substantial armrests. These are perfect for curling up in, and can be super conducive to getting lost in a good book. Smaller models, like barrel or club chairs, can be a great way to incorporate that same cozy feeling in a slightly more formal way.Armless Chairs: No arms required for these guys. If you’ve got a tighter space but still want to add a functional accent piece, a parsons, side or slipper chair should fit the bill.  You can find them upholstered or not, and while they are generally simple designs, more intricate styles are available.  Wingback Chairs: The high sides and back of a wing chair were originally intended to protect the sitter from drafts or help trap in heat from a fireplace (which explains why it’s often pictured near one). Now its bold design serves as more of a statement and less of a functional element. Its close relative, the balloon chair, features a similar high-back design with a partially enclosed half-dome shape that would protect its occupant just the same.Egg Chairs: The modern futuristic look of this iconic style, created by Arne Jacobsen in 1958, is sure to be a showstopper. It’s been said the design of the egg chair was inspired by the popular womb chair; both styles feature womb-like shapes and round, modern curves. Its cousin, the swan chair, is a smaller, less encompassing version, but will bring an equally modern and fun look to any room.How big should my accent chair be?This depends on where you plan to put it. Determining the size is all about understanding scale — if it’s going in a spacious living room, a larger armchair will work, but if it’s going into a tight guest bedroom or a corner, consider one of smaller stature, such as a slipper chair or a corner chair. In addition, keep in mind the other furnishings in the room so that the size of your new piece works with them, not against them.What  upholstery material should I consider?In many cases, upholstered chairs tend to be accent pieces, so it may be fun to use a patterned fabric or bold color to make a statement. Cotton and polyester designs usually come in the widest variety of colors and patterns, but might not be the winners if you’re looking for fabrics that are easy to clean. If your style is more easy-going and classic, consider leather or microfiber; both are fairly easy to clean and will withstand wear-and-tear over time. Always take your climate into account as well when choosing an upholstered chair — for example,  leather chairs may not be the best choice for hot sticky climates.Should I pair my  living room chair with an ottoman?Ottomans and footstools are great for kicking back and relaxing, and work well if your  armchair falls in line with a more casual, lounging style. Think along the lines of a leather chair and ottoman tucked in the corner by a cozy fireplace. If it’s too formal, a footrest may seem out of place. You’ll always need to consider space: Will there still be sufficient room for pathways and access to the chair itself? If so, your next step will be to make sure to get the height and width right. To maximize comfort, both pieces should be of similar width, with the footstool being as high as or slightly lower than the seat height. Ideally, you should try to coordinate the pieces by matching color, material or pattern.United StatesUnited StatesUnited KingdomAustraliaDeutschlandFranceРоссия日本ItaliaEspañaDanmarkSverigeIrelandSingaporeNew ZealandIndiaCOMPANYAbout HouzzIn the NewsPress InfoCareersContact UsTerms & PrivacyCopyright & TrademarkEXPLORE HOUZZButtons & BadgesMobile AppsAdvertiseFor ProfessionalsSell on HouzzWrite a ReviewFAQsCONNECT WITH USHouzz BlogTwitterFacebookGoogle+YouTubeRSSUnited KingdomAustraliaDeutschlandFranceРоссия日本ItaliaEspañaDanmarkSverigeIrelandSingaporeNew ZealandIndia© 2017 Houzz Inc.

Sell on Houzz - Learn MoreWhat kind of accent chairs do I need?There are many different styles, so finding the right one to fit in the right spot can be a daunting task. Before shopping for new seating, get a feel for what you're looking for. Are you trying to round out your living room set? Comfort is key, so look for an wingback, chaise lounge or recliner. Want to fill that empty corner in your dining room (and also have additional dining room seating on hand)? Opt for a more casual side or accent chair. Looking for really relax in your bedroom or nursery? Gliders and rockers will put you to sleep in no time. Once you figure out its function, it's easy to narrow down your options.What style chairs work for my space?As you pick out the pattern, color and material, start by understanding what you like and what will blend in (or stand out) in your current  decor. A tufted or wingback club chair gives off an elegant, sophisticated vibe, while an piece with nailhead details or chevron pattern is more contemporary. Bring a pop of color to your space with a bright or multicolored option, or add some much-needed pattern in an all-white room. You can also add style by experimenting with material. Leather and wood are classic options, while an upholstered or plastic piece can veer more modern, depending on the other finishes. When it comes to material, you want to think about both practicality and design; after all, wood and plastic are more durable when little kids or pets are involved since they're easy to wipe up and hard to ruin.How do I determine whether a recliner or chair is ergonomically correct?Most often, this applies to office chairs where people spend hours sitting. However, any piece that you spend time in should be ergonomically appropriate. To start, test out all options you’re considering for purchase — your body will innately know whether it’s right for you or not. If it feels good, check out the back support, particularly for kitchen or dining room options that are generally more upright. The lower portion should provide support while being slightly curved to follow the contour of your spine. As for the seat, it should feel comfortable when you first sit down and stay that way for several hours. There should be at least an inch of space between your body and the sides of the furniture to allow for some movement. If you’re looking for an option with arms, make sure their height is proportionate to your body. If they’re too high, you’ll have trouble relaxing your shoulders while your arms are resting.

About       Darrell Green Autographed Memorabilia & Collectibles
Darrell Green is a former player of the NFL that is largely recognized for his time as a member of the Redskins. Green was a cornerback for the Washington Redskins from 1983 to 2002, during which he created an unforgettable football legacy. Viewed as one of the greatest cornerbacks in football history, Darrell Green was enshrined in the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2008.
As one of the Redskins all-time greatest players in history, Darrell Green is often known as the “Ageless Wonder” for playing at a high ability all throughout his career. During his time in the NFL, he was a seven-time Pro Bowl selection, won three NFC championships, and took home two Super Bowl Championships, making Darrell Green memorabilia a treasure for any football fan. Bringing much success to the Redskins he was inducted into the Redskins Ring of Fame and products with a Darrell Green autograph are an absolute must for any collection dedicated to the team. If you're a die-hard Redskins fan, show your team pride with a unique Darrell Green signed helmet or autographed Darrell Green jersey to support Washington football wherever displayed. Collectors can also preserve iconic moments from football history with signed Darrell Green photos or a Darrell Green autographed football.
Autographed Darrell Green memorabilia makes the perfect gift for any sports fan or a valuable addition to any football collection. If you are an avid fan of Green and the Redskins, be sure to check out more football collectibles signed by other stars from the team, like John Riggins and Joe Theismann.
