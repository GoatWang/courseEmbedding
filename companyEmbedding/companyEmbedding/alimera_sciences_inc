Beware of Fraudulent Recruitment Scams




					How do you identify recruitment fraud?
					





The perpetrators often ask recipients to complete fraudulent recruitment documentation, such as application forms, terms and conditions of employment or visa forms.
The Alimera Sciences logo may be featured on the documentation and it may contain names of real Alimera employees.
There is frequently an early request for personal information such as address details, date of birth, resume, passport details, bank details, etc.
Candidates are requested to contact other companies/individuals such as lawyers, bank officials, travel agencies, courier companies, visa/immigration processing agencies etc.
Email correspondence is often sent to and from free web email accounts such as Yahoo, Gmail, Hotmail, Outlook, etc.
The perpetrators frequently use mobile telephone numbers instead of official company numbers.
The perpetrators may ask the candidate to pay a fee for travel, accommodations, visa applications, etc.
There is an insistence on urgency for the applicant to act on the correspondence received.







					What should you do?
					





Save the original and complete emails/messages from the perpetrator.
Contact your local police or legal authority and provide them with all information you have to aid investigation.
Do not respond to unsolicited business propositions or offers of employment from unfamiliar people.
Do not disclose your personal or financial details to anyone you do not know.
Do not send any money or transfer payments. Alimera does not ask for any form of payment from applicants to secure a job.

A A A
Management TeamAlimera’s management team has a proven track record of product discovery, development and revenue growth in the ophthalmic pharmaceutical industry. Prior to founding Alimera, many members of the management team established CIBA Vision Ophthalmics, later Novartis Ophthalmics, the ophthalmic pharmaceutical arm of Novartis Corporation.
Since the founding of Alimera Sciences, the management team has raised approximately $145 million through private capital and completed a public offering in June 2010 for $72 million to invest in our products. With the substantial financial backing of our initial investors and public market shareholders, we have accomplished a great deal in a short time frame:

Launched Soothe®, an over-the-counter (OTC) product that provides unique relief to sufferers of dry eye
Gained FDA NDA approval for an Rx-to-OTC switch anti-allergy product (now marketed by Bausch and Lomb as Alaway® – ketotifen fumarate ophthalmic solution)
Completed two Phase 3 clinical trials with ILUVIEN® studying the long-term delivery of a low dose of a steroid for the treatment of diabetic macular edema
ILUVIEN has received FDA approval in the United States for the treatment of diabetic macular edema (DME) in patients who have been previously treated with a course of corticosteroids and did not have a clinically significant rise in intraocular pressure.
ILUVIEN has also been granted marketing authorizations in Austria, Belgium, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Spain, Sweden and the United Kingdom as “ILUVIEN® 190 micrograms intravitreal implant in applicator”, for the treatment of vision impairment associated with chronic diabetic macular edema (DME) considered insufficiently responsive to available therapies.Learn More >>
Developed a pipeline for the future success of Alimera Sciences

The executive team’s operational experience, regulatory expertise, clinical knowledge and industry relationships have coalesced into immediate success and built the foundation for a strong future.

Product Overview | Alimera Sciences




































Alimera Sciences




 











A A A
Product OverviewAt Alimera Sciences, we are dedicated to developing innovative, vision-improving treatments for diseases of the retina. Our commitment to retina specialists and their patients is manifest in our development portfolio, studying compounds to treat early- and late-stage diseases such as diabetic macular edema, wet and dry age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and retinal vein occlusion (RVO).
Today, our primary focus is on ILUVIEN®(fluocinolone acetonide intravitreal implant) 0.19 mg.  ILUVIEN is an intravitreal implant of fluocinolone acetonide and is the first DME treatment to deliver 36 months of continuous, low-dose corticosteroid with a single injection.1
Fluocinolone acetonide is a corticosteroid, which may play an important role in addressing the inflammatory process associated with DME. Corticosteroids have been shown to inhibit inflammatory responses to a variety of inciting agents. They inhibit edema, fibrin deposition, capillary dilation, leukocyte migration, capillary proliferation, fibroblast proliferation, deposition of collagen, and scar formation associated with inflammation.1
ILUVIEN has received FDA approval in the United States for the treatment of diabetic macular edema (DME) in patients who have been previously treated with a course of corticosteroids and did not have a clinically significant rise in intraocular pressure.1  Learn More
ILUVIEN has also received marketing authorization approvals in Austria, Belgium, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Spain, Sweden and the United Kingdom.
In addition to activities related to the development of ILUVIEN, we are researching the safety and effectiveness of NADPH (Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide Phosphate) oxidase inhibitors. Learn more >>
 
INDICATION
ILUVIEN® (fluocinolone acetonide intravitreal implant) 0.19 mg is indicated for the treatment of diabetic macular edema in patients who have been previously treated with a course of corticosteroids and did not have a clinically significant rise in intraocular pressure.
 
ILUVIEN® IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION
 CONTRAINDICATIONS

ILUVIEN is contraindicated in patients with active or suspected ocular or periocular infections including most viral diseases of the cornea and conjunctiva including active epithelial herpes simplex keratitis (dendritic keratitis), vaccinia, varicella, mycobacterial infections and fungal diseases.
ILUVIEN is contraindicated in patients with glaucoma, who have cup to disc ratios of greater than 0.8.
ILUVIEN is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to any components of this product.

 
WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS

Intravitreal injections have been associated with endophthalmitis, eye inflammation, increased intraocular pressure, and retinal detachments. Patients should be monitored following the intravitreal injection.
Use of corticosteroids may produce posterior subcapsular cataracts, increased intraocular pressure, glaucoma, and may enhance the establishment of secondary ocular infections due to bacteria, fungi, or viruses. Corticosteroids are not recommended to be used in patients with a history of ocular herpes simplex because of the potential for reactivation of the viral infection.
Patients in whom the posterior capsule of the lens is absent or has a tear are at risk of implant migration into the anterior chamber.

 
ADVERSE REACTIONS

In controlled studies, the most common adverse reactions reported were cataract development and increases in intraocular pressure.

Alimera Sciences, Inc. is a biopharmaceutical company based in Alpharetta, Georgia that specializes in the research, development and commercialization of prescription ophthalmic pharmaceuticals. Their main focus is on diseases affecting the back of the eye, or retina.[1]
History[edit]
Alimera was founded in June 2003 by Dan Myers, Daniel White, Dave Holland and Mark Testerman. Three of the founders were previously part of Ciba Vision Ophthalmics, which was renamed Novartis Ophthalmics following a merger.[2]
In 2004, Alimera Sciences introduced Soothe Emollient (Lubricant) Eye Drops for people with dry eyes. Soothe was the first lubricant eye drop to feature Restoryl,[3] a lipid restorative that works to re-establish the lipid (oily) layer of tears, promoting sustained moisture retention. Soothe was a mineral oil in water emulsion developed by Chris Brancewicz (then at Clarkson University) for Ocular Research of Boston during 1996-2001. Soothe was sold to Bausch & Lomb in August 2007.[4]
In 2006, Alimera Sciences developed and submitted for U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval an application for a prescription to over-the-counter drug switch of 0.025% ketotifen fumarate, for the temporary relief of ocular itch. This product, Alaway, was approved by the FDA in December 2006[5] and was sold along with a potential future line extension to Bausch & Lomb, which began marketing Alaway in Spring 2007.[3]
Alimera conducted two Phase 3 pivotal clinical trials (collectively known as the FAME Study) for ILUVIEN involving 956 patients in sites across the United States, Canada, Europe and India to assess the efficacy and safety of ILUVIEN at two dose levels.[6] ILUVIEN is a sustained release intravitreal implant that delivers sub-microgram levels of fluocinolone acetonide (FAc) for 36 months. The company submitted the ILUVIEN New Drug Application (NDA) to the FDA in June 2010 and was granted priority review in August 2010.[7] In December 2010, November 2011, and October 2013 the FDA issued Complete Response Letters (CRL) stating that it was unable to approve a NDA for ILUVIEN.[8] Alimera met with the FDA in December 2013 and entered into labeling discussions. As a result, the company plans to refile with the FDA in early 2014.
In July 2010, a Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) for ILUVIEN was submitted to seven European countries via the Decentralized Regulatory Procedure (DCP) with the United Kingdom’s Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) serving as the Reference Member State (RMS). The six Concerned Member States (CMS) include Austria, France, Germany, Italy, Spain and Portugal.[9]
In February 2012, based on a consensus arrived upon by the RMS and the CMS, the MHRA issued its Final Assessment Report that ILUVIEN is approvable. The company was tasked with seeking individual marketing authorizations in each of the seven countries.[10] As of January 2014, ILUVIEN has been approved in Austria, France, Germany, Portugal, Spain, and the U.K. for the treatment of vision impairment associated with chronic DME considered insufficiently responsive to available therapies. In April 2013, Alimera began selling ILUVIEN in Germany and the UK, and intends to begin selling in France in 2014. ILUVIEN is available through the U.K. National Health Service. Alimera has filed with the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency in the U.K. as the Reference Member State for 10 additional European Union (EU) country approvals through the Mutual Recognition Procedure.[11]

Alimera Sciences: 2017 Outlook - Alimera Sciences, Inc. (NASDAQ:ALIM) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»Alimera Sciences: 2017 OutlookFeb.10.17 | About: Alimera Sciences, (ALIM) ONeil Trader Growth, momentum, small-cap, mid-capMarketplaceGrowth Stock ForumSummaryAlimera made insufficient progress to move the stock higher in 2016.Iluvien's quarterly growth is still lumpy but trending higher.Estimating this year's top line growth.Increasing institutional ownership a very good sign.Alimera (NASDAQ:ALIM) made some progress in 2016, but it was insufficient to move the stock higher in a really tough environment for biotech/pharma stocks. Iluvien's quarterly growth trends are still lumpy, but sales are generally trending in the right direction. This article takes a look at Q3 growth trends, the company's growth initiatives and provides a 2017 outlook. I will also discuss institutional ownership changes. Seasonality and distributor inventories impact Q2 and Q3 sales Alimera had a big sequential jump in net sales in Q2 followed by a dip in Q3. The company explained on the Q3 call that Q2 sales were inflated by a distributor inventory buildup and that end-user demand was actually slightly higher in Q3 compared to Q2. The company also noted that there was some seasonal weakness in early Q3 and that Iluvien sales dropped substantially in July, followed by a strong recovery in August and September. Management said that August and September were two of the three strongest months in 2016 (not counting Q4, since we still don't have the numbers). 

 Source: Alimera earnings reports I did some back of the envelope calculations and concluded that Iluvien sales in the U.S. were probably around $2.5 million in September, which translates into a $7.5 million quarterly run rate. And if we assume sales have grown month-over-month in Q4, I (conservatively) estimate U.S. sales in Q4 in the $7.5-8.5 million range. International sales are still lumpy due to the softness in the U.K., where Iluvien's reimbursement is restricted to patients who already had cataract surgery, so I assume we will see flat or slightly higher sequential sales in Q4.
 

 Source: Alimera earnings reports Based on these projections, I expect Q4 sales in the $9.5-11 million range. The analyst estimate range is $9-10.8 million and the consensus is at $10 million. 2017 outlook There are several things to consider before making this year's growth estimates: - International growth should finally pick up. Alimera saw six consecutive quarters of growth in Germany and sales in Portugal are showing strong Y/Y growth. As mentioned, U.K. is still soft due to restricted reimbursement, but the company noted that the situation is getting better. Alimera expects to engage with NICE in order to try to expand reimbursement in 2017, and if it succeeds, we should see a solid increase in sales in the U.K. later this year. Iluvien was also launched in Ireland and the Middle East in Q4 2016 and a launch in Italy should occur by mid-2017 by Alimera's partner SIFI. The company is still negotiating in France where pricing is an issue and we may not see a launch there at all if the two sides don't come to terms. - Alimera had a significant presence at EURETINA conference (the largest retina conference in Europe) in Copenhagen, Europe, in September 2016, and at the American Academy of Ophthalmology in October 2016. The company presented real world data from the use of Iluvien in the EU, which showed an even better experience than in clinical trials. Intraocular pressure (IOP) is a concern for physicians and patients. The real world data suggests the numbers are significantly lower than observed in clinical trials, which bodes well for Iluvien's uptake going forward. The company's presence at these conferences should also help with Iluvien's uptake in 2017. 


 Source: Alimera investor presentation - Since Iluvien is administered just once every three years, it takes time for physicians to see the product's efficacy and safety. We are now more than two years into the launch in the United States, and physicians will now have enough data and confidence to use the product in more patients, but I suspect this is more of a 2018/2019 catalyst, which is the time Alimera will have enough real world data in the U.S. to promote the product's benefits. I continue to expect more robust growth in the U.S. than outside of the U.S. due to Iluvien's broader label in the U.S. With all of this in mind, my revenue estimate range for 2017 is between $50 million and $56 million, while the analyst consensus is $55.2 million. There are a lot of moving parts and I see the potential for sales to exceed $60 million if everything goes well - if U.S. sales exceed expectations, if reimbursement gets expanded in the U.K., and if we see a launch in Italy and France.    Iluvien Net Sales Estimates  Period Low End High End   Q4 2016 $9,500 $11,000   Q1 2017 $10,000 $11,000   Q2 2017 $12,500 $14,000   Q3 2017 $13,000 $14,500   Q4 2017 $14,500 $16,500   FY 2017 $50,000 $56,000   Source: author's estimates and calculations Management expects expenses to stay roughly the same as in 2016, which means cash expenses will be $13-14 million a quarter in 2017. Based on my revenue projections, Alimera should reach cash flow positive status in Q3 or Q4 2017. If/once it does, the company will probably initiate a label-expansion trial in one of the two targeted indications. The company has enough cash on hand to reach the cash flow breakeven point and I do not anticipate additional dilution or funding issues. Rising institutional sponsorship a big positive for Alimera Institutional ownership has significantly increased in Q3, which is the consequence of the equity offering in August 2016. It is good to see familiar names and it is especially encouraging to see additional accumulation in Q4 2016 and early 2017 (based on 13G filings). Listed below are the funds that specialize in biotech/pharma and the ownership changes.
 

 Source: WhaleWisdom, Alimera SEC filings The five funds on the list purchased around 25 million shares since Q2 2016 (as a reminder, the August offering size was 18.9 million shares). Conclusion 2017 could be a breakout year for Alimera. U.S. sales should continue to grow and international sales could finally pick up due to the expansion in Ireland, the Middle East, and, hopefully, in Italy and France. The company should reach cash flow positive status in 2H 2017 and initiate a label-expansion trial which should expand Iluvien's addressable market in 2020's. Execution is the main risk to the thesis and disappointing sales will probably keep the share price depressed.

Beware of Fraudulent Recruitment Scams




					How do you identify recruitment fraud?
					





The perpetrators often ask recipients to complete fraudulent recruitment documentation, such as application forms, terms and conditions of employment or visa forms.
The Alimera Sciences logo may be featured on the documentation and it may contain names of real Alimera employees.
There is frequently an early request for personal information such as address details, date of birth, resume, passport details, bank details, etc.
Candidates are requested to contact other companies/individuals such as lawyers, bank officials, travel agencies, courier companies, visa/immigration processing agencies etc.
Email correspondence is often sent to and from free web email accounts such as Yahoo, Gmail, Hotmail, Outlook, etc.
The perpetrators frequently use mobile telephone numbers instead of official company numbers.
The perpetrators may ask the candidate to pay a fee for travel, accommodations, visa applications, etc.
There is an insistence on urgency for the applicant to act on the correspondence received.







					What should you do?
					





Save the original and complete emails/messages from the perpetrator.
Contact your local police or legal authority and provide them with all information you have to aid investigation.
Do not respond to unsolicited business propositions or offers of employment from unfamiliar people.
Do not disclose your personal or financial details to anyone you do not know.
Do not send any money or transfer payments. Alimera does not ask for any form of payment from applicants to secure a job.
Verify the validity of suspicious offers by contacting

ALIMERA SCIENCES ILUVIEN® RECEIVES FDA PRIORITY REVIEW FOR THE TREATMENT OF DIABETIC MACULAR
EDEMA
ATLANTA, August 30, 2010  Alimera Sciences, Inc., (NASDAQ: ALIM) (Alimera), a biopharmaceutical
company that specializes in the research, development and commercialization of prescription
ophthalmic pharmaceuticals, announced today that the Companys New Drug Application (NDA) for
Iluvien® (fluocinolone acetonide intravitreal insert) has been accepted for filing and granted
Priority Review status by the U. S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Iluvien is Alimeras
investigational, sustained drug delivery system that releases sub-microgram levels of fluocinolone
acetonide for the treatment of diabetic macular edema (DME). 
 
 
FDA Priority Review status is granted to therapies that offer major advances in treatment or
provide a treatment where no adequate therapy exists. This status accelerates the standard review
time from 10 months to six months. With priority review, Alimera could receive a response from the
FDA in the fourth quarter regarding its
 NDA for Iluvien, which was submitted at the end of June
2010.
 
 
Receiving Priority Review status from the FDA marks another important milestone in our efforts to
provide an approved therapeutic option to DME patients, said Dan Myers, president and CEO of
Alimera Sciences. If approved, we believe that Iluvien will be the first pharmaceutical in the
U.S. indicated to treat this disease, and the first long-term treatment with the potential to be
therapeutically effective for up to 36 months.
 
 
Alimera is currently conducting two Phase 3 pivotal clinical trials (collectively known as the FAME
Study) for Iluvien involving 956 patients in sites across the United States, Canada, Europe and
India to assess the efficacy and safety of Iluvien with two doses, a high and low dose, for the
treatment of DME. The primary efficacy endpoint for the FAME Study is the difference in the
percentage of patients whose best corrected visual acuity improved by 15 or more letters from
baseline on the ETDRS eye chart at month 24 between the treatment and control groups. The
study will conclude later this year with the final patient visits at the three-year data point.

Following its NDA submission to the FDA, Alimera submitted a Marketing Authorization Application to
the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency in the United Kingdom. Applications have
also been submitted to regulatory agencies in Austria, France, Germany, Italy, Portugal and Spain. 
The company expects to file in Canada in September. Based upon the analysis of the FAME Study, all
filings include the 24-month low dose data only.
 
 
About DME
DME, the primary cause of vision loss associated with diabetic retinopathy, is a disease affecting
the macula, the part of the retina responsible for central vision. When the blood vessel leakage of
diabetic retinopathy causes swelling in the macula, the condition is called DME. The onset of DME
is painless and may go undetected by the patient until it manifests with the blurring of central
vision or acute vision loss. The severity of this blurring may range from mild to profound loss of
vision. The Wisconsin Epidemiologic Study of Diabetic Retinopathy found that over a 10-year period
approximately 19 percent of people with diabetes studied were diagnosed with DME. As the population
of people with diabetes increases, Alimera expects the annual incidence of diagnosed DME to
increase, as well.
 
 
About Iluvien
Iluvien is an investigative, extended release intravitreal insert that Alimera is developing for
the treatment of DME. Each Iluvien insert is designed to provide a therapeutic effect of up to 36
months by delivering sustained sub-microgram levels of fluocinolone acetonide. Iluvien is inserted
in the back of the patients eye to a position that takes advantage of the eyes natural fluid
dynamics. The insertion device employs a 25-gauge needle, which allows for a self-sealing wound.
 
 
About Alimera Sciences, Inc.
Alimera Sciences, Inc., based in Alpharetta, Georgia, is a biopharmaceutical company that
specializes in the research, development and commercialization of prescription ophthalmic
pharmaceuticals. Presently, Alimera is focused on diseases affecting the back of the eye, or
retina. Its advanced product candidate, Iluvien, is an intravitreal insert containing fluocinolone
acetonide, a non-proprietary corticosteroid with demonstrated efficacy in the treatment of ocular
disease. Iluvien is in development for the treatment of DME, a disease of the retina that affects
individuals with diabetes and can lead to severe vision loss and blindness.

which are on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and available on the SECs

press release (unless another date is indicated). Alimera undertakes no obligation, and
specifically declines any obligation, to publicly update or revise any such forward-looking

FlashRatings - All research for my stocks!

The most comprehensive equity research coverage available online.


          Never miss a single piece of research, upgrade, downgrade or target price change by any analyst firm on any stock!
          
          Equity research by professional analysts - especially their rationales more than their forecasts - contains far more interesting and important information about the actual fundamentals of the traded companies than can be gathered from conventional news reports.
          
          Our mission is to unlock access to valuable research on stocks for all retail investors.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.
