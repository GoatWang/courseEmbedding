About the information in Grant's Family Tree :  
it is as accurate as my many and varied sources allow 
my sources are reasonable and hopefully reliable for most of the relationships , names , dates and places
as with most family histories , there are some assumptions and probably some mistakes , hopefully they are few 

I have more information to share with relatives and other researchers , and 
... I am always looking for more information.
