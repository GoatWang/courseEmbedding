(See "The Fund's Long-term Performance" for Index descriptions)                 

The performance information shown represents past performance and is not a      
guarantee of future results. The investment return and principal value of your  
investment will fluctuate so that your shares, when redeemed, may be worth more 
or less than their original cost. Current performance may be lower or higher    
than the performance information shown. You may obtain performance information  
current to the most recent month-end by contacting your financial institution or
visiting riversource.com/funds.                                                 

The 4.75% sales charge applicable to Class A shares of the Fund is not reflected
in the table above. If reflected, returns would be lower than those shown. The  
performance of other classes may vary from that shown because of differences in 
expenses. See the Average Annual Total Returns table for performance of other   
share classes of the Fund.                                                      

The indices do not reflect the effects of sales charges, expenses (excluding    
Lipper) and taxes.                                                              

It is not possible to invest directly in an index.

The style matrix can be a valuable tool for constructing and monitoring your    
portfolio. It provides a frame of reference for distinguishing the types of     
stocks or bonds owned by a mutual fund, and may serve as a guideline for helping
you build a portfolio.

(a)  The Investment Manager and its affiliates                                  
have contractually agreed to waive certain fees and to absorb certain 
    expenses until May 31, 2009, unless sooner terminated at the discretion of
  the Fund's Board. Any amounts waived will not be reimbursed by the Fund.
 Under this agreement, net fund expenses (excluding fees and expenses of
acquired funds), will not exceed 1.02% for Class A, 1.78% for Class B,
   1.77% for Class C, 0.65% for Class I, 1.45% for Class R2, 1.20% for Class
R3, 0.95% for Class R4, 0.70% for Class R5 and 1.10% for Class W.     

(1)  WEIGHTED AVERAGE LIFE measures a bond's maturity, which takes into         
    consideration the possibility that the issuer may call the bond before its
maturity date.                                                        
(2)  EFFECTIVE DURATION measures the sensitivity of a security's price to       
   parallel shifts in the yield curve (the graphical depiction of the levels
    of interest rates from two years out to 30 years). Positive duration means
   that as rates rise, the price decreases, and negative duration means that
as rates rise, the price increases.                                   
(3)  WEIGHTED AVERAGE BOND RATING represents the average credit quality of the  
underlying bonds in the portfolio.                                    

There are risks associated with an investment in a bond fund, including credit  
risk, interest rate risk, and prepayment and extension risk. See the Fund's     
prospectus for information on these and other risks associated with the Fund. In
general, bond prices rise when interest rates fall and vice versa. This effect  
is usually more pronounced for longer-term securities. Non-investment grade     
securities, commonly called "high-yield" or "junk" bonds, generally have more   
volatile prices and carry more risk to principal and income than investment     
grade securities.

MANAGER COMMENTARY -------------------------------------------------------------

Dear Shareholders:                                                              
RiverSource High Yield Bond Fund (the Fund) Class A shares declined 2.40%       
(excluding sales charge) for the 12 months ended May 31, 2008. The Fund         
underperformed its benchmark, the JP Morgan Global High Yield Index (JP Morgan  
Index), which fell 1.00% during the same period. The Fund also underperformed   
the Lipper High Current Yield Bond Funds Index, representing the Fund's peer    
group, which declined 2.13% during the same time frame.                         

SIGNIFICANT PERFORMANCE FACTORS                                                 
The high yield corporate bond market experienced more ups and downs during the  
annual period than at any other time in recent memory. The high yield market had
rallied strongly going into the annual period, with spreads, or the yield       
differential between these securities and Treasuries, reaching an all-time low  
level in May 2007. During June and July 2007, problems in the subprime mortgage 
market spilled over into most other credit markets in general, and into the high
yield corporate bond market in particular. High yield corporate bonds traded    
down sharply, as investors grew increasingly risk averse and spreads widened. In
August, the high yield bond market stabilized somewhat, and from September      
through most

of October, the market actually rallied. Then, a second wave of concern hit the 
market amid a liquidity crunch, recession worries and ongoing turmoil in the    
housing, subprime mortgage and credit markets. Large investment banks took major
credit-related write-downs and the highly leveraged structured product market   
remained somewhat dysfunctional. Thus, November through March proved to be      
another difficult span for the high yield bond market, with spreads widening    
once again.                                                                     

The high yield bank loan sector performed particularly poorly in January and    
February, hit by the combination of growing credit concerns, the liquidity      
crunch and an overhang of supply with dried-up demand. All of this turmoil      
culminated in mid-March when the Federal Reserve Board (the Fed) orchestrated a 
buyout of Bear Stearns, which was on the verge of collapsing, by JPMorgan Chase.
The Fed's actions stabilized the markets somewhat in the last months of the     
annual period by demonstrating that the Fed would do whatever was necessary to  
quiet fears and prevent systemic failure. In April, the high yield corporate    
bond market bounced back somewhat, with spreads tightening. The high yield      
corporate bond market exhibited relative stability during May.                  

The Fund's overweight positioning in the health care sector relative to the JP  
Morgan Index helped the Fund's results most, as this defensive sector proved to 
be less volatile than others in the high yield bond market. The bonds of        
hospital companies IASIS HEALTHCARE, HCA and COMMUNITY HEALTH SYSTEMS performed 
particularly well. The Fund also benefited from its overweight exposure to the

Bond ratings apply to the underlying holdings of the Fund and not the Fund      
itself. Whenever possible, the Standard and Poor's rating is used to determine  
the credit quality of a security. Standard and Poor's rates the creditworthiness
of corporate bonds, with 15 categories, ranging from AAA (highest) to D         
(lowest). Ratings from AA to CCC may be modified by the addition of a plus (+)  
or minus (-) sign to show relative standing within the major rating categories. 
If Standard and Poor's doesn't rate a security, then Moody's rating is used.    
RiverSource Investments, LLC, the Fund's investment manager, rates a security   
using an internal rating system when Moody's doesn't provide a rating. Ratings  
for 0.9% of the bond portfolio assets were determined through internal analysis.

energy sector. Here, holdings in energy infrastructure company DRESSER, INC. and
exploration and production company SANDRIDGE ENERGY boosted results. In         
industrials, aluminum producer NORANDA ALUMINUM was an outstanding performer    
given rising commodity prices during the annual period. The Fund's underweight  
position in the automotive industry also contributed positively to performance, 
as this industry fared poorly during the period.                                

Conversely, retailer CLAIRE'S STORES, which had conducted a leveraged buyout in 
early 2007, performed poorly and detracted from the Fund's results. We sold the 
Fund's position in this issue during the second half of the fiscal year.        
Similarly, holding a position in REALOGY, the parent company of Century 21, ERA,
Coldwell Banker and Sotheby's Intl Realty, detracted from the Fund's            
performance. REALOGY, which had completed a leveraged buyout in the spring of   
2007, got swept by the brush of the massive slowdown in the housing market and  
concerns over housing depreciation. We maintained the Fund's holding in REALOGY,
but did reduce the position during the period.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Fund's positioning in the homebuilder industry further detracted from       
results. Holdings such as HOVNANIAN ENTERPRISES and WILLIAM LYON HOMES, which we
continued to hold, and STANDARD PACIFIC, which we sold by the end of the period,
each lagged. We had shifted to a modestly overweight allocation in homebuilders 
during the first half of the period, seeking to build positions on market       
weakness given what we believed to be still-attractive longer-term fundamentals.
However, it turned out that we bought a bit prematurely, as the housing industry
continued to deteriorate during the period, prompting us to reduce the Fund's   
position in this group to an approximately equal weighting to the JP Morgan     
Index by the end of the period. Also within the homebuilders area, we moved into
more senior parts of companies' capital structures during the second half of the
period. For example, we sold subordinated bonds and senior bonds of HOVNANIAN   
ENTERPRISES and bought senior secured bonds of HOVNANIAN ENTERPRISES instead.   

Performance from yellow pages publisher R.H. DONNELLEY was disappointing during 
the period, as pressures on print media grew with the omnipresence of the       
Internet. Still, we maintained the Fund's sizable position in R.H. DONNELLEY, as
we believe the market overreacted and its sell-off was overdone. A holding in   
subprime auto lender TRIAD ACQUISITION also detracted from the Fund's           
performance as the credit crunch took hold. However, we believe prospects for a 
positive outcome in our TRIAD ACQUISITION position remains intact; the Fund     
continued to hold a position in this issue.                                     

CHANGES TO THE FUND'S PORTFOLIO                                                 

Overall, we sought to use periods of strength in the high yield corporate bond  
market, such as the rally in April, to reduce the Fund's exposure to lower-rated
issues and more cyclical sectors, and to increase its position in higher-rated  
securities and more defensive areas of the market. More specifically, we        
completely eliminated the Fund's exposure to the retail sector and reduced its  
allocation to homebuilders. We increased the Fund's position in energy to a     
meaningful overweight, as this sector tends to be more defensive and was        
benefiting from soaring oil and gas prices. We also increased the Fund's        
exposure to cable TV and satellite cable providers. We added to the Fund's      
holdings in wireline and wireless telecommunications companies as well. For     
example, we established a position in the bank debt of ALLTELL. Just after the  
close of the Fund's fiscal year, ALLTELL announced that it was going to be      
acquired by Verizon Wireless in a $28 billion deal that will create the biggest 
mobile phone company in the U.S. We also bought SPRINT ahead of its downgrade   
from investment grade status during the period in anticipation of just such a   
move.

MANAGER COMMENTARY (continued) -------------------------------------------------

We strive to select the right bonds while maintaining a diligent review of      
potential credit risks at individual companies.                                 

We added bank loan exposure across certain core                                 
holdings in the Fund during periods of market                                   
weakness, as these securities tend to be                                        
comparatively defensive in nature over time. In many                            
cases, this positioned the Fund in a more senior                                
part of a company's capital structure, thus reducing                            
the overall risk within the portfolio.                                          

At the end of the period, the Fund had materially                               
greater exposure than the JP Morgan Index in the                                
energy, health care, cable TV, wireline                                         
telecommunications and wireless telecommunications                              
industries, with lesser overweights in the media,                               
chemicals and food industries. Underweights in the                              
Fund's portfolio included the technology,                                       
manufacturing and industrial, retail and automotive                             
areas. The Fund also maintained holdings in the                                 
gaming and utilities industries, each at                                        
approximately equal weighting to the JP Morgan                                  
Index.                                                                          

OUR FUTURE STRATEGY                                                             

In our view, the high yield corporate bond market                               
may well continue to be challenged over the months                              
ahead, as a confluence of factors take hold. These                              
factors include a weaker economy, slowed consumer                               
spending, skyrocketing oil, gas and other commodity                             
prices, a higher default rate and limited access to                             
capital. One of the major questions that faces the                              
market going forward is how the Fed will reconcile                              
the need to both fight inflationary pressures and                               
stimulate the economy. All told, this scenario                                  
indicates a difficult environment for the high yield                            
corporate bond market, especially if the Fed chooses                            
to increase rates, as we believe it eventually will.                            

Given that we are in the latter stages of the                                   
economic cycle and the risk we see for the further                              
widening of spreads within the high yield corporate                             
bond market, we intend to maintain the Fund's                                   
overweight positions in more defensive names and                                
sectors and more modest exposure to cyclical areas                              
of the market. We further intend to continue                                    
upgrading credit quality in the

Fund's portfolio, seeking opportunities to reduce the Fund's position in lower- 
rated bonds and to move into higher-rated high yield bonds.                     

Going forward, we also believe more than ever that the key to potential         
outperformance will be leveraging our strength in credit research. We strive to 
select the right bonds while maintaining a diligent review of potential credit  
risks at individual companies. We sell bonds when we believe that risks outweigh
a bond's total return potential.                                                

We have a bottom-up approach when selecting credits. One of our competitive     
advantages is that our team of nine analysts performs in-depth research to      
acquire deep knowledge and insight of the industries it covers. We believe that 
good security selection based on quality and in-depth security research will be 
key to performance in the near term. We intend, of course, to continue to seek  
opportunities to capitalize on attractively valued bonds that have the potential
for positive returns.

THE FUND'S LONG-TERM PERFORMANCE -----------------------------------------------
The chart on the facing page illustrates the total value of an assumed $10,000  
investment in RiverSource High Yield Bond Fund Class A shares (from 6/1/98 to   
5/31/08) as compared to the performance of two widely cited performance indices,
the JP Morgan Global High Yield Index and the Lipper High Current Yield Bond    
Funds Index. In comparing the Fund's Class A shares to these indices, you should
take into account the fact that the Fund's performance reflects the maximum     
sales charge of 4.75%, while such charges are not reflected in the performance  
of the indices. Returns for the Fund include the reinvestment of any            
distribution paid during each period.                                           

The performance information shown represents past performance and is not a      
guarantee of future results. The table below and the chart on the facing page do
not reflect the deduction of taxes that a shareholder would pay on fund         
distributions or the redemption of fund shares. The investment return and       
principal value of your investment will fluctuate so that your shares, when     
redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Current           
performance may be lower or higher than the performance information shown. You  
may obtain performance information current to the most recent month-end by

FUND EXPENSES EXAMPLE ----------------------------------------------------------
(UNAUDITED)                                                                     

As a shareholder of the Fund, you incur two types of costs: (1) transaction     
costs, including sales charges (loads) on purchase payments; and (2) ongoing    
costs, which may include management fees; distribution and service (12b-1) fees;
and other Fund fees and expenses. This example is intended to help you          
understand your ongoing costs (in dollars) of investing in the Fund and to      
compare these costs with the ongoing costs of investing in other mutual funds.  
In addition to the ongoing expenses which the Fund bears directly, the Fund's   
shareholders indirectly bear the expenses of the funds in which it invests (also
referred to as "acquired funds"), including affiliated and non-affiliated pooled
investment vehicles (including mutual funds and exchange traded funds). The     
Fund's indirect expense from investing in the acquired funds is based on the    
Fund's pro rata portion of the cumulative expenses charged by the acquired funds
using the acquired funds' expense ratio as of the most recent shareholder       
report.                                                                         

The example is based on an investment of $1,000 invested at the beginning of the
period and held for the six months ended May 31, 2008.                          

ACTUAL EXPENSES                                                                 

The first line of the table provides information about actual account values and
actual expenses. You may use the information in this line, together with the    
amount you invested, to estimate the expenses that you paid over the period.    
Simply divide your account value by $1,000 (for example, an $8,600 account value
divided by $1,000 = 8.6), then multiply the result by the number in the first   
line under the heading titled "Expenses paid during the period" to estimate the 
expenses you paid on your account during this period.                           

HYPOTHETICAL EXAMPLE FOR COMPARISON PURPOSES                                    

The second line of the table provides information about hypothetical account    
values and hypothetical expenses based on the Fund's actual expense ratio and an
assumed rate of return of 5% per year before expenses, which is not the Fund's  
actual return. The hypothetical account values and expenses may not be used to  
estimate the actual ending account balance or expenses you paid for the period. 
You may use this information to compare the ongoing costs of investing in the   
Fund and other funds. To do so, compare this 5% hypothetical example with the 5%
hypothetical examples that appear in the shareholder reports of the other funds.

Please note that the expenses shown in the table are meant to highlight your    
ongoing costs only and do not reflect any transactional costs, such as sales    
charges (loads). Therefore, the second line of the table is useful in comparing 
ongoing costs only, and will not help you determine the relative total costs of 
owning different funds. In addition, if these transactional costs were included,
your costs would have been higher.

(a)  Expenses are equal to the Fund's annualized expense ratio as indicated     
    above, multiplied by the average account value over the period, multiplied
by 182/366 (to reflect the one-half year period).                     
(b)  Based on the actual return for the six months ended May 31, 2008: +1.27%   
  for Class A, +0.36% for Class B, +0.87% for Class C, +1.11% for Class I,
   +0.75% for Class R2, +0.91% for Class R3, +1.41% for Class R4, +1.44% for
Class R5 and +0.86% for Class W.                                      
(c)  The Investment Manager and its affiliates have contractually agreed to     
waive certain fees and to absorb certain expenses until May 31, 2009, 
   unless sooner terminated at the discretion of the Fund's Board, such that
net expenses (excluding fees and expenses of acquired funds) will not 
   exceed 1.02% for Class A, 1.78% for Class B, 1.77% for Class C, 0.65% for
    Class I, 1.45% for Class R2, 1.20% for Class R3, 0.95% for Class R4, 0.70%
for Class R5 and 1.10% for Class W. Any amounts waived will not be    
  reimbursed by the Fund. This change was effective June 1, 2008. Had this
  change been in place for the entire six month period ended May 31, 2008,
     the actual expenses paid would have been $5.10 for Class A, $8.87 for Class
B, $8.84 for Class C, $3.25 for Class I, $7.24 for Class R2, $5.99 for
Class R3, $3.51 for Class R5 and $5.49 for Class W; the hypothetical  
   expenses paid would have been $5.12 for Class A, $8.92 for Class B, $8.87
 for Class C, $3.27 for Class I, $7.27 for Class R2, $6.02 for Class R3,
$3.52 for Class R5 and $5.52 for Class W. The actual and hypothetical 
expenses paid for Class R4 would have been the same as those expenses 
presented in the table above.

    * The original cost for this position in fiscal year 2004 was $25,000,000.
    From Sept. 29, 2004 through March 7, 2005, $25,000,000 was returned to
the fund in the form of return of capital.                        

(m)  For those zero coupon bonds that become coupon paying at a future date, the
    interest rate disclosed represents the annualized effective yield from the
date of acquisition to maturity.                                      

(n)  Pay-in-kind securities are securities in which the issuer makes interest or
dividend payments in cash or in additional securities. The securities 
usually have the same terms as the original holdings.                 

(o)  Represents a senior loan purchased on a when-issued or delayed-delivery    
     basis. Certain details associated with this purchase are not known prior to
     the settlement date of the transaction. In addition, senior loans typically
     trade without accrued interest and therefore a weighted average coupon rate
    is not available prior to settlement. At settlement, if still unknown, the
borrower or counterparty will provide the Fund with the final weighted
average coupon rate and maturity date.                                

(p)  At May 31, 2008, the Fund had unfunded senior loan commitments pursuant to 
 the terms of the loan agreement. The Fund receives a stated coupon rate
 until the borrower draws on the loan commitment, at which time the rate
will become the stated rate in the loan agreement.

1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES                                   

RiverSource High Yield Bond Fund (the Fund) is a series of RiverSource High     
Yield Income Series, Inc. and is registered under the Investment Company Act of 
1940 (as amended) as a diversified, open-end management investment company.     
RiverSource High Yield Income Series, Inc. has 10 billion authorized shares of  
capital stock that can be allocated among the separate series as designated by  
the Board of Directors (the Board). The Fund invests primarily in high-yielding,
high risk corporate bonds, commonly known as junk bonds.                        

The Fund offers Class A, Class B, Class C, Class I, Class R2, Class R3, Class   
R4, Class R5 and Class W shares.                                                

-  Class A shares are sold with a front-end sales charge.                       

-  Class B shares may be subject to a contingent deferred sales charge (CDSC)   
and automatically convert to Class A shares during the ninth year of      
ownership.                                                                

-  Class C shares may be subject to a CDSC.                                     

-  Class I, Class R2, Class R3, Class R4 and Class R5 shares are sold without a 
front end sales charge or CDSC and are offered to qualifying institutional
investors.                                                                

-  Class W shares are sold without a front-end sales charge or CDSC and are     
offered through qualifying discretionary accounts.                        

At May 31, 2008, RiverSource Investments, LLC (RiverSource Investments or the   
Investment Manager) and the RiverSource affiliated funds-of-funds owned 100% of 
Class I shares and the Investment Manager owned 100% of Class R3 and Class R5   
shares.                                                                         

All classes of shares have identical voting, dividend and liquidation rights.   
Class specific expenses (e.g., distribution and service fees, transfer agency   
fees, plan administration services fees) differ among classes. Income, expenses 
(other than class specific expenses) and realized and unrealized gains or losses
on investments are allocated to each class of shares based upon its relative net
assets.                                                                         

The Fund's significant accounting policies are summarized below:                

USE OF ESTIMATES                                                                

Preparing financial statements that conform to U.S. generally accepted          
accounting principles requires management to make estimates (e.g., on assets,   
liabilities and contingent assets and liabilities) that could differ from actual
results.

VALUATION OF SECURITIES                                                         

All securities are valued at the close of each business day. Securities traded  
on national securities exchanges or included in national market systems are     
valued at the last quoted sales price. Debt securities are generally traded in  
the over-the-counter market and are valued at a price that reflects fair value  
as quoted by dealers in these securities or by an independent pricing service.  
Foreign securities are valued based on quotations from the principal market in  
which such securities are normally traded. The procedures adopted by the Board  
generally contemplate the use of fair valuation in the event that price         
quotations or valuations are not readily available, price quotations or         
valuations from other sources are not reflective of market value and thus deemed
unreliable, or a significant event has occurred in relation to a security or    
class of securities (such as foreign securities) that is not reflected in price 
quotations or valuations from other sources. A fair value price is a good faith 
estimate of the value of a security at a given point in time.                   

Many securities markets and exchanges outside the U.S. close prior to the close 
of the New York Stock Exchange and therefore the closing prices for securities  
in such markets or on such exchanges may not fully reflect events that occur    
after such close but before the close of the New York Stock Exchange, including 
significant movements in the U.S. market after foreign exchanges have closed.   
Accordingly, in those situations, Ameriprise Financial, Inc. (Ameriprise        
Financial), parent company of the Investment Manager, as administrator to the   
Fund, will fair value foreign securities pursuant to procedures adopted by the  
Board, including utilizing a third party pricing service to determine these fair
values. These procedures take into account multiple factors, including movements
in the U.S. securities markets, to determine a good faith estimate that         
reasonably reflects the current market conditions as of the close of the New    
York Stock Exchange. Swap transactions are valued through an authorized pricing 
service, broker, or an internal model.                                          

Short-term securities maturing in more than 60 days from the valuation date are 
valued at the market price or approximate market value based on current interest
rates; those maturing in 60 days or less are valued at amortized cost.          

ILLIQUID SECURITIES                                                             

At May 31, 2008, investments in securities included issues that are illiquid    
which the Fund currently limits to 15% of net assets, at market value, at the   
time of purchase. Prior to July 12, 2007, the Fund limited the percent held in  
securities and other instruments that were illiquid to 10% of the Fund's net    
assets. The aggregate value of such securities at May 31, 2008 was $20,762,401  
representing 1.46% of net assets. These securities may be valued at fair value  
according to procedures approved, in good faith, by the Board. According to     
Board guidelines, certain unregistered securities are determined to be liquid   
and are not included within the 15% limitation specified above. Assets are      
liquid if they can be sold or

disposed of in the ordinary course of business within seven days at             
approximately the value at which the asset is valued by the Fund.               

SECURITIES PURCHASED ON A FORWARD-COMMITMENT BASIS AND UNFUNDED LOAN COMMITMENTS

Delivery and payment for securities that have been purchased by the Fund on a   
forward-commitment basis, including when-issued securities and other forward-   
commitments, can take place one month or more after the transaction date. During
this period, such securities are subject to market fluctuations, and they may   
affect the Fund's net assets the same as owned securities. The Fund designates  
cash or liquid securities at least equal to the amount of its                   
forward-commitments. At May 31, 2008, the Fund has outstanding when-issued      
securities of $19,564,135 and other forward-commitments of $4,880,831.          

The Fund may enter into certain credit agreements, all or a portion of which may
be unfunded. The Fund is obligated to fund these loan commitments at the        
borrower's discretion. These commitments are disclosed in the Portfolio of      
Investments. At May 31, 2008, the Fund has entered into unfunded loan           
commitments of $5,497,628.                                                      

INVESTMENTS IN LOANS                                                            

The senior loans acquired by the Fund typically take the form of a direct       
lending relationship with the borrower acquired through an assignment of another
lender's interest in a loan. The lead lender in a typical corporate loan        
syndicate administers the loan and monitors collateral. In the event that the   
lead lender becomes insolvent, enters FDIC receivership, or, if not FDIC        
insured, enters into bankruptcy, the Fund may incur certain costs and delays in 
realizing payment, or may suffer a loss of principal and/or interest. Loans are 
typically secured but may be unsecured. The primary risk arising from investing 
in subordinated loans or in unsecured loans is the potential loss in the event  
of default by the issuer of the loans.                                          

OPTION TRANSACTIONS                                                             

To produce incremental earnings, protect gains, and facilitate buying and       
selling of securities for investments, the Fund may buy and write options traded
on any U.S. or foreign exchange or in the over-the-counter market where         
completing the obligation depends upon the credit standing of the other party.  
Cash collateral may be collected by the Fund to secure certain over-the-counter 
options trades. Cash collateral held by the Fund for such option trades must be 
returned to the counterparty upon closure, exercise or expiration of the        
contract. The Fund also may buy and sell put and call options and write covered 
call options on portfolio securities as well as write cash-secured put options. 
The risk in writing a call option is that the Fund gives up the opportunity for 
profit if the market price of the security increases. The risk in writing a put 
option is that the Fund may incur a loss if the market price of the security    
decreases and the option is exercised. The risk in buying an option is that the 
Fund pays a premium whether or not the option

is exercised. The Fund also has the additional risk of being unable to enter    
into a closing transaction if a liquid secondary market does not exist.         

Option contracts are valued daily at the closing prices on their primary        
exchanges and unrealized appreciation or depreciation is recorded. The Fund will
realize a gain or loss when the option transaction expires or closes. When      
options on debt securities or futures are exercised, the Fund will realize a    
gain or loss. When other options are exercised, the proceeds on sales for a     
written call option, the purchase cost for a written put option or the cost of a
security for a purchased put or call option is adjusted by the amount of premium
received or paid. At May 31, 2008, and for the year then ended, the Fund had no 
outstanding option contracts.                                                   

FUTURES TRANSACTIONS                                                            

To gain exposure to or protect itself from market changes, the Fund may buy and 
sell financial futures contracts traded on any U.S. or foreign exchange. The    
Fund also may buy and write put and call options on these futures contracts.    
Risks of entering into futures contracts and related options include the        
possibility of an illiquid market and that a change in the value of the contract
or option may not correlate with changes in the value of the underlying         
securities.                                                                     

Futures are valued daily based upon the last sale price at the close of market  
on the principal exchange on which they are traded. Upon entering into a futures
contract, the Fund is required to deposit either cash or securities in an amount
(initial margin) equal to a certain percentage of the contract value. Subsequent
payments (variation margin) are made or received by the Fund each day. The      
variation margin payments are equal to the daily changes in the contract value  
and are recorded as unrealized gains and losses. The Fund recognizes a realized 
gain or loss when the contract is closed or expires. At May 31, 2008, the Fund  
had no outstanding futures contracts.                                           

FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATIONS AND FORWARD FOREIGN CURRENCY CONTRACTS 

Securities and other assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies   
are translated daily into U.S. dollars. Foreign currency amounts related to the 
purchase or sale of securities and income and expenses are translated at the    
exchange rate on the transaction date. The effect of changes in foreign exchange
rates on realized and unrealized security gains or losses is reflected as a     
component of such gains or losses. In the Statement of Operations, net realized 
gains or losses from foreign currency transactions, if any, may arise from sales
of foreign currency, closed forward contracts, exchange gains or losses realized
between the trade date and settlement date on securities transactions, and other
translation gains or losses on dividends, interest income and foreign           
withholding taxes.                                                              

The Fund may enter into forward foreign currency contracts for operational      
purposes and to protect against adverse exchange rate fluctuation. The net U.S. 
dollar value of foreign currency underlying all contractual commitments held by 
the Fund and the resulting unrealized appreciation or depreciation are          
determined

using foreign currency exchange rates from an independent pricing service. The  
Fund is subject to the credit risk that the other party will not complete its   
contract obligations. At May 31, 2008, the Fund had no outstanding forward      
foreign currency contracts.                                                     

CMBS TOTAL RETURN SWAP TRANSACTIONS                                             

The Fund may enter into swap agreements to earn the total return on a specified 
security or index of fixed income securities. CMBS total return swaps are       
bilateral financial contracts designed to replicate synthetically the total     
returns of commercial mortgage-backed securities. Under the terms of the swaps, 
the Fund either receives or pays the total return on a reference security or    
index applied to a notional principal amount. In return, the Fund agrees to pay 
or receive from the counterparty a floating rate, which is reset periodically   
based on short-term interest rates, applied to the same notional amount.        

The notional amounts of swap contracts are not recorded in the financial        
statements. Swaps are valued daily, and the change in value is recorded as      
unrealized appreciation (depreciation) until the termination of the swap, at    
which time realized gain (loss) is recorded. Payments received or made are      
recorded as realized gains (losses).                                            

Swap agreements may be subject to liquidity risk, which exists when a particular
swap is difficult to purchase or sell. It may not be possible for the Fund to   
initiate a transaction or liquidate a position at an advantageous time or price,
which may result in significant losses. Total return swaps are subject to the   
risk that the counterparty will default on its obligation to pay net amounts due
to the Fund. At May 31, 2008, the Fund had no outstanding CMBS total return swap
contracts.                                                                      

CREDIT DEFAULT SWAP TRANSACTIONS                                                

The Fund may enter into credit default swap contracts to increase or decrease   
its credit exposure to an issuer, obligation, portfolio, or index of issuers or 
obligations, to hedge its exposure on an obligation that it owns or in lieu of  
selling such obligations. As the purchaser of a credit default swap contract,   
the Fund purchases protection by paying a periodic interest rate on the notional
amount to the counterparty. The interest amount is accrued daily as a component 
of unrealized appreciation (depreciation) and is recorded as a realized loss    
upon payment. If the credit event specified in the contract occurs, the Fund    
will be required to deliver either the referenced obligation or an equivalent   
cash amount to the protection seller and in exchange the Fund will receive the  
notional amount from the seller. The difference between the value of the        
obligation delivered and the notional amount received will be recorded as a     
realized gain (loss). As the seller of a credit default swap contract, the Fund 
sells protection to a buyer and will generally receive a periodic interest rate 
on the notional amount. The interest amount is accrued daily as a component of  
unrealized appreciation (depreciation) and is recorded as a realized gain upon  
receipt of the payment. If the credit event

specified in the contract occurs, the Fund will receive the referenced          
obligation or an equivalent cash amount in exchange for the payment of the      
notional amount to the protection buyer. The difference between the value of the
obligation received and the notional amount paid will be recorded as a realized 
gain (loss). As a protection seller, the maximum amount of the payment made by  
the Fund may equal the notional amount, at par, of the underlying index or      
security as a result of the related credit event.                               

The notional amounts of credit default swap contracts are not recorded in the   
financial statements. Any premium paid or received by the Fund upon entering    
into a credit default swap contract is recorded as an asset or liability and    
amortized daily as a component of realized gain (loss) on the Statement of      
Operations. At May 31, 2008, there were no credit default swap contracts        
outstanding which had a premium paid or received by the Fund. Credit default    
swap contracts are valued daily, and the change in value is recorded as         
unrealized appreciation (depreciation) until the termination of the swap, at    
which time a realized gain (loss) is recorded.                                  

Credit default swap contracts can involve greater risks than if a fund had      
invested in the reference obligation directly since, in addition to general     
market risks, credit default swaps are subject to counterparty credit risk,     
leverage risk, hedging risk, correlation risk and liquidity risk. The Fund will 
enter into credit default swap agreements only with counterparties that meet    
certain standards of creditworthiness.                                          

GUARANTEES AND INDEMNIFICATIONS                                                 

Under the Fund's organizational documents, its officers and directors are       
indemnified against certain liabilities arising out of the performance of their 
duties to the Fund. In addition, certain of the Fund's contracts with its       
service providers contain general indemnification clauses. The Fund's maximum   
exposure under these arrangements is unknown since the amount of any future     
claims that may be made against the Fund cannot be determined and the Fund has  
no historical basis for predicting the likelihood of any such claims.           

FEDERAL TAXES                                                                   

The Fund's policy is to comply with Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code   
that applies to regulated investment companies and to distribute substantially  
all of its taxable income to the shareholders. No provision for income or excise
taxes is thus required.                                                         

The Fund has adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Interpretation 
48 (FIN 48), "Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes," which is effective   
for fiscal periods beginning after Dec. 15, 2006. FIN 48 clarifies the          
accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in accordance with FASB   
Statement 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes." FIN 48 prescribes a two-step      
process to recognize and measure a tax position taken or expected to be taken in
a tax return. The first step is to determine whether a tax position has met the 
more-

P-->N-CSR42nd Page of 79TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust 42nd
likely-than-not recognition threshold and the second step is to measure a tax   
position that meets the threshold to determine the amount of benefit to         
recognize. FIN 48 also provides guidance on derecognition, classification,      
interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure, and          
transition. Management of the Fund has concluded that there are no significant  
uncertain tax positions that would require recognition in the financial         
statements. Generally, the tax authorities can examine all the tax returns filed
for the last three years.                                                       

Net investment income (loss) and net realized gains (losses) may differ for     
financial statement and tax purposes primarily because of recognition of        
unrealized appreciation (depreciation) for certain derivative investments,      
investments in partnerships, post-October losses, market discount and losses    
deferred due to wash sales. The character of distributions made during the year 
from net investment income or net realized gains may differ from their ultimate 
characterization for federal income tax purposes. Also, due to the timing of    
dividend distributions, the fiscal year in which amounts are distributed may    
differ from the year that the income or realized gains (losses) were recorded by
the Fund.                                                                       

On the Statement of Assets and Liabilities, as a result of permanent book-to-tax
differences, undistributed net investment income has been decreased by          
$8,523,183 and accumulated net realized loss has been decreased by $58,996,948  
resulting in a net reclassification adjustment to decrease paid-in capital by   
$50,473,765.                                                                    

The tax character of distributions paid for the years indicated is as follows:

RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS                                                

In March 2008, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.  
161 (SFAS 161), "Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging           
Activities - an amendment of FASB Statement No. 133," which requires enhanced   
disclosures about a fund's derivative and hedging activities. Funds are required
to provide enhanced disclosures about (a) how and why a fund uses derivative    
instruments, (b) how derivative instruments and related hedged items are        
accounted for under SFAS 133 and its related interpretations, and (c) how

derivative instruments and related hedged items affect a fund's financial       
position, financial performance, and cash flows. SFAS 161 is effective for      
financial statements issued for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after
Nov. 15, 2008. As of May 31, 2008, management does not believe the adoption of  
SFAS 161 will impact the financial statement amounts; however, additional       
footnote disclosures may be required about the use of derivative instruments and
hedging items.                                                                  

On Sept. 20, 2006, the FASB released Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 157 "Fair Value Measurements" (SFAS 157). SFAS 157 establishes an           
authoritative definition of fair value, sets out a hierarchy for measuring fair 
value, and requires additional disclosures about the inputs used to develop the 
measurements of fair value and the effect of certain measurements reported in   
the Statement of Operations for a fiscal period. The application of SFAS 157    
will be effective for the Fund's fiscal year beginning June 1, 2008. The        
adoption of SFAS 157 is not anticipated to have a material impact on the Fund's 
financial statements; however, additional disclosures will be required about the
inputs used to develop the measurements of fair value and the effect of certain 
measurements reported in the Statement of Operations for a fiscal period.       

DIVIDENDS TO SHAREHOLDERS                                                       

Dividends from net investment income, declared daily and payable monthly, when  
available, are reinvested in additional shares of the Fund at net asset value or
payable in cash. Capital gains, when available, are distributed along with the  
last income dividend of the calendar year.                                      

OTHER                                                                           

Security transactions are accounted for on the date securities are purchased or 
sold. Dividend income, if any, is recognized on the ex-dividend date. Non-cash  
dividends or interest included in investment income, if any, are recorded at the
fair market value of the security received. Interest income, including          
amortization of premium, market discount and original issue discount using the  
effective interest method, is accrued daily. The Fund may place a debt security 
on non-accrual status and reduce related interest income when it becomes        
probable that the interest will not be collected and the amount of uncollectible
interest can be reasonably estimated. A defaulted debt security is removed from 
non-accrual status when the issuer resumes interest payments or when            
collectibility of interest is reasonably assured.                               

2. EXPENSES AND SALES CHARGES                                                   
INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT SERVICES FEES                                             

Under an Investment Management Services Agreement, the Investment Manager       
determines which securities will be purchased, held or sold. The management fee 
is a percentage of the Fund's average daily net assets that declines from 0.59% 
to

Other expenses are for, among other things, certain expenses of the Fund or the 
Board including: Fund boardroom and office expense, employee compensation,      
employee health and retirement benefits, and certain other expenses. Payment of 
these Fund and Board expenses is facilitated by a company providing limited     
administrative services to the Fund and the Board. For the year ended May 31,
2008, other expenses paid to the company were $8,708.                           

COMPENSATION OF BOARD MEMBERS                                                   

Compensation of board members includes, for a former Board Chair, compensation  
as well as retirement benefits. Certain other aspects of a former Board Chair's 
compensation, including health benefits and payment of certain other expenses,  
are included under other expenses.                                              

Under a Deferred Compensation Plan (the Plan), non-interested board members may 
defer receipt of their compensation. Deferred amounts are treated as though     
equivalent dollar amounts had been invested in shares of the Fund or other      
RiverSource funds. The Fund's liability for these amounts is adjusted for market
value changes and remains in the Fund until distributed in accordance with the  
Plan.                                                                           

TRANSFER AGENCY FEES                                                            

Under a Transfer Agency Agreement, RiverSource Service Corporation (the Transfer
Agent) maintains shareholder accounts and records. The Fund pays the Transfer   
Agent an annual account-based fee at a rate equal to $20.50 for Class A, $21.50 
for Class B and $21.00 for Class C for this service. The Fund also pays the     
Transfer Agent an annual asset-based fee at a rate of 0.05% of the Fund's       
average daily net assets attributable to Class R2, Class R3, Class R4 and Class 
R5 shares and an annual asset-based fee at a rate of 0.20% of the Fund's average
daily net assets attributable to Class W shares.                                

The Transfer Agent charges an annual fee of $5 per inactive account, charged on 
a pro rata basis for 12 months from the date the account becomes inactive. These
fees are included in the transfer agency fees on the Statement of Operations.

Effective June 1, 2008, the Investment Manager and its affiliates have          
contractually agreed to waive certain fees and expenses until May 31, 2009,     
unless sooner terminated at the discretion of the Board, such that net expenses

In 2005, the Fund received an amended 2003 K-1, for a partnership investment,   
that reported a smaller loss allocable to the Fund than originally reported. The
resulting change to investment income caused taxable dividends on 2004 Forms    
1099-DIV to be understated. To resolve this matter, the Fund entered into a     
closing agreement and in August 2007 paid $433,562 to the Internal Revenue      
Service. This amount is included in other expenses on the Statement of          
Operations. Ameriprise Financial reimbursed the Fund for this payment. This     
amount is included in expenses waived/reimbursed by the Investment Manager and  
its affiliates on the Statement of Operations.                                  
*    In addition to the fees and expenses which the Fund bears directly, the    
Fund indirectly bears a pro rata share of the fees and expenses of the
     funds in which it invests (also referred to as "acquired funds"), including
    affiliated and non-affiliated pooled investment vehicles (including mutual
  funds and exchange traded funds). Because the acquired funds have varied
expense and fee levels and the Fund may own different proportions of  
     acquired funds at different times, the amount of fees and expenses incurred
indirectly by the Fund will vary.                                     

EARNINGS AND BANK FEE CREDITS                                                   

During the year ended May 31, 2008, the Fund's custodian and transfer agency    
fees were reduced by $88,594 as a result of earnings and bank fee credits from  
overnight cash balances.

year ended May 31, 2008. Realized gains and losses are determined on an         
identified cost basis.                                                          

Income from securities lending amounted to $71,335 for the year ended May 31,
2008. Expenses paid to the Investment Manager as securities lending agent were  
$781 for the year ended May 31, 2008, which are included in other expenses on   
the Statement of Operations. The risks to the Fund of securities lending are    
that the borrower may not provide additional collateral when required or return 
the securities when due. At May 31, 2008, the Fund had no securities out on     
loan.

purchases and proceeds from sales of shares of the RiverSource Short-Term Cash  
Fund aggregated $748,072,445 and $835,284,038, respectively, for the year ended 
May 31, 2008. The income distributions received with respect to the Fund's      
investment in RiverSource Short-Term Cash Fund can be found on the Statement of 
Operations and the Fund's invested balance in RiverSource Short-Term Cash Fund  
at May 31, 2008, can be found in the Portfolio of Investments.                  

6. BANK BORROWINGS                                                              

The Fund has entered into a revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks 
headed by JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (JPMCB), whereby the Fund may borrow for the
temporary funding of shareholder redemptions or for other temporary or emergency
purposes. The credit facility became effective on Oct. 18, 2007, replacing a    
prior credit facility. The credit facility agreement, which is a collective     
agreement between the Fund and certain other RiverSource funds, severally and   
not jointly, permits collective borrowings up to $500 million. Interest is      
charged to each Fund based on its borrowings at a rate equal to the federal     
funds rate plus 0.30%. Each borrowing under the credit facility matures no later
than 60 days after the date of borrowing. The Fund also pays a commitment fee   
equal to its pro rata share of the amount of the credit facility at a rate of   
0.06% per annum. Under the prior credit facility, a Fund paid interest on its   
outstanding borrowings at a rate equal to either the higher of the federal funds
effective rate plus 0.40% or the JPMCB Prime Commercial Lending Rate. The Fund  
had no borrowings during the year ended May 31, 2008.                           

7. CAPITAL LOSS CARRY-OVER AND POST-OCTOBER LOSS                                

For federal income tax purposes, the Fund had a capital loss carry-over of      
$1,320,916,274 at May 31, 2008, that if not offset by capital gains will expire 
as follows:                                                                     

                                                                [Download Table]

    2009           2010           2011          2014          2016   
                                                                     
$226,001,198   $517,121,802   $552,664,309   $19,078,058   $6,050,907

Because the measurement periods for a regulated investment company's income are 
different for excise tax purposes versus income tax purposes, special rules are 
in place to protect the amount of earnings and profits needed to support excise 
tax distributions. As a result, the Fund is permitted to treat net capital      
losses realized between Nov. 1, 2007 and its fiscal year end ("post-October     
loss") as occurring on the first day of the following tax year. At May 31, 2008,
the Fund had a post-October loss of $55,632,789 that is treated for income tax  
purposes as occurring on June 1, 2008.                                          

It is unlikely the Board will authorize a distribution of any net realized      
capital gains until the available capital loss carry-over has been offset or    
expires.

8. INFORMATION REGARDING PENDING AND SETTLED LEGAL PROCEEDINGS                  

In June 2004, an action captioned John E. Gallus et al. v. American Express     
Financial Corp. and American Express Financial Advisors Inc., was filed in the  
United States District Court for the District of Arizona. The plaintiffs allege 
that they are investors in several American Express Company mutual funds and    
they purport to bring the action derivatively on behalf of those funds under the
Investment Company Act of 1940. The plaintiffs allege that fees allegedly paid  
to the defendants by the funds for investment advisory and administrative       
services are excessive. The plaintiffs seek remedies including restitution and  
rescission of investment advisory and distribution agreements. The plaintiffs   
voluntarily agreed to transfer this case to the United States District Court for
the District of Minnesota. In response to defendants' motion to dismiss the     
complaint, the Court dismissed one of plaintiffs' four claims and granted       
plaintiffs limited discovery. Defendants moved for summary judgment in April    
2007. Summary judgment was granted in the defendants' favor on July 9, 2007. The
plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal with the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals on 
August 8, 2007.                                                                 

In December 2005, without admitting or denying the allegations, American Express
Financial Corporation (AEFC, which is now known as Ameriprise Financial, Inc.   
(Ameriprise Financial)), entered into settlement agreements with the Securities 
and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Minnesota Department of Commerce (MDOC)       
related to market timing activities. As a result, AEFC was censured and ordered 
to cease and desist from committing or causing any violations of certain        
provisions of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, the Investment Company Act of
1940, and various Minnesota laws. AEFC agreed to pay disgorgement of $10 million
and civil money penalties of $7 million. AEFC also agreed to retain an          
independent distribution consultant to assist in developing a plan for          
distribution of all disgorgement and civil penalties ordered by the SEC in      
accordance with various undertakings detailed at                                
http://www.sec.gov/litigation/admin/ia-2451.pdf. Ameriprise Financial and its   
affiliates have cooperated with the SEC and the MDOC in these legal proceedings,
and have made regular reports to the RiverSource Funds' Boards of Directors/    
Trustees.                                                                       

Ameriprise Financial and certain of its affiliates have historically been       
involved in a number of legal, arbitration and regulatory proceedings, including
routine litigation, class actions, and governmental actions, concerning matters 
arising in connection with the conduct of their business activities. Ameriprise 
Financial believes that the Funds are not currently the subject of, and that    
neither Ameriprise Financial nor any of its affiliates are the subject of, any  
pending legal, arbitration or regulatory proceedings that are likely to have a  
material adverse effect on the Funds or the ability of Ameriprise Financial or  
its affiliates to perform under their contracts with the Funds. Ameriprise      
Financial is required to make 10-Q, 10-K

and, as necessary, 8-K filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission on   
legal and regulatory matters that relate to Ameriprise Financial and its        
affiliates. Copies of these filings may be obtained by accessing the SEC website
at www.sec.gov.                                                                 

There can be no assurance that these matters, or the adverse publicity          
associated with them, will not result in increased fund redemptions, reduced    
sale of fund shares or other adverse consequences to the Funds. Further,        
although we believe proceedings are not likely to have a material adverse effect
on the Funds or the ability of Ameriprise Financial or its affiliates to perform
under their contracts with the Funds, these proceedings are subject to          
uncertainties and, as such, we are unable to estimate the possible loss or range
of loss that may result. An adverse outcome in one or more of these proceedings 
could result in adverse judgments, settlements, fines, penalties or other relief
that could have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial         
condition or results of operations of Ameriprise Financial.

ACCOUNTING FIRM ------------------------                                        
TO THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND SHAREHOLDERS OF                                   
RIVERSOURCE HIGH YIELD BOND FUND:                                               

We have audited the accompanying statement of assets and liabilities, including 
the portfolio of investments, of RiverSource High Yield Bond Fund (the Fund), of
the RiverSource High Yield Income Series, Inc., as of May 31, 2008, and the     
related statements of operations, changes in net assets, and financial          
highlights for the year then ended. These financial statements and financial    
highlights are the responsibility of the Fund's management. Our responsibility  
is to express an opinion on these financial statements and financial highlights 
based on our audit. The financial statements and financial highlights of the    
Fund for the periods presented through May 31, 2007, were audited by other      
auditors whose report dated July 20, 2007, expressed an unqualified opinion on  
those financial statements and financial highlights.                            

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company   
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements and financial highlights are free of material misstatement. We were  
not engaged to perform an audit of the Fund's internal control over financial   
reporting. Our audit included consideration of internal control over financial  
reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the 
circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the          
effectiveness of the Fund's internal control over financial reporting.          
Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a 
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial    
statements and financial highlights, assessing the accounting principles used   
and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall        
financial statement presentation. Our procedures included confirmation of       
securities owned as of May 31, 2008, by correspondence with the custodian and   
brokers, or by other appropriate auditing procedures where replies from brokers 
were not received. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our
opinion.

APPROVAL OF INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT SERVICES                                      
AGREEMENT ----------------------------------------------------------------------

RiverSource Investments, LLC ("RiverSource Investments" or the "investment      
manager"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Ameriprise Financial, Inc. ("Ameriprise 
Financial"), serves as the investment manager to the Fund. Under an investment  
management services agreement (the "IMS Agreement") RiverSource Investments     
provides investment advice and other services to the Fund and all RiverSource   
funds (collectively, the "Funds").                                              

On an annual basis, the Fund's Board of Directors (the "Board"), including the  
independent Board members (the "Independent Directors"), considers renewal of   
the IMS Agreement. RiverSource Investments prepared detailed reports for the    
Board and its Contracts Committee in March and April 2008, including reports    
based on data provided by independent organizations to assist the Board in      
making this determination. In addition, throughout the year, the Board (or its  
committees) reviews information prepared by RiverSource Investments addressing  
the services RiverSource Investments provides and Fund performance. The Board   
accords particular weight to the work, deliberations and conclusions of the     
Contracts, Investment Review and Compliance Committees in determining whether to
continue the IMS Agreement. At the April 9-10, 2008 in-person Board meeting,    
independent legal counsel to the Independent Directors reviewed with the        
Independent Directors various factors relevant to the Board's consideration of  
advisory agreements and the Board's legal responsibilities related to such      
consideration. Following an analysis and discussion of the factors identified   
below, the Board, including all of the Independent Directors, approved renewal  
of the IMS Agreement.                                                           

Nature, Extent and Quality of Services Provided by RiverSource Investments: The 
Board analyzed various reports and presentations it had received detailing the  
services performed by RiverSource Investments, as well as its expertise,        
resources and capabilities. The Board specifically considered many developments 
during the past year concerning the services provided by RiverSource            
Investments, including, in particular, the continued investment in, and         
resources dedicated to, the Fund's operations, particularly in the areas of     
trading systems, new product initiatives, legal and compliance. Further, in     
connection with the Board's evaluation of the overall package of services       
provided by RiverSource Investments, the Board considered the quality of the    
administrative and transfer agency services provided by RiverSource Investments'
affiliates to the Fund. The Board also reviewed the financial condition of      
RiverSource Investments (and its affiliates) and each entity's ability to carry 
out its responsibilities under the IMS Agreement. The Board also discussed the  
acceptability of the terms of the IMS Agreement (including the relatively broad 
scope of services required to be performed by RiverSource Investments). The     
Board concluded that the services being performed under the

IMS Agreement were of a reasonably high quality, particularly in light of recent
market conditions.                                                              

Based on the foregoing, and based on other information received (both oral and  
written, including the information on investment performance referenced below)  
and other considerations, the Board concluded that RiverSource Investments and  
its affiliates were in a position to continue to provide a high quality and     
level of services to the Fund.                                                  

Investment Performance:  For purposes of evaluating the nature, extent and      
quality of services provided under the IMS Agreement, the Board carefully       
reviewed the investment performance of the Fund. In this regard, the Board      
considered: (i) detailed reports containing data prepared by an independent     
organization showing, for various periods, the performance of the Fund, the     
performance of a benchmark index, the percentage ranking of the Fund among its  
comparison group and the net assets of the Fund; and (ii) a report detailing the
Fund's performance over various periods (including since inception), recent Fund
inflows (and outflows) and a comparison of the Fund's net assets from December  
2006 to December 2007. The Board observed that the Fund's investment performance
was appropriate in light of the particular management style and market          
conditions involved.                                                            

Comparative Fees, Costs of Services Provided and the Profits Realized By        
RiverSource Investments and its Affiliates from their Relationships with the    
Fund: The Board reviewed comparative fees and the costs of services to be       
provided under the IMS Agreement. The Board members considered detailed         
comparative information set forth in an annual report on fees and expenses,     
including, among other things, data (prepared by an independent organization)   
showing a comparison of the Fund's expenses with median expenses paid by funds  
in its peer group, as well as data showing the Fund's contribution to           
RiverSource Investments' profitability.                                         

The Board accorded particular weight to the notion that the level of fees should
reflect a rational pricing model applied consistently across the various product
lines in the Funds' family, while assuring that the overall fees for each fund  
are generally in line with the "pricing philosophy" (i.e., that the total       
expense ratio of each fund, with few exceptions, is at or below the median      
expense ratio of funds in the same comparison group). The Board observed that   
the Fund's expense ratio (after considering proposed expense caps/waivers)      
approximated the peer group's median expense ratio. Based on its review, the    
Board concluded that the Fund's management fee was fair and reasonable in light 
of the extent and quality of services that the Fund receives.

APPROVAL OF INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT SERVICES                                      
AGREEMENT (continued) ----------------------------------------------------------

The Board also considered the expected profitability of RiverSource Investments 
and its affiliates in connection with RiverSource Investments providing         
investment management services to the Fund. In this regard, the Board referred  
to a detailed profitability report, discussing the profitability to RiverSource 
Investments and Ameriprise Financial from managing and operating the Fund,      
including data showing comparative profitability over the past two years. The   
Board also considered the services acquired by the investment manager through   
the use of commission dollars paid by the Funds on portfolio transactions. The  
Board noted that the fees paid by the Fund should permit the investment manager 
to offer competitive compensation to its personnel, make necessary investments  
in its business and earn an appropriate profit. The Board concluded that        
profitability levels were reasonable.                                           

Economies of Scale to be Realized:  The Board also considered the economies of  
scale that might be realized by RiverSource Investments as the Fund grows and   
took note of the extent to which Fund shareholders might also benefit from such 
growth. The Board considered that the IMS Agreement provides for lower fees as  
assets increase at pre-established breakpoints and concluded that the IMS       
Agreement satisfactorily provided for sharing these economies of scale.         

Based on the foregoing, the Board, including all of the Independent Directors,  
concluded that the investment management service fees were fair and reasonable  
in light of the extent and quality of services provided. In reaching this       
conclusion, no single factor was determinative. On April 10, 2008, the Board,   
including all of the Independent Directors, approved the renewal of the IMS     
Agreement.                                                                      

PROXY
