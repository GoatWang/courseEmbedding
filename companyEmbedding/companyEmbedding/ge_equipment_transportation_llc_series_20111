GE Transportation, formerly known as GE Rail, is a division of General Electric. The organization manufactures equipment for the railroad, marine, mining, drilling and energy generation industries. It is headquartered in Chicago, Illinois while their main manufacturing facility is located in Fort Worth, Texas. Locomotives are assembled at the Erie plant, while engine manufacturing takes place in Grove City, Pennsylvania.[2] In May 2011, the company announced plans to build a second locomotive factory in Fort Worth, Texas.

Rail products[edit]
GE Transportation is the largest producer of diesel-electric locomotives for both freight and passenger applications in North America, believed to hold up to a 70% market share.[3] It also produces related products, such as railroad signaling equipment, and parts for locomotives and railroad cars, as well as providing repair services for GE and other locomotives.
Current locomotives in major production include the GE Evolution Series; for a complete listing, see the list of GE locomotives. In the spring of 2007, GE Transportation Systems rolled out a prototype hybrid diesel-electric locomotive to increase fuel efficiency and reduce emissions. In September 2010, GE Transportation announced plans to commercialise a hybrid design by 2014-15.[4]
In addition to the railroad industry, GE Transportation also serves the following industries: Marine, Mining, Stationary Power, Drilling, and Drivetrain Technologies (wind gear boxes).




Once commonly seen leased rolling stock General Electric Rail Services Corp. covered hopper car 'NAHX 44703' and GE Capital Rail Services car 'NCHX 38781' in the Duryea yard, Duryea/West Pittston Pennsylvania in July 2013. GE Transportation has consolidated or sold off both subsidiary functions. (View looking toward Sayre and Waverly, NY.)


Propulsion products[edit]
In addition to railroad locomotives and equipment, GE Transportation Systems also produces large electric motors and propulsion systems for the mining, oil drilling, and wind turbine industries. GE also provides medium-sized, medium-speed diesel engines for several smaller vessels, mostly tugboats and other similarly-sized vessels. These marine engines are marinized versions of their locomotive engines.
Battery products[edit]
GE’s battery business serves the rail, marine, telecommunications and energy sectors, including new smart grid technology.[5][6]
GE's Durathon battery production takes place at their state of the art facility in Schenectady, New York.

GE Transportation, formerly known as GE Rail, is a division of General Electric. The organization manufactures equipment for the railroad, marine, mining, drilling and energy generation industries. It is headquartered in Chicago, Illinois while their main manufacturing facility is located in Fort Worth, Texas. Locomotives are assembled at the Erie plant, while engine manufacturing takes place in Grove City, Pennsylvania.[2] In May 2011, the company announced plans to build a second locomotive factory in Fort Worth, Texas.

Rail products[edit]
GE Transportation is the largest producer of diesel-electric locomotives for both freight and passenger applications in North America, believed to hold up to a 70% market share.[3] It also produces related products, such as railroad signaling equipment, and parts for locomotives and railroad cars, as well as providing repair services for GE and other locomotives.
Current locomotives in major production include the GE Evolution Series; for a complete listing, see the list of GE locomotives. In the spring of 2007, GE Transportation Systems rolled out a prototype hybrid diesel-electric locomotive to increase fuel efficiency and reduce emissions. In September 2010, GE Transportation announced plans to commercialise a hybrid design by 2014-15.[4]
In addition to the railroad industry, GE Transportation also serves the following industries: Marine, Mining, Stationary Power, Drilling, and Drivetrain Technologies (wind gear boxes).




Once commonly seen leased rolling stock General Electric Rail Services Corp. covered hopper car 'NAHX 44703' and GE Capital Rail Services car 'NCHX 38781' in the Duryea yard, Duryea/West Pittston Pennsylvania in July 2013. GE Transportation has consolidated or sold off both subsidiary functions. (View looking toward Sayre and Waverly, NY.)


Propulsion products[edit]
In addition to railroad locomotives and equipment, GE Transportation Systems also produces large electric motors and propulsion systems for the mining, oil drilling, and wind turbine industries. GE also provides medium-sized, medium-speed diesel engines for several smaller vessels, mostly tugboats and other similarly-sized vessels. These marine engines are marinized versions of their locomotive engines.
Battery products[edit]
GE’s battery business serves the rail, marine, telecommunications and energy sectors, including new smart grid technology.[5][6]
GE's Durathon battery production takes place at their state of the art facility in Schenectady, New York.

      Fitch Takes Various Actions on GE Equipment Transportation LLC Series 
      2011-1, 2012-1, and 2012-2
    





September 27, 2013 05:44 PM Eastern Daylight Time



CHICAGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Fitch Ratings takes various rating actions on GE Equipment 
      Transportation L.L.C. Series 2011-1 (GE ET 2011-1), Series 2012-1 (GE ET 
      2012-1), and Series 2012-2 (GE ET 2012-2) as follows:
    

      GE ET 2011-1
    

      --Class A-3 affirmed at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --Class A-4 affirmed at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --Class B affirmed at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --Class C upgraded to 'AAAsf' from 'AAsf'; Outlook to Stable from 
      Positive.
    

      GE ET 2012-1
    

      --Class A-2 affirmed at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --Class A-3 affirmed at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --Class A-4 affirmed at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --Class B upgraded to 'AAAsf' from 'AAsf'; Outlook to Stable from 
      Positive;
    

      --Class C upgraded to 'AAsf' from 'Asf'; Outlook Positive.
    

      GE ET 2012-2
    

      --Class A-2 affirmed at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --Class A-3 affirmed at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --Class A-4 affirmed at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --Class B affirmed at 'AAsf'; Outlook to Positive from Stable;
    

      --Class C affirmed at 'Asf'; Outlook to Positive from Stable.
    

      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    

      The upgrade of class C and affirmation of class A and B in GE ET 2011-1 
      reflect the loss coverage levels from the increasing credit enhancement 
      levels commensurate with an 'AAAsf' rating. Performance of the 
      transaction continues to be within expectations with 18 basis points 
      (bps) of losses to date.
    

      The upgrades of class B and C in GE ET 2012-1 reflect the improving loss 
      coverage levels as credit enhancement continues to grow. The 
      affirmations of class A reflect the high levels of enhancement available 
      to the notes as well as strong performance of the transaction with only 
      31 bps of net loss to date.
    

      The affirmation of all outstanding classes in GE ET 2012-2 is reflective 
      of credit enhancement levels that are consistent with the ratings and 
      strong collateral performance to date. As of the September 2013 
      reporting period, cumulative net losses of 19 bps is lower than Fitch's 
      initial expectations for the pool.
    

      The Positive Outlook designation for class C in GE ET 2012-1 as well as 
      class B and C in GE ET 2012-2 reflects Fitch's expectation for loss 
      coverage to continue improving as the transactions amortize and credit 
      enhancement levels continue to build. The Positive Outlook on certain 
      classes of notes reflects Fitch's view that the notes will continue to 
      perform well and may warrant a review for a potentially positive rating 
      action in the next 12-18 months.
    

      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    

      Unanticipated increases in the frequency of defaults and loss severity 
      could produce loss levels higher than the current projected base case 
      loss proxies which would impact available loss coverage. Lower loss 
      coverage could impact ratings and Rating Outlooks, depending on the 
      extent of the decline in coverage. In Fitch's initial review of the 
      transactions, the notes were found to have limited sensitivity to 1.5x 
      and 2.5x higher of Fitch's base case loss expectations. Initial Key 
      Rating Drivers and Rating Sensitivities are further described in the GE 
      ET 2011-1 New Issue report dated June 20, 2011, GE ET 2012-1 Presale 
      Report dated March 12, 2012, and GE ET 2012-2 Presale Report dated Oct. 
      15, 2012.
    

      To date, the transactions have exhibited strong performance with losses 
      well within Fitch's initial expectations with rising loss coverage and 
      multiple levels. As such, continued strong performance for these 
      transactions would most likely result in further positive rating 
      actions. Conversely, a material deterioration in performance would have 
      to occur within these asset pools to have potential negative impact on 
      the outstanding ratings.
    

      Fitch's analysis of the Representations and Warranties (R&W) of these 
      transactions can be found in the reports listed as follows:
    

      --'GE Equipment Transportation, L.L.C Series 2011-1 - Appendix'
    

      --'GE Equipment Transportation, L.L.C Series 2012-1 - Appendix'
    

      --'GE Equipment Transportation, L.L.C Series 2012-2 - Appendix'
    

      These R&W are compared to those of typical R&W for the asset class as 
      detailed in the special report 'Representations, Warranties, and 
      Enforcement Mechanisms in Global Structured Finance Transactions' dated 
      April 17, 2012.

                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.
