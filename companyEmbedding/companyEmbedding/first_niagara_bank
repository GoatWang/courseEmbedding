It Takes a Village to Raise a College Graduate

                            With the rising costs of college, families are taking a multigenerational approach to planning for education and other life goals.
                        





It takes a village to raise a child, but in 2017 it may take an extended family to educate one.
With the costs of higher education trending higher each year, paying for college has become a top-tier life expense, alongside other big-ticket goals like buying a home and planning for retirement. However, education costs have now skyrocketed to the extent that saving for both of those life goals—retirement and home-buying—has become hampered in some families.

Some parents are cutting back on retirement savings contributions to help fund their children’s education.  At the same time, children are entering their 20’s with student loan debt, which in some cases is delaying the purchase of their first home. Even grandparents have modified life goals, choosing to help grandchildren with education expenses now, rather than leaving a larger legacy later.
In short, paying for education has officially become a multigenerational concern. But with a little advance planning, families can make some savvy moves to help prepare for the costs of college. 





The Growing Cost of Education



According to the College Board's latest “Trends in Higher Education" report, the continued increase in average published tuition and fees at colleges and universities is now outpacing the growth in family incomes, financial aid and many consumer goods and services. It now costs, on average, $45,370 per year for tuition, fees, room and board, for a four-year private college. Assuming a college-cost inflation rate of 3%, today’s 8-year-old child may need $255,090 come college time in 2027.
“For parents, the number-one goal from a financial planning perspective is still retirement, but close behind is paying for a child’s education,” says Marc Dextraze, Executive Director, Morgan Stanley Wealth Management Investment Solutions.




It takes a village to raise a child, but in 2017 it may take an extended family to educate one.

One option, says Dextraze, is for parents to start saving early with a 529 college savings plan.  “Having a head start on the costs means less sacrifice later on, avoiding the heavy burden of parental loans," he says. For the child, “Having all or most of their college funding in place means they have more options, like being able to select the college that best fits their interests and goals, as opposed to the college that offers the most aid. And graduating with less student debt means having the ability to pursue the next chapter of their lives with more financial freedom."
Named after Section 529 of the Internal Revenue Code, a 529 plan is a tax-advantaged savings vehicle which allows you to save, or even pay in advance, for college expenses. Earnings in a 529 plan can be tax deferred, and the withdrawals are exempt from federal and state income taxes if you use the funds for qualified expenses such as tuition, fees, room and board and supplies. Many states also offer state tax deductions or tax credits on top of that.





Making Education a Family Affair



Motivated by persistent news headlines about the growing costs of education, grandparents, relatives and even family friends have also begun creating 529 accounts in a child’s name. Not only do 529 plans offer potential tax advantages, they allow the family member or friend to give the gift of education and a young adulthood free from student debt.
“Today it definitely takes a village to send a child to college," says Jennifer Tierney, Vice President, Morgan Stanley Wealth Management Investment Solutions and 529 plans product manager. “It's so important to plan ahead. For grandparents, aunts and uncles, family friends, it just makes sense to leverage the benefits that 529 plans provide to a child and from a tax-perspective, to themselves.”

A Flexible Way to Save and Invest for College



The appeal of 529 plans may derive from their benefits and flexibility.
There are no income restrictions, no required minimum distributions, no limits on the number of accounts the same person or entity can own, generally no maximum age limits for establishing an account, and high contribution limits. Virtually anyone can be named a beneficiary—a child, grandchild, niece, nephew, spouse, even a friend.1
According to Chris Stack, a managing consultant at Savingforcollege.com, one of the most overlooked benefits is the daily access and liquidity of the 529 account, as opposed to a UTMA (Uniform Transfers to Minors Act) or UGMA (Uniform Gifts to Minors Act) account or other strategy. “With 529s, grandparents or extended family give themselves an option, but not an obligation, to apply their funds to help pay college costs," he says. 


Another significant benefit of 529 plans is tax-free compounding. “Earning on an account’s growth, rather than paying taxes on the earnings, provides more funding available in future years when the college costs become a family reality," Stack says. “Having the ability to withdraw the principal and tax-deferred earnings without any federal or state income tax liability is a very significant benefit, especially when compared to alternative strategies such as using a life insurance policy or a taxable account."
Stack recommends that families start preparing for college costs as early as possible. While as soon as the child is born is ideal, he said, some even “begin with an account in their own name years before their first child is born knowing the designated beneficiary can be changed in the future."
Says Dextraze, “At the end of the day, the idea is to harmonize all of your goals, taking whatever tax advantages you can through the various kinds of plans out there, including 401Ks, 529s and others. It’s using all of the available tools. That’s how you reach your goals.”


Morgan Stanley offers many 529s from some of the nation’s leading mutual fund companies. You can choose from a range of investment strategies depending on the specific plan, the age of the beneficiary, your financial objectives and risk tolerance. Talk with your Morgan Stanley Financial Advisor, or find one using the locator below, for more information. 
















1 Some plans may have age, residency or other restrictions and may charge a fee for beneficiary changes, and beneficiary changes may result in an immediate tax liability if the new beneficiary is not a member of the old beneficiary’s family. Contribution limits vary by state. Refer to the individual plan for specific guidelines.


Disclosures
An investor should consider the investment objectives, risks, and charges and expenses associated with 529 plans and municipal fund securities before investing. More information about municipal fund securities is available in the issuer's official statement – the 529 Plan Program Disclosure – which is available from your Financial Advisor. It should be read carefully before investing.
Investments are subject to market risk and may fluctuate in value. Before investing, investors should consider whether tax or other benefits are only available for investments in the investor’s home-state 529 college savings plan. Assets can accumulate and be withdrawn federally tax-free only if they are used to pay for qualified expenses. Earnings on nonqualified distributions will be subject to income tax and a 10% federal income tax penalty. Some states offer favorable tax treatment and other benefits to their residents only if they invest in the state’s own Qualified Tuition Program. Investors should consult with their financial and tax advisor before investing in any 529 plan, or contact their state tax division for more information. Some plans may have age, residency or other restrictions and may charge a fee for beneficiary changes.
Morgan Stanley Smith Barney LLC (“Morgan Stanley”), its affiliates and Morgan Stanley Financial Advisors do not provide tax or legal advice. Clients should consult their personal tax advisor for tax-related matters and their attorney for legal matters.

                            Navigate the money taboo and get together around what really matters—your family.
                        





What’s the hardest thing to talk about? Death, religion, politics? Would it surprise you to know that one of the most difficult things to discuss is money? When polled, 44% of Americans claimed that personal finance was the hardest to discuss – beating out politics and even death.1
Perhaps this is because money represents more than a topic – it can represent control, power, embarrassment, insecurity, fear. For some people, the hesitation stems from a natural reluctance to confront their own mortality or their potential for future disability. For others, avoiding the topic is caused by the perception that planning is associated with complicated—and expensive—legal and tax issues.

Silence Can Be Harmful



Avoiding these sometimes difficult conversations can have detrimental outcomes and unexpected consequences for your family, such as:
Passing On Bad Habits - Talking to your children about money now can help them avoid mistakes in the future. The key is to talk about what money means to you and why you worked hard to achieve your success. It involves being open about the challenges and responsibilities that accompany wealth – including what you might have wished you’d done differently when younger. And, most important, it’s about your values and what you wish for yourself and your children to accomplish with your privilege. The conversation can serve as an empowering first step to forming a healthy relationship with wealth.
Lost Opportunities - It’s never too early for your children to understand the value of creating a wealth plan that takes family members’ needs into account. Family members may not be aligned on priorities, such as long-term health care needs, charitable giving and generational gifting strategies, and taking the time to establish common goals is the first step in understanding how all members can participate in achieving them. 
The reality is that 70% of families lose their wealth by the second generation.[ii] Lack of communication can ultimately lead to misunderstandings and divergent objectives that could jeopardize your legacy and work against your values.
Costly Procrastination - Perhaps the hardest of conversations to have as an adult is with your aging parents. This is where the danger of putting it off grows exponentially. According to the U.S. Department of Health and Human services, 70% of people over 65 will require some long-term care at some point in their lives.[iii] Once a crisis hits, it’s often too late. Now is the time to determine if sufficient long-term health care plans have been made, as well as who will make financial decisions on your parents’ behalf if they lose the ability to safely handle their money. Proper planning gives you time to discuss your decisions with family members. This open communication can help to reduce, if not eliminate, the risk of family discord, resentment or conflict.




Having a hard time starting a conversation about family finances? Here are a few questions to make it easy for you.



 
Is it important to talk about money as a family?




 
At what age do you hope to retire?




 
When is it ok to borrow money?




 
What's your favorite charitable cause and why?




 
How is your generation different from the generations before you?




 
Should children give to charity?

A New Paradigm for Family Wealth Planning











Align Your Goals with Strategies for Reaching Them



Morgan Stanley’s goals-based wealth planning framework strives to guard against more than just market volatility. We believe that a successful planning strategy must meet the following criteria:
1. Your plan should be customized to reflect what you care about most. It should address both the goals you hope to achieve and the risk of outliving your assets.
2. Your plan should address the shifting nature of issues and unknowns you face at different stages of your life and consider risks beyond market volatility, like inflation.
3. Your plan should seek to mitigate judgment and behavioral risks such as panic selling in difficult markets or overspending.





Smash the Taboo



We know it’s hard. Sitting down to discuss your parents’ long-term health needs or checking in with your siblings to see if you are all on the same page relating to any inheritance isn’t easy. What about your children; do they value the same causes that have moved you all your life? Is your spouse prepared should something happen to you?
The tough part is getting started, and that’s where bringing in an objective financial professional can help. We understand that wealth is about much more than just money, and can guide the conversation down those difficult paths to uncover the things that matter most to you and your family. We don’t believe in having a single conversation, but rather a series of talks that shift as your life changes. It’s a road. And you don’t have to travel it alone.
It starts with family, but doesn’t have to end there. We are ready to provide the guidance, tools and information that can help you tackle these difficult topics and transform them into meaningful discussions for your future. Uncover what matters most to you and find a Morgan Stanley Financial Advisor to help guide the conversation. Because the road starts here.

KeyBank announces plans to acquire First Niagara

















































Better Together
KeyCorp to acquire First Niagara Financial Group, becoming the 13th largest U.S. commercial bank, with enhanced presence in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic.












October 30, 2015 – Cleveland, Ohio -- KeyCorp (NYSE: KEY) and First Niagara Financial Group (NASDAQ: FNFG) announced today that they have entered into a definitive agreement under which KeyCorp will acquire First Niagara in a cash and stock transaction for total consideration valued at approximately $4.1 billion.
First Niagara headquartered in Buffalo, N.Y., has $39 billion in assets and $29 billion in deposits and 394 banking offices in New York, Pennsylvania, Connecticut and Massachusetts. With approximately $135 billion of assets, the combined bank will be the 13th largest commercial bank headquartered in the U.S.
The combination will create a leading regional bank with enhanced scale to serve three million clients across diverse markets in the Northeast, Mid-Atlantic, Midwest and Pacific Northwest. The acquisition will make KeyCorp a leading bank in Upstate New York, with a strong market presence in Buffalo, Albany, Syracuse and Rochester. KeyCorp will also expand its operations to large, attractive metropolitan areas throughout Pennsylvania, Massachusetts and Connecticut.
Under the terms of the agreement, which was unanimously approved by the Boards of Directors of each company, the merger consideration will be approximately $4.1 billion. First Niagara shareholders will receive 0.68 KeyCorp shares and $2.30 in cash for each First Niagara common share. The per share consideration is valued at $11.40 per share based on the closing price of KeyCorp common stock on October 29, 2015. In conjunction with the closing of the transaction, three members of the First Niagara Board of Directors are expected to join the KeyCorp Board, which will be expanded accordingly.
“Key and First Niagara are a powerful combination, driven by a shared commitment to the clients and to the communities we serve,” said KeyCorp Chairman and CEO Beth Mooney. “This transformational opportunity will bring compelling and complementary capabilities to our shared 3 million clients, while driving meaningful synergies and enhancing shareholder value. KeyBank and First Niagara both have values-based cultures and a long-term commitment to and experience with the region.”
“I am confident that the combination of First Niagara and Key will benefit our shareholders, customers and the communities we serve and will build off the great progress that the First Niagara team has made,” said Nathaniel D. Woodson, Chairman of the Board of Directors of First Niagara. “We believe that this partnership provides significant value for our shareholders and allows them to participate in the upside potential of the combined Key and First Niagara.”
“I am incredibly proud of all that my team has accomplished to put our customers at the center of all we do,” said Gary M. Crosby, President and CEO of First Niagara. “Combining our strengths with those of Key will enable us to even better serve customers with a broader set of product features and functionality, while providing our team members with expanded opportunities as part of a larger, more-diversified organization. Key shares our values and our culture of diversity, inclusion and community service – I look forward to working with their team to ensure a seamless integration of our businesses for the benefit of all of our stakeholders.”
“We have known First Niagara for a long time and have always been impressed by the quality of their people and their commitment to the community. We look forward to welcoming First Niagara clients and employees to Key,” said Mooney.
Importantly, the compelling financial rationale for the transaction provides significant upside potential for shareholders of both companies. The acquisition diversifies KeyCorp’s loan portfolio, strengthens its core retail deposit franchise and provides expanded scale. Upon completion of the transaction, the combined company will have approximately $99.8 billion in deposits, $83.6 billion in loans and 1,366 branches across 15 states. The combined company will have approximately $135 billion of pro forma assets providing increased operating leverage to deliver improved financial performance.
Shareholders of both companies will benefit from annual cost savings in excess of $400 million from maximizing efficiencies of technology infrastructure, procurement savings across the combined organization, and optimizing overlapping branches. The combined bank will be better positioned to generate attractive financial returns for shareholders through improved efficiency, strong returns on capital and earnings accretion. Finally KeyCorp will maintain its strong capital position, enabling the company to continue to return capital to shareholders.
KeyCorp expects the acquisition to be accretive to earnings per share in 2017, excluding one-time charges, and expects the transaction to deliver an attractive Internal Rate of Return of approximately 15%.
KeyCorp and First Niagara have built a legacy of philanthropy and civic involvement and will continue this commitment to the markets the combined company will serve. Together, the combined companies have nearly $5 billion in lending and investments supporting underserved individuals and communities. Additionally, Key will make a $20 million contribution to the First Niagara Foundation to continue its important community initiatives.
Upon closing the transaction, KeyCorp expects to successfully integrate First Niagara into its business. KeyCorp and First Niagara have the shared expertise, the culture and the capital to ensure a successful transition. Christopher M. Gorman, President of Key Corporate Bank, will lead the merger integration team which will be comprised of both KeyCorp and First Niagara team members. “Chris is a dynamic, client-centric leader who is credited with successfully leading, integrating, transforming, and growing businesses throughout his 30-year career in financial services,” said Mooney.
The acquisition is subject to customary closing conditions, including regulatory approvals and approval by KeyCorp and First Niagara shareholders. The transaction is expected to close in the third quarter of 2016.

History[edit]
It was founded in 1870 as Farmers and Mechanics' Savings Bank and was then re-branded as Lockport Savings Bank in 1967. In 2000 the bank was rebranded as First Niagara. The bank was based in its former home county, Niagara until the 1990s when it spread to nearby Buffalo, New York and its surrounding Erie County. Part of this growth could be attributed to the collapse of the Buffalo-centric banks Goldome and Empire of America.[4] Most of this growth was from the recruitment of new customers, as opposed to the purchase of other firms' assets. Although, in 1998 the bank did purchase the regional insurance brokerage firm Warren-Hoffman & Associates Inc. as a means of entering the insurance business.[5] First Niagara in 2000 acquired Albion Bancorp in Albion, NY Bring Banks branches up to 22.
In 2002, First Niagara acquired Cayuga Bank of Auburn, New York and Cortland Savings Bank in Cortland, New York. In 2003, First Niagara acquired the Bank of Finger Lakes in Geneva, New York. In 2004, First Niagara acquired Troy Savings Bank in Albany, New York.[6] In 2005, First Niagara acquired Hudson River Bank and Trust in Hudson, New York.

In September 2007, it was announced that First Niagara was to purchase Great Lakes Bancorp, parent company of Greater Buffalo Savings Bank. The price to purchase the 16 branch bank was $153 million. With the nearly $900 million of assets of the Great Lakes Bancorp, First Niagara became the fourth largest bank in the Buffalo-Niagara region [1] [2]. In April 2009, First Niagara acquired 57 of the 61 of National City branches in Erie and Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. They were rebranded on Labor Day weekend in 2009. In conjunction with the expansion into Pittsburgh, First Niagara bought the naming rights for a concert venue, First Niagara Pavilion.
In April 2010, First Niagara Financial Group acquired Pennsylvania-based Harleysville National. This created a bank with $19.7 billion in assets, 254 branches and approximately $13.7 billion in deposits.
In August 2010, First Niagara announced its acquisition of NewAlliance Bank of Connecticut.[7] The stock holders approved the merger in December 2010 and the transaction closed on April 15, 2011. This provided First Niagara with over 340 branches and 500 ATMs.
On July 31, 2011, First Niagara announced that it had bought all of HSBC's upstate New York branches for $1 billion.[8] This included the bulk of what had been First Niagara's longtime rival in Western New York, Marine Midland Bank. On August 25, 2011, First Niagara bought the naming rights for HSBC Arena in Buffalo, renaming it the First Niagara Center.[9]
On October 30, 2015, First Niagara Bank agreed to be acquired by KeyCorp.[10] 18 branches in Erie and Niagara Counties will be sold to Northwest Savings Bank for antitrust reasons.[11]
21st century growth[edit]
National City[edit]
On April 7, 2009, First Niagara agreed to buy 57 National City branches in Western Pennsylvania from PNC Financial Services[12] and officially took over those branches on September 8 after the signs were changed over from National City during Labor Day Weekend.[13]

PNC, which had acquired National City in late 2008 with money from the $700 billion bailout plan after National City suffered losses in the subprime mortgage crisis, was required by the United States Department of Justice to sell 50 National City branches in the Pittsburgh area and 11 more branches in and around Erie to competitors,[14] since the two banks had significant overlap in Western Pennsylvania—PNC and National City were number 1 and 2 in market share, respectively[15]—and had potential antitrust issues in the area. (Even after the sale was completed, PNC retained a market-leading 46% share in the Pittsburgh market, with Citizens Financial Group in a distant second at 13%.)[12] A dark horse candidate, the sale to First Niagara was considered a surprise, considering that PNC was also in negotiations with much larger banks such as JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo, Fifth Third Bank, KeyBank, Huntington Bancshares, and FNB Corporation for the branches.[16] Fifth Third, Huntington, & FNB had existing branches in the market, while JPMorgan Chase's retail banking division & Key were in adjacent territories, and Wells Fargo was in the process of expanding its Eastern U.S. operations by way of its acquisition of Wachovia. Before the deal was announced, First Niagara was thought to be interested only in the Erie-area National City branches.[16]

First Niagara, which had been eyeing an expansion into Pittsburgh for some time,[12] was immediately ranked third in market share at 8%, ahead of the longer-established Dollar Bank and First Commonwealth Bank at six and five percent, respectively.[12] First Niagara retained all National City employees at the acquired branches in the Pittsburgh and Erie areas, and established a regional office in Downtown Pittsburgh's 11 Stanwix Street tower.[12]
First Niagara was outbid for the four branches in Crawford County, Pennsylvania that PNC had to divest.[17] Of those four, one branch in Titusville was sold to Emclaire Financial Group[18] while the other three (one in Conneaut Lake, the other two in Meadville, including the branch inside Wal-Mart) were sold to Marquette Savings Bank.[19]
On August 4, 2009, First Niagara agreed to take over the automatic teller machines (ATMs) at 95 Sheetz locations throughout Western Pennsylvania, replacing M&T Bank, which doesn't have any bank branches in the region.[20] The ATMs, which officially become First Niagara ATMs at the same time First Niagara took over the former National City branches, will be surcharge-free from First Niagara itself, though people using the ATMs may still be charged a foreign ATM fee from their primary financial institution if they charge such fees. The ATM's were later replaced by PNC across Sheetz's footprint.[21]
Harleysville National[edit]
On July 27, 2009, First Niagara agreed to acquire the Philadelphia-area-based Harleysville National Corporation financial services company in an all-stock transaction valued at approximately US$237,000,000 or $5.50 per share, allowing First Niagara its first access to the Philadelphia market.[22] The deal provided First Niagara with $5.6 billion in assets, including $3.6 billion in loans and $4.1 billion in deposits in 83 bank branches in nine Eastern Pennsylvania counties. The parent company of Harleysville National Bank also operates East Penn Bank, Millennium Wealth Management and Cornerstone Companies. First Niagara maintained all Harleysville National and East Penn branches, and the Pennsylvania company's growing commercial banking and wealth-management business. Harleysville had over 1,100 employees. The deal was completed on April 9, 2010.[23]
HSBC deal expands presence in northeastern U.S.[edit]
On July 31, 2011, First Niagara announced it would purchase from UK-based HSBC Holdings plc nearly half of its HSBC Bank USA branch network, including 195 branches for a price of US$1 billion. Of these, 183 branches are in upstate New York, six in New York City suburbs, and six in Connecticut; most of these branches had been part of Buffalo-based Marine Midland Bank before being re-branded to HSBC Bank USA in the late 1990s. The deal included US$15 billion in deposits, US$2.8 billion in loans, and US$4.3 billion in assets under management. The deal also nearly doubled First Niagara's branch network to about 450 branches, US$38 billion in assets, and US$30 billion in deposits. Pending regulatory approval, the deal will close in early 2012. Investors had complained that HSBC had spread itself too thinly, with roughly 95 million customers and 300,000 employees in 87 markets. As a result of the acquisition, the United States Department of Justice required First Niagara to divest itself of 26 branches.[24] First Niagara ended up spinning off 64 branches; 37 to KeyBank, 19 to Community Bank, and 8 to Five Star Bank.[25]
On October 30, 2015, First Niagara Bank agreed to be acquired by KeyCorp.[10]

In September 2007, it was announced that First Niagara was to purchase Great Lakes Bancorp, parent company of Greater Buffalo Savings Bank. The price to purchase the 16 branch bank was $153 million. With the nearly $900 million of assets of the Great Lakes Bancorp, First Niagara became the fourth largest bank in the Buffalo-Niagara region [1] [2]. In April 2009, First Niagara acquired 57 of the 61 of National City branches in Erie and Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. They were rebranded on Labor Day weekend in 2009. In conjunction with the expansion into Pittsburgh, First Niagara bought the naming rights for a concert venue, First Niagara Pavilion.
In April 2010, First Niagara Financial Group acquired Pennsylvania-based Harleysville National. This created a bank with $19.7 billion in assets, 254 branches and approximately $13.7 billion in deposits.
In August 2010, First Niagara announced its acquisition of NewAlliance Bank of Connecticut.[7] The stock holders approved the merger in December 2010 and the transaction closed on April 15, 2011. This provided First Niagara with over 340 branches and 500 ATMs.
On July 31, 2011, First Niagara announced that it had bought all of HSBC's upstate New York branches for $1 billion.[8] This included the bulk of what had been First Niagara's longtime rival in Western New York, Marine Midland Bank. On August 25, 2011, First Niagara bought the naming rights for HSBC Arena in Buffalo, renaming it the First Niagara Center.[9]
On October 30, 2015, First Niagara Bank agreed to be acquired by KeyCorp.[10] 18 branches in Erie and Niagara Counties will be sold to Northwest Savings Bank for antitrust reasons.[11]
21st century growth[edit]
National City[edit]
On April 7, 2009, First Niagara agreed to buy 57 National City branches in Western Pennsylvania from PNC Financial Services[12] and officially took over those branches on September 8 after the signs were changed over from National City during Labor Day Weekend.[13]




A First Niagara branch in Cranberry Township, Pennsylvania along U.S. Route 19 just off the Pennsylvania Turnpike. This is a former National City branch.


PNC, which had acquired National City in late 2008 with money from the $700 billion bailout plan after National City suffered losses in the subprime mortgage crisis, was required by the United States Department of Justice to sell 50 National City branches in the Pittsburgh area and 11 more branches in and around Erie to competitors,[14] since the two banks had significant overlap in Western Pennsylvania—PNC and National City were number 1 and 2 in market share, respectively[15]—and had potential antitrust issues in the area. (Even after the sale was completed, PNC retained a market-leading 46% share in the Pittsburgh market, with Citizens Financial Group in a distant second at 13%.)[12] A dark horse candidate, the sale to First Niagara was considered a surprise, considering that PNC was also in negotiations with much larger banks such as JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo, Fifth Third Bank, KeyBank, Huntington Bancshares, and FNB Corporation for the branches.[16] Fifth Third, Huntington, & FNB had existing branches in the market, while JPMorgan Chase's retail banking division & Key were in adjacent territories, and Wells Fargo was in the process of expanding its Eastern U.S. operations by way of its acquisition of Wachovia. Before the deal was announced, First Niagara was thought to be interested only in the Erie-area National City branches.[16]




First Niagara branch footprint as of March 2013.


First Niagara, which had been eyeing an expansion into Pittsburgh for some time,[12] was immediately ranked third in market share at 8%, ahead of the longer-established Dollar Bank and First Commonwealth Bank at six and five percent, respectively.[12] First Niagara retained all National City employees at the acquired branches in the Pittsburgh and Erie areas, and established a regional office in Downtown Pittsburgh's 11 Stanwix Street tower.[12]
First Niagara was outbid for the four branches in Crawford County, Pennsylvania that PNC had to divest.[17] Of those four, one branch in Titusville was sold to Emclaire Financial Group[18] while the other three (one in Conneaut Lake, the other two in Meadville, including the branch inside Wal-Mart) were sold to Marquette Savings Bank.[19]
On August 4, 2009, First Niagara agreed to take over the automatic teller machines (ATMs) at 95 Sheetz locations throughout Western Pennsylvania, replacing M&T Bank, which doesn't have any bank branches in the region.[20] The ATMs, which officially become First Niagara ATMs at the same time First Niagara took over the former National City branches, will be surcharge-free from First Niagara itself, though people using the ATMs may still be charged a foreign ATM fee from their primary financial institution if they charge such fees. The ATM's were later replaced by PNC across Sheetz's footprint.[21]
Harleysville National[edit]
On July 27, 2009, First Niagara agreed to acquire the Philadelphia-area-based Harleysville National Corporation financial services company in an all-stock transaction valued at approximately US$237,000,000 or $5.50 per share, allowing First Niagara its first access to the Philadelphia market.[22] The deal provided First Niagara with $5.6 billion in assets, including $3.6 billion in loans and $4.1 billion in deposits in 83 bank branches in nine Eastern Pennsylvania counties. The parent company of Harleysville National Bank also operates East Penn Bank, Millennium Wealth Management and Cornerstone Companies. First Niagara maintained all Harleysville National and East Penn branches, and the Pennsylvania company's growing commercial banking and wealth-management business. Harleysville had over 1,100 employees. The deal was completed on April 9, 2010.[23]
HSBC deal expands presence in northeastern U.S.[edit]
On July 31, 2011, First Niagara announced it would purchase from UK-based HSBC Holdings plc nearly half of its HSBC Bank USA branch network, including 195 branches for a price of US$1 billion. Of these, 183 branches are in upstate New York, six in New York City suburbs, and six in Connecticut; most of these branches had been part of Buffalo-based Marine Midland Bank before being re-branded to HSBC Bank USA in the late 1990s. The deal included US$15 billion in deposits, US$2.8 billion in loans, and US$4.3 billion in assets under management. The deal also nearly doubled First Niagara's branch network to about 450 branches, US$38 billion in assets, and US$30 billion in deposits. Pending regulatory approval, the deal will close in early 2012. Investors had complained that HSBC had spread itself too thinly, with roughly 95 million customers and 300,000 employees in 87 markets. As a result of the acquisition, the United States Department of Justice required First Niagara to divest itself of 26 branches.[24] First Niagara ended up spinning off 64 branches; 37 to KeyBank, 19 to Community Bank, and 8 to Five Star Bank.[25]
On October 30, 2015, First Niagara Bank agreed to be acquired by KeyCorp.[10]

(AP-Modified) - KeyCorp will stretch its reach deeper into the Northeast with a $4.1 billion deal to buy First Niagara Financial Group and create the 13th largest commercial bank in the United States.Cleveland-based KeyCorp says it will offer a portion of its stock and $2.30 in cash for each First Niagara share. The total comes to $11.40 per share based on the Thursday closing price of Key Corp's stock.What will happen to the First Niagara Center?That represents a roughly 10 percent premium to First Niagara's $10.38 closing price on Thursday. Its shares are up almost 2 percent in premarket trading before the market opens.During a conference call Thursday morning, bank leaders spoke at length about how this deal will benefit their shareholders and how they will be able to offer more services to their combined customers. But they didn't say much at all about what this means for employees or how the transferring of customers' accounts will be handled.What's the future of Larkinville without its major tenant?The deal, which will need to be approved by federal regulators and by each company's shareholders, is expected to close in the third quarter of 2016. The Board of Directors of each company unanimously approved the move.Gary Crosby, President and CEO of First Niagara, said, "Combining our strengths with those of Key will enable us to even better serve customers with a broader set of product features and functionality, while providing our team members with expanded opportunities as part of a larger, more-diversified organization."Christopher Gorman, President of Key Corporate Bank, will lead the merger integration team, which will have both Key Bank and First Niagara team members.What does the deal mean for customers and employees?Buffalo, New York-based First Niagara has nearly 400 locations in New York, Pennsylvania, Connecticut and Massachusetts. It has $39 billion in assets and $29 billion in deposits.With approximately $135 billion of assets, the combined bank will be the 13th largest commercial bank headquartered in the U.S. with three million clients.First Niagara has a market value of $3.6 billion. It began life as the Lockport Savings Bank in 1967 although the firm can trace its roots back to the early 1870s. It currently employs more than 5,000 people.Just a few days ago, "MONEY Magazine" named First Niagara the best bank in the Northeast in its "Best Banks in America 2015-2016" rankings.One of the goals of the merger is to save $400 million by maximizing efficiencies of technology, purchasing, and optimizing overlapping branches. That has many people wondering if that will mean job loss and branch closures in the Buffalo area."Considering that Key and First Niagara overlap tremendously, I would expect branch closings. I would expect back-offices to be shut down, which will mean there will be job loss," said Erie County Executive Mark Poloncarz.KeyCorp told 7 Eyewitness News that it is still too early in the process to talk about branch closures because it would be unfair to communities, customers and employees.Watch 7 Eyewitness News team coverage of this major announcement.         Stay in Touch Anywhere, Anytime with News, Weather and Video -- Download the WKBW app:Android AppiPhone/iPad AppOr Sign Up for Our Newsletters -- Delivered to Your E-mail:E-News, Forecast and Bills Beat Newsletters          Share Article                   Related   What will happen to First Niagara Center?

                This was my first credit card. I applied for it because I was attempting to establish credit history, and also wanted to be able to charge something in an emergency if needed. Now, I use it for almost all of my purchases in order to accumulate rewards. However, the rewards are not great compared to other rewards programs out there. Points take forever to accumulate unless you are a big spender, and your best value reward is to cash out a $25 account credit after accumulating 3,000 points (spending $3,000). Customer service is easy to work with, but if you're looking to get the most rewards for your purchases, don't choose this card! If you don't care about rewards, then it's a fine card to have.… read more

                This was the first credit card that I ever got. I got it because First Niagara was a trusted bank and there was a branch right near where I was going to college. I got this card to help pay for college stuff like books and in case of emergencies so I didn't use it all the time. That being said, it was really nothing special. The interest rate isn't that great. The rewards aren't that great either. I don't like points systems and would prefer having gotten cash back. Points expire after a few years which is bad for people who don't use credit all the time, since you don't really get to accrue enough points for anything good. Overall I would not recommend this card to others. Not because I had any problems with it or the customer service, but simply because there are much better credit card options out there. Even from First Niagara themselves.… read more

                I opened up a credit card with this bank a few years back and never had an issues with it until it was going to expire. I didn't have a balance at the time so when my new card came I tossed the old one out and didn't think about it. My wife always pays the bills and the next month I had a $50 charge which I made. She used the online bill pay and paid the balance, but unfortunately to the old card which for some reason was now a separate account which we were initially unaware of. The next month the same thing we gather the bill with a few for being late. Unsure why she pays it again. And again to the wrong account. Three more the into this I'm getting calls about an outstanding and later balance of 77 dollars but they are telling me I have another account with 110 dollar credit on it. After fiNall figuring out the problem I asked if they could just pay one with the other and the only answer I recieved was no.. it was an amazing hassle and sad that they dropped the ball for months.… read more

                I have had an account with First Niagara for years. My parents used this local bank while I was growing up, so I didn't do much shopping around for a checking account. I gave 4 stars, because their mobile banking isn't nearly as good as most other banks. It's very slow, almost too secure, and their app isn't designed well at all. Other than that, I have had great experiences with them. I just recently moved across the country, and because they are a local bank in Western NY, it was too inconvenient to stay with them. I was just using up the rest of my money in my account, when an auto payment I had set up, overdrew the account. I was charged $40, and was facing more fees. I called them, and seriously, within 5 minutes of dialing the phone, the fee had already been waved, and my account was closed. It was so easy, fast, and I didn't even have to put up a fight! They are a great company, and have excellent customer service.… read more

                First Niagra Bank is more of a criminal enterprise than bank. They use every trick imaginable in order to collect as many overdraft fees as possible. They hold deposits longer if you account is low. They always process large payments before the smaller ones so that if you do go negative, they get more fees. If you have a lot of money in your account, payments take forever to clear but if you only have a few dollars, they process immediately. On a separate issue... I tried to set up a transfer. (We needed $220 to be routed from our First Niagra account to another bank automatically, every week.) I had to go in three different Saturdays over the course of two months and even then, IT WASN'T SET UP CORRECTLY! Every time we would get a mail, weeks after I went in saying they needed a different form. The third time I went I went to a different branch because I was convinced that the people at the Pittsburgh Street were intellectually impaired. Although the branch I went to wasn't dirty like Pittsburgh Street Branch always is, the woman working there said, and I quote, "We aren't trained to do this.". So, apparently the workers and managers are not trained to set up automatic transfers. (I bet they have extensive, college level, in-depth, week-long seminars on overdraft fee collection theory and practice.) Needless to say, we closed this account. When I went in, I wasn't asked why I was closing it. I was expecting the manager to ask me why I was closing and try to see if he could salvage the relationship. Not only did that NOT happen, the woman who closed the account didn't bother to ask either. They got their final $109 dollars from me, that is all they cared about. So remember, at First Niagra - you are worth less than $109 dollars. If they can get that from you, they'll be happy to see you go. In closing, I would like to warn anyone considering using this bank, especially senior citizens, people on fixed incomes, single moms and everyone who struggles from paycheck to paycheck to avoid this bank completely. They would slowly torture and kill a basket full of kittens and puppies for just one overdraft fee. They are truly evil, in every sense of the word. May God have mercy on their souls.… read more

                I been a long time member of First Niagara going back to the days when it was Lockport Saving Bank, and they've never been anything but helpful. I moved out of the Western New York area about 10 years ago (and far away from any branch), but I've always maintained my account. I still do business in New York, so it is handy to have a couple local accounts. They have always been always willing to help me out with any issue I have had involving transfer and bill payments. These types of problems can be tricky to deal with when I am on the opposite coast, but I can relax, knowing that someone at their customer service will always be willing to work with me to get the problem resolved.… read more

                The most serious problem I have occurred while using First Niagara Simple Checking Account is when I first opened it, I called before I did it to make sure it would be okay and clear normally, but I deposited a third party check for a friend and withdrew the funds out of the ATM for him. I had called and asked if this was okay and they told me it would clear in 2 business days like a regular check. Unfortunately that was not true, it took 5 business days because my account was still new but they failed to tell me than when I called so the money was not available until almost a full week later.… read more

                There are two main reason I chose to have my savings account with First Niagara Bank. The first being that is where I have my checking account so it makes it more conivent for me to have both accounts with the same bank so it is only a one stop for me to do all my banking needs. The second reason is that I found First Niagara's website to be very user-friendly and easily accessible. As I do most of my banking actions online or from my mobile phone, it is very important for me to have a bank with online services that are easy to use as well as efficient when using them.… read more

                This bank would be a great bank if it were not for a very terrible customer service department when you call in on there 800 number.Very unskilled and not at all knowledgeable representatives, that repeatedly ask for the same information, and then when you give it to them they ask for more before they will help you.Then it seems like they are unwilling to solve your problems.Also the web page is not up to par with other checking account web sites.It constanly asks for your zip code when trying to log in. That happens while you are trying to enter your user ID.All in all this just gives me a bad feeling about a company when I cannot get treated with respect when I call in and they put little thought into their web design.… read more

                I've had First Niagara as my checking account for a few years. They are very easy to use. They let me know when my checking account goes below a designated amount and they don't require me to have a minimum amount in my account. I don't make any money on annual interest, which is disappointing. The website is decent to check your account, but I have been with banks who have better accounts. I find it frustrating that I cant see the pictures of the checks that I've written like other banks have on their website. Also, on the app, you can only see transactions for the last 30 days, which doesn't help me much when I'm searching for trends. Other banks also categorize your purchases and show you a pie chart of your expenses. There isnt a windows phone app for this, which was a problem when I had windows phone (the lack of an app for the checking forced me to switching my phone around, with was inconvenient.) They do allow you to take pictures of your checks and have them deposited electronically, which is helpful. They also have branches that you can go to on Sundays, which is good when you have a cash to deposit.… read more

                I think this is a pretty decent account. It has the benefit of returning the money lost from various atm fees. This is pretty important as I am a college student. There is also no minimum balance. This keeps me from losing money from not retaining enough money in my account. Overall I think it is a decent account. Your run of the mill checking account, with benefits for poor college students.

                When we were buying a new car, we went through First Niagara because of their great rates. In a very short period of time, we were able to open an account. While we were doing that, I met several people in our local branch, and everyone is great. Everyone we met that day was very service-oriented. They were very prompt on getting all the paperwork done in a timely fashion, and everything went smoothly from the initial application to signing the paperwork.… read more

                Here we have a bank with very good local offices. The 800 number however leaves something to be desired with uninformed reps. The Savings account that I opened was on line and was completely free with a 400 dollar balance,There are no points or matched savings as of now but I do like the idea that I can transfer online from by savings to checking with no hassle at all. The APY of .010 is not to bad at all in my opinion too.The… read more

                I first found about First Niagara by seeing a promo for a very large bonus offer which I took advantage off. They were very prompt with applying it to my account within the 10 days that was stated. Then I had to call customer service to get my account number since I applied on line and it was not furnished! No one would give me my account number. All I had was the last 4 numbers.So I could not do business with my new account!Catch 22 became my situation. Compliments to my local branch 30 miles away since they gave me my number so I could us my account and link it to other accounts. There they admitted how terrible the 800 customer service is. So there you have it . A checking account with few fees and a decent on line web service yet zero customer service unless less you want to go to a local branch .Two stars for this bank that is rude when you call them even as a new customer.Also when I asked for my account number they told me it was in my email.then I got an email stating they will never place account number in an emailwow.… read more

                One day I went into First Niagara Bank to cash my check. Usually, this went without a hitch. This time, however, I realized I left my identification at my house. Since I arrived at the bank 10 minutes before close, I knew this would be a problem. The teller understood my frustration and told me to go grab my ID. I went, and 30 minutes later, I returned with ID in hand. My teller unlocked the door to let me back in and finished my transaction. This really helped me out a bunch, and just showed how above & beyond this teller went to make sure I got what I came for. Customer service like this is rare now and days!… read more

                Signing up for a checking account with First Niagara was as easy as you could ever imagine. You simply log on to their website and it helps find the perfect account for you. You can choose between if you're a student, just married, dislike your bank, or are new to the area. It will ask you general questions about your finances and situation and ultiamtely will guide you to the perfect bank account. I pay little in the way of fees and the people at the bank and online are always friendly and courteous.… read more

                Two weeks ago I opened my on line First Niagara checking account that offered a 250.00 dollar bonus. During the first week I satisfied the first bonus requirement and made 5 online bill pays. I was shocked to see they credited my account with the 50.00 in just one week!I love this bank so far since I only had to deposit 50.00 to open it and if I use the debit card 10 times per month I will avoid any fees. I hope to satisfy the 10 debit card transactions to get my next 50.00 dollar bonus too. Customer Service is excellent as they gave me a follow up call only two days after signing up on line to make sure I had navigated their system correctly.The only problem I had was after signing up online was I had no access to my full account number.Only the last four. When I called they would not give it to me over the phone.To access my own account number I had to contact them through their secure message service two time to resolve this issue. I am not going to hold this against them due to all the fraud out there theses days. They are just trying to be secure!.… read more

                Very good experience with this bank after just opening accounts on line a few weeks ago.Savings account is free with just a 400.00 daily balance kept in it and it come with online services that are very good. After opening my new account on line I received a call from their customer service department within two days to make sure I was satisfied.I liked that a lot. Also I stopped in to the nearest local branch to check it out, and the manager introduced himself to me and was very friendly. This is a bank that is interested in satisfied customers and building their business. That is my impression anyway.All in all so far I am satisfied with my new bank.… read more

                I was originally a client of HSBC US with a student account. Once, HSBC sold a majority of their operations to First Niagara, my account was transferred to them. Everything seemed to work okay at first, until I started getting charged for too low minimum balance on my account for a couple of months. When I called to inquire on why, I was told that in fact my student account had not been migrated to a First Niagara student account, but some other type. Changing the account type over the phone was apparently impossible, and so was canceling the account. I was out of the country at the time and couldn't go to an actual branch, so I had no way of fixing the problem. It was quite a disappointing experience, and I canceled my checking account as soon as I had the opportunity.… read more

                I have had accounts with First Niagara Bank for years. I had never had a problem, until recently, I noticed that I was being charged a monthly fee on my savings account. I had never been required to keep a minimum balance in the past and was not aware of any policy changes. I spoke with a customer service representative about this and it was explained to me that they did send a notice and would now require the minimum balance. I explained that I did not want an account with that stipulation and asked if there was any other option. The representative explained that the policy required that, or, I could have two direct deposits per month to avoid paying the fee. The representative explained that I could split my current direct deposit to my checking account and have part of it added to my savings account. This ended up working out really well. I was very pleased with this solution. The representative also credited back the two fees that had billed already on the account.… read more

                I just opened a checking account with First Niagara and I must say I am very impressed. They have free personal checking as long as you have a direct deposit set up. You don't get any over draft charges for anything under $5, and their employees are very helpful and kind. I would recommend their bank to anyone looking for a good one!!

                First Niagara bank’s basic savings account is, for the most part, a quality savings account. First off, it has free online banking which is an amazing tool to use for managing your finances. Secondly, they offer a free atm card with the creation of a basic savings account, which allows the customer to withdraw money from a number of different atms free of charge. Additionally, they have exceptional service. The only downside to their savings account is that they have a somewhat high minimum balance, and they charge you fees if you are under that balance.… read more

                My experience with First Niagara's most basic savings account has been pretty good. I haven't run into any problems, and they always seem prompt and attentive when I try to contact the bank for information or with any questions. What's more, I really like their online banking system, which allows me to easily and immediately transfer money from my savings account into my checking account, which has helped cover me on a number of occasions. Still, there are a few features about this account that I dislike. Firstly, they only allow you to withdraw money from this account so many times a month without a fee, which is definitely irritating. If I used this account more often, it might be a serious problem. Secondly, their online system is somewhat annoying, in that you have to change your password quite frequently. I realize this is for security purposes, but it's caused me to forget my login information on a number of occasions. All-in-all, though, I'm satisfied with this account.… read more

                I had a horrible experience with this credit card. I actually didn't intend to sign up for it, but when my HSBC accounts switched over to First Niagara, they gave me this card for free. While I'm sure the card would have worked well in emergencies, for some reason, they automatically linked it to cover my overdraft fees, which became a huge fiasco and headache, and forced me to ultimately pay more money than I would have without the card. The card was also quite difficult to cancel, and took a couple of phone calls. I'd recommend looking for one of their other credit cards, if you must go with First Niagara.… read more

                The First Niagara Platinum MasterCard is the newest credit card that I've added to my wallet. This card is a "for emergencies" card; because it has no fee and the interest rate is SUPERB! Also, the fact that it is a MasterCard is another huge plus, as the rest of my cards are all Visas; so having some variety is quite nice. Honestly though, the best part of this card is it's huge grace period. 25 days is a long time to help reconcile a late fee; which makes this card absolutely perfect for an emergencies only card. Knowing that I can safely repair my car, and have ample time to pay the balance off is a huge weight lifted off my shoulders.… read more

                I am very pleased with First Niagara Bank. I gave them a shot because they are a local business and they really do a great job at taking care of their customer. I love their program where any non-FNB ATMs do not charge me a fee because it saves me so much money, especially when I am out somewhere and am in a bind for cash. I haven't dealt with their customer service that much because I haven't had problems but I really think that they do a great job at making sure their customers needs are met at all times. If you are looking for a bank in Western New York, go for it.… read more

                I used this car to transfer two other balances onto to get my household down to a single credit card. It had a 0 percent introductory APR for the first six months after the transfer. This helped me chip away at that debt big time. After that, my interest rate was about 15 percent. This is not great, but there are cards with 18-20 percent or more out there - including ones I've held - so it's not horrible, either. The standard rate for purchases is around 14 percent, which again isn't too bad in today's market. This is my only card, but it would be my primary card if I held more than one today.… read more

                I used First Niagara bank for my business checking account for years but only because it was the closest bank to me locally. It is pretty decent but nothing spectacular. They have a pretty steep ATM fee for when you use non-First Niagara ATMs so I try to avoid those at all costs. That can get pretty inconvenient. They also recently added a monthly fee for checking accounts that have below a certain amount of money in them by the end of the month. I fortunately have not been hit with that fee yet or I would probably rate it lower. If you have a small business that doesn't keep a lot of cash in your accounts you might be better off just looking elsewhere.… read more

                I ended up with First Niagara after they bought out New Alliance. I was weary at first because I had never heard of them before, but I am so glad that I ended up with them! The tellers and the branch managers are all extremely nice and helpful. Recently, I purchased a new vehicle. I decided to go with First Niagara for my loan because I already bank with them. They took an extra .7% off of my interest rate because I had an account with them and could do automatic debit for my payments. Which makes life so much easier. After filling out the papers, it only took two days for everything to be finalized. I would definitely recommend this bank to anyone I know. You wont be disappointed.… read more

                I was transferred to First Niagara Bank after it bought out HSBC branches in upstate New York. But since they took over, First Niagara has been nothing but great to deal with. An introductory phone call when they first took over answered most of my concerns. And some of their policies - like funds being instantly available, in most cases - outpace the policies of other banks I've been a customer of. First Niagara admittedly wasn't my first choice, but circumstances have made it a favorite of mine now.… read more

                My bank was switched from HSBC to First Niagara some time ago. I just have not been able to write a review about the switching process yet. While switching there were very customer orientated, and always picked up the phone when I had problems. The only problem that I had with the switch was when my card wasn't able to work for a week because everyone was having problems with there's as well. With that situation at hand I knew that problem like that though that was expected. Even with that I still see them as a great bank to belong to! Great job First Niagara!… read more

                My bank was recently bought out by First Niagara bank, and so far I've had no problems with them, in fact they might be slightly better than my older bank. The main point to stress is that their online banking software runs very well on all of my devices -- whether I'm checking my balance on my iPhone, or balancing my account through my laptop, it all seems to work seamlessly and flawlessly. The employees at my branch were conveniently the same ones that worked at my older branch, I knew them fairly well and they've always been very helpful. If you're looking for something basic, I can say I haven't had any problems with First Niagara.… read more

                When my local HSBC Bank became First Niagara, I was originally apprehensive. I came to soon find out that First Niagara was in fact a lot better than my previous bank. The customer service at First Niagara is especially top notch. The teller went out of her way to teach me how to use the check deposit feature at the ATM outside of the building. I also like to use telephone banking a lot to check my current account balance and debit/credits. Phone banking is a lot easier with First Niagara because the menu system is very easy and you can quickly navigate to exactly what you want to hear. I would definitely recommend First Niagara as a bank for personal checking accounts.… read more

                My experiences with First Niagara Bank have been stressful and unsatisfactory, on the whole, and I've actually been considering switching banks.I originally had an account through HSBC, and I'd never had a problem with them. However, HSBC shut down all of its bank branches in my part of the US, and there was an automatic switchover to First Niagara. I figured that hey, they're a more localized company. Why not give them a try?However, almost immediately, I had problems. About two weeks after the switchover, somebody put a debit card scanning device on the ATM inside my local First Niagara bank branch. They ended up getting the information for many different patrons of the branch, including myself. Though I was reimbursed quickly for the money taken out of my account by the perpetrators (over $700 total), the process was long and harrowing, and it seemed like they were accusing me of doing something wrong or irresponsible. But it was at their actual bank location that the skimming occurred! The whole reimbursement was not officially approved or resolved until months later. I should mention that the customer service of the bank tellers and managers at my actual branch location was amazing. They were very helpful, supportive and informative. However, they were previous employees of HSBC, so I can't give First Niagara credit for hiring them.Besides that whole fiasco, I've just found First Niagara to be a little shady or tight-lipped when it comes to added fees. For example, soon after the switchover, they implemented fees for not having enough money in your checking account, which HSBC had never done. Also, I recently received a bill of $15 for too many transactions in one month, but was never made aware that such fees existed.I'm still on the lookout for a new bank, and I caution anyone considering signing up with First Niagara. I'm sure many people have had positive experiences with them, and it is nice that they're regional, but I wish they were friendlier to willing customers and that they informed you more about their fees.… read more

                I have been a satisfied customer of First Niagara bank for years. I have a checking account through them. I never have any trouble getting new checks or registries, and I've found the representatives at every branch I've visited to be pleasant and accommodating. The website is also easy to navigate and use. Several years ago fraudulent charges began to show up on my debit card. I visited my local branch, and the gentleman who I spoke with was very helpful. He immediately assisted me in cancelling my card, disputing the charge, and applying for a new card. The new card arrived in the exact amount of time that he said it would. I've also found that there are plenty of convenient locations near both my work and home. I will continue to remain a loyal customer of First Niagara bank.… read more

                I haven't had any problems with my First Niagara Checking Account. They're always pleasant and when they switched me from Key bank to First Niagara I went in to find out exactly what was going to be different. They showed me a nice chart and explained everything to me about how their system had looked at my previous usage and determined which checking and savings accounts would be best for me in my current situation. The checking account is perfect for me and my husband as there is no minimum and no charge as long as we choose to just get our statement online instead of in the mail. We already did that any way so it was no big deal. We're pretty happy with the switch so far.… read more

                I was with Key bank for years and then they sold out to First Niagara in my area. As soon as they started to take over things went downhill fast. They charged for the accounts that I had always had for free with Key bank and gave me no choice in the matter. I went in asking for help in understanding what they were doing with my accounts and they gave me the run around until I finally just had to close my accounts. They were charging my accounts for amounts they had assured me wouldn't be charged just days earlier. The only good thing is that it didn't take very much time to get my money back and get my accounts closed with them forever.… read more

                My experience with First Niagara has been generally favorable. The biggest problem I have is that their customer service is completely staffed by people from India. Many of the people I talked to spoke in broken English and had thick accents that I could not understand. This only increases the frustration when dealing with customer service. Besides having trouble understanding them, the customer service was good. Once, I overdrew my account and got charged $35. I called the bank and after a brief conversation, they reversed the charges. I once also lost my credit card which they canceled for me. Besides that, I haven't had any trouble with my accounts or debit card.… read more

                Other than the $.35 cent charge for using it as a debit card, I have nothing bad to say about First Niagara. My wife and I have banked with them for 3 years now. They have resolved the few problems we had with a phone call and little hassle. I do most of my banking online or depositing checks at the ATM. When I do go into one of their locations there are always enough employees at the counter to make the line move smoothly. The only issue I can remember was, when cashing a large check they put a hold on my account without clearly telling me that so a few charges didn't clear or over-drafted. I called customer service and they reversed the charges. I have opted out of over draft protection to avoid any potential problems in the future.… read more

Capital One® Secured Mastercard®


                                            I never had played in credit before, and someone suggested this card to me to build credit for the first time. I've been really satisfied for the most part. They report quickly and accurately, remind me when my bill is due, and the customer service has been kind and thorough....show more

GEICO


                                            GEICO needs in depth review by AG's nationwide. Highly recommend that you shop around and take time to review each company. GEICO will let you down 100% You work hard for your money, Invest your time to find a real insurance company. Good luck.

Wells Fargo


                                            I find it quite disturbing to see 24 one star, the lowest, ratings on the first page of Wallet Hub's most recent reviews of Wells Fargo. Somehow, in its overall summary, Wallet Hub still gives the impression Wells Fargo is a good banking option. What's going on here?

Bed Bath & Beyond® Credit Card


                                            The Bed Bath & Beyond Mastercard was purchased from US Bank in October 2016.

Woodforest National Bank


                                            It is my opinion that you would do better to find a different company. In the long run they will charge you plenty and the support is virtually non-existent. They don't even have a working answering system. They are disorganized  and a nightmare to work with.

Making simple transfers or even looking at accounts is harder and more confusing. bring back the old version.

How Do Banks Work?
By: John Kiernan, Personal Finance Editor
													The manner in which banks operate might seem like a rather basic topic, but given how complex financial markets have become in recent years, it’s helpful to revisit the fundamental simplicity of the industry.

Having money exactly when you need to it—and earning income on it when you don’t—is a problem as old as money itself. Banks exist to solve that problem, and have served as an intermediary between savers and borrowers since the Italian Renaissance, the Crusades, or even earlier, depending on which historians you consult.

More specifically, banks lend the funds deposited into savings accounts and certificates of deposit (CDs) to other customers, who repay the money with interest over time. Depositors entrust their money to banks for two reasons: 1) banks offer safe-keeping, borne from FDIC insurance; and 2) banks pay interest on deposits, allowing funds to grow over time. Banks, in turn, make money, by charging a higher rate of interest on their loans than what they pay on deposits. Banks can have other sources of revenue as well, including investments, fees on various services, and commissions on the sale of financial products such as mutual funds and insurance.

In addition to serving as a vector for borrowing and lending, banks play a central role in a number of other financial mechanisms. For example, banks process payments between buyers and sellers and they exchange foreign currencies. Banks also carry out governmental monetary policy by increasing or decreasing the amount of money they keep in reserve.
											

How Do I Choose a Bank?
By: Odysseas Papadimitriou, WalletHub CEO
													When it comes to selecting a bank, the options can be overwhelming. In past generations, it was common to choose whichever institution was to your home or office, or to be lured in by special prizes such as a free toaster. These days, you might just as easily do business with a bank that’s located across the country or with an online-only bank that has no branch offices at all. Special offers also are less likely to be small kitchen appliances and more likely to be perks such as free checking, introductory interest rates, or a lump of cash to jumpstart your savings account.

But before you jump on the bank with the biggest name or the flashiest offers, take some time to identify how you’re most likely to use your account and which features are most important to you.

Do you need a brick-and-mortar location? You may find yourself in need of a safe-deposit box. Or if questions arise, you may be the kind of person who is most comfortable with face-to-face communication. If you need access to a real building staffed by live people, prioritize your bank’s location and hours.

Bankers’ hours are notoriously short, and if your workday overlaps them completely, you might want to choose a bank that’s close to your office rather than your home, so that you can slip in at lunchtime. Or you might want to look for a bank with better hours.

Are you a technophile? You may find access to better interest rates and fee structures by opting for an online-only bank or bank account. By the same token, you may be able to minimize fees by opting for paperless statements, keeping tabs on your account balance electronically, and using mobile apps to locate ATMs that are within your network.

These are great opportunities, and you should take advantage of banks that offer them…if you are likely to use them. If your inbox is full of unread email notifications and your phone is loaded with unused apps, it helps to be realistic. Read through the fine print, understand the fees and penalties, and decide whether they work for your lifestyle.

Do you travel abroad extensively? International financial transactions have never been easier or less labor-intensive. And while most banks charge special fees for international debit card transactions and ATM withdrawals, others have been able to pass the savings along to their customers.

If you’re a frequent international traveler, it definitely pays to open one of the various no foreign transaction fee credit cards that are on the market.  Not only will this enable you to avoid the industry-standard 3% international surcharge, but you’ll also save a lot of money on currency conversion since Visa and Mastercard offer much better rates than bank branches or airport kiosks.  You should also look into getting a checking account that charges for neither international debit card use, nor foreign ATM withdrawals.

Is a sense of responsibility to the community important to you when it comes to banking? Since the global financial crisis of 2008, the reputation of many banks has suffered a black eye. But the banking industry is not a monolithic entity. Many consumers who are concerned about issues like local development, fair lending, and executive salaries have turned to small community and cooperative banks as well as credit unions for their banking needs.

These institutions may be less likely to offer all the bells and whistles of their larger cousins, but their mission is to provide the immediate community with the best products and services possible.  They’re worth a look at the very least.
											

What Does It Mean to Be FDIC Insured?
By: John Kiernan, Personal Finance Editor
													If your bank is FDIC insured, any money you put into a deposit account, along with any earned interest, will be returned to you, even if your bank fails. There are limits, of course. Insurance coverage tops out at $250,000 per depositor, per institution—not per account, as some people assume. That means if you have $125,000 in a money market account and another $125,000 in a CD at the same bank, you’ll want to open a new account at a different bank before depositing any more money in order to make everything is insured.

It’s important to note that FDIC insurance covers deposit accounts only, that is, checking, savings, CDs, and money market accounts. Other investment vehicles that banks sometimes provide, such as annuities, life insurance, and mutual funds (including money market funds), are not insured.

Most banks and thrifts (also known as savings and loan institutions), are FDIC insured, but a few are not. By law, those that are must display the FDIC logo prominently on the bank premises and in written materials. If you don’t see the logo, or if you have any doubts, ask about coverage. Credit unions are not covered by the FDIC, but they do have an insurance program of their own, sponsored by the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA).  As is the case with banks, this provides coverage for up to $250,000 per depositor, per institution.

The FDIC, which stands for the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, was founded by the U.S. government in 1933 in response to the widespread bank failures of the Great Depression. FDIC insurance is deemed necessary because bank failures can initiate a devastating domino effect involving consumers, commerce, other banks, and the overall economy. And one of the hard lessons of the 1920s and 1930s was that even healthy banks can fail when skittish customers withdraw all their deposits en masse. Deposit insurance gives depositors the assurance necessary to keep their money in the bank, even in the face of frightening economic and financial news. In that way, it protects not only the consumer, but also the banks and the economy.

Depending on your needs for a checking account, like direct deposit or checks, I suggest letting your credit cool off and open what's called a simple card account. It does require proof of identity, no fees, allows direct deposit, and is a Visa cash, not credit card.Also, I'd suggest talking to a credit union about an account, because their systems run checks - it is not the same as a traditional bank check system.

I've been in same position and resorted to doing a title loan, but not your usual one. Look into a company called New Deal. They provide title loans assistance but, the % is wal less and since collateral is involved, they'll be more willing. It goes on credit as a loan, and also helps improve your credit score with each on time payment

Walmart had something called bluebird checking and you get a debit card also. There are NO Fees. You cannot get overdrafts like I have at Wells Fargo and Chase when I specifically wrote and told them no on overdrafting. I would deposit the money before opening the next business day but those monster banks were so greedy making it like they did me a favor charging me 34.00 and usually for less than 34.00 over and I had the money in by the next business day. Also Amex Serve charges very little depending on your habits and which plan you select. As another mentioned, credit unions are another good place to call and nowadays are more lax on who can open accounts. Go to the social worker at the hospital and see if he/she can help. They sometimes have extended payment plans, partial forgiveness, low interest, etc. for such things. The billing office probably won't help you so if the are bothering you tell them you are working with the social worker to get it paid. I don't know if you qualify for Medicaid within 3 mo of the illness but health and human resources in your state would be able to help you then. But you would have to have very low income and less than 2,000 in resources not counting your house or car. There are other agencies in your city/county that may also help. One place to call is 211.… read more

...and so there is this checking acc. from Wells Fargo called "Everyday Checking".Here is how it works: You open an account that consists of a Savings Acc. with some minimal starting amount (in my case opening was $100) and a checking acc.with lets say $4600 for total of $4700.This type of Acc. "Everyday Checking", comes with a $10 Monthly Service Fee, which one of the ways that could be waved is to maintain a minimum of $1500.Now as part of this checking/savings acc. is a scam called "Save As You Go". That means that every time you make some electronic transaction (like paying a bill), usually $1, $2, $3 or more dollars, (depending on the amount of the transaction), will be transferred from your checking part of the acc. to the Saving acc.The idea is that YOU are to stupid to manage and save your own money, so Wells Fargo will do it for you by moving a dollar or two of your own money from your checking to your savings.As a result of this scam, you can find yourself in a position where you have, lets say, $400 in your Savings acc., and $1600 in your checking, for a total of $2000.So, lets assume You make a "bill pay" to your Cable Co. of $100, that leaves a balance in your checking acc. of $1500, and your So called "Save As You Go"savings acc., still has the $400 for a total of $1900.Here is the kicker, remember, You checking had $1600, you paid the cable co. $100, you have left $1500, but because Well Fargo moved $1 dollar to your savings, your Savings amount became $401, and your checking $1499.At $1499 in your checking, you are below the $1500 and therefore you are subject to a $10 Monthly Service Fee, even though you still have $401 in your savings.now, I am sure that those very young, smart, highly educated people in the wells fargo boardroom, get a lot of money paid to find ways that will boost the Bank's profits, but ultimately, a "Pig with a Lipstick, is still a pig".It should be obvious by now that my issue is not the $10.I could close my acc. and make sure that these will be the first, the last and the only $10 wells Fargo will ever take from me (very inexpensive insurance policy against wells Fargo ever taking another penny out of me). I still think is a scam, is designed to exploit the poor and I will forward my thoughts and your response to the local news (starting with Michael Turko of the Turko Files Ch. 9 - KUSI News - San Diego, CA), and follow with Huffington Post and let the public decide with their comments whether my point is valid or not.… read more

You've totaly misread the 3 ways to avoid the $10.00 fee. First off, if you DO the savings, that alone automatically waives the $10.00 checking fee. 2nd is if you use your debit card 10x, and Wells Fargo is very upfront, in fact, around 1pm, they post pending transactions that come in that night! So, at 2pm your balance could be -$90.00 and you can cover it before they post that night! NO other bank lets you know what's coming through, as that's money directly out of their pocket! 3rd is to simply have a measly $500.00 in direct deposits for the month, and this includes direct deposits from square and cash.me/scotttampa . Also, they are up front about these too! You have 24-7 access next to each option, it shows how many debit card purchases you have ( I just run 10 $1.00 charges through square) and also shows your total direct deposits, and one month I came up short and guess what! They didn't charge the $10.00... they said "as a valued customer we've noticed you came close this month so we'll waive the $10.00 but please keep an eye on your numbers and make sure one of the options is completed each month.So, You are WAY off base. Also, I created this account on their website in 5 minutes with only a $25.00 initial deposit! Received a debit card and signature card to sign and mail back within 4 days.

Credit Union of the Rockies used to be a good institution, but it seems they have lost all customer service. I had been with them for 15+years. We had financed a car and our home and had a standing line of credit. We maintained a healthy balance in our accounts and were never late on a payment (actually we always paid our loans off early. Anyway, we were buying a condo as an investment and needed a mortgage for about 25% of the property (we were bringing a 75% down-payment to the table). Credit Unions of the Rockies uses a mortgage broker, we applied and the service we received was appalling: Keith Schnell, theLoan Officer with CU Members Mortgage was very slow to communicate and even though we applied 6 weeks prior to the closing, he was still messing around two days before closing. We ended up taking a short term loan from another source and closing without the loan from the Credit Union of the Rockies. The poor performance of Mr. Schnell and CUR costs us time, an $400 appraisal and put our $5,000 earnest money at risk. I have had almost no follow up from the CUR even though I left messages and send a letter when closing our accounts. I can not recommend Credit Union of the Rockies or Credit Union Members Mortgage.… read more

I recently discontinued my account with this bank for several reasons. I was with TD Bank since them being Commerce Bank. I truly enjoyed the fact that they were open 7 days a week and had longer working hours then other banks. The customer service was excellent and I had no issues with them. A bout 2 years after them becoming TD Bank I started to notice several fees being charged to my account. And even more overdraft fees when I specifically called them and took that option off of my account so that I would never overdraft it. The customer service was horrible. This became such a problem that I ended up having hundreds of dollars in overdraft fees. I am planing on taking this matter to court because of the fact that they are liars and I feel that they do that just to take money from you.… read more

Ally use to be good. But sadly this is no longer the case. They have raised fees. Put $10 cap on ATM fee reimbursement. They also are scandalous in there system. Debits are applied before credits which means if you have low balance and have a bill on auto pay and you put money in your account the same day, the bill is paid first and you are charged an overdraft fee which is now $25 a hit. You get 1 overdraft fee reimbursement for the Lifetime of the account. Not monthly or annually LIFETIME OF THE ACCOUNT. worst of all is there TERRIBLE Customer service which btw is only 24/7 phone or email now. All the things that made Ally great are now gone. Best to look else where for your online banking needs.… read more

I have been using the Washington Federal bank for maybe three years now,and it seems to me that they are one of those banks that wants to keep your money if you put it in their bank. There was an instance when I was trying to withdraw my money and got to the bank 10 minutes early before they would stop letting people withdraw their money or transfer it. Because of the long lines, I ended up having to wait 12 minutes, and so I was 2 minutes late. The women inside refused to give me money, and i did not have any money for the weekend. I called her supervisor and it was resolved, but it should not have happened in the first place. it was horrible ,and I am not too fond of them anymore. Watch out with this bank, they will try to keep YOUR money.… read more

I have a fixed mortgage of 5.5% with Weber state Credit Union. Back in June, I applied for re-financing with the same lender. I was approved for a rate of 3.25%. Closing was supposed to take place at end of August, but it did not because the bank made an error on some house paperwork that is invalid. They now have to go through the process of removing the error, but I have to continue to pay a higher interest on my mortgage - not to any fault of my own. Robbery in plain daylight! i feel like this at least.… read more

I immediately switched over to Bashas Associates Federal Credit Union after being with Bank of America for five years. I wanted to be with a bank that hand superb customer service and treated customers fairly. I have overall been happy with the services I have received and the 24/7 support I have gotten abroad and domestically. There have been several situations in which my bank account had been compromised and needed assistance with Bashas. Although they weren't as quick to respond as BofA would be, they still worked hard to send me new cards and secure my account without too much of a hassle.

They offer certain benefits to the checking account that I truly appreciate such as no International withdrawal fees. The customer service is excellent whenever I've had to call for various reasons. The saving account interest rate is not great like all the other banks but when I initially sign up they had the highest rate I keep hoping it will go back up. I sincerely would recommend the previous ‘ING’ and now Capitol One to anyone needing a good reliable internet bank.… read more

They are extremely nice and really try to understand what you want done. I've been to banks where some of the bank tellers just don't want to deal with your problem and what you gone.

I have been a Wells Fargo customer for over 15 years. Whenever I call or visit Wells Fargo, the customer service is usually very good. The agent is very respectful and appreciative and handles queries as best as s/he can. Recently, I accidentally left my card in the ATM machine at my local branch. When I called the bank about it, they informed me that the ATM will automatically shred the card if I do not take it out of the machine. They went ahead and arranged for a new one to be sent to my address. In the meantime, they told me to visit a local branch, and an agent could issue me a temporary card connected to my account. I visited a branch later that day, and was issued a card within five minutes. I was quite impressed with the efficiency and speed. I had been so annoyed with myself, thinking about how inconvenient my "card-less" existence would be for the next week. In the end, Wells Fargo made this inconvenience as hassle-free as possible, which I did really appreciate.… read more

I have been a member with Cedar Point Federal Credit Union in southern MD for about 20 years. I have never had a bad experience with them. Their staff is friendly and welcoming, they go out of their way to help and give information or answer any questions that you have, and are extremely helpful with any problems that I have had arise. I have my main checking and savings account with them, as well as used them for two different car loans. The loan process was very new and overwhelming to me, but the associate at Cedar Point answered all questions, recommended the best type of loan for me, and set up the loan and payment plan with ease.The employees are very knowledgeable, eager to help, and make you feel welcomed at "at home." They remember names of their clients, and you are always welcomed (usually by name) as soon as you enter. I have been to all of the southern MD branches, and each one is consistently friendly, helpful, and knowledgeable.I would highly recommend this bank to anyone for any kind of banking needs.… read more

We have been with Air Academy Federal Credit Union for about 15 years. We have always had a great experience with them. We have our main accounts and we had one car loan with them. Going through the car loan process with them was a piece of cake and they had everything done within a couple days. When we paid off the load, we got a phone call congratulating us on paying off the car. You don't get that from the big banks! Overall, being a member at Air Academy has been a great experience!… read more

I first began banking with Suntrust while working at Ft. Lee Army Base in Petersburg, Virginia some twenty-five years ago. Each and every time I had a need for financial assistance representatives from Suntrust were right there to take care of my needs. I find their products very user friendly, their tellers or branch managers very knowledgeable and they consistently do exactly what they say there are going to do. I will be a Suntrust customer until the very end I suggest you do the same.… read more

I have had no problems with TD bank at all so far. I have been using them for 4 years, since I was a freshman at my college. I chose them because they were close to my home and they had a student specialty program so I wouldn't need a specific amount of dollars in my bank account. A td bank atm was even in my college as well, providing extra convenience. I love that they allow you to take their pens. The feel and atmosphere of the bank was nice. They always allow you to get free items such as candy or hand sanitizers. Every experience with them has gone smoothly. I have a checkings account and I haven't really used credit or purchases on anything big. They have a banking app that is useful and reliable as well.… read more

I have been a member of Allegacy Federal Credit Union since 1984. My experience with this CU is one of respect, confidence, and care. From the time I joined, they have treated me with dignity and concern for my financial future. I trust Allegacy as much as anyone could trust another to be a good steward over their hard-earned money. Along with their service offerings, Allegacy also offers financial literacy workshops, college scholarships for the member and family members, great money market and savings account rates, as well as a checking account that bears interest. Overall, Allegacy is an upstanding, trustworthy and fiscally responsible credit union.… read more

I have been a member of Patriot Federal Credit Union for 4years now, and have thoroughly enjoyed my experience with them. They offer all the convenience of the big banks but at a fraction of the cost. I initially started with them because of the favorable loan options a credit union can provide, and have never been let down. The interest I pay for loans is much lower then any traditional lending institution I've shopped with. If you live in an area that Patriot Federal Credit Union serves, I would highly recommend establishing a relationship with them. You won't be disappointed and will look at the big banks differently.… read more

I can’t say enough great things about having USAA as a bank. Their overall fees are very low, and they reimburse you for a certain amount of ATM withdrawl fees each month. Additionally, their online banking app is extremely easy to use, and you can easily deposit checks through your mobile phone. Customer service is stellar too.

Another great bank is Grow Financial Credit Union. I've been with them for over two years and also received approval for my first car loan through them with a great interest rate. They have student banking too, which is great for college students, and they also do student loans. The staff is always courteous and helpful and just recently they reversed two NSF fees because I messed up my withdrawal and deposit dates. I love this bank and would highly recommend them to anyone!… read more

After numerous calls to customer service, we all were finally able to determine the problem. Their customer service reps were always friendly with me and they went out of their way each time I called to find a solution - in my case, it was an IT problem and once that was determined, the problem was solved.… read more

Mission Federal Credit Union is a fantastic place to keep your hard earned cash!! The customer service at MFCU is outstanding. My son had no credit but wanted to establish himself. We went to MFCU and he applied for a car loan. Based on my history with them,he is now driving a new car,oh,and the car loan that was given to him from MFCU is top notch!! I thought that I would have to co-sign for him,but that was not to be. I have 4 accounts with MFCU,a savings,a Christmas club account,and two checking accounts. It is such a good feeling when you don't have to worry about where your money is. I highly recommend MFCU to everyone!!… read more

Bank of America has been my bank for many years. Once there was an incident where my account had been comprised ( by someone nameless ). I went into the bank to resolve it. Honestly I was surprised and relieved at how this was handled. One account had to be closed, a new one opened; easy and painless. So many pleasing attributes in my opinion, not to mention ease of use, banking online, bill pay, chat, and the list goes on. The thing I enjoy most about my bank is I'm able to transfer funds easily to family members and vise versa. Oh did I mention some overdraft fees have been refunded as a courtesy. I can go on and go. Just love my bank!… read more

I was facing a strenuous issue when I my car broke down in October of that year. What I thought would be a day visit to the mechanics resulted in me finding out that my car had actually died. They were not forthwith with granting me any kind of loan to help me during the interim period while I didn’t have a car. As a result, I had to rent cars for longer than I would have liked. But they have helped me establish my credit and find viable credit card options.… read more

I recently opened checking and savings accounts with USAA. I am extremely pleased with them so far. I had been very happy with the same national bank for close to 20 years, but when a couple of problems arose with them, things went south for me very quickly. I chose USAA because I use the company for my auto and homeowner's insurance,All the services (insurance, banking services, etc.) USAA offered are centered around veterans and our specific needs. I've had nothing but positive experiences with their insurance services, and I can honestly also say the same about my experiences to date with their checking and savings products. I pay no monthly fees; the accounts have no minimum balance, and they extend the same excellent service in their banking division as they do for their insurance policies.The only downside is that you either have to be a veteran or related to one to join. If you are eligible, however, I strongly encourage you to join.… read more

I bank with Navy Federal Credit Union. I have been with them for over 25 years now. When I retired from the Navy out here in San Diego,I was given a lump sum of cash. The first place I went to was NFCU. I was very lucky to pick them as my choice for all of my financial needs. Over the years I can count on one hand how many times that I had a dispute with them. And every time,EVERY time,that I questioned something,they always had an answer for me. The customer service is excellent!! The auto rate loans (I have had 4) are also one of the lowest that you will find out here in san diego. I am a father of 6 and all my kids are with NFCU also. Before you decide on where to put your hard earned money,my suggestion is to give NFCU a call.… read more

A few years ago I totaled my car just a week after paying it off. I was very upset; especially since it was the other person's fault. They ran a stop sign and hit me right on the driver's side door. The car spun several times and I found myself trapped inside. After the accident I could see the other driver and his friends moving his car to make it look like it was my fault. They then tried to move my car with me inside, instead of trying to help me get out. The entire experience was dreadful and the other driver's insurance company refused to pay because of the way the cars had been set up. USAA, however, believed me when I told them what happened. They got me a rental car that very day and I had money to buy a new car with a couple of days. I also got more than I was expecting. Banking, insurance, and savings with USAA is always a good experience!… read more

I have always felt that my information was secure and my money was in safe hands. I must say I am a person who often misplaces my cards. I am always embarrassed to make the call, once again that I have misplaced my card. They help me as if it was my first time each and every time. Never making me feel embarrassed or insecure even though they can clearly see this has not been my first loss. My children also have opened accounts through them, and their child friendly program is the best!… read more

My bank Is US Bank. A bit like heirlooms, US Bank has been passed down and always used by my family. Recently, i opened a checking account upon my 18th birthday. When signing up at my branch they put a student indicator on my account saying the $8.95 maintenance fee would be waived. For one reason or another it was for about two months then this month it wasn't refunded. I called customer service and they switched me over to a "Easy Student" account which did cost $2 but is waived by online statements. If you ever have an Issue their customer service is top notch and they try hard to help you. Bonus for some: customer service is based in the US so it's all native speakers from here. That personally doesn't matter to me but for older people or folks with trouble understanding international people it would help. The US Bank android app is wonderful and simple. Really my only qualm with US Bank is that their money sending system online is hard and bad from the app. All together, It would be hard to find a better bank then good ol' US Bank.… read more

I can transfer money, pay bills, make deposits all from my phone or computer even while I'm on the go. I don't have time to go the physical bank. The representatives are always helpful as well. In addition, they offer many discounts on products and services within and out of the bank. I am certain I will never bank with another institution as they are a one-stop shop.… read more

Recently, I had a very low balance in my account and accidently used my debit card, over drawing my account since the bank does not decline point of sale purchases to costumers in good standing. This caused several over draft charges that amounted to about $100.00 dollars. I went in to my local branch and explained the situation, the woman I was speaking with removed the charges and resolved the issue on the spot. I was very pleased.… read more

Yes, you can get a loan with tarnished credit, but you will have to pay a considerably higher interest rate because lenders assume you are a higher risk. You should attempt to rebuild the relationships you have with existing creditors to help improve your credit in the short term. If your accounts have not gone past 90 days in delinquency there is a good chance that by calling and speaking to a customer service rep, or by sending along a 'goodwill' letter and simultaneously making your accounts current your lenders may report your accounts as never late. There are a lot of other ways to remove past negative remarks from your credit report, but it is important that your first become current with all over due accounts. You should begin by puling your free annual credit report from https://www.annualcreditreport.com/ so you can begin to triage the worst of your accounts. Once you have a better picture of where you credit is now, you can begin the process of forming a recovery strategy and determine which lenders may be willing to extend credit to you. I would recommend staying away from credit counseling agencies and others such as Lexington Law because they are incredibly expensive and you can everything and more than they are able to do with a little research of your own. You may wish to familiarize yourself with 'credit good will letters' and have a look at the following websites:www.creditboards.comwww.myFico.comGood luck, you will certainly be able to repair your credit in good time!… read more

I like the security that they also offer, I am notified immediately if they question any kind of questionable use on my account, I get emails from them notifying me even if my account is logged into too many times in one day.

I have an account with TDBank North. I am very unhappy with them My account was somehow compromised and money was taken and used without my knowledge. They said it was used with an ATM card but I have the card. I have the card though so the bank is telling me they will not refund the money taken without doing a complete investigation. I understand they need to investigate but I have been a customer for maybe 10 years without any previous issues. They should return the disputed funds until/unless they can find no evidence of a theft. Even then if that happens that would be bad for me because the money really was taken. I would recommend another bank.… read more

We have banked with Vystar and its predecessor Jax Navy Fed C/U for nearly thirty years and have never had any problems with them except one recent event where an apparent unauthorized charge on our debit card appeared from a vendor we hadn't used in six months. Also, on the date of the charge we were not in town, making the charge appear fraudulent. Vystar reversed the charge and began an investigation. After three months and a thoroughly helpful Vystar customer service rep we discovered the charge to be correct. The vendor had taken its time to submit the proper paper work.

I bank with Chase Manhattan, just Chase to most and I have to say that every time I go in they are nice, the wait is never very long and the place is always clean. One time I needed $150 in gold dollars for a fundraiser and I went in and they said that most branches usually only have about $50 unless you order them in advance. Well, I didn't have that kind of time. I didn't think I would have to order them. So I told the gal I would just drive to a few banks. She told me to wait while she made a couple calls. When she came back about 5minutes later she said she called the bank next door (an independent credit union) and that they had what I needed and someone would bring them right over! Within 10 minutes I was out the door and didn't have to drive all over town! They always go the extra mile when I need them to. Plus hardly any fees and a good interest rate...all the boring things..haha..makes this a great bank I will stay with for years and years!… read more

My deciding factor in choosing Green Dot was how user friendly and easy the card is to use.

It does cost monthly, but the ease and flexibility are worth it!

I have been banking with one local credit union in San Antonio - Generations FCU - since 2003. It has expanded and acquired more branches since the time I opened my accounts with them. I definitely like their interest rates on loans and very straight-forward membership fees and policies. Overdraft and other account fees are way cheaper than in major banks. My account is free, because I have a direct deposit. The new location is very close to my house. I was able to get several car loans through them at a very low rate and still have a line of credit.… read more

Re: Wells Fargo, when I used their ATM for the first time I was charged a fee that I never agreed to. They referred to it as a "inquirer fee." This was in addition to a $3 fee that I did agreed to. This put my account into the negative. I discussed this with the bank and showed them my receipt which did state that I did not agree to the charge. After a call with the bank manager it was agreed that this was an unintentional mix-up an overdraft was not charged. At least they made it right.… read more

We changed from a different back to WPCU about ten years ago and have had no issues with their banking or service. We have done multiple home refinances and auto loans as the fee structures and rates tend to be the best. The staff is knowledgeable and made every effort to advise us of changing and best rates. One of the better benefits is not being constantly hit with numerous fees for the privilege of banking with them. The only negative that I have is the lack of locations to do ATM transactions. On the flip side, if I have to use a out of network ATM, WPCU allows me to recover the cost of the transaction. So, they do almost everything right to earn and keep my business.… read more

Allegacy Federal Credit Union is a southeastern credit union that provides outstanding service. The company is extremely conservative with credit lending decisions. I can say that as a customer, I feel secure in knowing that my investments are safe and I am being provided with exemplary financial stewardship. I have been a customer for over two decades and have not had a problem. Their standards are high and they take few risks, especially when it comes to borrowing. I can't say that I have always been happy with their decisions, but in retrospect, I believe the correct decision was made.… read more

I have had an Capital One 360 account for about 6 months and I can honestly say I have never been so pleased with a bank before. For those of you who don't know, CO 360 is an online-based banking experience. I moved to the middle of nowhere, Tennessee where there are mostly Credit Unions and very few big banks, so I decided to open a CO 360 account. You can deposit checks just by taking a picture of them with your phone; you can do Person2Person transfers and if the receiver also has Capital One the transfer is instant (Example: I told my roommate to get us Taco Bell on the way home and transferred $15 to her, which she received immediately). They also give you the option of opening as many savings accounts as you'd like, and even have an automatic-savings plan where you choose how much to put in each savings account every month. Whenever I call the bank for any questions or assistance, a customer service representative answers IMMEDIATELY. No confusing and misleading menus! I recommend it to everyone. Did I mention there's no annual fees or minimums?… read more

The Bancorp Bank has been a very good institution for me. For many, many years their customer service dept. has been helpful when it comes to assisting in any and every given situation that I've ever had concerning my accounts. I am new to the game of being an Entrepreneur and they have been very informative on a need to know basis. I never knew that the average monthly amount of deposits that could be made per month is 20. They were kind and patient enough to explain to me in every detail what was needed to know for a better understanding of how things work within the system. Bancorp is an excellent bank.… read more

When I lived in New York I was drawn to TD Bank for their flexible hours (closed at 7pm, open on Sundays). That worked great for a while until my student privileges expired. They would charge me $5 if I didn't have a minimum of $50 in the account. There were also no TD Banks or ATMs in the Brooklyn area, and they would charge you $2 if you withdrew money at a non-TD Bank ATM. In the end I realized this bank was established for rich, Wall Street people and closed my account.… read more

I have a Bank Account with Fifth Third Bank. I absolutely love this bank. The only downfall was the opening deposit amount of $50 because I was just getting back on my feet. At the time I opened my account with them, I had terrible credit due to a separation that I had recently went through. I was trying to get my life back in order and I was denied an account by almost every bank. Fifth Third Bank offered me a second chance with their second chance checking. I opened my second chance checking account and began to use it wisely. After six months of continuous responsible checking with Fifth Third Bank they helped me get approved for a small personal loan to help rebuild my credit. They also offer an identity Theft program that is a great tool to alert you when something looks suspicious. I love Fifth Third Bank!… read more

I had a Bank account with Huntington some time back and at first things seemed all on the up and up, Then Their was a problem with a transfer. I tried to call customer service and was on hold for at least 30-45 minutes and then finally got threw the person on the other end was extremely rude and said they were transferring me to another department. The customer service person failed to mention before transferring me that that department was not even open. Very frustrating and I didn't want to have to wait another 45 minutes on hold again. So anyone who don't like to wait and anyone who don't make $100,000 or more a year should not bank with Huntington.… read more

I had a checking account with Huntington Bank for three years. My account was always in good standing. Then, I had some money problems and was unable to make a deposit before the check when through. I was a day late. I spoke with the manager about waving the NSF fee since it was my first time and I was a valued customer. She politely said no. Therefore, I not only had that check bounce, but another check bounced as well. I had to pay two NSF fees and was unable to cover my bills because of it. I don't recommend Huntington Bank to anyone.… read more

I have been with ING Direct for more than three years and I am absolutely satisfied.When my credit card was stolen from me a month ago or when I lost a check  once, their customer service was great. They issued me a new card within a week and helped with the check too. I really had a feeling that they really care about people they work for.

I've had a bank account in Idaho central credit union bank since last year. The main issue with the bank is the hidden charges which they never tell you about while you are opening an account with them.For transactions that you do overseas they are going to charge $5 as processing fees which other reputed banks are not.Also if for 3 months you don't deposit any money they are going to charge you for that.In my opinion this information should be given to customers prior to opening the account.… read more

I switched to Huntington bank this year because it does not hassle me with service fees, and it is close to the university I will be attending. I love how Huntington is open every day of the week. It is convenient for people who work during the week and can only make it to the bank on the weekend. Overall I am satisfied with this service. My biggest issue is that checks take several days to clear and the bankers can be a bit pushy when they are trying to sell the bank's credit card. For instance, when I walked into the bank the first time after opening an account, the banker I worked with skipped hellos and immediately asked if I was still considering the credit card even though I told him no last time. Usually the staff is friendly and takes care of my needs quickly when I visit, however.… read more

I have a bank account with BBT. Unfortunately they have the tendency to ding you with fees. When I was out of work, they would charge me $10 a month for having a bank account with them. When I was working, I had zero complaints about them. I wish they would remove that $10 fee, when you do not have a steady stream of income coming in. It is hard to keep up with a fee when you have zero money coming in.… read more

I currently have 5/3 Bank for my checking and savings account, as well as, for a mortgage loan. We chose this bank primarily because of location (right across the street from our previous address). We have never had any issues with them and I have always found their customer service to be excellent (kind, considerate, respectful, pleasant and attentive to my needs). Setting up the mortgage with them and our accounts was easy breezy. The only issue we have with them now is that they are not nearby so we have to travel some ways to get to them now that we relocated. It would be nice if they upgraded to things such as taking a pic of a check and utilizing those tools like Chase does. Outside of that, I do recommend this bank to anyone who is searching for a new bank.… read more

I applied for a home mortgage at Mountain West Bank in Idaho. It turned into a miserable experience. The first mortgage broker took all my information and started to shop for rates. Two anxious weeks later he told me that no one wanted my mortgage. I have great credit and 50% down payment but because it was a rural home with minimal fire protection (the home is on forest service land) no one wanted the loan. I talked to a second loan officer at Mountain West who said that he had other contacts to check. Another long week of waiting and no response. When I started to call these loan officers back they didn't want to take my calls. Very disappointing. I would not recommend doing business with them in the future.… read more

I have an account at First Financial Credit Union for over 5 years.I am really impressed with the customer service that the bank used to offer till last year. Currently their response time is very high.Last month i lost a cheque for which i called the customer service for cancellation. I was surprised to know that their lead time for same is 2 days while others are offering 2 hours. I suggest you not have an account at this bank.… read more

I have been using ING Direct for over 10 years. I have never run into any problems banking with them. One time I got locked out of my account and needed to retrieve my password, so I contacted their customer service. They were extremely helpful and got everything back in order on the same day. They are also quick to reply if you decide to send them messages. Choosing ING Direct all those years ago was a smart one, they have excellent service and have yet to disappoint.… read more

I recently opened up an account with Woodforest National Bank. I have had this account for less than a year, but I can already tell that this bank stands out among the others because it truly cares about its banking customers. Checks deposited to your account are available immediately. Even checks deposited through ATM are available the same day - within the hour. There is no ridiculous holding process for larger checks or deposited funds. The tellers are always friendly and happy to help. The only complaint that I have would be the number of locations in the Houston area, inner loop. One important aspect of your bank is number of locations. Direct deposit works for me now, but any time I need to be physically present for any banking, I do have to hunt down a location.… read more

Citibank. During my younger corporate years, I was delinquent with my credit card payments at one point. Couple of years after, I was unexpectedly approved for a Citibank Visa credit card. I must say that their application assessment is thorough and they give considerations or chances for young professionals to reestablish their credit.

I live in Canada and have all my banking with TD Canada Trust. We opted the bank as it has the best customer service. It also provides service during weekends and holidays which is very helpful for working people. Also they have financial advisers who provide all the liable options for banking to us to choose. They provide answers to all our questions and will have a very friendly relation with the customers.

Around one year ago I opened an account at a local Busey Bank, in my home city. It´s not a very well-known bank, but it´s close to my home and, so far, I´ve had no problem with it. The bank features a no minimum balance requirement, with the sole condition of getting the statements on-line. It offers debit and credit cards, online banking, mobile and direct deposit, and its customer service is excellent. The only detail I´m a little bit disappointed with is the fact that every time I sign-in online I have to wait for an E-mail with an access code, but that problem is a minor one. The problem lies on the fact that, I don´t know why, the system is unable to recognize my computer. It´s somehow a bargain, but nothing compared to the possibilities it features.… read more

MidFirst Bank has been the best bank I've ever used. The fact that they allow you to use any ATM and not charge you a fee is the most solid choice for going with them. They always make you feel welcome every time you visit their locations. The only negative experience I have had with them is putting a hold on my account for a purchase I made for $2. I appreciate the fact that a bank will look out for you but it caused a problem when I didn't know and I was trying to make a purchase. I guess I would've appreciated a phone call or an email telling me that they put a hold on the account...and did a $2 purchase for something unusual really warrant a hold? Other than that, great bank and I will be a member for years to come!… read more

Boeing Employee Credit Union, is the bank that I'll be mentioning today. Don't get me wrong, but this bank is great, but there are incidents that made me decide to switch to other banks. This bank only gave me about 5 mobile transfer actions per month which was far less than what I would prefer because I like to make transfers from my savings to checking account to make sure I had enough funds for what I wanted to buy. I also use my mobile banking system a lot so it was a serious problem I had with this bank.… read more

It Takes a Village to Raise a College Graduate

                            With the rising costs of college, families are taking a multigenerational approach to planning for education and other life goals.
                        





It takes a village to raise a child, but in 2017 it may take an extended family to educate one.
With the costs of higher education trending higher each year, paying for college has become a top-tier life expense, alongside other big-ticket goals like buying a home and planning for retirement. However, education costs have now skyrocketed to the extent that saving for both of those life goals—retirement and home-buying—has become hampered in some families.

Some parents are cutting back on retirement savings contributions to help fund their children’s education.  At the same time, children are entering their 20’s with student loan debt, which in some cases is delaying the purchase of their first home. Even grandparents have modified life goals, choosing to help grandchildren with education expenses now, rather than leaving a larger legacy later.
In short, paying for education has officially become a multigenerational concern. But with a little advance planning, families can make some savvy moves to help prepare for the costs of college. 





The Growing Cost of Education



According to the College Board's latest “Trends in Higher Education" report, the continued increase in average published tuition and fees at colleges and universities is now outpacing the growth in family incomes, financial aid and many consumer goods and services. It now costs, on average, $45,370 per year for tuition, fees, room and board, for a four-year private college. Assuming a college-cost inflation rate of 3%, today’s 8-year-old child may need $255,090 come college time in 2027.
“For parents, the number-one goal from a financial planning perspective is still retirement, but close behind is paying for a child’s education,” says Marc Dextraze, Executive Director, Morgan Stanley Wealth Management Investment Solutions.




It takes a village to raise a child, but in 2017 it may take an extended family to educate one.

One option, says Dextraze, is for parents to start saving early with a 529 college savings plan.  “Having a head start on the costs means less sacrifice later on, avoiding the heavy burden of parental loans," he says. For the child, “Having all or most of their college funding in place means they have more options, like being able to select the college that best fits their interests and goals, as opposed to the college that offers the most aid. And graduating with less student debt means having the ability to pursue the next chapter of their lives with more financial freedom."
Named after Section 529 of the Internal Revenue Code, a 529 plan is a tax-advantaged savings vehicle which allows you to save, or even pay in advance, for college expenses. Earnings in a 529 plan can be tax deferred, and the withdrawals are exempt from federal and state income taxes if you use the funds for qualified expenses such as tuition, fees, room and board and supplies. Many states also offer state tax deductions or tax credits on top of that.





Making Education a Family Affair



Motivated by persistent news headlines about the growing costs of education, grandparents, relatives and even family friends have also begun creating 529 accounts in a child’s name. Not only do 529 plans offer potential tax advantages, they allow the family member or friend to give the gift of education and a young adulthood free from student debt.
“Today it definitely takes a village to send a child to college," says Jennifer Tierney, Vice President, Morgan Stanley Wealth Management Investment Solutions and 529 plans product manager. “It's so important to plan ahead. For grandparents, aunts and uncles, family friends, it just makes sense to leverage the benefits that 529 plans provide to a child and from a tax-perspective, to themselves.”

A Flexible Way to Save and Invest for College



The appeal of 529 plans may derive from their benefits and flexibility.
There are no income restrictions, no required minimum distributions, no limits on the number of accounts the same person or entity can own, generally no maximum age limits for establishing an account, and high contribution limits. Virtually anyone can be named a beneficiary—a child, grandchild, niece, nephew, spouse, even a friend.1
According to Chris Stack, a managing consultant at Savingforcollege.com, one of the most overlooked benefits is the daily access and liquidity of the 529 account, as opposed to a UTMA (Uniform Transfers to Minors Act) or UGMA (Uniform Gifts to Minors Act) account or other strategy. “With 529s, grandparents or extended family give themselves an option, but not an obligation, to apply their funds to help pay college costs," he says. 


Another significant benefit of 529 plans is tax-free compounding. “Earning on an account’s growth, rather than paying taxes on the earnings, provides more funding available in future years when the college costs become a family reality," Stack says. “Having the ability to withdraw the principal and tax-deferred earnings without any federal or state income tax liability is a very significant benefit, especially when compared to alternative strategies such as using a life insurance policy or a taxable account."
Stack recommends that families start preparing for college costs as early as possible. While as soon as the child is born is ideal, he said, some even “begin with an account in their own name years before their first child is born knowing the designated beneficiary can be changed in the future."
Says Dextraze, “At the end of the day, the idea is to harmonize all of your goals, taking whatever tax advantages you can through the various kinds of plans out there, including 401Ks, 529s and others. It’s using all of the available tools. That’s how you reach your goals.”


Morgan Stanley offers many 529s from some of the nation’s leading mutual fund companies. You can choose from a range of investment strategies depending on the specific plan, the age of the beneficiary, your financial objectives and risk tolerance. Talk with your Morgan Stanley Financial Advisor, or find one using the locator below, for more information. 
















1 Some plans may have age, residency or other restrictions and may charge a fee for beneficiary changes, and beneficiary changes may result in an immediate tax liability if the new beneficiary is not a member of the old beneficiary’s family. Contribution limits vary by state. Refer to the individual plan for specific guidelines.


Disclosures
An investor should consider the investment objectives, risks, and charges and expenses associated with 529 plans and municipal fund securities before investing. More information about municipal fund securities is available in the issuer's official statement – the 529 Plan Program Disclosure – which is available from your Financial Advisor. It should be read carefully before investing.
Investments are subject to market risk and may fluctuate in value. Before investing, investors should consider whether tax or other benefits are only available for investments in the investor’s home-state 529 college savings plan. Assets can accumulate and be withdrawn federally tax-free only if they are used to pay for qualified expenses. Earnings on nonqualified distributions will be subject to income tax and a 10% federal income tax penalty. Some states offer favorable tax treatment and other benefits to their residents only if they invest in the state’s own Qualified Tuition Program. Investors should consult with their financial and tax advisor before investing in any 529 plan, or contact their state tax division for more information. Some plans may have age, residency or other restrictions and may charge a fee for beneficiary changes.
Morgan Stanley Smith Barney LLC (“Morgan Stanley”), its affiliates and Morgan Stanley Financial Advisors do not provide tax or legal advice. Clients should consult their personal tax advisor for tax-related matters and their attorney for legal matters.

                            Navigate the money taboo and get together around what really matters—your family.
                        





What’s the hardest thing to talk about? Death, religion, politics? Would it surprise you to know that one of the most difficult things to discuss is money? When polled, 44% of Americans claimed that personal finance was the hardest to discuss – beating out politics and even death.1
Perhaps this is because money represents more than a topic – it can represent control, power, embarrassment, insecurity, fear. For some people, the hesitation stems from a natural reluctance to confront their own mortality or their potential for future disability. For others, avoiding the topic is caused by the perception that planning is associated with complicated—and expensive—legal and tax issues.

Silence Can Be Harmful



Avoiding these sometimes difficult conversations can have detrimental outcomes and unexpected consequences for your family, such as:
Passing On Bad Habits - Talking to your children about money now can help them avoid mistakes in the future. The key is to talk about what money means to you and why you worked hard to achieve your success. It involves being open about the challenges and responsibilities that accompany wealth – including what you might have wished you’d done differently when younger. And, most important, it’s about your values and what you wish for yourself and your children to accomplish with your privilege. The conversation can serve as an empowering first step to forming a healthy relationship with wealth.
Lost Opportunities - It’s never too early for your children to understand the value of creating a wealth plan that takes family members’ needs into account. Family members may not be aligned on priorities, such as long-term health care needs, charitable giving and generational gifting strategies, and taking the time to establish common goals is the first step in understanding how all members can participate in achieving them. 
The reality is that 70% of families lose their wealth by the second generation.[ii] Lack of communication can ultimately lead to misunderstandings and divergent objectives that could jeopardize your legacy and work against your values.
Costly Procrastination - Perhaps the hardest of conversations to have as an adult is with your aging parents. This is where the danger of putting it off grows exponentially. According to the U.S. Department of Health and Human services, 70% of people over 65 will require some long-term care at some point in their lives.[iii] Once a crisis hits, it’s often too late. Now is the time to determine if sufficient long-term health care plans have been made, as well as who will make financial decisions on your parents’ behalf if they lose the ability to safely handle their money. Proper planning gives you time to discuss your decisions with family members. This open communication can help to reduce, if not eliminate, the risk of family discord, resentment or conflict.




Having a hard time starting a conversation about family finances? Here are a few questions to make it easy for you.



 
Is it important to talk about money as a family?




 
At what age do you hope to retire?




 
When is it ok to borrow money?




 
What's your favorite charitable cause and why?




 
How is your generation different from the generations before you?




 
Should children give to charity?

A New Paradigm for Family Wealth Planning











Align Your Goals with Strategies for Reaching Them



Morgan Stanley’s goals-based wealth planning framework strives to guard against more than just market volatility. We believe that a successful planning strategy must meet the following criteria:
1. Your plan should be customized to reflect what you care about most. It should address both the goals you hope to achieve and the risk of outliving your assets.
2. Your plan should address the shifting nature of issues and unknowns you face at different stages of your life and consider risks beyond market volatility, like inflation.
3. Your plan should seek to mitigate judgment and behavioral risks such as panic selling in difficult markets or overspending.





Smash the Taboo



We know it’s hard. Sitting down to discuss your parents’ long-term health needs or checking in with your siblings to see if you are all on the same page relating to any inheritance isn’t easy. What about your children; do they value the same causes that have moved you all your life? Is your spouse prepared should something happen to you?
The tough part is getting started, and that’s where bringing in an objective financial professional can help. We understand that wealth is about much more than just money, and can guide the conversation down those difficult paths to uncover the things that matter most to you and your family. We don’t believe in having a single conversation, but rather a series of talks that shift as your life changes. It’s a road. And you don’t have to travel it alone.
It starts with family, but doesn’t have to end there. We are ready to provide the guidance, tools and information that can help you tackle these difficult topics and transform them into meaningful discussions for your future. Uncover what matters most to you and find a Morgan Stanley Financial Advisor to help guide the conversation. Because the road starts here.
