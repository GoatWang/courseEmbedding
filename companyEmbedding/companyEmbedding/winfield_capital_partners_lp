Wynnefield Capital, Inc. (WCI) is a value investor, specializing in U.S. small cap situations that have a company or industry specific catalyst(s). Surfacing of these catalysts unlocks existing, but previously unrecognized value for shareholders. WCI maintains an active investment philosophy. We are not involved in "Greenmail" situations, but focus on initiatives with management and outside directors to release value. 
We seek out under-followed, unrecognized and undervalued companies that fit our parameters which include minimal balance sheet risk and potential for micro or macro change. WCI adds value by uncovering both long and short opportunities through in-depth original research. The investment manager holds core positions about 6-8 years, turning the portfolio approximately 25% per year, providing its limited partners the benefit of tax efficient returns.
WCI was established in 1992. Our founding partners, Nelson Obus and Joshua Landes, held senior research and institutional equity positions at Lazard Freres & Co. Among the initial Wynnefield investors were Nelson's and Joshua's colleagues at Lazard.
