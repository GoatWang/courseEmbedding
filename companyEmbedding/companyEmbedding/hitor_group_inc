Hitor Group to Introduce New German Oil Cleaning ProductsHomeMailFlickrTumblrNewsSportsFinanceCelebrityAnswersGroupsMobileMoreYahooSearchSearchSkip to NavigationSkip to Main ContentSkip to Related Content0Hitor Group to Introduce New German Oil Cleaning ProductsMarketwireOctober 31, 2011ReblogShareTweetShareKIRKLAND, WASHINGTON--(Marketwire -10/31/11)- Hitor Group, Inc. (OTCQB: HITR.PK - News) (the "Company") is pleased to announce with its recent move to Germany, it has signed agreements that will add several products lines which focus on Hitor Groups goal of reducing global reliance on fossil fuels and to eliminate harmful emissions.The Company will add these products to the independent tests to be conducted in Montreal, Quebec at the CAD Railroad Industries Ltd. locomotive test facility. The new products will focus on lubricating fluids, cleaning the oil by separating it from water and any contaminants. It works with bio-diesel, engine oil, gear oil, hydraulic oil, bio-oil, and compressor oil, to significantly reduce the need to change oil, saving as much as 90% on the cost of lubricants and decreasing maintenance.Hitor Group CEO Ken Martin said, "The human race is dumping 22 million tons of CO2 into the oceans every day and much of this comes from cars, boats, trucks, motorcycles, lawnmowers, generators, airplanes that burn fossil fuels. Our goal is to reduce this by as much as 50% in engines that use these fossil fuels. One of the most dramatic and advancing results of CO2 is acidification of our oceans which has increased by 30% in the last 240 years. It has been estimated within 50 years shell fish, and coral will be extinct. This food source will affect fish higher in the food chain and within 100 to 200 years the oceans will be void of life, just like the Acid European lake example. Our generation will not see the repercussion, but our children and their children will. Acidification of our oceans may not be reversible but we must endeavor to pursue a remedy. Last year's oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico is a microcosm of this acidification process, and look what this does to the environment and the economy in the immediate vicinity".About Nano-Jet:Nano-Jet Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary of Hitor Group, Inc. (HITR), is the sole owner and producer of the patented Nano-Jet line of magnetic fuel performance enhancing Modules. Nano-Jet offers the most highly refined and effective fuel performance enhancement technology available in the market today. Nano-Jet's proprietary design breaks down the molecular clusters which naturally exist in the fuel into single molecules and polarizes those molecules to enable a more complete combustion of the fuel/air mix. Extensive testing of the line of Nano-Jet models on a variety of gasoline and diesel engines has conclusively proven that fuel treated by these fuel performance optimizing devices produces measurably more power, increases fuel economy by an average of 5% or more and reduces toxic exhaust emissions 30% or more.The Nano-Jet Fuel Module is suitable for use with a wide variety of internal combustion power plants from the smallest single cylinder gasoline engine to diesel railroad locomotives and marine diesels.To learn more about The Hitor Group, please visit our website at www.hitorgroup.com.DisclaimerAny statements that are not based on historical fact are forward-looking statements.

Extensive testing of the line of Nano-Jet models on a variety of gasoline and diesel engines has conclusively proven that fuel treated by these fuel performance optimizing devices produces measurably more power, increases fuel economy by an average of 5% or more and reduces toxic exhaust emissions 30% or more.The Nano-Jet Fuel Module is suitable for use with a wide variety of internal combustion power plants from the smallest single cylinder gasoline engine to diesel railroad locomotives and marine diesels.To learn more about The Hitor Group, please visit their website at www.hitorgroup.com.DisclaimerAny statements that are not based on historical fact are forward-looking statements.

The Company changed its name on August 27, 2004 to LFG International, Inc. Upon completion of a merger with Nano-Jet Corporation, a Nevada corporation, the Company changed its name to Nano-Jet Corporation. Effective December 6, 2007, the Company further changed its name to Hitor Group, Inc. Hitor Group, through its three subsidiaries would market to the American and International trucking and automobile parts distribution companies as well as to oil companies and alternative fuel vehicle distributors. The Company's product is anticipated to allow owners and operators of both gasoline and diesel powered vehicles to potentially increase fuel efficiency while reducing fuel emissions into the environment.Its two-fold marketing and sales strategy is directed toward establishing immediate technological acceptance, rapid penetration and market dominance within five years of market entry. The company would first move toward trucking companies and truck manufacturers, truck, automobile and motorcycle distributors, as well as wholesalers. Hitor Group owns a proprietary technology and currently is applying for patents and has hired patent attorneys for this technology worldwide. Although there are many companies who claim to have developed fuel-efficient products and fuel additives, when tested most of these products have not been proven. Select companies have attempted to produce similar fuel conservation products. 展开中文(简体)English (US)日本語한국어Français (France)Bahasa IndonesiaPolskiEspañolPortuguês (Brasil)DeutschItalianoMessengerFacebook Lite用户地点游戏位置名人二手市场小组食谱彩色气球Instagram公司简介创建广告创建主页开发者招聘信息隐私权政策Cookie广告选项条款设置活动日志 Facebook © 2017

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!

About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
