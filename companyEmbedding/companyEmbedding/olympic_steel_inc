Olympic Steel, Inc. is a steel processor based in Cleveland, Ohio.
Current operations[edit]
Olympic Steel, Inc. engages in the processing and distribution of processed carbon, coated and stainless flat-rolled sheet, and coil and plate steel products primarily in the United States. The company owns 17 facilities throughout the eastern-half of the United States and 1 in Mexico.[2]
Its services include cutting-to-length, slitting, and shearing. It also offers value-added processes such as blanking, tempering, plate burning, precision machining, welding, and fabricating and painting to process steel to specified lengths, widths, and shapes. It also owns two subsidiaries, Chicago Tube and Iron and Integrity Stainless.
History[edit]
Olympic Steel was founded in 1954 by brothers Sol and Morris Siegal and Sam Sigel. Initially, it was a metals trading company and owned no facilities.[3]
In 1956, it opened an 11,000-square-foot (1,000 m2) facility in Bedford Heights, Ohio. By 1966, the facility had grown to 35,000 square feet (3,300 m2). The company offered multiple flat-rolled steel products, including coil and plate products.
In 1975, Michael Siegal, son of Sol Siegal, joined the company. The next year, the facility was again expanded to 56,000 square feet (5,200 m2). By 1985, the company had founded a Southern sales office in Georgia and another office in Pennsylvania. Michael Siegal bought out his father's share of the company in 1984 and David Wolfort joined the company as General Manager.
In 1987, Olympic acquired Viking Steel Company, based in Elk Grove Village, Illinois.
In 1988, the Philadelphia Division was formed by moving the Eastern sales office to a full warehouse facility in Lester, Pennsylvania.
In 1989, the Southern Division moved to Greenville, South Carolina, consolidating several sales offices in the region and Olympic Steel Trading was formed to sell steel in Puerto Rico and Mexico.
In the early 1990s, Olympic expanded further by purchasing Eastern Steel in Milford, Connecticut, Juster Steel of Minneapolis, Minnesota, and Lafayette Steel & Processing in Detroit, Michigan.
In 1994, the company offered 4,000,000 shares in an IPO. In 1996, it offered 2,500,000 more shares.[4]
In 1997, the company acquired Southeastern Metal Processing for $11.5 million in cash and the assumption of $5.8 million in liabilities.[5]
In 1997, the company broke-ground on its second temper mill at a new facility in Bettendorf, Iowa.[6]
In 1998, Olympic entered the machining business by purchasing the assets of JNT Machining and opening a new facility in Chambersburg, Pennsylvania.[7]
In 2006, it purchased the Siler City, North Carolina-based Tinsley Group.[8]
In 2008, it announced new fabrication facilities to be built in Dover, Ohio and Sumter, South Carolina.[9][10]
In 2013, the founder, Sol Siegal, died.[11]

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The three scores are based on the trading styles of Growth, Value, and Momentum.


Growth Score
A


Value Score
A


Momentum Score
A


Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B.

Simple Fly Fishing Special Edition 


                        Last spring, we launched the Simple Fly Fishing Campaign, a program designed to demystify fly fishing and make it more accessible by offering simple gear, easy techniques and basic teachings for all ages and skill levels. Simple Fly Fishing introduced the stripped-down tenkara technique and helped                        
                             bring thousands of new anglers to the sport. Now we've created an autographed limited edition release of the book in hardcover. Only 500 copies were produced, each numbered and signed by all three authors. The books are accompanied by four high-quality photographic prints of the authors' favorite fish, and one is signed by the artist, James Prosek. Everything is elegantly packaged in a cloth-covered, silkscreened clamshell box.

Berger Hunting Bullets - 6mm (.243) 87gr Match Hunting Vld 100/Box 


                        The Berger Hunting bullet line is proving to be the most lethal big game hunting bullets available. All of the Berger Hunting bullets are made in the VLD design.

Olympic Steel, Inc. is a steel processor based in Cleveland, Ohio.
Current operations[edit]
Olympic Steel, Inc. engages in the processing and distribution of processed carbon, coated and stainless flat-rolled sheet, and coil and plate steel products primarily in the United States. The company owns 17 facilities throughout the eastern-half of the United States and 1 in Mexico.[2]
Its services include cutting-to-length, slitting, and shearing. It also offers value-added processes such as blanking, tempering, plate burning, precision machining, welding, and fabricating and painting to process steel to specified lengths, widths, and shapes. It also owns two subsidiaries, Chicago Tube and Iron and Integrity Stainless.
History[edit]
Olympic Steel was founded in 1954 by brothers Sol and Morris Siegal and Sam Sigel. Initially, it was a metals trading company and owned no facilities.[3]
In 1956, it opened an 11,000-square-foot (1,000 m2) facility in Bedford Heights, Ohio. By 1966, the facility had grown to 35,000 square feet (3,300 m2). The company offered multiple flat-rolled steel products, including coil and plate products.
In 1975, Michael Siegal, son of Sol Siegal, joined the company. The next year, the facility was again expanded to 56,000 square feet (5,200 m2). By 1985, the company had founded a Southern sales office in Georgia and another office in Pennsylvania. Michael Siegal bought out his father's share of the company in 1984 and David Wolfort joined the company as General Manager.
In 1987, Olympic acquired Viking Steel Company, based in Elk Grove Village, Illinois.
In 1988, the Philadelphia Division was formed by moving the Eastern sales office to a full warehouse facility in Lester, Pennsylvania.
In 1989, the Southern Division moved to Greenville, South Carolina, consolidating several sales offices in the region and Olympic Steel Trading was formed to sell steel in Puerto Rico and Mexico.
In the early 1990s, Olympic expanded further by purchasing Eastern Steel in Milford, Connecticut, Juster Steel of Minneapolis, Minnesota, and Lafayette Steel & Processing in Detroit, Michigan.
In 1994, the company offered 4,000,000 shares in an IPO. In 1996, it offered 2,500,000 more shares.[4]
In 1997, the company acquired Southeastern Metal Processing for $11.5 million in cash and the assumption of $5.8 million in liabilities.[5]
In 1997, the company broke-ground on its second temper mill at a new facility in Bettendorf, Iowa.[6]
In 1998, Olympic entered the machining business by purchasing the assets of JNT Machining and opening a new facility in Chambersburg, Pennsylvania.[7]
In 2006, it purchased the Siler City, North Carolina-based Tinsley Group.[8]
In 2008, it announced new fabrication facilities to be built in Dover, Ohio and Sumter, South Carolina.[9][10]
In 2013, the founder, Sol Siegal, died.[11]

Olympic Steel, Inc. is a steel processor based in Cleveland, Ohio.
Current operations[edit]
Olympic Steel, Inc. engages in the processing and distribution of processed carbon, coated and stainless flat-rolled sheet, and coil and plate steel products primarily in the United States. The company owns 17 facilities throughout the eastern-half of the United States and 1 in Mexico.[2]
Its services include cutting-to-length, slitting, and shearing. It also offers value-added processes such as blanking, tempering, plate burning, precision machining, welding, and fabricating and painting to process steel to specified lengths, widths, and shapes. It also owns two subsidiaries, Chicago Tube and Iron and Integrity Stainless.
History[edit]
Olympic Steel was founded in 1954 by brothers Sol and Morris Siegal and Sam Sigel. Initially, it was a metals trading company and owned no facilities.[3]
In 1956, it opened an 11,000-square-foot (1,000 m2) facility in Bedford Heights, Ohio. By 1966, the facility had grown to 35,000 square feet (3,300 m2). The company offered multiple flat-rolled steel products, including coil and plate products.
In 1975, Michael Siegal, son of Sol Siegal, joined the company. The next year, the facility was again expanded to 56,000 square feet (5,200 m2). By 1985, the company had founded a Southern sales office in Georgia and another office in Pennsylvania. Michael Siegal bought out his father's share of the company in 1984 and David Wolfort joined the company as General Manager.
In 1987, Olympic acquired Viking Steel Company, based in Elk Grove Village, Illinois.
In 1988, the Philadelphia Division was formed by moving the Eastern sales office to a full warehouse facility in Lester, Pennsylvania.
In 1989, the Southern Division moved to Greenville, South Carolina, consolidating several sales offices in the region and Olympic Steel Trading was formed to sell steel in Puerto Rico and Mexico.
In the early 1990s, Olympic expanded further by purchasing Eastern Steel in Milford, Connecticut, Juster Steel of Minneapolis, Minnesota, and Lafayette Steel & Processing in Detroit, Michigan.
In 1994, the company offered 4,000,000 shares in an IPO. In 1996, it offered 2,500,000 more shares.[4]
In 1997, the company acquired Southeastern Metal Processing for $11.5 million in cash and the assumption of $5.8 million in liabilities.[5]
In 1997, the company broke-ground on its second temper mill at a new facility in Bettendorf, Iowa.[6]
In 1998, Olympic entered the machining business by purchasing the assets of JNT Machining and opening a new facility in Chambersburg, Pennsylvania.[7]
In 2006, it purchased the Siler City, North Carolina-based Tinsley Group.[8]
In 2008, it announced new fabrication facilities to be built in Dover, Ohio and Sumter, South Carolina.[9][10]
In 2013, the founder, Sol Siegal, died.[11]

The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion

Data Format: N-Triples RDF

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.


RDF

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
