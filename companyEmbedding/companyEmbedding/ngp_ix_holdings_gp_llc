WEF to buy Northern Blizzard from Riverstone, NGP for $244 mln
 Waterous Energy Fund (WEF), a private equity fund launched earlier this year by Canadian investment banker Adam Waterous, has agreed to buy Northern Blizzard Resources Inc (TSX: NBZ) for $244 million. The deal will see WEF acquire about 67 percent of the company's issued and outstanding common shares from Riverstone Holdings and NGP Energy Capital Management, both U.S. private equity firms. Riverstone and NGP have backed Northern Blizzard since its founding in 2009 and public listing in 2014. Based in Calgary, Northern Blizzard is a crude oil production and development company. Once closed, the investment will be WEF's second to date.

 Waterous Energy Fund (WEF), a private equity fund launched earlier this year by Canadian investment banker Adam Waterous, has agreed to buy Northern Blizzard Resources Inc (TSX: NBZ) for $244 million. The deal will see WEF acquire about 67 percent of the company’s issued and outstanding common shares from Riverstone Holdings and NGP Energy Capital Management, both U.S. private equity firms. Riverstone and NGP have backed Northern Blizzard since its founding in 2009 and public listing in 2014. Based in Calgary, Northern Blizzard is a crude oil production and development company. Once closed, the investment will be WEF’s second to date.
PRESS RELEASE
Waterous Energy Fund Announces Agreements to Acquire 67% Ownership of Northern Blizzard Resources Inc.
CALGARY, ALBERTA–(Marketwired – April 10, 2017) – Waterous Energy Fund (“WEF”) is pleased to announce its affiliates, WEF GP (International) Ltd., the general partner of Waterous Energy Fund (International) L.P. and WEF GP (Canadian) Corp., the general partner of Waterous Energy Fund (Canadian) L.P., have today entered into two separate purchase agreements to acquire approximately 67% of the issued and outstanding common shares of Northern Blizzard Resources Inc. (the “Company”) from affiliates of Riverstone Holdings, LLC, and NGP Energy Capital Management, LLC for a purchase price of $3.60 / share totalling approximately $244 million. 





The purchase agreements, each dated April 10, 2017, provide for the purchase of 27,426,170 common shares, representing approximately 27.18% of the issued and outstanding common shares of the Company from R/C Canada Coöperatief U.A. (“R/C Canada”), and 40,316,175 common shares, representing approximately 39.91% of the issued and outstanding common shares of the Company, from NGP IX Northern Blizzard S.A.R.L. (“NGP IX”). This transaction represents the first acquisition of securities of the Company by WEF or its affiliates, who currently hold no common shares of the Company. Upon completion of the transaction WEF would own 67,742,345 common shares of the Company which will, assuming no changes to the capital structure of the Company prior to completion of the purchase, represent 67.09% of the issued and outstanding common shares of the Company.
The closings of the transactions are conditional on receiving certain regulatory approvals, including those governed by the Investment Canada Act and Competition Act. In addition to the purchase of the shares, WEF will also be assigned R/C Canada’s and NGP IX’s interest in a registration rights agreement dated July 22, 2010.
Commenting on the acquisition, WEF Managing Partner and CEO Adam Waterous stated: “I have been following Northern Blizzard’s progress for many years and we are pleased to begin a long-term partnership with CEO John Rooney and President Jim Artindale. Over the last several years, current management’s innovative development processes and techniques have transformed the Saskatchewan focused company’s core Cactus Lake asset into one of North America’s largest vertical well polymer floods. We believe the property’s low decline, long reserve life, and high free cash flow make it a top quartile North American oil asset, which will serve as a platform for future growth for the company. We look forward to working with management and the Board to identify opportunities to further enhance shareholder value.” 





WEF is acquiring the shares for investment purposes. WEF may seek representation on the Board of Directors commensurate with its shareholding interest, once acquired. WEF may, in the future, increase or decrease its beneficial ownership, control or direction over securities of the Company. WEF is supportive of management, and intends to work with them to develop the optimal business strategy for the Company going forward.

 Waterous Energy Fund (WEF), a private equity fund launched earlier this year by Canadian investment banker Adam Waterous, has agreed to buy Northern Blizzard Resources Inc (TSX: NBZ) for $244 million.

Waterous Energy Fund said April 10 that it acquired 67 percent of Northern Blizzard Resources Inc for about $244 million through two separate purchase agreements. Riverstone Holdings LLC and NGP Energy Capital Management were the sellers. Northern Blizzard, of Calgary, Canada, is a crude oil production and development company.
PRESS RELEASE
CALGARY, ALBERTA–(Marketwired – April 10, 2017) – Waterous Energy Fund (“WEF”) is pleased to announce its affiliates, WEF GP (International) Ltd., the general partner of Waterous Energy Fund (International) L.P. and WEF GP (Canadian) Corp., the general partner of Waterous Energy Fund (Canadian) L.P., have today entered into two separate purchase agreements to acquire approximately 67% of the issued and outstanding common shares of Northern Blizzard Resources Inc. (the “Company”) from affiliates of Riverstone Holdings, LLC, and NGP Energy Capital Management, LLC for a purchase price of $3.60 / share totalling approximately $244 million.
The purchase agreements, each dated April 10, 2017, provide for the purchase of 27,426,170 common shares, representing approximately 27.18% of the issued and outstanding common shares of the Company from R/C Canada Coöperatief U.A. (“R/C Canada”), and 40,316,175 common shares, representing approximately 39.91% of the issued and outstanding common shares of the Company, from NGP IX Northern Blizzard S.A.R.L. (“NGP IX”). This transaction represents the first acquisition of securities of the Company by WEF or its affiliates, who currently hold no common shares of the Company. Upon completion of the transaction WEF would own 67,742,345 common shares of the Company which will, assuming no changes to the capital structure of the Company prior to completion of the purchase, represent 67.09% of the issued and outstanding common shares of the Company.
The closings of the transactions are conditional on receiving certain regulatory approvals, including those governed by the Investment Canada Act and Competition Act. In addition to the purchase of the shares, WEF will also be assigned R/C Canada’s and NGP IX’s interest in a registration rights agreement dated July 22, 2010.
Commenting on the acquisition, WEF Managing Partner and CEO Adam Waterous stated: “I have been following Northern Blizzard’s progress for many years and we are pleased to begin a long-term partnership with CEO John Rooney and President Jim Artindale. Over the last several years, current management’s innovative development processes and techniques have transformed the Saskatchewan focused company’s core Cactus Lake asset into one of North America’s largest vertical well polymer floods. We believe the property’s low decline, long reserve life, and high free cash flow make it a top quartile North American oil asset, which will serve as a platform for future growth for the company. We look forward to working with management and the Board to identify opportunities to further enhance shareholder value.”
WEF is acquiring the shares for investment purposes. WEF may seek representation on the Board of Directors commensurate with its shareholding interest, once acquired. WEF may, in the future, increase or decrease its beneficial ownership, control or direction over securities of the Company. WEF is supportive of management, and intends to work with them to develop the optimal business strategy for the Company going forward.
WEF is acquiring the common shares of the Company pursuant to the exemption from the formal take-over bid requirements of securities legislation pursuant to the exemption set out in Section 4.2 of Multilateral Instrument 62-102 (the “Instrument”). In accordance with that exemption, the purchase is being made from only two persons, no offer is being made generally to the common shareholders of the Company, and the purchase price for the common shares is less than 115% of the market price of the common shares, calculated in accordance with the instrument. This press release is being disseminated as required by National Instrument 62-103 – The Early Warning System and Related Take-Over Bid and Insider Reporting Issues and Multilateral Instrument 62-104 – Take-Over Bids and Issuer Bids in connection with the filing of early warning reports (the “Early Warning Reports”) containing the information with respect to the foregoing matters. A copy of the Early Warning Reports will be filed shortly under the Corporation’s profile on SEDAR (www.sedar.com) and a copy thereof shall be promptly sent to anyone who requests it from the person noted below.

	This Item 2 shall be deemed to amend and supplement Item 2:


	Certain information required by this Item 2 concerning the executive officers, directors and managers of the Reporting Persons is set
	forth on

	Schedule A

	, attached hereto, which is incorporated herein by reference.



	Item 4. Purpose of Transaction.



	Item 4 is hereby amended and supplemented by the following:


	On November 19, 2013, Memorial Resource, as the selling unitholder, the Issuer, Memorial Production Partners GP LLC and Memorial
	Production Operating LLC, entered into an underwriting agreement attached hereto as Exhibit H with Barclays Capital Inc. (the 


	Underwriter


	), providing for the offer and sale by Memorial Resource (the 


	Secondary
	Offering


	), and purchase by the Underwriter of 7,061,294 Common Units at a price of $19.12 per Common Unit. The Secondary Offering closed on November 22, 2013.





	Pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement, Memorial Resource has entered into a lock-up agreement
	(the 


	Lock-up Agreement


	) pursuant to which it has agreed with the Underwriter not to offer, sell, contract to sell, pledge or otherwise dispose of (or enter into any transaction which is designed to, or might reasonably be
	expected to, result in the disposition) any Common Units or securities convertible into or exchangeable for Common Units during the period from November 19, 2013 continuing through and including the date 45 days thereafter, except with the
	prior written consent of the Underwriter.


	The foregoing descriptions of the Underwriting Agreement and the Lock-up Agreement do not
	purport to be complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the Underwriting Agreement, which is filed as Exhibit H hereto, and the form of Lock-up Agreement, which is included as Exhibit A to the Underwriting Agreement, and are
	incorporated herein by reference.


	Except as set forth above in this Item 4, as amended and supplemented, the Reporting Persons have
	no present plans or proposals which would result in or relate to any of the transactions described in subparagraphs (a) through (i) of Item 4 of Schedule 13D.



	Item 5. Interest in Securities of the Issuer.



	Item 5 is hereby amended and restated by the following:


	(a)-(b)


	 




	 


	(i)


	Memorial Resource does not beneficially own any Common Units. Its beneficial ownership (with respect to both voting and dispositive power) therefore constitutes 0.0% of the outstanding Common Units. Memorial Resource is
	the sole record owner of 5,360,912 subordinated units which are convertible into an equal number of Common Units upon satisfaction of the conditions in the Partnership Agreement. Memorial Resource is the indirect beneficial owner of the 0.1% general
	partner interest in the Issuer and incentive distribution rights in the Issuer by virtue of being the sole member of the General Partner.




	 




	 


	(ii)


	NGP VIII, NGP IX and NGP IX Offshore do not directly own any Common Units. NGP VIII, NGP IX and NGP IX Offshore own an approximate 50.3%, 47.3% and 2.4% interest, respectively, in Memorial Resource. By virtue of owning
	Memorial Resource, each of NGP VIII, NGP IX and NGP IX Offshore may be deemed to possess shared voting and dispositive powers with respect to those units held by Memorial Resource, representing 5,360,912 subordinated units.




	 




	 


	(iii)


	The General Partner does not directly own any Common Units. The General Partner may be deemed to beneficially own (i) the 0.1% general partner interest in the Issuer and (ii) the incentive distribution rights
	in the Issuer.




	 




	 


	(iv)


	Kenneth A. Hersh does not directly own any Common Units. Mr. Hersh is a member of the board of directors of the General Partner. Mr. Hersh is also an Authorized Member of the ultimate general partners of NGP
	VIII, NGP IX and NGP IX Offshore and thus may be deemed to possess shared voting and dispositive powers with respect those units held by Memorial Resource, representing 5,360,912 subordinated units that are attributable to NGP VIII, NGP IX and
	NGP IX Offshore.




	The above Reporting Persons disclaim beneficial ownership of the reported securities except to the extent
	of their pecuniary interests therein, and this report shall not be deemed an admission that the reporting persons are the beneficial owner of the reported securities for purposes of Section 16 or for any other purpose.


	(c) There have been no reportable transactions with respect to the Common Units within the last 60 days by the Reporting Persons except for the
	disposition of beneficial ownership of Common Units being reported on this Schedule 13D/A.


	(d) The Reporting Persons have the right to receive
	distributions from, and the proceeds from the sale of, the respective Common Units reported by such persons on the cover pages of this Schedule 13D/A and in this Item 5. See

	Schedule A

	for the information applicable to the Listed
	Persons. Except for the foregoing and the cash distribution described in Item 6 below, no other person is known by the Reporting Persons to have the right to receive or the power to direct the receipt of distributions from, or the proceeds from
	the sale of, Common Units beneficially owned by the Reporting Persons or, to the Reporting Persons knowledge, the Listed Persons.


	(e) The
	Reporting Persons are no longer beneficial owners of more than five percent of the outstanding Common Units.






	Item 6. Contracts, Arrangements, Understandings or Relationships With Respect to Securities of the
	Issuer.



	Item 6 is hereby amended and supplemented by the following:


	In connection with the sale of 7,061,294 Common Units by Memorial Resource in the Secondary Offering described in Item 4 above, such
	Common Units are no longer pledged under the Credit Agreement.


	Item 4 above summarizes certain provisions of the Underwriting
	Agreement and the Lock-up Agreement and is incorporated herein by reference. A copy of the Underwriting Agreement, which includes the form of Lock-up Agreement as Exhibit A thereto, is attached as Exhibit H hereto, and is incorporated by reference
	herein.

	extent permitted by the terms thereof, cease to be in full force and effect and valid, binding and enforceable in accordance with their terms against any Loan Party party thereto or, in the case of any Intercreditor Agreement, against any other
	party thereto (other than the Administrative Agent), or shall be repudiated by any of them (other than the Administrative Agent), or cease to create a valid and perfected Lien of the priority required thereby on any material part of the collateral
	purported to be covered thereby, except to the extent permitted by the terms of this Agreement, or the Borrower or any other Loan Party or any of their Affiliates or, in the case of the Intercreditor Agreement, any other party thereto (other than
	the Administrative Agent), shall so state in writing;


	2.14

	Amendment to Section 11.12 of the Credit Agreement

	.
	Section 11.12 of the Credit Agreement is hereby amended and restated in its entirety to read in full as follows:

	Secured Party) (by receiving the benefits thereunder and of the collateral pledged pursuant to the Security Instruments) agrees that the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement and each such other intercreditor agreement shall be binding on such
	Lender, such Affiliates and their respective successors and assigns, as if it were a party thereto. Each Lender agrees to cause each of its Affiliates that is a Secured Party to acknowledge, confirm and ratify the agreements entered into by such
	Lender on behalf of such Secured Party pursuant to this Section 11.12 forthwith upon the request of the Administrative Agent, any Loan Party or any other Lender.

	Schedule 7.14

	attached
	hereto shall be deemed to be attached as Schedule 7.14 to the Credit Agreement.

	forth in
