IMPORTANT NOTE TO HONG KONG INVESTORS (Declaration Facility)
Important Risk Disclosures

MIRAE ASSET GLOBAL DISCOVERY FUND

Mirae Asset Global Discovery Fund as an umbrella fund under UCITS regulations has within its different sub-funds (the 'Funds')

investing mainly in equities and equity related securities, each with a different risk profile.
Some Funds may invest in emerging markets that should be regarded as having a higher level of illiquidity and volatility than

investing in developed countries. Investors may suffer loss of the entire amount invested.
Some Funds may invest in single markets or specific sectors subject to higher concentration risk and liquidity risk than other funds

with a diversified portfolio of investments.
Investment involves risks. Investors should not only base on this website alone to make investment decisions. Before making any

investment decision, prospective investor should read the Funds' offering documents carefully for further details, including the

product features and risk factors, and should consider seeking independent professional advice.

MIRAE ASSET DISCOVERY FUND

Mirae Asset Discovery Fund as an umbrella fund domiciled in Hong Kong has within its different sub-funds (the 'Funds') investing

mainly in equities and equity related securities, each with a different risk profile.
Some Funds may invest in emerging markets that should be regarded as having a higher level of illiquidity and volatility than

investing in developed countries. Investors may suffer loss of the entire amount invested.
Some Funds may invest in single markets or specific sectors subject to higher concentration risk and liquidity risk than other funds

with a diversified portfolio of investments.
Investment involves risks. Investors should not only base on this website alone to make investment decisions. Before making any

investment decision, prospective investor should read the Funds' offering documents carefully for further details, including the

product features and risk factors, and should consider seeking independent professional advice.

MIRAE ASSET HORIZONS EXCHANGE TRADED FUNDS SERIES/ MIRAE ASSET HORIZONS EXCHANGE

TRADED FUNDS SERIES II/ MIRAE ASSET HORIZONS LEVERAGED AND

INVERSE SERIES

Mirae Asset Horizons Exchange Traded Funds Series and Mirae Asset Horizons Exchange Traded Funds Series II are umbrella funds with a series of

different sub-funds which are exchange traded funds and which seek to provide investment results that, before deduction of fees

and expenses, closely correspond to the performance of their respective underlying indices.
Mirae Asset Horizons Leveraged and Inverse Series is an umbrella fund with a series of different sub-funds tracking the inverse or

two times the performance on an index on a daily basis.
Mirae Asset Horizons Leveraged and Inverse Series is different from conventional exchange traded funds as it seeks leveraged or

inverse investment results relative to the Index and only on a Daily basis. This product is not intended for holding longer than one

day as the performance of this product over a longer period may deviate from and be uncorrelated to the leveraged performance of

the Index over the period.
Certain Funds are subject to concentration risk as a result of tracking the performance of a single country, single geographical

region (Asia) or single sector. They are likely to be more volatile than a broad-based fund, such as a global equity fund, as they are

more susceptible to fluctuations in value of the underlying indices resulting from adverse conditions in that single country, region or

sector.
Certain Funds invest in Asian emerging markets, and are therefore subject to greater risk of loss compared with investments in

developed markets due to greater political, economic, taxation and regulatory uncertainty and risks linked to volatility and market

liquidity.
An investment in the units of the Funds may directly or indirectly involve exchange rate risk.
The units of the Funds may trade at a substantial premium or discount to their net asset value.
Due to fees and expenses of the Funds, liquidity of the market, foreign exchange costs, and changes to the regulatory policies, the returns of the Funds may deviate from that of their respective underlying indices.
Investment involves risks. Investors may lose part or all of their investment. Investors should not base on this website alone to make investment decisions. Before making any investment decision, prospective investor should read the Funds' offering documents carefully for further details, including the product features and risk factors, and should consider seeking independent professional advice.
