COMPLICATED IMMIGRATION MATTER




“If you want the peace of mind that your case will is in the right hands and everything will done to get favorable outcome then Whitaker Legal, LLC is the right place. I came there for immigration matters and I was completely satisfied; without the diligence and hard work that I received from this attorney, I don’t think my case would be resolved. And the best thing is she put more emphasis on the outcome of my case than the money I had to pay. I am glad and thankful that I was referred to this place.” 



RESPONSE TO NOTICE OF INTENT TO DENY TPS




“Great great great. She is really the best immigration lawyer in town.  When I was in trouble I lost my hope, but she gave me a hope and said there are lots of way to fight back in your case and she did. Thank you, Nicole. In very first time she won my case. She is very smart, experienced and confident. Best of the best.”

RESPONSE TO NOTICE OF INTENT TO DENY BASED ON SUSPECTED MARRIAGE FRAUD




“My wife and I will like to use this opportunity to thank you for putting in your knowledge and experience in our case and making this happen. We are very grateful.Knowing a lawyer like you is out there to help people out is a huge relief. I must say you have earned my respect. You are a true professional.” 



N-400 INTERVIEW PREPARATION




“First, Nicole is a highly Professional. Second, even though I reached out to her after I sent my application, Nicole prepared me quite well for naturalization interview. Frankly, her preparation is what got me through. I had some concerns about my case because of a couple of unfortunate issues.
