Kenneth'sLucky Man Creme ClayWhat is it: a medium-to-high hold styling creme with a matte finish.  This formula gives a pliable hold that works great for medium to thick textures.
Why you love it: it's ‘layerable” and easy to use.  It can be cocktailed with Water Wax to create more sheen or cocktail with Forming Fiber to create more separation and definition. A “must” puck for matte finish days.

Kenneth'sLucky Man Forming FiberWhat is it: high hold, semi-matte styling and finishing wax.  The product is best used on short hair (1-3 inches) due to the resinous nature of the product (you can see and feel it by pinching your fingers together repeatedly and see the resin form a fibrous network of hold as it dries.) Why you use it: For styles that need maximum control, a dab of Forming Fiber can create maximum separation and definition. Great for finer textures that need more support and hold.

Witch Hazel to add extra astringency and ant-inflammatory cleansing. Men’s epidermal skin and scalp is thicker (why men tend to wrinkle less) but oilier and pores/follicles often become clogged with perspiration and oily hormones. This clogging can result in hair loss.
