	We are an integrated, growth-oriented oilfield service company serving companies engaged in the exploration and development of North American onshore unconventional oil and natural gas reserves. Our primary business objective is to grow our operations and create value for stockholders through organic opportunities and accretive acquisitions. Our suite of services includes completion and production services, natural sand proppant services, contract land and directional drilling services and remote accommodation services. Our completion and production services division provides pressure pumping services, pressure control services, flowback services and equipment rentals. Our natural sand proppant services division sells, distributes and is capable of producing proppant for hydraulic fracturing. Our contract land and directional drilling services division provides drilling rigs and crews for operators as well as rental equipment, such as mud motors and operational tools, for both vertical and horizontal drilling. Our remote accommodation services division provides housing, kitchen and dining, and recreational service facilities for oilfield workers located in remote areas away from readily available lodging. We believe that these services play a critical role in increasing the ultimate recovery and present value of production streams from unconventional resources. Our complementary suite of drilling and completion and production-related services provides us with the opportunity to cross-sell our services and expand our customer base and geographic positioning.

    	    Products    	

















	Muskie Proppant LLC
 



Products
Muskie can produce a wide variety of products based on the needs of our customers. We collaborate with customers to develop products to help them leverage the highest long-term production of an oil or gas well. We start by producing a majority of the standard proppant sizes as defined by the ISO/API 13503-2 specifications. These grain distributions can be customized to meet the demands of a particular well or frac stage.
Our superior Jordan substrate exhibits the physical properties necessary to withstand the environments of completion and production of the well. The highest quality raw sand from our Northern White (Jordan) deposit exhibits the highest crush resistance of natural substrates. The deposit yields over 50% coarser than the 50 mesh size which is significantly coarser than most deposits even in the Jordan formation. The chemical composition exhibits over 99% monocrystalline quartz. The shape (sphericity and roundness) and strength result in downhole durability and high conductivity. Our hard, rounded grains reduce wear on pumping equipment that minimizes down-time and completion costs.
Our normal production runs provide natural sand proppant in the following size specifications:

20/40 – standard
20/40 – coarse cut
30/50
40/70
Custom Gradations - Due to the flexibility of our plant we offer the ability to make any gradations that our customers need

Our net proceeds from the sale of 7,500,000 shares of common stock in this
offering are estimated to be $103.2 million, after deducting underwriting
discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses. We intend to use the
net proceeds from this offering to repay in full the outstanding borrowings
under our revolving credit facility. Any remaining net proceeds will be used for
other general corporate purposes, which may include the acquisition of
additional equipment and complementary businesses that enhance our existing
service offerings, broaden our service offerings or expand our customer
relationships.

As of June 30, 2016, we had $82.3 million in borrowings outstanding under our
revolving credit facility, with a weighted average interest rate of 3.3%. As of
September 30, 2016, our outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit
facility were $72.0 million. Our revolving credit facility matures on November
25, 2019.

Affiliates of certain of the underwriters are lenders under our revolving credit
facility and, as a result, will indirectly receive a portion of the proceeds of
this offering. Accordingly, this offering is being made in compliance with FINRA
Rule 5121.

We will not receive any proceeds from the sale of shares by the selling
stockholders, including any sale the selling stockholders may make upon exercise
of the underwriters’ option to purchase additional shares.


The markets in which we operate are highly competitive. To be successful, a
company must provide services and products that meet the specific needs of oil
and natural gas exploration and production companies and drilling services
contractors at competitive prices.

We provide our services and products across the United States and in Alberta,
Canada and we compete against different companies in each service and product
line we offer. Our competition includes many large and small oilfield service
companies, including the largest integrated oilfield services companies.

Our major competitors for our pressure control services include Schlumberger
Limited, Halliburton Company, Baker Hughes Incorporated, Weatherford
International Ltd., Key Energy Services Inc., Nabors Industries Ltd., Complete
Energy Services, Inc. and RPC Incorporated and a significant number of locally
oriented businesses. Our major competitors in pressure pumping services include
Halliburton Company, U.S. Well Services, LLC, Schlumberger Limited, Weatherford
International Ltd, C&J Energy Services Ltd., RPC Incorporated, Complete Energy
Services, Inc. and FracTech Services, Inc. In our contract and directional
drilling services segment, our primary competitors include Helmerich & Payne,
Inc., Precision Drilling Corporation, Patterson-UTI Energy, Inc., Cactus
Drilling, Sidewinder Drilling, Inc., Baker Hughes Incorporated, Weatherford
International Ltd. and various regional and local service providers. Our major
competitors in our proppant production and sales business are Badger Mining
Corporation, Fairmount Minerals, Ltd., Hi-Crush Partners LP, Preferred Proppants
LLC, Unimin Corporation and U.S. Silica Holdings Inc. Our major competitors for
our remote accommodation business include Oil States International, Inc., Black
Diamond Limited and a significant number of local businesses.

We believe that the principal competitive factors in the market areas that we
serve are quality of service and products, reputation for safety and technical
proficiency, availability and price. While we must be competitive in our
pricing, we believe our customers select our services and products based on the
local leadership and basin-expertise that our field management and operating
personnel use to deliver quality services and products.


Company Description
We are an integrated, growth-oriented oilfield service company serving companies
engaged in the exploration and development of North American onshore
unconventional oil and natural gas reserves. Our primary business objective is
to grow our operations and create value for stockholders through


 organic
opportunities and accretive acquisitions. Our suite of services includes
completion and production services, natural sand proppant services, contract
land and directional drilling services and remote accommodation services. Our
completion and production services division provides pressure pumping services,
pressure control services, flowback services and equipment rentals. Our natural
sand proppant services division sells, distributes and is capable of producing
proppant for hydraulic fracturing. Our contract land and directional drilling
services division provides drilling rigs and crews for operators as well as
rental equipment, such as mud motors and operational tools, for both vertical
and horizontal drilling. Our remote accommodation services division provides
housing, kitchen and dining, and recreational service facilities for oilfield
workers located in remote areas away from readily available lodging. We believe
that these services play a critical role in increasing the ultimate recovery and
present value of production streams from unconventional resources. Our
complementary suite of drilling and completion and production related services
provides us with the opportunity to cross-sell our services and expand our
customer base and geographic positioning.
