Iroquois Capital Management Comments on LRAD Corporation’s Earnings






February 07, 2013 01:15 PM Eastern Standard Time



NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Iroquois Capital Management, LLC today commented on the first fiscal 
      quarter earnings released by LRAD Corporation (NASDAQ: LRAD).
    

      Iroquois Capital commented, “As the owner of more than 5% of LRAD’s 
      common stock, we are very disappointed by LRAD’s results. The company 
      indicated that quarterly revenues declined by 17% year over year. 
      However, we were even more concerned by the large quarterly net loss 
      suffered by LRAD that compares to a net profit just one year ago.”
    

      “While management disclosed some new information that had not been 
      previously revealed on the direction of the business and the composition 
      of its revenues, we note that any nominal disclosure closely followed 
      our nomination of five independent nominees to replace the company’s 
      incumbent board. This only reinforces our belief that stockholders need 
      representation in the LRAD boardroom because we believe that this late 
      stage attempt at transparency is not enough to stem further 
      deterioration in shareholder value.”

NEW YORK, June 22, 2015 /PRNewswire/ --  Iroquois Capital Management, LLC (together with its affiliates, "Iroquois"), one of the largest unaffiliated shareholders of LRAD Corporation ("LRAD" or the "Company") (NASDAQ:  LRAD) with beneficial ownership of approximately 5.7% of the outstanding common stock of the Company, today announced that it has delivered a letter to the Company's Board of Directors.  Iroquois also announced it filed a Schedule 13D with the SEC earlier today, converting from its prior Schedule 13G filing.  
The full text of the letter follows:
June 22, 2015
LRAD Corporation
16990 Goldentop Road, Suite A
San Diego, CA 92127
Attn: Members of the Board of Directors
Dear Board Members,
Iroquois Capital Management, LLC ("Iroquois Capital", "we" or "us") manages investment funds that, together with its affiliates, collectively own approximately 5.7% of the outstanding common stock (including shares underlying certain warrants) of LRAD Corporation ("LRAD" or the "Company"), making us one of the Company's largest unaffiliated shareholders.  We are long-term value investors in the Company, having held shares of LRAD since 2005, and have a vested interest in seeing LRAD capitalize on all opportunities that may exist to create significant value for shareholders
In 2013 we worked closely with LRAD to reconstitute and enhance the board of directors (the "Board") by replacing two of its then-current directors.  Shortly thereafter, in early 2014, we transitioned to a passive Schedule 13G filing at LRAD, confident that with a reconfigured board, the Company would be well-positioned to steer itself in the right direction and create shareholder value. In fact, the stock proceeded to double in short form following the momentum of these important structural changes.  To that end, we are especially pleased that General John G. Coburn, one of our recommended directors, has proven effective in utilizing his vast experience and network around the globe to expand LRAD's international footprint, particularly in the Far East.  As a result, the Company's revenue from international business has been growing substantially.
Recently, however, with LRAD's share price down over 20% year-to-date while the Russell Microcap Growth Index is up 28%, we have become increasingly concerned that management and the Board may not be acting with a proper sense of urgency in terms of capitalizing on available opportunities to enhance shareholder value. Specifically, our concerns include (i) the Board's failure to effectively manage the Company's capital resources, including the excess cash on the balance sheet and the lack of share repurchases under the existing buyback plan, and (ii) the Company's failure to capitalize on available sales opportunities in emergency or general campus notifications, emergency warnings for natural disasters and even the recent shark attacks in North Carolina.  We also note that insiders, including the CEO and CFO, have recently engaged in sales of LRAD shares immediately upon the exercise of options sending the wrong message to shareholders.  In light of these concerns, we have converted our Schedule 13G back to a Schedule 13D so that we may be able to more actively engage with the Company and shareholders regarding these concerns and the most effective manner for addressing them. 
The Board has Failed to Properly Manage the Company's Capital Resources
The LRAD Board is tasked with the responsibility of acting as a steward of shareholder value. LRAD has excess cash on its balance sheet and, we believe, should take immediate steps to return this capital to its shareholders through either a substantial increase in its share repurchases under the Company's share buyback program or through a significant one-time dividend and a continuing dividend program.
According to its most recent Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, as of March 31, 2015, LRAD had over $23 million in cash and marketable securities on its balance sheet, which represents nearly two-thirds of total assets and over one-third of the Company's market capitalization.  What is the reason for holding this much of the Company's capital in cash?  Often companies with excess cash reserves take steps to return capital to shareholders.  We believe that without some compelling strategy to deploy such cash, the best approach for the Company is to return it to shareholders.  
The Company already has a share buyback program, which it adopted in mid-2013 and which expires on December 31, 2015.  Under the buyback program, as amended, the Company has been authorized to repurchase up to $4 million of the Company's outstanding common shares.  According to its public filings, the Company repurchased no shares in fiscal 2013, 277,157 shares for $516,352 (an average of $1.86/share) in fiscal 2014 and an additional 69,213 shares for $158,740 (an average of $2.29/share) in the first half of fiscal 2015.  This amounts to share repurchases to date of $675,092, or just 17% of what has been authorized.  How can a share buyback program increase shareholder value if it is not being properly utilized?  We strongly urge the Board to increase the amount of share repurchases under the program or issue a large, one-time cash dividend to shareholders.  
The Company has Failed to Take Advantage of Readily Available Business Opportunities 
Another concern is the apparent failure by the Company to capitalize on potentially significant business opportunities, particularly in areas in which the Company could realize substantial growth.  Given the highly-publicized nature of many events for which LRAD's products are typically utilized, there is no excuse in our mind that the Company has failed to recognize and capitalize on these growth opportunities.  
The Company launched its omnidirectional product line in 2012 in order to expand into the mass notification market, which the Company views as substantial in size and growing.  LRAD has stated that it has "added selling resources to focus on this market," however, it has missed rather obvious potential sales opportunities.  For example, the Company has not built a sales and marketing infrastructure to take advantage of opportunities in emergency or general campus notifications at schools and universities.  In light of the recent increase in campus shootings LRAD is well-positioned to provide public and private education institutions with LRAD's state-of-the-art emergency notification products.  LRAD has also missed sales opportunities with respect to emergency warnings for natural disasters.
Ultimately, we believe management needs to do a better job at recognizing potential sources of demand for both its directional and omnidirectional product lines and be prepared to expand into new or underdeveloped markets.  The Company should develop its sales and marketing capabilities in these areas to be able to more effectively capture these growth opportunities.
Concerns with Insider Sales of LRAD Stock
In addition to repurchasing a very limited number of what has been authorized under the Company's share buyback program, we are concerned with the significant selling of LRAD shares by certain insiders.  According to their insider filings, the Company's Chief Executive Officer, Thomas R. Brown and Chief Financial Officer, Katherine H. McDermott, have been exercising their options and immediately selling large amounts of stock at a substantial profit.  Mrs. McDermott's sales are particularly disconcerting given her particularly generous compensation package coupled with the fact that she sold each and every share she exercised. 
What's more, the prices at which these insiders are selling the shares are often higher than the prices at which the Company has offered to repurchase its own shares from LRAD shareholders.  Ms. McDermott on the Q1 2015 earnings call essentially admitted that the stock price has been too high for the Company to engage in share repurchases in the first quarter, stating: 
"We didn't have any repurchases in the first quarter.  Based on where our stock price has been, it's been up pretty high at this point so its still – the program is still active through the end of the calendar year.  So, depending on the price, if the prices are at a reasonable level, we will do future repurchases, but there weren't any in the first quarter."  
It appears that LRAD management and the Board will not engage in share repurchases unless it can acquire the shares at a discount, however, when it comes to their own shares, the CEO and CFO are happy to exercise options and sell their shares regardless of the price.
At a time when the Company has excess cash reserves and is conducting its own share buyback program, why are these executives selling their stock in such high numbers?  These actions are in contrast to what the Company is attempting to accomplish through the share buyback program. 
In light of all of the above concerns, we remain very excited about the prospects of the Company and open to discussing the best ways in which we can constructively work together with the LRAD Board to take advantage of the available opportunities for the Company to create value for the benefit of shareholders.
Best Regards,
Richard Abbe

History

From the beginning, Iroquois Capital Group has been a Nashville-based provider of financial services to early-stage and lower middle market companies. In 2006, Iroquois was founded to take over the management of a troubled institutional pharmacy company, which became our initial portfolio company. A large publicly held health care company later acquired this company, creating a favorable return for its investors.
Iroquois next founded the portfolio company REIT Investment Group (“RIG”), which provides shareholder and compliance services to over 300 private REITs, giving investors access to preferred stock in these REITs.
Through Iroquois Capital Advisors—our FINRA member broker-dealer—we offer highly selective alternative investments to high net worth individuals. An example of such an investment is Iroquois’ portfolio company, Covenant Surgical Partners (“CSP”), which acquires, owns and manages ambulatory surgery centers. In 2008, Iroquois and its investors provided CSP its initial seed funding. Over $200 million of additional capital for CSP’s growth has been provided through our network of high net worth individuals and institutions, along with Iroquois’ continued participation in each round of equity offerings.
In early 2011, Iroquois created its investment banking group to provide mergers and acquisitions advisory and private capital raising services for middle market companies.
Iroquois expanded its platform of specialty finance services and created Iroquois Financial Partners I, LP (“IFP I”), which provided credit support for loans made to early stage companies in need of capital, affording qualified investors the opportunity to invest in growth-stage companies. Investors in IFP I were given the ability to realize a return on an “under-utilized” asset–their personal credit. This is different than the typical committed capital arrangement.
In 2013, Iroquois created an additional alternative investment opportunity for qualified investors by merging IFP I into Iroquois Financial Partners II, L.P. (“IFP II”). IFP II provides qualified investors the same opportunities as IFP I but on a much larger scale.
Iroquois has a long and successful track record of providing debt and equity capital and offering investment banking services to middle market companies and providing alternative investments for our base of high net worth individuals and institutional investors.

Iroquois Capital Nominates Two Highly Qualified Directors For Election to the LRAD Board

Delivers Letter to LRAD's Board of Directors
Has Lost All Confidence in the Ability of LRAD's President & CEO Thomas R. Brown to Capitalize on LRAD's Industry-Leading Technology and Deliver Value for Shareholders
Expresses Serious Concerns with LRAD's Dismal Operational and Stock Performance and Recent Insider Sales by Management
Believes Material Changes in Executive Leadership, Board Composition, and Corporate Strategy Are Required to Drive Shareholder Value Creation at LRAD




Jan 14, 2016, 9:19am EST














NEW YORK, Jan. 14, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Iroquois Capital Management, LLC, (together with funds managed by it, "Iroquois"), one of the largest shareholders of LRAD Corporation ("LRAD" or the "Company") (NASDAQ: LRAD) with a beneficial ownership interest in approximately 6.8% of LRAD's outstanding shares, inclusive of shares held by members of Iroquois' 13(d) reporting group, today announced that it has delivered a letter to the Company's Board of Directors (the "Board"), the full text of which is included below.  Iroquois also announced today that it has submitted a letter to the Company nominating two candidates with strong, relevant backgrounds for election to the Board at LRAD's 2016 Annual Meeting.  Iroquois believes that additional shareholder representation on the Board alongside General John G. Coburn, Richard H. Osgood and Dennis J. Wend will help ensure that shareholders' best interests are appropriately represented and that management is held accountable for its underperformance.
Iroquois' highly qualified director nominees include:
Scott L. Anchin, a restructuring professional with more than 19 years of leadership experience spanning a variety of industries. Since 2009, Mr. Anchin has worked for Alvarez & Marsal North America, LLC, a global professional services firm specializing in turnaround and interim management and performance improvement. 
Daniel H. McCollum, a Managing Director in the Investment Office of Brown University in Providence, RI, a position which he has held since 2013.  
The full text of Iroquois' letter to the LRAD Board follows:
January 14, 2016
LRAD Corporation16990 Goldentop Road, Suite ASan Diego, CA 92127Attn: Members of the Board of Directors
Dear Board Members,
Iroquois Capital Management, LLC ("Iroquois Capital", "we" or "us"), together with funds managed by it and members of its Schedule 13D reporting group, is one of the largest shareholders of LRAD Corporation ("LRAD" or the "Company") with a combined beneficial ownership interest in approximately 6.8% of LRAD's outstanding shares.  We are long-term value investors in the Company, having held shares of LRAD since 2005, and have a vested interest in seeing LRAD capitalize on all opportunities that may exist to create significant value for shareholders
As you know, we worked constructively with LRAD back in 2013 to reconstitute and enhance the board of directors (the "Board") by replacing two directors with directors that we recommended.  We even subsequently converted our Schedule 13D back to a passive Schedule 13G filing as we were hopeful that our involvement had helped to put the Company back on the right track towards shareholder value creation.  
Unfortunately, it now appears that despite our efforts in 2013, management remains in control and perpetuating what we view as a problematic, value-destructive status quo while demonstrating little accountability for performance.  Given this lack of progress, we now find ourselves back in a similar situation as we faced in 2013, with both the operations and corporate governance of the Company in need of significant reform in order to enhance shareholder value. 
We Have Lost Confidence in Thomas R. Brown as LRAD's President and Chief Executive Officer
We have significant concerns and doubts regarding the ability of the Company's President and Chief Executive Officer, Thomas R. Brown, to properly manage the Company's capital resources and take advantage of readily available business opportunities.  LRAD's operational performance has been woeful under Mr. Brown.  On the 2014 year-end conference call, Mr. Brown said he was targeting 20% revenue growth in 2015.  Instead, the Company's total revenues declined approximately 31% year-over-year while income from operations was down more than 60%.  Mr. Brown also failed to live up to his stated target of delivering "much more" than 100% growth in the mass notification market for 2015.  Rather than hold Mr. Brown accountable for LRAD's poor performance, the Board rewarded him with a grant of 250,000 options in December 2015 at $1.86.  We question how this lack of accountability benefits LRAD shareholders.  
It appears that one of the lone bright spots at LRAD is the efforts and hard work of one of our recommended directors, General John G. Coburn, who has effectively utilized his vast experience and network around the globe to expand LRAD's international footprint.  Of note, General Coburn's recent labors led to a modification of LRAD's existing contract with the United States Navy that paved the way for the United States Army to purchase the Company's acoustic hailing devices.
We also have serious concerns with the significant selling of LRAD shares by certain insiders, including Mr. Brown. It seems clear to us, and we believe to many others as well, that the current management team has failed to maximize the potential of LRAD's directional and omnidirectional product lines and that it is time to hold management accountable for its poor performance.  
As you know, on June 22, 2015, we delivered a letter to the Board describing the reasons for converting our passive Schedule 13G filing back to a Schedule 13D.  In the June 22 Letter, we set forth our serious concerns with the Board's failure to effectively manage the Company's capital resources, including the excess cash on the balance sheet and the lack of share repurchases under the then-existing buyback plan, as well as LRAD's apparent failure to capitalize on available sales opportunities in emergency or general campus notifications and emergency warnings for natural disasters.  The letter also noted our serious concerns that LRAD insiders had recently engaged in sales of shares immediately upon exercise of options, which sent the wrong message to shareholders. 
Regrettably, the Company's operational performance has not improved since our June 22 Letter.  We believe management has continued to poorly oversee the Company's capital resources and miss opportunities for growth during a period where the mass notification market is forecast to grow to almost $9 billion by 2020. The CEO and CFO have unabashedly continued to engage in insider sales. In 2015, LRAD's share price declined over 26% while the Russell Microcap Growth Index only lost 6%.  All told, we believe the market has lost confidence in management's ability to govern the Company.  
In order to drive the level of change that we believe is required at LRAD, we have determined to provide shareholders with alternative nominees to elect at LRAD's 2016 annual meeting of shareholders (the "2016 Annual Meeting").  To that end, we have delivered to you today a formal notice of our nomination of two highly-qualified director candidates – Scott Anchin and Dan McCollum – for election to the Board at the 2016 Annual Meeting.  We believe that additional shareholder representation on the Board alongside General Coburn, Richard H. Osgood and Dennis J. Wend will help ensure that shareholders' best interests are appropriately represented.
We Believe Management Has Failed to Properly Manage the Company's Capital Resources
According to its most recent public filings, the Company's total revenue is down 31% year-over-year, with income from operations down over 60%. The Board may try to divert attention from its poor performance with the announcement of a quarterly dividend of $.01 or a "new" $4 million share buyback beginning January 1, 2016.  Remember, the Company's buyback programs have often delivered only a fraction of what has been authorized. 
We view LRAD's declaration of a quarterly dividend and increased buyback program as another attempt to distract shareholders from the Company's poor performance. No dividend or share buyback can hide the fact that LRAD's revenues and gross profit for fiscal 2015 decreased substantially despite award-winning products.
We Believe the Company Continues to Miss Opportunities Despite Exceptional, Best-In-Class Products
Another cause for concern is the Company's failure to take advantage of the opportunities within its growing industry. In the second quarter of 2015, Mr. Brown stated during the earnings call that the Company hoped to meet continued demand in the Middle East: "as I've indicated we've been on a major program in the Middle East we are still awaiting to final outcome ... We were still chasing this opportunity… We're seeing continued demand for LRAD … in the Middle East". Unfortunately for the Company, Mr. Brown lost the mass notification order to a competitor even though Mr. Brown stated in the third quarter earnings call that the Company had "the best product and price." Mr. Brown's eventual claim that he was not prepared to conduct business in a manner that would win the contract only begs the question as to why he was so publicly focused on this business in his outreach to shareholders. 
We believe that there is an immense opportunity for LRAD to capitalize on the rapidly growing mass notification market and dramatically grow its revenues. It is unacceptable that the Company has not found a way to take advantage of available sales opportunities in emergency or general campus notifications, emergency warnings for natural disasters or countless other domestic and international opportunities.  Mr. Brown has shown time and time again his inability to exploit clear opportunities, as further evidenced by his latest re-hire of the Company's previously dismissed public relations spokesman Robert Putnam as Director of Marketing with a six-figure salary.  If history serves as any guide, we do not have confidence in management's ability to take advantage of LRAD's industry-leading technology to grow the Company and maximize shareholder value.  
Continued Concerns with Insider Sales by Senior Management
According to the Company's insider filings, during fiscal 2015 both Mr. Brown and Ms. McDermott have engaged in significant selling of LRAD shares. Based on public filings, the CEO and CFO have a well-documented history of exercising options and selling their shares. This stands in stark contrast to the share buyback program, in which the sale of insider shares are often higher than the prices at which the Company has offered to repurchase its own shares from LRAD shareholders. Clearly, the actions by the CEO and CFO are in contrast to what the Company is attempting to accomplish through the share buyback program. It should not be surprising that a senior management team that only has a nominal stake in the Company would act in in a manner that is drastically misaligned with the best interests of the Company and its shareholders.  
We find it outrageous that the Company repurchased only a fraction of the shares authorized under its previous buyback program at an average price above $2.00, and then issued 250,000 options to the CEO and 100,000 options to the CFO in December 2015 at $1.86 per share. The CEO's insider filings make clear that that prior to the new issuance, Mr. Brown held 100,000 options that expired December 6, 2015 at an exercise price of $2.63 and that despite the poor performance of the Company in fiscal 2015, the CEO was rewarded with more options at a significantly lower exercise price. 
The  dismal  operating  performance  under  Mr. Brown's  leadership,  the  questionable trading by insiders,  and  what we view as a complete  lack  of accountability all  solidify  our  view  that  material  change  in  executive  leadership,  board composition, and corporate strategy are required at LRAD.  We are deeply troubled by management's history of poor execution and the Board's failure to hold management accountable for its less than admirable track record.  We remain open-minded about potential solutions and are willing to engage in discussions towards a mutual resolution.  However, we are steadfast in our belief that increased shareholder representation on the Board will be required to ensure improved performance, better management accountability, and that the best interests of LRAD shareholders are represented in the boardroom.

LRAD® Corporation Announces Settlement Agreement with Iroquois Master Fund Ltd. and Schedules Annual Meeting of Stockholders
SAN DIEGO, CA – March 14, 2016 – LRAD Corporation (NASDAQ: LRAD), the world’s leading provider of acoustic hailing devices and  advanced mass notification systems, today announced it has reached an agreement with Iroquois Master Fund Ltd. and certain of its affiliates (collectively “Iroquois”), with regard to the 2016 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. Iroquois had previously nominated two new independent nominees to LRAD’s Board of Directors (the “Board”). In the Investors Agreement, it was agreed that Iroquois’ two nominees, Scott L. Anchin and Daniel H. McCollum, will be appointed to the Board immediately and will be nominated for election at the 2016 Annual Meeting. As part of the agreement, Iroquois will vote all of its shares in favor of the 2016 nominees at the Annual Meeting.
“We believe this agreement is in the best interests of the Company and our stockholders,” stated General John G. Coburn, Chairman of the Company’s Board of Directors. “We look forward to working together with our new Board members to increase long term stockholder value.”
“We are pleased to have worked constructively with LRAD and commend LRAD’s Board for its thoughtful engagement over the past couple of months,” stated Josh Silverman, co-founder and managing member of Iroquois Capital Management, LLC. “We are excited that we have been able to attract two highly qualified directors of Scott and Dan’s caliber to a company of LRAD’s size. It is clear LRAD has excellent prospects and we believe that this newly composed Board will help maximize the Company’s potential and enhance stockholder value.”
Scott L. Anchin is a restructuring professional with more than 19 years of leadership experience spanning a variety of industries. Until recently, Mr. Anchin worked for Alvarez & Marsal North America, LLC (“A&M”), a global professional services firm specializing in turnaround and interim management and performance improvement. Mr. Anchin started his career in public accounting with Anchin, Block & Anchin LLP, where he audited financial statements for manufacturing, real estate, retail and consumer products companies. Mr. Anchin has a Bachelor of Science in Accounting from the Wharton School of Business at the University of Pennsylvania and an MBA with a concentration in Management from Columbia Business School. He is also a non-active Certified Public Accountant (CPA).
Daniel H. McCollum is a Managing Director in the Investment Office of Brown University in Providence, RI, a position he has held since 2013. The Investment Office of Brown University is responsible for managing the University’s $3+ billion endowment. From 2008 through 2013, Mr. McCollum was a Managing Director at Narragansett Asset Management, LLC. Mr. McCollum has a B.A. in Economics from the University of California at Berkeley and an M.B.A. from the Columbia Business School.
The Company also announced that Tom Brown, the Company’s President and Chief Executive Officer, is resigning from the Company effective June 30, 2016. The Company’s Board of Directors has initiated a replacement search.
Mr. Brown joined the Company as a member of the Board in March 2006 and became President and Chief Executive Officer in August 2006. Brown guided the development and expansion of the Company’s successful LRAD-X® product line and established the LRAD brand around the world by building U.S. and international distribution networks, resulting in LRAD systems being utilized in over 70 countries and in more than 200 U.S. cities, counties and states. Brown personally brought in the Company’s largest order to date ($17.6 million) and his efforts resulted in the recent modification of the Company’s current U.S. Navy contract that provides a vehicle for the U.S. Army to purchase LRAD systems and accessories under the modified contract.
Mr. Brown increased the Company’s business potential by entering the large and growing mass notification market with a line of advanced life safety systems that have recorded over 70% in annual revenue growth the last two fiscal years. By building a solid financial structure, Brown has grown the Company organically during his tenure, resulting in six consecutive years of profitability and seven consecutive years of positive cash flow.
“Under Tom’s leadership, the Company created the acoustic hailing device market and achieved global recognition of its products and the LRAD brand,” stated General Coburn. “The Board thanks Tom for his years of service and many contributions, including the Company’s good financial health and positioning it for further growth and success.”
The Company also announced that its annual meeting of stockholders has been scheduled for May 17, 2016 at its corporate offices. Stockholders of record as of March 23, 2016 will be eligible to vote for the proposed slate of directors and other proposals for consideration that will be included in the Company’s proxy statement scheduled for filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).
