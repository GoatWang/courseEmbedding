Restatements[edit]
On March 14, 2003, Audiovox said it planned to restate results for the first three quarters of fiscal 2002, following a review of the effect of the FASB's Emerging Issues Task Force regulations on its statements. The restatement would lower revenue by about $462,000 and increase income by $36,000.[4] On April 15, 2003, Audiovox announced to restate results for fiscal years 2000, 2001, and the first three quarters of fiscal 2002.

On March 14, 2003, Audiovox said it planned to restate results for the first three quarters of fiscal 2002, following a review of the effect of the FASB's Emerging Issues Task Force regulations on its statements. The restatement would lower revenue by about $462,000 and increase income by $36,000.[4] On April 15, 2003, Audiovox announced to restate results for fiscal years 2000, 2001, and the first three quarters of fiscal 2002.

VOXX International Corp.: Bullish On Rosen Electronics Acquisition - VOXX International Corp. (NASDAQ:VOXX) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»VOXX International Corp.: Bullish On Rosen Electronics AcquisitionApr.12.17 | About: VOXX International (VOXX) Austin Lee Value, contrarian, tech, long-term horizonNebulux CapitalSummaryRosen complements VOXX International's product portfolio nicely.VOXX is still undervalued.Time will show the company's true value.

 VOXX International Corp. (VOXX) has made another bullish acquisition of Rosen Electronics. Because of the small market cap of VOXX and the lack of proved earnings potential, despite incredibly promising acquisitions, many investors are simply continuing to sleep on the stock. If you missed my previous article on VOXX, check it out here. The big update, according to VOXX, is: "The acquisition of Rosen Electronics complements and expands our current RSE leadership position in the industry, as well as adds to our extensive portfolio of RSE patents. With the announcement of the acquisition we look forward to servicing our current VOXX and newly acquired Rosen customers..." 

 Rosen In-Seat Entertainment Systems VOXX recently won several big automotive contracts that it mentioned should bolster earnings in the coming quarters. The acquisition of Rosen Electronics means VOXX has only strengthened its product line offering within the automotive sector. As VOXX grows its relationships with OEMs and automotive suppliers, new contracts to become a supplier for essential automotive technologies will emerge. This makes sense if you look on the company's website: "Rosen holds a significant intellectual property (patent) portfolio for mobile video products with over 50 issued or pending, Rosen has established a reputation for mobile video product innovation that is second to none."
 VOXX is beginning to strongly remind me of Harman International, which was bought by Samsung (OTC:SSNLF) for $8.0 billion in late 2016. With strong technologies in multimedia, audio, biometrics, and other technologies, VOXX holds a ton of intellectual property that should prove to be of incredibly value in the coming years. Harman stock chart leading up to its buyout 

 (Source: Bloomberg) Advanced cockpit and new multimedia technology are going to be huge markets for automotive in the coming years. However, most of these technologies are often overlooked because of the focus on autonomous driving technologies. Investors should remember that each car that is sold will also need an advanced infotainment system and luxury features. With its suite of patents and technologies that are applicable to this growing sector, VOXX will also begin to grow exponentially. In 2011, the company purchased Klipsch for $160 million. The current market cap of VOXX is $111.92 million, and the company has very little debt relative to the assets it is holding. New technologies and patents will be a huge catalyst for VOXX moving forward. As time goes one, the cost of goods and OE will drop, making VOXX a profit printing machine. Check out the company's balance sheet here. Conclusion I maintain my strong buy rating on VOXX International Corp. I think this investment looks more and more compelling each day. Look for the upcoming earnings report to be a huge wake-up as the health of this conglomerate continues to improve. Valuable acquisitions make this company worth much more in assets alone than its current price.
Disclosure: I am/we are long VOXX. 
I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions. I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha). I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.

VOXX International
























Company Overview



We are a leading global manufacturer and supplier of consumer
			electronic products in the automotive, premium audio, and accessory
			industries. We have developed a broad range of products sold under a
			portfolio of over 30 well-known consumer brands. These known
			consumer brands include Klipsch®, RCA®, Audiovox®,
			Magnet®, Heco®, and Acoustic Research®. Additionally, we
			have an array of products from our automotive Original Equipment
			Manufacturers ("OEM") with brands such as Hirschmann Car
			Communication®, Invision®, and Code-Alarm®. We maintain
			leading market share positions across targeted product categories.
			We supply our products to a diversified customer base that consists
			of automotive OEMs, specialty consumer electronics, and mass
			merchandise retailers, power retailers, 12-volt specialists, and
			other commercial entities.
We have grown organically and through strategic acquisitions.
			Both methods have enabled us to expand our product offering,
			diversify our markets, expand geographies, and to improve our
			financial performance. Since 2002 we have completed twelve
			acquisitions that have allowed us to enter new markets. The
			significant acquisitions are Holding GmbH
			and its worldwide subsidiaries (now VOXX Hirschmann, which is part
			of the Automotive segment), and Klipsch Group Inc. and its worldwide
			subsidiaries (Klipsch, which is part of the Premium Audio segment).
We have a substantial amount of research and development
			resources; that enables us to introduce a robust pipeline of new
			products that are responsive to key market trends. We believe it
			will allow us to increase market shares and margins across each of
			our primary operating segments. Further, with our recent
			acquisitions, we have added manufacturing capabilities to complement
			our outsourced manufacturing strategy. Currently, we manufacture
			approximately 30% of our products across our global facilities. The
			blend of internal and outsourced manufacturing allows us to drive
			innovation, control product quality, and speed time-to-market.
Our company was incorporated in 1987 as successor to a
			business founded in 1960 by John J. Shalam, our Chairman of the
			Board. Effective on December 1, 2011, Audiovox Corporation changed
			to VOXX International Corporation. Today Voxx International
			Corporation conducts business through 19 wholly-owned subsidiaries
			and a 50% non-controlling ownership interest suppliers of
			televisions, other automotive sounds, security, and accessory
			products to specialized markets for specialized vehicles.
Our three reportable operating segments are Automotive, Premium Audio,
			and Consumer Accessories.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

In 2013 Audiovox developed the app for a new accessory device called Shutterball.[3] Cellcom Communications holds the exclusive rights to the device.
Restatements[edit]
On March 14, 2003, Audiovox said it planned to restate results for the first three quarters of fiscal 2002, following a review of the effect of the FASB's Emerging Issues Task Force regulations on its statements. The restatement would lower revenue by about $462,000 and increase income by $36,000.[4] On April 15, 2003, Audiovox announced to restate results for fiscal years 2000, 2001, and the first three quarters of fiscal 2002.

Electronics[edit]
In 2013 Audiovox developed the app for a new accessory device called Shutterball.[3] Cellcom Communications holds the exclusive rights to the device.
Restatements[edit]
On March 14, 2003, Audiovox said it planned to restate results for the first three quarters of fiscal 2002, following a review of the effect of the FASB's Emerging Issues Task Force regulations on its statements. The restatement would lower revenue by about $462,000 and increase income by $36,000.[4] On April 15, 2003, Audiovox announced to restate results for fiscal years 2000, 2001, and the first three quarters of fiscal 2002.

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion

Data Format: N-Triples RDF

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).

VOXX International
























Community



Community — Employee 

VOXX International is dedicated to improving the well-being
			and safety of its employees. We offer free training in First Aid,
			CPR, and AED use to interested employees. We host the National
			Safety Councils' Defensive Driving Course on our premises for the
			convenience of our staff and their families and friends. We are
			environmentally friendly with a structured Environmental Management
			System and are ISO 14001 certified that does everything possible to
			prevent pollution and continue to recycle materials.
		
We provide programs that focus on the health, well-being, and
			safety of our employees. Our Safety Committee, comprised of
			representatives from various departments of the company, conducts
			periodic self-inspections of all areas of the building (to check for
			safety, environmental, and housekeeping issues). Representatives
			meet every other month to review any incident investigations
			(accidents/injuries) and to discuss the merits of employee
			suggestions that have been submitted. Employee suggestions that get
			implemented are given a nominal monetary award and are entered in an
			annual $500 drawing for "Suggestion Box Winner of the Year."
Our wellness philosophy is to encourage our employees to
			improve their health through wellness programs. Our wellness
			programs vary and have included Healthy Lunch Club programs, Lunch
			and Learns, 'Stop Smoking Sessions', 'Stress in the Workplace'
			sessions, and Weight Watcher's at work. The company arranges annual
			flu vaccines right on the premises (for a nominal fee) and an annual
			Health Fair with biometric screenings.
Community
			— Charity

VOXX International and its subsidiaries support a wide
			variety of charities nationwide, many in concert with our major
			customers. We have chosen several charities that are the
			beneficiaries of our major fundraising efforts, and encourage our
			employees to support local causes. The company will match employee
			donations to our leading causes. On the local level at our NY
			offices, we participate in Long Island Cares Food Drives and the
			American Cancer Society's Daffodil Days. We support the coalition
			against domestic violence, and host blood drives at work several
			times a year. To help employees who actively participate in a wide
			variety of personally sanctioned charities, we have run Jeans Day
			Fundraisers with raffles, where all the funds raised go to the
			employee's particular charity. Finally, at our NY office, each year
			we run an Annual Holiday Toy and Gift Drive with the proceeds that
			go to three local charities.
		
Our Major Charities:

 The American Heart Association is the
			nation's oldest, largest voluntary organization devoted to fighting
			cardiovascular diseases and stroke. Founded by six cardiologists in
			1924, the group now includes more than 22.5 million volunteers and
			supporters working tirelessly to eliminate these diseases. They fund
			innovative research, fight for stronger public health policies, and
			provide lifesaving tools and information to save and improve lives.
			Their Mission is: Building healthier lives, free of cardiovascular
			diseases and stroke. That mission drives everything they do. We
			support their Annual Go Red for Women Day luncheon on Long Island,
			which is one of the biggest in the country. Two of our company
			executives sit on the committee and manage various aspects of the
			luncheon. This year we will sponsor the VOXX Kid's Zone at the Long
			Island Heart Walk. Over 100 VOXX employees will attend the event
			Manning Kid Zone activity tents that range from face painting and
			tattoos to sand art and even a dunk tank. Our AHA support exceeds
			$35,000 annually.
		

Make A Wish. Our Klipsch subsidiary has been an active
			supporter and sponsor of Make A Wish since 2009, helping grant
			wishes to children with serious health conditions. As a corporate
			sponsor of the Wish Gala and Walk for Wishes events, Klipsch has
			contributed to making wishes come true by donating time, money, and
			effort as employees have designed and constructed two game rooms for
			Wish Kids. Donations total over $100,000 through programs such as
			jeans Friday, tee-shirt sales, bike rides, recycling programs, and
			employee auctions to name a few.
		

The Red Cross responds to approximately 70,000
			disasters in the United States every year, ranging from home fires
			that affect a single family to hurricanes that affect tens of
			thousands, to earthquakes that impact millions. During these events,
			the Red Cross provides shelter, food; health and mental health
			services to help families and entire communities get back on their
			feet. Although the Red Cross is not a government agency, it is an
			essential part of the response when disaster strikes. Additionally,
			the Red Cross helps military members, veterans, and their families
			prepare for, cope with, and respond to the challenges of military
			service. Emergency communications, training, support to wounded
			warriors and veterans, and access to community resources help an
			average of 150,000 military families and veterans annually. They run
			blood drives to help the nation's blood supply, teach training
			courses in first aid and CPR, and can be an international source of
			support in international disasters. We will match any employee
			donations to the Red Cross and in times of major disasters make
			significant corporate donations to this charity.
		

Disabled American Veterans (DAV) is the most
			long-lasting veteran's advocacy and assistance group in this
			country. They have never wavered in their core mission to fulfill
			our nation's promises to the men and women who served. They stand up
			for those veterans who risked it all when they stood up for us, our
			country, and our ideals. They are dedicated to a single purpose:
			empowering veterans to lead high-quality lives with respect and
			dignity. They accomplish their goals by ensuring that veterans and
			their families can access the full range of benefits available to
			them; fighting for the interests of America's injured heroes on
			Capitol Hill, and educating the public about the great sacrifices
			and needs of veterans transitioning back to civilian life. Our work
			with the DAV goes beyond donating. We match contributions of our
			employees to this group as well as sponsoring local events for the
			charity. We have included a veteran as a special guest at our annual
			parties as a way to properly thank a local vet.
