Article excerpt

  A survey of electronics companies shows a once-great industrial innovator has fallen behind    However, its problems can be solved by management actions    Five strategies for change    It's not news to anyone that some of Germany's industrial companies are having problems these days. Burdened with excessive costs at home, they are steadily losing share in the global marketplace. But it is not too late for a turnaround. A good number of leading companies are restructuring to achieve a competitive cost base from which they are beginning to expand aggressively in Europe or even worldwide.    Cost-cutting alone will not be enough, however. If German companies want to recapture their lost share of world sales, they must also find new sources of revenue. Geographic expansion will help, but innovation is equally important - especially if the changes needed throughout industry are to be carried out in a socially responsible way. By 2000, for example, restructuring of European telecommunications is likely to have eliminated as many as 75 percent of the 200,000 jobs that existed in the industry in 1990. Without new, innovative businesses, employment in many sectors has nowhere to go but down.    Besides losing its well-trained workforce, a company that neglects new product development is likely also to lose its competitiveness. One leading German electronics manufacturer, for example, drew about 70 percent of its revenues in the late 1970s from products that were clearly superior to those of its competitors. Five years later that share had fallen to 35 percent; 10 years later the company had not a single superior product. Indeed, as much as 30 percent of its revenue came from products that were inferior to those of competitors.    Innovation is no easy business. The development and introduction of new products usually require tremendous investment in R&D and long lead times. Paybacks are still further down the road. And because the innovation cycle is shortening, products are quickly outdated. The mechanical typewriter, for example, had a life cycle of 35 years. Its electric successor lasted 20 years, and the PC word-processing software of today is upgraded almost every six months.    By the time most companies have a new technology well in hand, moreover, they usually find the market saturated with products based on similar technology. At this stage, even heavy R&D expenditure will probably yield only marginal improvements in their own product, and R&D productivity will already be on a downward track.(*)    It is at this point that companies have to leap to a new technology S-curve. They must have the courage to innovate before the market becomes saturated, or an innovator with greater R&D productivity attacks the market with a new product in a new technology. Companies such as Hewlett-Packard are adept at taking such leaps, generating 60 to 70 percent of their revenues from products introduced within the previous year.    Such courage has long been rewarded with higher profits. While average US corporate profits fell by almost 3 percent between 1978 and 1983, particularly innovative companies, such as those belonging to the American Business Conference, raised them by about 20 percent.    Innovation gaps    German companies were once renowned as the best, most prolific innovators, setting world standards. Aniline chemical dyes, electro-engines, the first commercial motor car (Benz-Motorwagen), and X-rays were all German inventions, and Germans led the development of television, rockets, jet-engines, and high-speed trains. Those days are long gone. Though many German companies still acknowledge the importance of innovation, few have moved decisively or rapidly enough to improve their recent track records. McKinsey's best-practice survey of 102 electronics companies worldwide - including 45 European companies, most of which were German - confirms this. …
