iMedicor Launches Phase I Product 
      Marketing Program for MuGard




Program’s Initial Phase Includes On-going Product Sampling to Centers 
      of Excellence and Key Opinion Leaders






July 27, 2010 08:58 AM Eastern Daylight Time



NANUET, N.Y.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--iMedicor (OTCBB: VMCI) today announced its launch of Access 
      Pharmaceuticals’ MuGard product through its pharma online marketing 
      portal, ClearLobby, and its direct sales channel, Direct Medical 
      Solutions (DMS). The initial phase of the marketing program includes a 
      targeted MuGard sampling program to select iMedicor users and the DMS’ 
      physician network. As previously announced, iMedicor has been selected 
      by Access Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (OTCBB: ACCP) to support the North 
      American commercial launch efforts of its lead product, MuGard – an 
      FDA-approved, ready-to-use mucoadhesive oral wound rinse for the 
      management of oral mucositis and stomatitis, a debilitating side effect 
      of radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy.
    


      MuGard is now being introduced to Centers of Excellence, Key Opinion 
      Leaders, cancer research centers and selected physicians in the United 
      States. The initial release of MuGard samples is part of a joint project 
      that includes participation from iMedicor’s user base and DMS, a network 
      of direct field representatives with strong relationships to physicians 
      and their practices. The full national launch is expected during the 
      third quarter using iMedicor’s highly targeted Physician Communication 
      System (PCS), and iMedicor’s strategic partnership with Direct Medical 
      Solutions (DMS) and other strategic partners.
    

      “After many months of planning, we look forward to assisting Access 
      Pharma with its introduction of MuGard on a national level,” said Fred 
      Zolla, CEO of iMedicor. He continued, “MuGard represents a potential 
      blockbuster product that could significantly improve the quality of life 
      for patients undergoing certain cancer treatments. iMedicor’s ability to 
      deliver essential information from a trusted source to specific 
      physician audiences will significantly increase Access Pharma’s 
      marketing ROI.”
    

      “Our collective efforts have led to the positive acceptance of the first 
      phase sampling program throughout the DMS network,” commented Marian 
      Bartosiewicz, CEO of DMS. She continued, “We are pleased to be part of 
      the introduction of a product like MuGard that can offer measurable 
      relief to patients undergoing radiation and chemotherapy.”
    

      “Teaming up with iMedicor and DMS is an important strategic step in 
      launching MuGard in North America as it provides us the ability to 
      introduce MuGard more rapidly and cost-effectively than we would expect 
      through traditional distribution channels to doctors,” said Jeffrey 
      Davis, CEO of Access Pharmaceuticals, Inc. He continued, “Along with 
      this initial and on-going sample program, Access will be able to utilize 
      the medical education aspects of the iMedicor system to further inform 
      doctors about oral mucositis and MuGard, and to accelerate commercial 
      uptake in the U.S. market.”
    

      The market for the treatment of oral mucositis, expanding to include all 
      patients undergoing chemotherapy and radiotherapy, is estimated to be in 
      excess of $5 billion worldwide. iMedicor and DMS will share in a portion 
      of the revenue as sales are developed within North America. Updated 
      clinical practice guidelines for the prevention and treatment of 
      mucositis recommend the use of a preventive oral care regimen as part of 
      routine supportive care along with a therapeutic oral care regimen if 
      mucositis develops.

GENTLEMEN:
What is erectile dysfunction?






Erectile dysfunction is when a man has difficulty getting an erection. Or keeping it long enough for sex. It’s also known as ED or impotence. It happens when not enough blood flows to the penis, preventing an erection. It affects about 30 million men in the U.S. Some guys with ED find it difficult to either get or keep an erection every time they try to have sex. For others, ED symptoms can happen just once in a while. Either way, you should know that you’re not alone.
 ABOUT

1.1-50-percent.png




ED is not all in your head. It’s not just a part of aging that you have to accept. It’s a real medical condition, so it should be addressed like one. If you think you have ED symptoms, talk to a doctor.
*Data taken from the Massachusetts Male Aging Study. Of 1,290 respondents, 52% stated that they had some degree of ED.
 



What can cause ED?


ED is often caused by something physical, such as a disease, injury, or side effects from other drugs.
Medical Conditions





      
          Depression    

      
          Diabetes    

      
          Heart disease    

      
          High blood pressure    

      
          High cholesterol    

      
          Obesity    

      
          Prostate cancer treatment    

      
          Spinal cord injury    

 


Although most cases of ED have a physical cause, thoughts that lead to depression, worry, or anxiety can also cause ED.
Even when ED has a physical cause, it can be made worse if it leads to depression and worry.
 

Diabetes is a condition where there is too much sugar, or glucose, in the blood. Over time, high blood sugar levels can damage nerves and blood vessels—like the ones that produce erections. When this occurs, diabetes can lead to ED.
In a study, up to 83% of men with diabetes had some form of ED.
 

Heart disease can clog or narrow the arteries. This can stop blood from flowing to the penis, and may cause ED. Talk to your doctor to make sure your heart is healthy enough for sex.
 

High blood pressure makes the heart work harder. This puts strain on the blood vessels, which then harden and narrow. This can prevent blood from getting to the penis and lead to ED. In a study, more than 65% of men with high blood pressure also had ED.
Additionally, some medications used to treat high blood pressure can lead to ED. Make sure your doctor is aware of all medications you are taking.
 

High cholesterol can clog your arteries. This can slow blood flow to the penis. The result? It can affect the quality of your erections.
In a study, high cholesterol raised men's risk of erectile dysfunction by 80%.
 

Obesity can cause real harm to your health. For example, it's associated with medical conditions that can affect blood flow. And when blood flow is affected, it can cause ED.
 

The prostate is a small gland near your bladder. It's next to the nerves that are necessary for an erection to happen. For men with prostate cancer, surgical removal of the prostate can lead to ED.
 

An injury to the spine can affect many functions in the body. Erectile function is no exception.
Due to nerve damage, some men with spinal cord injuries can't get erections. Others can—but can't keep them hard enough or long enough for sex.
 


Medications
In some men, ED is a side effect of some medications. These medications might include drugs used to treat:
High blood pressure
Heart disease
Depression
 





Can your lifestyle have something to do with it?
 Yes. Some lifestyle and psychological factors can play a role in causing ED, such as smoking, drinking, and stress because they may lead to conditions that affect blood circulation. 
There are things you can do each day to improve your circulation and avoid some of the conditions that can lead to ED:
Find ways to stay more active (mowing the lawn, walking the dog)
Help manage your weight by eating healthy and watching your portion size
Drink less alcohol
Quit smoking. The results can be significant
Look for ways to reduce stress in your daily life
 





GENTLEMEN:
VIAGRA helps guys with ED get and keep an erection.

And it’s been shown to effectively treat ED in guys who have certain other medical conditions. So be sure to tell your doctor about your medical conditions and medications so he can choose the right dose for you.
 
 
 
 















          NEXT:        
Learn how VIAGRA works. 





















 
GENTLEMEN:
How does VIAGRA work?






VIAGRA works for men with erectile dysfunction (ED) by increasing blood flow to the penis so you can get and keep an erection hard enough for sex. Individual results may vary. It’s been proven to help guys with all degrees of ED. VIAGRA usually starts to work within 30–60 minutes. And you only take it when you need it.

1.1-watch-1.png




VIAGRA works only when you are sexually stimulated. You may take it up to 4 hours before sexual activity. So don’t worry. There's no need to rush.
After sex? Your erection should go away. In the rare event of an erection lasting more than 4 hours, seek immediate medical help to avoid long-term injury.
 APPROXIMATELY

1.2-four-fifths.png




†Seventy-two percent, 80%, and 85% of the patients on 25 mg, 50 mg, and 100 mg of VIAGRA, respectively, achieved erections hard enough for sex, compared to 50% on placebo. Also, men taking VIAGRA showed an improvement in their ability to get and keep an erection versus those who took placebo.
 












          NEXT:        
Is VIAGRA right for me? 





















 
GENTLEMEN:
Want to know if it's right for you?






Only your doctor can decide if VIAGRA is right for you. VIAGRA isn't right for everyone. If you have trouble getting or keeping an erection hard enough for sex, VIAGRA may help. 
HOW TO GET A PRESCRIPTION FOR VIAGRA
 
1.3-carousel-2.png




 









            MORE THAN          
23 

million men
 have been prescribed VIAGRA.
 



 








Who should not take VIAGRA?
Do not take VIAGRA if you:
Take medicines called “nitrates” (such as nitroglycerin)
Use street drugs called “poppers” such as amyl nitrate or amyl nitrite, and butyl nitrate
Take medicines called guanylate cyclase stimulators such as Adempas (riociguat)
Are allergic to sildenafil, as contained in VIAGRA and REVATIO, or any of the ingredients in VIAGRA. See the Patient Information for a complete list of ingredients in VIAGRA
 VIAGRA and drug interactions.
Tell your healthcare provider about all the medicines you take, including prescription and over-the-counter medicines, vitamins, and herbal supplements.
VIAGRA may affect the way other medicines work, and other medicines may affect the way VIAGRA works, causing side effects. Especially tell your healthcare provider if you take any of the following:
medicines called nitrates
medicines called guanylate cyclase stimulators such as Adempas (riociguat)
medicines called alpha-blockers such as Hytrin (terazosin HCl), Flomax (tamsulosin HCl), Cardura (doxazosin mesylate), Minipress (prazosin HCl), Uroxatral (alfuzosin HCl), Jalyn (dutasteride and tamsulosin HCl), or Rapaflo (silodosin). Alpha-blockers are sometimes prescribed for prostate problems or high blood pressure. In some patients, the use of VIAGRA with alpha-blockers can lead to a drop in blood pressure or to fainting
medicines called HIV protease inhibitors, such as ritonavir (Norvir), indinavir sulfate (Crixivan), saquinavir (Fortovase or Invirase), or atazanavir sulfate (Reyataz)
some types of oral antifungal medicines, such as ketoconazole (Nizoral) and itraconazole (Sporanox)
some types of antibiotics, such as clarithromycin (Biaxin), telithromycin (Ketek), or erythromycin
other medicines that treat high blood pressure
other medicines or treatments for ED
VIAGRA contains sildenafil, which is the same medicine found in another drug called REVATIO. REVATIO is used to treat a rare disease called pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). VIAGRA should not be used with REVATIO or with other PAH treatments containing sildenafil or any other PDE5 inhibitors (such as Adcirca [tadalafil])

Possible side effects of VIAGRA. 





















 
Wondering about possible side effects?






Safety is important. And it helps to know about possible side effects. 
VIAGRA can cause serious side effects. Rarely reported side effects include: 
an erection that will not go away (priapism). If you have an erection that lasts more than 4 hours, get medical help right away. If it is not treated right away, priapism can permanently damage your penis. 
sudden vision loss in one or both eyes. Sudden vision loss in one or both eyes can be a sign of a serious eye problem called non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION). Stop taking VIAGRA and call your healthcare provider right away if you have sudden vision loss in one or both eyes. 
sudden hearing decrease or hearing loss. Some people may also have ringing in their ears (tinnitus) or dizziness. If you have these symptoms, stop taking VIAGRA and contact a doctor right away.
Other important information:

VIAGRA can help a man get and keep an erection when he becomes sexually stimulated. It’s not right for everyone. Here are some other things you should know:
Do not take VIAGRA if you:

take any medicines called nitrates, often prescribed for chest pain, or guanylate cyclase stimulators like Adempas (riociguat) for pulmonary hypertension. Your blood pressure could drop to an unsafe level.
are allergic to sildenafil, as contained in VIAGRA and REVATIO, or any of the ingredients in VIAGRA. 
Discuss your health with your doctor to ensure that you are healthy enough for sex. If you experience chest pain, dizziness, or nausea during sex, seek immediate medical help.
 The most common side effects of VIAGRA are:
headache
flushing
upset stomach
abnormal vision, such as changes in color vision (such as having a blue color tinge) and blurred vision
stuffy or runny nose
back pain
muscle pain
nausea
dizziness
rash
In addition, heart attack, stroke, irregular heartbeat and death have happened rarely in men taking VIAGRA. Most, but not all, of these men had heart problems before taking VIAGRA. It is not known if VIAGRA caused these problems.
Tell your healthcare provider if you have any side effect that bothers you or does not go away.
These are not all the possible side effects of VIAGRA. For more information, ask your healthcare provider or pharmacist.
 





Talk to your doctor.
Discuss your general health and ED symptoms with your doctor to see if VIAGRA is right for you.
Patients should always ask their doctors for medical advice about adverse events.

GENTLEMEN:
What is erectile dysfunction?






Erectile dysfunction is when a man has difficulty getting an erection. Or keeping it long enough for sex. It’s also known as ED or impotence. It happens when not enough blood flows to the penis, preventing an erection. It affects about 30 million men in the U.S. Some guys with ED find it difficult to either get or keep an erection every time they try to have sex. For others, ED symptoms can happen just once in a while. Either way, you should know that you’re not alone.
 ABOUT

1.1-50-percent.png




ED is not all in your head. It’s not just a part of aging that you have to accept. It’s a real medical condition, so it should be addressed like one. If you think you have ED symptoms, talk to a doctor.
*Data taken from the Massachusetts Male Aging Study. Of 1,290 respondents, 52% stated that they had some degree of ED.
 



What can cause ED?


ED is often caused by something physical, such as a disease, injury, or side effects from other drugs.
Medical Conditions





      
          Depression    

      
          Diabetes    

      
          Heart disease    

      
          High blood pressure    

      
          High cholesterol    

      
          Obesity    

      
          Prostate cancer treatment    

      
          Spinal cord injury    

 


Although most cases of ED have a physical cause, thoughts that lead to depression, worry, or anxiety can also cause ED.
Even when ED has a physical cause, it can be made worse if it leads to depression and worry.
 

Diabetes is a condition where there is too much sugar, or glucose, in the blood. Over time, high blood sugar levels can damage nerves and blood vessels—like the ones that produce erections. When this occurs, diabetes can lead to ED.
In a study, up to 83% of men with diabetes had some form of ED.
 

Heart disease can clog or narrow the arteries. This can stop blood from flowing to the penis, and may cause ED. Talk to your doctor to make sure your heart is healthy enough for sex.
 

High blood pressure makes the heart work harder. This puts strain on the blood vessels, which then harden and narrow. This can prevent blood from getting to the penis and lead to ED. In a study, more than 65% of men with high blood pressure also had ED.
Additionally, some medications used to treat high blood pressure can lead to ED. Make sure your doctor is aware of all medications you are taking.
 

High cholesterol can clog your arteries. This can slow blood flow to the penis. The result? It can affect the quality of your erections.
In a study, high cholesterol raised men's risk of erectile dysfunction by 80%.
 

Obesity can cause real harm to your health. For example, it's associated with medical conditions that can affect blood flow. And when blood flow is affected, it can cause ED.
 

The prostate is a small gland near your bladder. It's next to the nerves that are necessary for an erection to happen. For men with prostate cancer, surgical removal of the prostate can lead to ED.
 

An injury to the spine can affect many functions in the body. Erectile function is no exception.
Due to nerve damage, some men with spinal cord injuries can't get erections. Others can—but can't keep them hard enough or long enough for sex.
 


Medications
In some men, ED is a side effect of some medications. These medications might include drugs used to treat:
High blood pressure
Heart disease
Depression
 





Can your lifestyle have something to do with it?
 Yes. Some lifestyle and psychological factors can play a role in causing ED, such as smoking, drinking, and stress because they may lead to conditions that affect blood circulation. 
There are things you can do each day to improve your circulation and avoid some of the conditions that can lead to ED:
Find ways to stay more active (mowing the lawn, walking the dog)
Help manage your weight by eating healthy and watching your portion size
Drink less alcohol
Quit smoking. The results can be significant
Look for ways to reduce stress in your daily life
 





GENTLEMEN:
VIAGRA helps guys with ED get and keep an erection.

And it’s been shown to effectively treat ED in guys who have certain other medical conditions. So be sure to tell your doctor about your medical conditions and medications so he can choose the right dose for you.
 
 
 
 















          NEXT:        
Learn how VIAGRA works. 





















 
GENTLEMEN:
How does VIAGRA work?






VIAGRA works for men with erectile dysfunction (ED) by increasing blood flow to the penis so you can get and keep an erection hard enough for sex. Individual results may vary. It’s been proven to help guys with all degrees of ED. VIAGRA usually starts to work within 30–60 minutes. And you only take it when you need it.

1.1-watch-1.png




VIAGRA works only when you are sexually stimulated. You may take it up to 4 hours before sexual activity. So don’t worry. There's no need to rush.
After sex? Your erection should go away. In the rare event of an erection lasting more than 4 hours, seek immediate medical help to avoid long-term injury.
 APPROXIMATELY

1.2-four-fifths.png




†Seventy-two percent, 80%, and 85% of the patients on 25 mg, 50 mg, and 100 mg of VIAGRA, respectively, achieved erections hard enough for sex, compared to 50% on placebo. Also, men taking VIAGRA showed an improvement in their ability to get and keep an erection versus those who took placebo.
 












          NEXT:        
Is VIAGRA right for me? 





















 
GENTLEMEN:
Want to know if it's right for you?






Only your doctor can decide if VIAGRA is right for you. VIAGRA isn't right for everyone. If you have trouble getting or keeping an erection hard enough for sex, VIAGRA may help.

Alpha-blockers are sometimes prescribed for prostate problems or high blood pressure. In some patients, the use of VIAGRA with alpha-blockers can lead to a drop in blood pressure or to fainting
medicines called HIV protease inhibitors, such as ritonavir (Norvir), indinavir sulfate (Crixivan), saquinavir (Fortovase or Invirase), or atazanavir sulfate (Reyataz)

Possible side effects of VIAGRA. 





















 
Wondering about possible side effects?






Safety is important. And it helps to know about possible side effects. 
VIAGRA can cause serious side effects. Rarely reported side effects include: 
an erection that will not go away (priapism). If you have an erection that lasts more than 4 hours, get medical help right away. If it is not treated right away, priapism can permanently damage your penis. 
sudden vision loss in one or both eyes. Sudden vision loss in one or both eyes can be a sign of a serious eye problem called non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION). Stop taking VIAGRA and call your healthcare provider right away if you have sudden vision loss in one or both eyes. 
sudden hearing decrease or hearing loss. Some people may also have ringing in their ears (tinnitus) or dizziness. If you have these symptoms, stop taking VIAGRA and contact a doctor right away.
Other important information:

VIAGRA can help a man get and keep an erection when he becomes sexually stimulated. It’s not right for everyone. Here are some other things you should know:
Do not take VIAGRA if you:

take any medicines called nitrates, often prescribed for chest pain, or guanylate cyclase stimulators like Adempas (riociguat) for pulmonary hypertension. Your blood pressure could drop to an unsafe level.
are allergic to sildenafil, as contained in VIAGRA and REVATIO, or any of the ingredients in VIAGRA. 
Discuss your health with your doctor to ensure that you are healthy enough for sex. If you experience chest pain, dizziness, or nausea during sex, seek immediate medical help.
 The most common side effects of VIAGRA are:
headache
flushing
upset stomach
abnormal vision, such as changes in color vision (such as having a blue color tinge) and blurred vision
stuffy or runny nose
back pain
muscle pain
nausea
dizziness
rash
In addition, heart attack, stroke, irregular heartbeat and death have happened rarely in men taking VIAGRA. Most, but not all, of these men had heart problems before taking VIAGRA. It is not known if VIAGRA caused these problems.
Tell your healthcare provider if you have any side effect that bothers you or does not go away.
These are not all the possible side effects of VIAGRA. For more information, ask your healthcare provider or pharmacist.
 





Talk to your doctor.
Discuss your general health and ED symptoms with your doctor to see if VIAGRA is right for you.

You can expect that once you bring up the topic of ED, your doctor can take it from there. So here are some ways to break the ice when he asks how everything’s going: 
1. "I have trouble sometimes in bed. Could it be ED?"
2. "I think I might have ED. What can I do about it?"
3. "Could VIAGRA work for me?" 
Help make the most of your VIAGRA Talk.
By asking questions about VIAGRA and ED, you can help your doctor get the information he needs to find out if you have ED and to decide if VIAGRA is right for you.

Watch out for VIAGRA offers with “no prescription.”  





















 
Don't be fooled by counterfeit VIAGRA.






Counterfeits aren’t just a cheap knock-off of a proven product; they’re illegal, potentially harmful fakes. It’s hard to tell where or how they were made—or even what’s inside them.
 









WATCH:
A counterfeit epidemic
 










VIAGRA is one of the most counterfeited drugs in the world. 
In March 2011, Pfizer Global Security studied the search results for the term "buy VIAGRA" to see how many online pharmacies were selling counterfeit VIAGRA. 
The study was conducted using the top 2 search engines over a 5-day period. During this time, 22 unique sites consistently appeared among the top search results claiming to sell VIAGRA manufactured by Pfizer. Pfizer Global Security then ordered VIAGRA from these sites and tested the chemical composition of the pills.

Learn how to safely buy online.
Make sure that when you buy VIAGRA online, you get real VIAGRA. Many of the sites that claim to sell VIAGRA online are actually selling potentiallydangerous counterfeits.


3.2-watch-online-scams.jpg





 Follow these steps: 
1 Make sure the website requires a valid prescription. It’s illegal to sell VIAGRA without a prescription from a qualified healthcare professional.
2 Make sure you see a U.S. address and phone number. This can help you make sure the website is not selling unregulated medication from overseas.
3 Check if they claim to sell “generic VIAGRA” for ED. The FDA has never approved the so-called “generic VIAGRA” for ED you see for sale online. It could be counterfeit and may cause you harm.
4 VIAGRA only comes in 3 doses. 25 mg, 50 mg, and 100 mg. VIAGRA is a tablet. Any other form, like “fast-dissolving,” “extra-strength,” “soft-tab,” or “VIAGRA for Women” is not FDA-approved.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
