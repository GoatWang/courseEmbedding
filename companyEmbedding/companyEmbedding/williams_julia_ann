Academics

Known for our commitment to providing an education that emphasizes not just intellectual growth, but also ethical development, a degree from Duquesne prepares you to make solid contributions in your field and in your community. A Duquesne education helps you develop job skills, learn to think critically and come to better understand yourself and the world around you.
Build a Solid Foundation
Every undergraduate student in every school of study here at Duquesne takes a series of courses that emphasize intellectual and moral development through the study of the liberal arts. In addition to building skills for later success, this core curriculum allows you to study a wide variety of subjects and graduate with the richest possible academic experience.
Learn From the Best
While studying at Duquesne, you’ll enjoy a low (14:1) student-to-faculty ratio, and in small classes, you get the personal attention needed to achieve your best. Most importantly, our faculty exemplify the ideal of the teacher-scholar. This means your professors are committed to providing an exceptional learning experience. They are top-notch teachers, but they also value and participate in scholarship and research, making important contributions to their fields.
In fact, many students—both graduate and undergraduate—have the chance to assist their professors with research projects that are changing the world around us.

I remember sitting in the back of the depot smoking and thinking about walking out of the program. Julie came out and sat down and looked and me and she new exactly what I was thinking. She gave me the best hug ever and told me not to do it because she would chase me down and she don't have time for that she has to feed everybody. Because of her hug and advice that day I chose to stay.

I remember sitting in the back of the depot smoking and thinking about walking out of the program. Julie came out and sat down and looked and me and she new exactly what I was thinking. She gave me the best hug ever and told me not to do it  because she would chase me down and she don't have time for that she has to feed everybody. Because of her hug and advice that day I chose to stay. She even sent Lance to chase down my wife when she walked out. My family would not be where we are today if not for Julie. I miss her but find comfort in her watching over my family.

I will never forget the awesome times we had praising God with the worship team! We would laugh and give each other a hard time when one of us missed a word or forgot a verse but we did it all for the glory of our God and I always felt blessed singing by her side! Julie was so vibrant in all she did but when she sang or cooked her talents truly shined. I know today the heavenly host sounds a whole lot better with her loving voice singing praises to our King. I will always treasure these memories Julie and you will always be in my heart...with much love, sadness for us left behind, and respect for all that you came through and all that you accomplished!
