intuVision Edge Analytics
intuVision's powerful video analytics is available in your smart camera! 
 Our edge analytics are developed to run directly on your camera,eliminating the need for additional hardware.
Available on Axis, Cisco, and Samsung cameras, our edge analytics are easily setup via the camera's web interface and when an alarm condition is detected, various actions are triggered, such as sending email notifications, play audio clips, and sending triggers for 3rd party devices.
Working with the intuVision Event Manager, you can store and manage events, view cameras, create graphs and other visual representations of your events.
Events currently available on the edge:

Activity
Enter/Exit
Object Taken
Speeding Object
Wrong Way
Zone Intrusion

Person detection feature is available for relevant applications.

Edge Analytics Events
Our wide listing of events on the edge are capable of helping you provide security, count customers, and manage your facilities, Events such as line crossing can even be used in factories to count items being manufactured, and more. 
Activity

Our Activity spots activity of legitimate moving objects within a user-drawn "activity zone". ActivitySpy can be used to detect the presence of moving objects in the selected areas whether it is people around a store display, a vehicle in a docking zone, or even illicit dumping into your dumpsters. ActivitySpy reports only the true activity going well beyond commonly used pixel-based motion detection algorithms which are prone to false-alarms. 
Enter/Exit

Enter/Exit application detects objects that enter and/or exit a scene via a selected zone. This is used typically to detect people entering and exiting a store or business for the purpose of people counting, or to detect vehicles entering and exiting a parking area. On select cameras, person classification can be used to ensure you get the alarms you want and none you don't. This is our recommended people counting application. 
Object Taken

Our ObjectTaken detector will secure your fixed assets by detecting a marked object being removed from its location. ObjectTaken can be used to protect valuable assets such as art, wall-monitors, or other stationary valuables.
Speeding Object

The SpeedingObject application detects objects that pass too quickly over two user defined lines. Simply draw your two lines, select the approximate distance between them, and the accepted speed limit in that area, and the application will alarm when it is exceeded. This is useful both in collecting general speed metrics for a specific location and for apprehending specific drivers who routinely exceed the limit.

Wrong Way

WrongWay detects  objects moving in the direction of the user drawn arrow in the camera view. WrongWay can be used the detect vehicles moving against the allowed flow.
Zone Intrusion

Our ZoneIntrusion detects objects entering into a user-drawn zone from outside of the zone. This spy can be used the detect and count people entering or exiting a building or intruding into a marked area. Whether to catch a vehicle leaving the road, or to send someone for customer assistance in a specific area of the store, this edge analytic will enhance your security and your services.
 

Event Manager for intuVision Edge Analytics
Manipulate event and alarm data from the edge - make the most of your edge analytics. intuVision edge analytics provide a great tool for low-cost video event detection, our Event Management tool lets you go further with the analytics from the edge devices.	
Simply create an action rule on your camera and link that to an intuVision input trigger to view events, create compound events, and produce statistical charts and graphs based on event occurrences.


Use the information from your edge analytics to gain valuable insights for your business:

Event Counting: generate event counts to determine customer visits, building occupancy, road travel, etc. 
Event Search and Graphing: Gain a holistic view of customer visits, with event counts and graphs. Easily view a wide variety and export graphs of interest to share findings. 
Compound Events: Increase alert reliability with compound events. Combine two similar events, multiple instances of the same event, or two disparate events into one alarm. 
Floor-Map View: View event alarms within the context of your facility. 


As this is the same review application that comes with intuVision VA, this will allow you to create simple and intuitive split deployments, with simple scenes protected by edge analytics, and more challenging scenes protected by server based processing, with intuVision VA. All events can seamlessly be reviewed in the same application, reducing complexity for your security team.

Edge analytics has gained attention as the Internet of Things (IoT) model of connected devices has become more prevalent. In many organizations, streaming data from manufacturing machines, industrial equipment, pipelines and other remote devices connected to the IoT creates a massive glut of operational data, which can be difficult -- and expensive -- to manage. By running the data through an analytics algorithm as it's created, at the edge of a corporate network, companies can set parameters on what information is worth sending to a cloud or on-premises data store for later use -- and what isn't.
Analyzing data as it's generated can also decrease latency in the decision-making process on connected devices. For example, if sensor data from a manufacturing system points to the likely failure of a specific part, business rules built into the analytics algorithm interpreting the data at the network edge can automatically shut down the machine and send an alert to plant managers so the part can be replaced. That can save time compared with transmitting the data to a central location for processing and analysis, potentially enabling organizations to reduce or avoid unplanned equipment downtime.

Another primary benefit of edge analytics is scalability. Pushing analytics algorithms to sensors and network devices alleviates the processing strain on enterprise data management and analytics systems, even as the number of connected devices being deployed by organizations -- and the amount of data being generated and collected -- increases.

As I read the brief article, I was reminded of early days of SCADA (systems for control and data acquisition) communicating 100s miles by slow 2400 baud modems. For more efficient communications, only differences were sent, but there was also a "background sweep" over all parameters, to refresh them in case of some kind of error. Otherwise, if a bit was lost, but rarely changed, it could remain in the wrong state "forever". Similarly, IMO, one must be careful not to filter too much at the "edge". Consider all error cases, comms also.

Seems to me that Edgeanalytics is a repeat of the 80s/90s client/server model which turned out to be rather expensive and was mostly a means to deal with inadequate bandwidth. Not sure that this reason holds true today.

Document Summary: Edge Analytics in IoT


	Whether the intelligence of IoT systems and subsystems should reside at the cloud or at the edge is one of the most critical questions in the industry. While the historical focus favored cloud platforms for their ability to create highly sophisticated ML-based algorithms, a greater emphasis on edge analytics is on the horizon with advances in device computing capabilities, as well as the enabling connectivity infrastructure, creating a growing number of instances in which it makes more sense to perform analytics closer to the ‘thing’ or activity that is generating or collecting data. These small footprint edge analytics solutions allow companies the freedom and flexibility to differentiate their products and services. They also allow machines and connected equipment to continuously self-regulate, equip engineers and industrial process analysts with an outlet to innovate around inefficiency, and offer a vantage point for procurement professionals to improve the products and services they provide as a result of greater visibility throughout the supply chain.	 	This research analysis examines what ABI Research considers to be the most significant trends and developments related to edge analytics in IoT. The first section includes the conceptual framework supporting the research, as well as a wrap-up of recent activity. The second section consists of updated and refined forecasts on the market’s growth, broken down by application segment, connectivity technology (2G, 3G, 4G, Fixed Line, Satellite), and revenue potential. The final section provides a high-level assessment of a number of relevant vendors to exemplify the different parts of the value chain. As a whole, this analysis should be viewed as an extension of ABI Research’s earlier work around IoT analytics, which evolved considerably since the initiation of coverage in 2013. Recent examples include “Big Data Analytics in IoT and M2M” (AN-2255), “Machine Learning in IoT” (AN-2016), and “Big Data and Machine Learning in Telecom” (AN-2302).

Document Summary: Edge Analytics in IoT


	In ABI Research’s view, one of the most significant trends in the Internet of Things (or the connected world—the Internet of Everything—as a whole) is the shifting balance between edge computing and cloud computing. The early days of the IoT and its conceptual precursor, M2M, have been characterized by the critical role of cloud platforms as application enablers. Intelligent systems have largely relied on the cloud level for their intelligence, and the actual devices of which they consist have been relatively unsophisticated. This old premise is currently being shaken up, as the computing capabilities on the edge level advance faster than those of the cloud level. ABI Research refers to this trend as a paradigm shift—from the connected device paradigm to the intelligent device paradigm. This is, most of all, making the available architecture choices more nuanced and allowing organizations deploying the IoT to enhance their physical assets and processes in novel ways. Edge computing, also known as edge intelligence, is what is driving this shift. 	This study explores edge computing specifically as an analytic proposition: as an approach to analyze data close to its source instead of sending it to a remote server for cloud-level analysis. The report builds on ABI Research’s earlier work on IoT analytics, aiming to provide further insight and conceptual clarity on the role of the network edge in the IoT. Its first section summarizes the three levels of IoT intelligence, and provides commentary on the related drivers and inhibitors. Also, the most noteworthy market trends and observations are listed under this section. The second section, in the meantime, includes quantitative analyses of the "data universe" associated with the IoT: providing forecasts on the data volumes that are (a) generated, (b) captured, and (c) transmitted by connected devices. Finally, the report's third section serves as an overview of a number of technology vendors that are pioneering edge analytics with their products, services, and solutions.

Analytics at the edge

Examples of opportunity in the Internet of Things

By Fiona McNeill, Global Product Marketing Manager, SAS


The data streaming in and out of organizations from electrical and mechanical sensors, RFID tags, smart meters, scanners, mobile communications, live social media, and more results in staggering volumes of information. When all these sources are networked to communicate with each other – without human intervention – the Internet of Things (IoT) is born.
The IoT market is estimated to include nearly 26 billion devices, with a “global economic value-add” of $1.9 trillion by 20201 and nearly $9 trillion in annual sales by 20202. By all accounts, IoT is a new type of industrial revolution.
But to derive useful knowledge from the tide of streaming source data – and participate in this new economy – you must have analytics.
In traditional analysis, data is stored and then analyzed. But with streaming data, analytics must occur in real time, as the data passes through. This allows you to identify and examine patterns of interest as the data is being created. The result is instant insight and immediate action.
So before the data is stored, in the cloud or in any high-performance repository, the event stream is automatically processed. And using analytics to decipher streaming data as close to the device as possible creates a new realm of knowledge for many industries.


Event streams that know more than just existing conditions, and which evaluate future scenarios using advanced analytics, are now within the realm of possibility. 





Let’s look at a few examples.
The Internet of Things in health care
In health care, analyzing IoT data can result in increased uptime for machines that treat cancer, which means that patients are treated when they are scheduled. If a treatment time is missed, it can be up to 40 percent less effective, so reducing service interruptions is critical. By monitoring hundreds of sensors, identifying issues early and proactively correcting them, service personnel armed with the necessary information and parts arrive together.3 Elekta, a Swedish company that provides equipment and clinical management to help treat cancer and brain disorders, has cited a 30 percent reduction in site visits because of such monitoring.4
With rising global populations and corresponding increases in disease and health care costs, the remote patient monitoring market doubled from 2007 to 2011 and is projected to double again by 20165.
And what if these scenarios went beyond monitoring device status or patient conditions – to predicting machine reliability in advance of parts beginning to malfunction? Servicing would then move from being proactive to being optimized across each supplier’s landscape of devices. And foreseeing patient problems before they even experience symptoms could avert adverse events altogether. 
Event streams that know more than just existing conditions, and which evaluate future scenarios using advanced analytics, are now within the realm of possibility. 
How do you apply predictive capabilities to IoT data? High-performance analytics environments are designed to examine complex questions and produce models. These algorithms are then coded into the data streams, along with any data normalization and business rules to detect patterns associated with the defined future scenarios. So in addition to monitoring conditions and thresholds, you can use the data stream to assess likely future events.
The Internet of Things in manufacturing
The automobile industry is stepping up development detection systems for imminent collisions to determine when to take evasive action. Based on radar and other types of remote technologies, driving conditions are monitored to assess – and ultimately avoid – collisions. These collision avoidance systems assess the likelihood of a collision event and automatically prescribe mechanical changes to the vehicle if the driver doesn’t respond – including deceleration and external lighting changes. Potential accident reduction from wide deployment could surpass $100 billion annually6 in savings.
In fact, the “Industrial Internet”7 – which combines physical machinery, networked sensors and software – has extensive use and promise in manufacturing, including production optimization, product development and aftermarket servicing. GE predicts $1 trillion in opportunity per year by improving how assets and resources are used and how operations and maintenance are performed within industrial industries.8

The Internet of Things in energy
A detailed view of energy consumption patterns is needed to understand energy usage, daily spikes and workload dependencies. And beyond just manufacturing – lighting alone takes 19 percent of the world’s electricity.9 Optimized alternate energy sources can have a significant impact on all sectors.
For example, a single blade on a gas turbine can generate 500GB of data per day.10 Wind turbines constantly identify the best angles to catch the wind, and turbine-to-turbine communications allow turbine farms to align and operate as a single, maximized unit.
Historically, the only way to know what was happening with a turbine – even if it was on and working – was to climb 330 feet and see. Remote monitoring provides new eyes on the status of these energy generators. 
What if the same data could be used to forecast? Efficiency in green energy means we can store more energy for use when the wind is low. Predicting when excess energy is available can help determine when to charge batteries, for example, further extending the efficiencies of alternate energy sources.  
Of course, the energy market provides one of the most well-known examples of IoT technology altering the customer landscape. With dynamic smart meter billing, customers have new choices, which lead energy companies to adopt a more customer-centric approach. The utility smart grid transformation is expected to almost double the customer information system market, from $2.5 billion in 2013 to $5.5 billion in 2020.11
The Internet of Things in retail
Customers are also at the center of IoT analytics in retail, where some companies are studying ways to gather and process data from thousands of shoppers as they journey through stores. This “in-store geography” informed by sensor readings and videos considers how long shoppers linger at individual displays, recording what they ultimately buy.
With the goal of optimizing store layout, these data points can also be tied to smart-device Wi-Fi networks. In addition to appropriately targeting shoppers for promotions in-store, retailers can ask customer opinions – using IoT data to initiate an interaction, customizing the shopping experience and enhancing loyalty.
Taking action with IoT data
Event streams monitor patterns of interest. Sensors and devices generate lots of data that describes existing conditions. Analysis of conditions informs what actions are necessary – either immediately as an alert notification, or with pre-planning from predictive and other advanced analysis methods.
Of course, analysis always leads to more questions – directing what additional sensors (and data) can be collected to measure new aspects of the conditions, elements of the event or more detail in the scenario to understand different patterns.
IoT data, by itself, isn’t the value. Just as with traditional data sources, it’s the ability to take the insights and then act on them that provides value. To know what to do in the moment, use analytics at the edge.
