Overview



Home/About/Overview















Altri is a leading Portuguese eucalyptus pulp producer and one of the most efficient European producers. The company is listed on Euronext Lisbon and a member of it's main index the PSI20.
Company profile 

Portuguese Bleached Eucalyptus Kraft Pulp (BEKP) pulp producer 
Incorporated in 2005, following restructuring 
Production capacity increased to 900 thousand tonnes in 2011 
Listed on Euronext Lisbon and a member of the PSI20 












Scale of operation
Altri main focus is the production of eucalyptus pulp, being one of the lowest cost producers in Europe.
Altri’s three pulp mills – Celbi, Caima and Celtejo – will have a technical capacity to produce above 1,000,000 tonnes per year. Breakdown as follow: Celbi - around 700,000 tonnes per year; Celtejo - around 200 tonnes per year; Caima - around 100 tonnes per year.
Celbi and Celtejo produce BEKP. Caima is producing DP.
Currently Altri manages around 84,000 ha of forest in Portugal all certified by the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) and PEFC the main references in forest certification worldwide. The wood self-sufficiency rate stands around 25%.
To optimise forest management Altri acquired a 50% stake in EDP Bioelectrica (a joint venture in equal shares with EDP) to develop a single renewable source of energy: biomass. This company has nowadays 62 MWh in operation.
Apart from the biomass the company also has a strong focus on cogeneration. The pulp mills operated by Altri are entirely self sufficient on power that is produced through the burning of wood components not suitable for pulp production - the black liquor.
Altri’s rapid growth has been fuelled by successful acquisitions (Celtejo in 2005 and Celbi in 2006) and further integration and expansion. The main investment decision metric is Return on Capital Employed.
Our strategy is to maximize the value from our main asset – the forest – and to continue growing the pulp business, adding new incremental capacity through debottlenecking projects and through new value accretive options

As you can see from the example above, spread betting can be very profitable or can bring big losses, given the deposit required is only a fraction of the trade value (20% margin required on IG). In the next section I will go over briefly the ful potential risk of the trade we exampled above in Altri S.G.P.S S.A ALSS.LS on Lisbon Stock Exchange (EUR).




Other useful information about your trade

Risk

As you can see from the example above spread betting can be very profitable or can bring big losses, given that the deposit required (20%) to open a trade is only a fraction of the trade value. Now, let’s do the calculations of the risk reward on the egsample above.
We traded Altri SGPS SA at £20.00 (your stake) a point. The price of ALSS.LS on Lisbon Stock Exchange is 4.37. If we multiply the stake by the price ( 4.37) we get the full value of the asset you are holding(£8,740.00), which could also be the potential loss of the trade, given no stoploss is placed.
£20.00 (your stake) x 4.37 = £8,740.00(max potential risk)
therefore it is important to place your stop loss at the maximum potential loss you are willing to incurr when trading

Reward

The rewards on the other hand can be big, given that the deposit required is only 20% on ALSS.LS .
For egsample, in our trade above we put down a deposit of £1,748.00 (20% of the full value £8,740.00 ) and gained £349.60 . The reward made was 20% on the funds we used in this example. This is the power of leverage and what makes spread betting so attractive. Furthemore, these profits and losses are not taxed.



Reward Spread betting


£349.60 (profit)  /  £1,748.00(deposit)   = 20% (return)




If instead you were buying the asset (Altri SGPS SA (ALSS.LS)) not leveraged on the Lisbon Stock Exchange, your reward would have been 4% (£349.60 / £8,740.00)



Buying the asset non leveraged


£349.60 profit  /  £8,740.00 (cost to buy ALSS.LS ) = 4% return




Slippage

 Slippage is when an order is filled at a price that is different than the requested price. This because trading there was no trading at your desired price and the broker gives you the first available price in the market
Another factor to consider is if you hold your trade in Altri SGPS SA over night, when the Lisbon Stock Exchange is closed( Trading hours are 09:00 AM  05:30 PM(+1 Hours GMT) in Portugal ), and there is majour news that will affect the price in Altri S.G.P.S S.A, you can suffer slippage. Your stoploss or take profit will trade at the first available price when the market opens.

Guaranteed Stop Loss

To avoid slippage IG.group guarantees your stoploss level when you opt to use a guaranteed stoploss. The cost of the stoploss on xxx that is a small premium of 0.30% calculated on the value of your trade. It is a little peice of mind offered by  IG.group, like a little insurance.

Altri SGPS SA is a Portuguese industrial conglomerate headquartered in Porto. The group's main companies operate in wood pulp production, cultivation of forests for the timber and paper industry and co-generation of energy, including energy production from renewable resources. Prior to 2008 the group also operated in the steelworks industry.
Altri's holding company is Altri SGPS, SA., which is listed on the Euronext Lisbon stock exchange. Its major subsidiaries are Celulose do Caima (paper industry) and Celbi (paper industry). Altri's F. Ramada subsidiary, which produced steel and storage systems such as cold rolled steel sheets and strips, machinery, tools and other related products, was spun off on the stock exchange in 2008.[2] Altri was itself born from a spin-out of the industrial assets of the Cofina group in March 2005.[3]
