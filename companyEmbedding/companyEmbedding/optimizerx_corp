Our Story
OptimizeRx® Corporation provides unique physician and consumer platforms and strategies to help patients better afford and adhere with their treatment regimens, while offering pharmaceutical and healthcare companies more effective ways to expand physician and patient awareness, access and adherence to their medications and product support.
Our core product is a novel patient financial support software application. It replaces traditional physical drug samples by automating the process of distributing coupons and vouchers into healthcare providers’ eRx workflow, then automatically delivering them electronically to the pharmacy. Through the OptimizeRx platform, pharmaceutical and biotech manufacturers now have a digital paperless platform to directly offer patients critical cost savings, education and adherence tools right at the point of prescribing.

Analyst Ratings
Consensus Ratings for OptimizeRx Corp. (OTCMKTS:OPRX) (How are Consensus Ratings Calculated?) MarketBeat calculates consensus ratings using the most recent rating from each brokerage that has rated a stock within the last twelve months. Since brokers often use different ratings systems, each rating is normalized to a standardized rating score of 1 (sell), 2 (hold), 3 (buy) or 4 (strong buy). Consensus ratings scores are calculated using the mean average of the number of normalized sell, hold, buy and strong buy ratings. Each stock's consensus rating is derived from its calculated consensus ratings score (0-1.5 = Sell, 1.5-2.5 = Hold, 2.5-3.5 = Buy, >3.5 = Strong Buy). MarketBeat's consensus price targets are a mean average of the most recent available price targets set by each analyst that has set a price target for the stock in the last twelve months.MarketBeat will no longer include ratings and price target data in its consensus calculation if a broker drops coverage and MarketBeat has received a report that coverage was dropped. Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.Ratings Breakdown: No ratings tracked in the last 12 months.Consensus Rating:N/A (Score: NaN)Consensus Price Target: N/A
