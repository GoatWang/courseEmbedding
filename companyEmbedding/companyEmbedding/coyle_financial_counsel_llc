Discover a better way to manage your finances



Everyone knows that managing your financial affairs is more than a number on a balance sheet. Our mission is to truly understand our clients so that all aspects of their finances are aligned with the good life each wants to live. Making the complex simpleTransformingWealth, our proprietary approach, helps you to get your arms around the big picture so you can make informed financial decisions with conviction. TransformingWealth also gives you confidence that, as your life changes, all the pieces will continue to work together. At Coyle Financial Counsel, we offer a complimentary TransformingWealth Preview Meeting. We incorporate mind mapping to engage you personally in ways that elicit valuable participation. Ultimately we develop a TransformingWealth™ Map that is as unique as your situation – to  guide you as you move forward.This meeting will help you to visually integrate the financial and non-financial aspects of your life. You will walk away with a clearer understanding of all the variables that affect your future. How TransformingWealth™ Preview worksInitially, you are greeted in a meeting that includes a large screen monitor populated in the center with your names (the tree trunk, so to speak). Via computer, all pertinent information is placed on lines (“branches”) that are connected and diagrammed according to specific aspects of a person’s life.Such aspects include four main topics that form the main branches:Family mattersLegacy preservationWealth managementRelationship managementAside from general family structure, other topics of discussion include family values, unique family assets and future milestones such as weddings, moves, babies, and retirement – all items with varying needs and timing that require financial resources.As answers are recorded and mapped, the computerized branches become increasingly more insightful, growing and visibly intertwining. Often, people don't think of how life events and their timing, and the various people involved can really affect financial planning (until it is too late) – our process solves that. After the “what-ifs,” then come the more practical matters of a personal spending plan, retirement income assessment, and an investment plan aligned with your objectives.Ultimately, the mind map forms a large, interconnected picture unique to your family. It isolates the variables, identifies the priorities, facilitates ongoing communication and promotes informed decision-making.Seeing is believingWe are so confident TransformingWealth can help you achieve your goals that we make it easy to get started. Sign up for a TransformingWealth Preview Meeting. This complimentary consultation will allow you to experience the power of TransformingWealth and help you to take control of your financial life. Use our contact form or call (800) 480-7913; we will send you a questionnaire and schedule a meeting at one of our three offices (Wheaton, IL, Glenview, IL, or Naples, FL). 
















Visual Financial PlanningPondering challenging tasks can be more difficult, draining, and emotionally time-consuming than actually working to make them happen? Mind mapping and financial planning According to Rob O’Dell (a mind mapping enthusiast), the visual experience of mind mapping Coyle uses as part of our TransformingWealth process creates an “oh, wow” reaction of relief in clients who finally see all the parts and how they fit together into a larger picture that can be accommodated with realistic investments that fit personal choices.
