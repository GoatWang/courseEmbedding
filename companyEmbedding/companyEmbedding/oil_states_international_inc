Oil States International is an American multinational corporation. It focuses on providing services to oil and gas companies. It is a public company listed on the New York Stock Exchange.
History[edit]
The company was founded as an oilfield supply store in Tulsa, Oklahoma in 1937.[3] Five years later, in 1942, it started selling rubber components to oil patch producers in Texas.[3] In the 1950s, it sold rubber products used to support bridges.[3] Later, in the 1970s, it focused on addressing the needs of oil and gas companies in Canada and on the Gulf Coast of the United States.[3] The next decade, in the 1980s, it focused on supplying those companies with pipeline maintenance and repair for their underwater operations at sea.[3] In 1999, it acquired Tubular Services, thus becoming one of the main tubular distributors in the US.[3]
Its IPO was in 2001, when it became a public company on the New York Stock Exchange traded as OIS.[3]
From 2005, it acquired several accommodation inns for employees of oil and gas companies in Canada (Fort McMurray, Northern Alberta, Southern Saskatchewan) and Australia (Gladstone, Queensland, Karratha, Western Australia, Gunnedah Basin in New South Wales).[3] On June 2, 2014, these accommodation services became a spin-off company called Civeo Corporation, also traded on the New York Stock Exchange.[4]

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Data Format: N-Triples RDF

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.




Total triples: 63 million

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
