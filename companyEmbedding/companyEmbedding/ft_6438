      Burford Capital Limited ("Burford" or the “Company”), a leading global
      finance firm focused on law, announces its financial results for the
      half year ended 30 June 2017.
    

Highlights



        Best ever results in Burford’s history: 1H 2017 profit exceeds record
        profit for full year 2016
      

        Income increased by 130% to $175.5 million (H1 2016: $76.2 million),
        driven by a 148% increase in investment income to $161.6 million (H1
        2016: $65.3 million)
      

        151% increase in operating profit to half-year record of $155.0
        million (H1 2016: $61.7 million), and 170% increase in profit after
        tax to $142.7 million (H1 2016: $52.8 million)
      

        Interim dividend of 3.05¢ (H1 2016: 2.67¢) declared, at the rate of
        one third of total 2016 dividend – an increase of 14% over last year’s
        interim dividend. Interim dividend payable on 15 November 2017 with
        record date of 20 October 2017

        Strong demand for Burford’s capital, with record new commitments to
        investments of $488 million (comprising $226 million from our balance
        sheet and $262 million from our investment funds), $289 million of
        which already deployed
      

        Record investment performance underpinned by 11 investments, including
        largest cash generation from a single investment in our history, the
        sale of 25% of our ongoing Petersen investment
      

        Cash generation of $173.7 million from investments on balance sheet,
        exceeding every previous half-year period
      

        Oversubscribed retail bond offering, raising £175 million at a 5%
        coupon, to further support client demand and future growth
      

        Gerchen Keller acquisition and integration successful and
        well-received, first fund starting to generate performance fees.
        Burford’s new investment management business closed largest investment
        fund ever raised in sector, at $500 million, to invest in complex
        strategies
      


Sir Peter Middleton, Chairman of Burford, commented:


      “In just under eight years, Burford has grown from an £80 million
      startup to become the clear industry leader. In six months, we have
      committed almost half a billion dollars to new investments. We look
      forward to continuing to develop our core business while supporting all
      our clients with a broad range of financial solutions.”
    


Christopher Bogart, Chief Executive Officer of Burford, added:


      “Burford has had an exceedingly active first half. Our continued strong
      growth has been driven by rising client demand as well as our ongoing
      investment in broadening our product offering and pioneering new
      markets. As the industry advances, we continue to innovate legal cost
      and risk management techniques while delivering strong investment
      returns for shareholders.”

This charmer is sure to make you feel comfortable from the moment you step inside. The front hall ushers you past secondary bedrooms, a bath, and a laundry room with convenient access to the garage. A large open great room with vaulted ceilings, featuring tons of natural light, offers plenty of space for dining, entertaining, and living spaces. The great room leads to a large covered patio as well. The sizable L-shaped kitchen consists of an eat-at island, contemporary stainless steel appliances (including a side-by-side refrigerator), and loads of available storage with its 36-in. upper cabinets and closet pantry. A private master suite offers backyard views, a walk-in closet, and a gorgeous master bath consisting of an executive-height vanity with dual sinks and a walk-in shower.

                    The City of Vallejo, Ca offers Buyers some of the most attractive values in the San Francisco Bay Area.  The City also boasts the Vallejo Heritage District which was the of the first registered districts West of the Mississippi.  Most of these homes are Victorian type structures built between 1860 and 1890.  The homes are not open to the public, visitors can do a self-guided walking or driving tour of the area.

Until its closure in 1996 the Mare Island Naval Base was in operation and many ships were built or repaired including atomic submarines.  It was the oldest US Naval Base on the Pacific and the second largest in the US.

Vallejo also has a ferry terminal and has 4 big water Jet catamarans that operate every day from the terminal to the San Francisco Ferry Building as well as angel Island, and pier 39.  These vessels are licensed to carry up to 325 people per run.  They are a commuters dream, I rode them for 12 years.  If you are in the Buyers market take a look at the City.

Evaluating the potential for watershed restoration to reduce nutrient loading to Upper Klamath Lake, OregonProduct Type: Open-file ReportYear: 2007Author(s): McCormick, P., and S.G. CampbellSuggested Citation: McCormick, P., and S.G. Campbell. 2007. Evaluating the potential for watershed restoration to reduce nutrient loading to Upper Klamath Lake, Oregon. Open-file Report 2007-1168. U.S. Geological Survey. 31 p. A literature review of best management practices to reduce nutrient loading was performed to provide information for resource managers in the Klamath Basin, Oregon. Although BMPs have already been implemented in the watershed, some sense of their effectiveness in reducing phosphorus loading and their cost for installation and maintenance is still lacking. This report discusses both causes of nutrient loading and a wide-variety of BMPs used to treat or reduce causal factors. We specifically focused on cattle grazing as the principal land-use and causal factor for nutrient loading in the Klamath Basin above Upper Klamath Lake, Oregon. Several BMP types, including stream corridor fencing, riparian buffer strips and constructed wetlands, seem to have potential for reducing phosphorus loading that may result from cattle grazing. However, no single BMP is likely to be the most effective in all locations or situations.
