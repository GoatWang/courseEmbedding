Statement of SEC Chairman Mary L. Schapiro on Money Market Fund Reform
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
          2012-166
        

          Washington, D.C.,           Aug. 22, 2012—
        
 Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Mary Schapiro today made the following statement:

Three Commissioners, constituting a majority of the Commission, have informed me that they will not support a staff proposal to reform the structure of money market funds.  The proposed structural reforms were intended to reduce their susceptibility to runs, protect retail investors and lessen the need for future taxpayer bailouts.
I -- together with many other regulators and commentators from both political parties and various political philosophies -- consider the structural reform of money markets one of the pieces of unfinished business from the financial crisis.
While as Commissioners, we each have our own views about the need to bolster money market funds, a proposal would have given the public the chance to weigh in with their views as well.   However, because three Commissioners have now stated that they will not support the proposal and that it therefore cannot be published for public comment, there is no longer a need to formally call the matter to a vote at a public Commission meeting.  Some Commissioners have instead suggested a concept release.  We have been engaging for two and a half years on structural reform of money market funds.  A concept release at this point does not advance the discussion.  The public needs concrete proposals to react to.
The declaration by the three Commissioners that they will not vote to propose reform now provides the needed clarity for other policymakers as they consider ways to address the systemic risks posed by money market funds.   I urge them to act with the same determination that the staff of the SEC has displayed over the past two years.
As we consider money market funds' susceptibility to runs, we must remember the lessons of the financial crisis and the history of money market funds.  And, we must be cognizant that the tools that were used to stop the run on money market funds in 2008 no longer exist.  That is, there is no "back-up plan" in place if we experience another run on money market funds because money market funds effectively are operating without a net. 
One of the most critical lessons from the financial crisis is that, when regulators identify a potential systemic risk - or an industry or institution that potentially could require a taxpayer bailout - we must speak up.  It is our duty to foster a public debate and to pursue appropriate reforms.  I believe that is why financial regulators both past and present, both Democrats and Republicans, have spoken out in favor of structural reform of money market funds.  I also believe that is why independent observers, such as academics and the financial press -- from a variety of philosophical ideologies -- have supported structural reform of money market funds, as well.
The issue is too important to investors, to our economy and to taxpayers to put our head in the sand and wish it away.  Money market funds' susceptibility to runs needs to be addressed.  Other policymakers now have clarity that the SEC will not act to issue a money market fund reform proposal and can take this into account in deciding what steps should be taken to address this issue.
History and Background
It's been a long and deliberative process that led us to the point we are at today.  
Money market funds, as we know them, actually are not permitted under existing federal securities statutes.  Instead, they exist as a result of a special exemption granted by the SEC three decades ago.   This exemptive rule, known as rule 2a-7, allows money market funds to seek to maintain a stable $1.00 net asset value by using penny rounding and amortized cost accounting.  As a result of this exemption, these funds do not have to comply with the mark-to-market valuation standards required for all other mutual funds.  
In exchange, money market funds relying on rule 2a-7 must follow strict limitations on their investments.
Over the years, money market funds fostered a strong sense of stability as they maintained a stable $1.00 NAV.   Before long, retail investors were using them as substitutes for checking accounts -- and institutional investors were using them as vehicles for their cash management.  
Between 1983 and 2008, only one small money market fund fell far enough below the $1.00 NAV that it broke the buck, but because of its size, the impact from that event did not spread to other money market funds or the broader market.  During that period, however, numerous sponsors of money market funds supported the funds' stable $1.00 NAVs by purchasing out troubled securities at above-market values; injecting cash infusions into the funds; and otherwise engaging in capital support of their money market funds.  
Unfortunately, the sense of stability this created led to what I believe to be a false sense of security, masking risks that became all too apparent during the financial crisis.  When the Reserve Primary Fund broke the buck in the fall of 2008, this stability was shattered. 
In a matter of days, panicked investors had redeemed not only massive amounts from the Reserve Fund, but more than $300 billion from prime money market funds across the industry.  The short term credit markets froze.   And, financial institutions and operating companies worldwide were unable to effectively fund their daily operations.  
To stop the growing damage, the Treasury Department stepped in by temporarily guaranteeing investments in money market funds.  This was an unprecedented action that put taxpayers on the hook for the performance of an investment product.  
The temporary federal guarantee was supplemented by Federal Reserve Board liquidity facilities, which also provided unprecedented assistance to money market funds.

In short, every taxpayer in the nation found themselves a partial insurer of a $multi-trillion investment product.

Money Market Funds' Structural Issues
While the events of the 2008 financial crisis dramatically exposed the risks presented by money market funds, it also highlighted that the risks stem from flaws inherent in the structure of money market funds.    In particular, most of the risks resulted from the valuation standards and stable NAV that are permitted to exist by SEC rule, without any capital or asset cushion to back them up.  

First, money market funds have no ability to absorb a loss above a certain size without breaking the buck.  We saw that first hand with the Reserve Primary Fund, where just over 1% of that fund's assets were held in commercial paper of Lehman Brothers.  When Lehman Brothers declared bankruptcy, its commercial paper became worthless, the fund broke the buck, investors began to flee the fund, and other funds began to experience high rates of redemptions as a result.    
Second, investors of money market funds have every incentive to run at the first sign of a problem.  We saw this phenomenon play out in the week of September 15, 2008 when over $300 billion was withdrawn from prime money market funds.  Under the "first-mover advantage," those who redeem first, get out with their full $1.00 invested, even if the fund's assets are worth slightly less.  This leaves all the other investors holding the bag -usually the slower moving retail investors who can lose both value and access to their money.  They lose the value when the fund reaches a mark-to-market NAV of 99-and-a-half cents and breaks the buck.  And they lose access, for an unknown period, since fund boards are now permitted to suspend redemptions and liquidate a fund if it breaks the buck.

This inability to absorb a loss in value of a portfolio security and the incentive to run at the first sign of a problem are the two structural issues we were seeking to address with the proposals under consideration by the Commission.  These are issues that are inherent in the structure of money market funds which came to the fore in the financial crisis, but undoubtedly are  still present.  
The fear of breaking the buck and triggering a run is perhaps one reason why fund managers, in hundreds of instances, have sought some type of relief to bolster their funds' financial condition and prevent the breaking of a buck.   
Several entities - from Moody's to the Federal Reserve to our own staff - have spelled out this fact.  Indeed, based on our staff's tabulation, there have been more than 300 such instances, dating back to the 1980s.  This figure represents those occasions where fund sponsors requested relief or otherwise notified us that they provided sponsor capital support to their funds because of a troubled security holding or a need to address diminished value or extraordinary redemptions in a money market fund.  
As we all know, though, and as was evident in the Reserve Primary Fund case, there is no legal obligation for a fund's sponsor to support its fund, and there is absolutely no certainty that every fund sponsor with a problem in its money market fund will be able to provide capital support to the fund.
Reform Alternatives 
That is why we were considering alternative proposals that would address these two structural issues in different ways.  
The two alternatives:

First, that money market funds float the NAV and use mark-to-market valuation like every other mutual fund.  This would underscore for investors that money market funds are investment products and that any expectation of a guarantee is unwarranted.  In such a scenario, investment losses in money market fund portfolios could be both absorbed and reflected in the price - as would gains for that matter.  Similarly, while the incentive to run may not be reduced entirely, the "cliff" effect of redeeming at $1.00, or getting stuck with a loss and no immediate access to one's assets would no longer exist. 
Second, and alternatively, a tailored capital buffer of less than 1% of fund assets, adjusted to reflect the risk characteristics of the money market fund.  This capital buffer would be used to absorb the day-to-day variations in the value of a money market fund's holdings.  To supplement that capital buffer in times of stress, it would be combined with a minimum balance at risk requirement.  That requirement would enable investors to redeem up to 97% of their assets in the normal course as they do today.  However, it would require a 30-day holdback of the final 3% of a shareholder's investment in a money market fund.  That holdback would take a so-called "first-loss" position and could be used to provide extra capital to a money market fund that suffered losses greater than its capital buffer during that 30-day period.  The result is that remaining investors would not be harmed by a redeeming investor's full withdrawal and the incentive to redeem fully and quickly at the first sign of trouble would be diminished.

I believe these proposals have merit, address the two structural issues identified, and deserved to see the light of day so that we could receive public feedback.  

The Reform Process
Development of these proposals was thorough and considered.  In June 2009, shortly after the financial crisis and my arrival at the Commission, the Commission proposed an important first round of reforms to boost the resilience of money market fund portfolios.  The Commission adopted those reforms in January of 2010.  The reforms shortened maturities, improved credit qualities, and for the first time imposed liquidity requirements for money market funds.  The reforms were based in large part on the March 2009 report of the ICI's Money Market Fund Working Group.  This first round of reforms also imposed new disclosure requirements regarding money market fund portfolios and shadow NAVs.  Those disclosures have been very valuable to both the SEC and to investors as we monitor money market fund portfolios.
But, when the Commission proposed the first stage of money market fund reforms in 2009, it also requested comment on additional structural reforms:  namely whether to mandate a floating NAV and whether to require redemptions in kind.  In other words, the Commission made clear that the first round of reforms in 2010 were a first step and that additional structural reforms were expected to follow as a second step.   In fact, I specifically said as much at the time.
Thereafter, in November 2010, the Commission requested comment on structural reform options discussed in the Money Market Fund Report issued by the President's Working Group -- a precursor to the Financial Stability Oversight Council.  After reviewing those comments, the SEC hosted a May 2011 Roundtable on Money Market Funds and Systemic Risk.  The roundtable included voting members from FSOC or their designee as well as fund industry representatives, investors, academics, foreign regulators and industry observers. 
Following the roundtable, our staff in consultation with staff from the Treasury and the Federal Reserve, met with various fund industry representatives to discuss multiple structural reform options and we received even more ideas worthy of pursuing.  And we continued to collect public comment throughout this long process.
Once the staff narrowed money market reform options, they refined those options, obtained suggestions for additional areas of public comment and prepared a proposal that is shaped and strengthened by economic analysis.  The draft release presented to the Commissioners requests comment on multiple alternative approaches to money market fund reform, including liquidity fees and gates - all with a view of furthering the public debate.

SEC Speech: "The Consumer in the Financial Services Revolution" (Chairman Mary L. Schapiro; December 3, 2009)

Speech by SEC Chairman:
"The Consumer in the Financial Services Revolution"
by
Chairman Mary L. Schapiro
U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission
Consumer Federation of America 21st Annual Financial Services Conference
Washington, D.C.
December 3, 2009
Thank you very much for that kind introduction. I am so pleased to be here today.
The Consumer Federation of America has long been a vigorous watchdog for consumers everywhere. Every time that I step inside a store, open a bank account, buy insurance, or set up a telephone plan — I know that I'm benefiting from the work of the CFA.
And, the same can be said every time any of us invests in a financial product or turns to an investment professional for help. That is why I so greatly appreciate the work of this organization.
Today, we are undergoing a financial services revolution. And, I know that both of our organizations will continue to be on the front lines looking out for individual investors — finding ways to better protect Americans who contribute to a 401(k) plan, open a college investment account or simply buy a single stock, bond or mutual fund.
As we all know, last year's financial turmoil had a real impact on real people. Many older Americans had to put off their retirements. Many families with high school students saw their college investment plans plummet. Many workers came to work to find a pink slip on their desk. And many middle-aged Americans saw their future financial security replaced with uncertainty.
In recent months, the market has improved and the financial forecasters have become more optimistic. But we cannot let down our guard. We cannot presume the weaknesses in our financial regulatory system have been resolved. And, we cannot let our memories be so short as to avoid learning lessons from the mistakes of the past.
There is too much at stake.
For this reason, we must continue our efforts to reform the financial regulatory system — both at the Congressional level and at the agency level.
Both the Administration and Congress have recognized the need for meaningful and effective financial reforms — and have been working hard in recent months on legislation to achieve these goals.
We have certainly made progress, but we still have a ways to go.
On The Legislative Front
We need a regulatory system that is focused on identifying and minimizing systemic risk — one that can eliminate gaps in our regulatory structure, protect investor rights and promote fair competition.
We need a credible resolution regime that permits large institutions to fail without taking the system or taxpayers down with them — a regime that eliminates artificial advantages and incentives that encourage institutions to get so big and complicated in the first place.
We need to bring managers of hedge funds and other private funds under the regulatory umbrella. For too long, these large players have managed to avoid effective oversight.
We need to have a strong fiduciary standard for all securities professionals.
And, finally, we need to bring greater transparency and stability to the over the counter derivatives market — a market that has grown enormously in the past decade.
This is particularly important because derivatives directly affect the regulated securities and futures markets and can infuse significant risk into our financial system. They serve as a less regulated — but economically equivalent — alternative to the markets and products that you and I rely upon.
To address these gaps and regulatory arbitrage dangers, legislation is essential to bring greater transparency and oversight to OTC derivative products and market participants. The existing regulatory chasm cannot be allowed to continue.
I believe Congress has made real progress in this regard. As this process moves forward, however, we must remain ever vigilant against even small exceptions, carve outs and arbitrage opportunities that might create tomorrow's risks.
For example, to prevent bad actors from hiding their trading activities, I also believe we — at the SEC — need the tools to effectively apply the securities laws and police the securities-based derivatives market.
That is why we have been pushing for security-based swaps to be subject to at least all the oversight and transparency that would apply to any other over-the-counter security, such as an OTC option. This would ensure that we have the ability to inspect and examine all relevant market participants — including swap dealers, central counterparties, trading venues, and swap repositories.
We need to have quick access to comprehensive, real-time data on securities-related OTC derivatives — so that fraudsters cannot just use securities-based derivatives to engage in insider trading or market manipulation.
Regulatory Activity
But the need for meaningful regulatory reform does not exist solely at the Congressional level. It is not limited to macro-economic issues. There is much that the SEC can do on its own.
In fact, over the past year, we have already undertaken initiatives to protect client assets at investment advisers, address market structure inequities, enhance corporate governance, strengthen the resiliency of money market funds, and upgrade regulation of credit rating agencies.
Protecting the Individual Investor
All of these initiatives — and many more — will ultimately help individual investors.
And, it is to that constituency I believe the SEC must be most attuned.
After all, broker-dealers and investment advisers put lots of thought and energy into selling their products and services to the public. They figure out how they can get new investors in the door and how they can make a profit.
So, I want to be sure that we — at the SEC — are putting just as much thought and energy into how to protect individuals who are entrusting their money to our capital markets.
I want to know that we've thought through what investors encounter when they walk into a financial professional's office or call them on the phone. For example:

Does the investor make a distinction between brokers and investment advisers, the way the law does?
Does the investor get the relevant, simple and comparable information at the point of sale or recommendation, or only after the sale has occurred, if at all?
Does the investor know about all the fees they are being charged and whether they are getting the services they are being charged for?
And, does the investor appreciate the nuances of retirement investments and products?

Today I want to discuss the initiatives we are undertaking to address these questions — and perhaps it's easiest to do so from the perspective of that individual investor.
Treating Securities Professionals' Similarly
Applying the Same Standards
So, imagine an investor walking down Main Street in the town where you grew up. He steps into the office of the local securities professional and is handed a business card.
But he doesn't look to see whether it says broker-dealer or investment adviser. Chances are he doesn't know the difference. Or even care. All he wants is helpful, investor-focused advice, a fair deal and a professional he can trust.
These seem to me to be reasonable expectations. But today that investor — whether he knows it or not — is treated differently depending on what that business card says. If it's a broker-dealer, he's sold a product that is, "suitable" for him. If it's an investment adviser, he gets treated under a higher standard — the fiduciary duty standard — meaning that the investment adviser has to provide advice that puts the investor's interest first.
Investors today should not be treated differently based on what door they walk into — or based on what is written on the business card they are handed.
Instead, I believe that all securities professionals should be subject to the same fiduciary duty — and that all investors receiving advice should rest assured that the advice they get is being given with their interest at heart.
But, to be effective, the fiduciary duty needs to be meaningful and uniform across all securities professionals. It cannot be weakened or diluted just so that it can be applied broadly.
At the same time, we should not assume that the investor is fully protected just because the professional on the other side of the desk is subject to a fiduciary standard.
To fully protect the interests of that investor, we must couple the fiduciary duty with an effective oversight regime. And because that investor doesn't differentiate between broker-dealers and investment advisers, our rules should not either.
Securities professionals, regardless of what their business card says, should be subject to the same standard of conduct, the same licensing and qualification requirements, the same disclosure obligations, the same regulatory and recordkeeping standards and a robust examination and oversight schedule.
This approach may disrupt a number of entrenched interests. But, we are doing no service to retail investors by continuing with a distinctly different regulatory approach for professionals who perform virtually the same or similar services.
I thank Congress and the Administration for their leadership in moving us toward a unified fiduciary standard and a harmonized regulatory regime for broker-dealers and investment advisers.
Securities Professionals' Compensation and Conflicts
Point of Sale Disclosure
So, now let us assume our investor is dealing with a professional who is subject to a fiduciary standard. He puts the business card in his pocket and proceeds to listen to the advice he is given.
But exactly what information is he provided? Is it helpful? Is it easy to understand?
Surely, buying a security is not like buying cereal in the grocery store. But, when we enter a grocery store, we at least can see nutrition labels that are easily comparable; we can see prices that are clearly marked. We can count calories and save cents, as we walk through the aisles comparing products.
But, back at that office of the financial professional, comparative shopping is not so easy. In my mind, this should not be the case.
I believe retail investors should be provided clear, simple, meaningful disclosure at the time they are making an investment decision — disclosure that includes comprehensible and comparable information about the securities products and services being offered.
It also should include information about the compensation the professional will receive on each product being sold — and information about the conflicts that may be causing the advisor or salesman to steer the investor to a certain investment.
I realize this is a difficult task, but we will not be deterred by the complexity of the product. Our staff already has announced that it is developing a simplified "summary prospectus" for variable annuities, which are widely regarded as one of the most difficult-to-understand products on the market. It is precisely in this type of product where simplicity of disclosure is essential.
At the end of the day, our investor in that Main Street office just wants to know the facts, so he is not taken advantage of by hidden fees or questionable motivations. And he needs this information when it is most meaningful — at the time he is making his investment decision.
Naturally, not every securities product is purchased while sitting in an office on Main Street. With technology it doesn't quite work that way anymore. For this reason, the mode of disclosure will need to be tailored. A solely paper-based disclosure system is a thing of the past. We should harness the power of the Internet to better serve retail investors. But because disclosure should inform, and not overwhelm, the goal of this disclosure initiative will be to achieve simplicity and clarity, whether on the page or on the screen.
Based on past experience, I know that getting to the point where we can have meaningful point of sale disclosure will be difficult. There will likely be significant pushback from the industry related to cost and convenience. But anything worth doing is not easy.
Ultimately, if we can improve the timeliness and clarity of disclosure for that investor on Main Street, it will have been well worth the effort.
12b-1 Fees
Directly related to this, is the issue of 12b-1 fees. These are fees that are automatically deducted from mutual funds to compensate securities professionals for sales and services provided to mutual fund investors.
The problem is that our investor may have no idea these fees are being deducted or who they are ultimately compensating.
That's why I believe there needs to be a better approach.
When it comes to these fees, there is a need for more fundamental change than merely disclosure reforms and a name change. We must critically rethink how 12b 1 fees are used and whether they continue to be appropriate.
For example, do they result in investors overpaying for services or paying for distribution services that they may not even know they are supposed to be getting? This is no small matter. In 2008, these fees amounted to more than $13 billion — up from just a few million dollars in 1980 when they were first permitted.
Of course, in 1980, they may have made sense — but after 30 years of growth and change in the mutual fund market, it is past the time to reassess their need and their effectiveness.
So, I have asked the staff for a recommendation on 12b-1 fees for Commission consideration in 2010.
Retirement Products
Finally, as we look back in on the office on Main Street — we see our investor asking about retirement products. In fact, today that's happening more and more as Americans are being asked to fund their own retirements.
That is why I believe our nation needs to commit to helping everyday Americans invest for their retirements. It is a financial goal that no one should ignore, whether just entering the workforce or approaching the end of a career.
Essential to this effort are education and financial literacy. Earlier this fall, the SEC launched a new "investor.gov" Web site to better connect with retail investors, with a particular focus on seniors. And we recently brought on a new management team to oversee Investor Education to assure an undiluted focus on the need to better educate investors.
In addition, I have requested that the staff, early next year, present the Commission its recommendations on target date funds. As you may know, these are products specifically designed for Main Street investors planning for their retirement.
They are funds that contain a "target" retirement date in their very name and are designed to become more conservatively invested as the target date approaches. However, last year, many investors were surprised when target date funds marketed to 2010 retirees lost between 9 and 41 percent of their values.
The "set it and forget it" slogans of these funds resulted in shocked investors who were on the verge of retirement. It was a wake-up call for investors, employers and regulators, alike.
Earlier this year, the SEC held a joint hearing with the Department of Labor, which has designated target date funds as qualified default options for 401(k) retirement plans.
Since that hearing, our staff has been focused on the marketing materials related to these funds and the use of target dates in fund names. I believe this an area in need of reform for the benefit of America's retirement investors, and I look forward to completing the work we have started.
Self-Funding
To succeed on behalf of all investors will take not only the will but the resources. I can assure you we have the will. We have dedicated men and women at the SEC who wake up every day committed to protecting investors. And we are stretching our existing resources. But we will not likely be able to achieve all we seek to do without additional funding.
You may not know, but the SEC is a relatively small agency for what we are tasked to do.
We have a staff of 3,700 individuals responsible for overseeing more than 35,000 entities, and areas as diverse as accounting, market structure, corporate governance, mutual fund and intermediary regulation to name just a few.
And, our examination staff — tasked with inspecting 11,000 investment advisory firms and 8,000 mutual funds — numbers less than 500. As a result, our investor on Main Street has about a 10% chance of walking into an investment adviser who has been inspected by the SEC in the previous year.
What's more, as the financial world and product complexity were growing exponentially, our budget was shrinking. Since 2005, the SEC staff size has dropped and funding for discretionary technology has decreased by 50%.
That is why I have been advocating for the SEC to be able to fund its own operations, like virtually every other financial regulator — through the fees we collect. The amount of these fees far surpasses the amount appropriated by Congress to the SEC each fiscal year.
Through self-funding, the SEC will be able to maintain sufficient, stable long-term funding that would enable us to perform long-term planning and better protect the interests of investors and pursue the initiatives I have just described.
Conclusion
2010 will be another year in which I expect the SEC to pursue an ambitious reform agenda. And as we set out on these reforms, we will do so from the perspective of that retail investor on Main Street, who has the unquestioned right to believe that the SEC is on the job. I am committed to restoring confidence and providing the protections investors expect and deserve.
I hope I can count on your support.
Thank you.

Early life and education[edit]
Schapiro was born in New York City[5] to Robert and Mary Susan "Sue" Hall Schapiro.[6] Schapiro's mother was a member of the Presbyterian church.[7] One of four children, Schapiro grew up in Babylon, N.Y., where her father owned the Tempus Fugit antique store.[8] and her mother was a reference librarian.[9] Schapiro graduated from Babylon High School, and matriculated at Franklin & Marshall College, where she was graduated in 1977. In 1980 she earned a Juris Doctor (J.D.) degree with honors from George Washington University Law School.[1]
Career prior to the SEC[edit]
Schapiro was appointed in 1988 by President Ronald Reagan to fill one of two Democratic seats on the SEC. President George H. W. Bush reappointed her to this position in 1989. President Bill Clinton appointed Schapiro acting Chair of the SEC, and then appointed her Chair of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission in 1994.
In 1996 Schapiro joined the National Association of Securities Dealers (NASD) (now the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority) as the president of NASD Regulation. In 2002 she became the Vice Chair of the NASD.
In 2005 Schapiro oversaw a wide-reaching probe into gift-giving and entertaining on Wall Street, uncovering several instances of lavish and excessive activities, which led to many charges.[10]
In 2006 she became NASD's Chair and CEO. In that position, she oversaw NASD's consolidation with NYSE Member Regulation to form the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.[11]
In January 2008, President George W. Bush appointed Schapiro to the 19-member council of the President's Advisory Council on Financial Literacy. In 2008, Schapiro was named to Investment Advisor magazine's IA 25, the list of the 25 most influential people in and around the investment advisory business.[12]
In 2008, her last year at FINRA, Schapiro earned a regular compensation package of $3.3 million; on departure from FINRA, she received additional lump sum retirement benefit payments to a total of just under $9 million.[13]She received $8.99 million as a "final distribution," including $7.6 million in vested retirement benefits, according to a Finra report. She makes $163,500 at the SEC.[14]
SEC Chair[edit]
In January 2009 the U.S. Senate unanimously confirmed Schapiro's appointment by President Barack Obama to be the SEC's first female permanent Chair.[1]
Schapiro partially blamed the financial crises of 2008 on deregulation, telling senators that the regulatory system had "not kept pace with the markets and the needs of investors". As the SEC's head, she said, she would press for tighter regulation of financial instruments, including derivatives.[15]
During Schapiro's tenure at the SEC, the agency improved its enforcement program, creating new structures, procedures, and programs to better address the modern financial markets, including: bringing 735 enforcement actions in FY 2011 and a near record of 734 actions in FY 2012; obtaining more than $11 billion in ordered disgorgements and penalties since FY 2009; prosecuting the largest insider trading scheme ever discovered, winning a record $92.8 million fine in the civil case against the CEO of the Galleon Hedge Fund; and bringing financial-crisis related actions against Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, among others.[16][17] Also during Schapiro’s tenure, the SEC brought a record number of enforcement actions and returned more than $6 billion to harmed investors.[2] Schapiro also led the agency through one of its most active rulemaking periods, and enacted many other investor protection measures, including adopting more than three quarters of the rules required by the Dodd-Frank Act.[18]
An early setback for Schapiro as SEC Chair occurred in September 2009 when U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff rejected the SEC's proposed $33 million settlement with Bank of America. BoA had been charged with failure to disclose bonuses paid to Merrill Lynch executive before the two companies merged. Under the settlement's terms BoA was allowed to deny any wrongdoing, which they did when pressed by Rakoff on the matter of guilt.[19] Rakoff said the settlement did not "comport with the most elementary notions of justice and morality".[20] Seven months later, Rakoff approved a $150 million settlement of the BoA case; BoA did not have to change its declaration of innocence.[21]
Upon Schapiro's departure from the SEC in December 2012, President Obama commended Schapiro's contributions as Chair in an official White House statement.[22]
Subsequent career[edit]
In April 2013, Schapiro joined Promontory Financial Group where she is Advisory Board Vice Chair.[23][24] In 2014 she joined the board of directors of General Electric,[25] and in 2015, she joined the board of directors of the London Stock Exchange Group.[26] In 2017, she was elected to the board of directors of CVS Health.[27]
Personal life[edit]
Schapiro is married to Charles "Chas" Cadwell, a former official with the U.S. Small Business Administration.[28] They have two daughters.[29] She serves as treasurer of the Humane Rescue Alliance, formerly the Washington Humane Society.[30]

Early life and education[edit]
Schapiro was born in New York City[5] to Robert and Mary Susan "Sue" Hall Schapiro.[6] Schapiro's mother was a member of the Presbyterian church.[7] One of four children, Schapiro grew up in Babylon, N.Y., where her father owned the Tempus Fugit antique store.[8] and her mother was a reference librarian.[9] Schapiro graduated from Babylon High School, and matriculated at Franklin & Marshall College, where she was graduated in 1977. In 1980 she earned a Juris Doctor (J.D.) degree with honors from George Washington University Law School.[1]
Career prior to the SEC[edit]
Schapiro was appointed in 1988 by President Ronald Reagan to fill one of two Democratic seats on the SEC. President George H. W. Bush reappointed her to this position in 1989. President Bill Clinton appointed Schapiro acting Chair of the SEC, and then appointed her Chair of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission in 1994.

An early setback for Schapiro as SEC Chair occurred in September 2009 when U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff rejected the SEC's proposed $33 million settlement with Bank of America. BoA had been charged with failure to disclose bonuses paid to Merrill Lynch executive before the two companies merged. Under the settlement's terms BoA was allowed to deny any wrongdoing, which they did when pressed by Rakoff on the matter of guilt.[19] Rakoff said the settlement did not "comport with the most elementary notions of justice and morality".[20] Seven months later, Rakoff approved a $150 million settlement of the BoA case; BoA did not have to change its declaration of innocence.[21]
Upon Schapiro's departure from the SEC in December 2012, President Obama commended Schapiro's contributions as Chair in an official White House statement.[22]
Subsequent career[edit]
In April 2013, Schapiro joined Promontory Financial Group where she is Advisory Board Vice Chair.[23][24] In 2014 she joined the board of directors of General Electric,[25] and in 2015, she joined the board of directors of the London Stock Exchange Group.[26] In 2017, she was elected to the board of directors of CVS Health.[27]
Personal life[edit]
Schapiro is married to Charles "Chas" Cadwell, a former official with the U.S. Small Business Administration.[28] They have two daughters.[29] She serves as treasurer of the Humane Rescue Alliance, formerly the Washington Humane Society.[30]

Early life and education[edit]
Schapiro was born in New York City[5] to Robert and Mary Susan "Sue" Hall Schapiro.[6] Schapiro's mother was a member of the Presbyterian church.[7] One of four children, Schapiro grew up in Babylon, N.Y., where her father owned the Tempus Fugit antique store.[8] and her mother was a reference librarian.[9] Schapiro graduated from Babylon High School, and matriculated at Franklin & Marshall College, where she was graduated in 1977. In 1980 she earned a Juris Doctor (J.D.) degree with honors from George Washington University Law School.[1]
Career prior to the SEC[edit]
Schapiro was appointed in 1988 by President Ronald Reagan to fill one of two Democratic seats on the SEC. President George H. W. Bush reappointed her to this position in 1989. President Bill Clinton appointed Schapiro acting Chair of the SEC, and then appointed her Chair of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission in 1994.
In 1996 Schapiro joined the National Association of Securities Dealers (NASD) (now the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority) as the president of NASD Regulation. In 2002 she became the Vice Chair of the NASD.
In 2005 Schapiro oversaw a wide-reaching probe into gift-giving and entertaining on Wall Street, uncovering several instances of lavish and excessive activities, which led to many charges.[10]
In 2006 she became NASD's Chair and CEO. In that position, she oversaw NASD's consolidation with NYSE Member Regulation to form the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.[11]
In January 2008, President George W. Bush appointed Schapiro to the 19-member council of the President's Advisory Council on Financial Literacy. In 2008, Schapiro was named to Investment Advisor magazine's IA 25, the list of the 25 most influential people in and around the investment advisory business.[12]
In 2008, her last year at FINRA, Schapiro earned a regular compensation package of $3.3 million; on departure from FINRA, she received additional lump sum retirement benefit payments to a total of just under $9 million.[13]She received $8.99 million as a "final distribution," including $7.6 million in vested retirement benefits, according to a Finra report. She makes $163,500 at the SEC.[14]
SEC Chair[edit]
In January 2009 the U.S. Senate unanimously confirmed Schapiro's appointment by President Barack Obama to be the SEC's first female permanent Chair.[1]
Schapiro partially blamed the financial crises of 2008 on deregulation, telling senators that the regulatory system had "not kept pace with the markets and the needs of investors". As the SEC's head, she said, she would press for tighter regulation of financial instruments, including derivatives.[15]
During Schapiro's tenure at the SEC, the agency improved its enforcement program, creating new structures, procedures, and programs to better address the modern financial markets, including: bringing 735 enforcement actions in FY 2011 and a near record of 734 actions in FY 2012; obtaining more than $11 billion in ordered disgorgements and penalties since FY 2009; prosecuting the largest insider trading scheme ever discovered, winning a record $92.8 million fine in the civil case against the CEO of the Galleon Hedge Fund; and bringing financial-crisis related actions against Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, among others.[16][17] Also during Schapiro’s tenure, the SEC brought a record number of enforcement actions and returned more than $6 billion to harmed investors.[2] Schapiro also led the agency through one of its most active rulemaking periods, and enacted many other investor protection measures, including adopting more than three quarters of the rules required by the Dodd-Frank Act.[18]

Personal life[edit]
Schapiro is married to Charles "Chas" Cadwell, a former official with the U.S. Small Business Administration.[28] They have two daughters.[29] She serves as treasurer of the Humane Rescue Alliance, formerly the Washington Humane Society.[30]

The chief financial regulator worked to restore trust in the agency. (Alex Wong/GETTY IMAGES)   By Dina ElBoghdady  By Dina ElBoghdady  November 26, 2012    Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Mary L. Schapiro said Monday that she will step down in mid-December, ending a four-year tenure that began in the rough-and-tumble days of the financial crisis and came to be defined by it.  President Obama designated Elisse Walter, one of the SEC’s Democratic commissioners, as Schapiro’s replacement for now. But people familiar with the administration’s plan expect the president to nominate a permanent successor soon. The new SEC chief will adopt an agency saved from the brink of extinction under Schapiro’s watch. When she took the job in January 2009, the agency’s reputation was in tatters. Its failure to police Wall Street or detect Bernard Madoff’s massive Ponzi scheme had critics calling for its dismantling. Even Schapiro’s detractors credit her for making the agency relevant again under the most difficult conditions in its recent history. But unfinished work presents knotty challenges. Critics say that under Schapiro, the SEC never fully reckoned with the financial crisis or the shortcomings that created it. It failed to punish key Wall Street figures, negotiate enough meaningful settlements with the large institutions they ran or crank out most of the regulations required of it by the Dodd-Frank overhaul measure enacted in 2010. Meanwhile, the May 2010 “flash crash” — in which high-speed computer trading accelerated a plunge in stock values — and other glitches such as the botched public offering of Facebook are raising questions about whether the SEC can keep up with the tech-savvy traders and markets it oversees. While some other countries are moving to rein in high-speed trading, the SEC has not.  Schapiro dismissed the criticism and released several pages listing the SEC’s achievements, including an overhaul of the enforcement unit, which brought a record number of actions in each of the past two years and has returned a record $4.5 billion to harmed investors since fiscal 2010. The agency that was once on the chopping block has gained new authority from Congress, created a whistleblower program to gather tips and complaints, and engaged in one of the most active periods of rulemaking in decades, Schapiro said. “I feel great about the last four years,” she said in an interview. “I knew the most important thing I could do was steer the agency out of the most difficult period in its history, and I feel I’ve accomplished that.” Obama lauded her record, noting in a statement that Schapiro “was fully aware of the difficulties facing the SEC and our economy as a whole. But she accepted the challenge, and today, the SEC is stronger and our financial system is safer and better able to serve the American people — thanks in large part to Mary’s hard work.”  Even one of the SEC’s most strident critics credited Schapiro for turning around the agency. Harry Markopolos, the financial sleuth who had tried for years to alert the SEC to Madoff’s Ponzi scheme, said he initially opposed her nomination because she once ran the brokerage industry’s self-regulatory body and he took her for an industry sympathizer.  “I was quickly proven wrong,” he said. “The SEC is night-and-day better than it was four short years ago. . . . It gives no free passes to anybody.”  Many Schapiro supporters say the watershed case that showed the SEC was back in action came in April 2010, when Goldman Sachs agreed to pay $550 million to settle a fraud suit brought by the agency — the largest fine the agency had ever assessed against a financial company. Other cases followed against companies involved in the financial crisis, including Countrywide, Bank of America and Citigroup.  But the courts also dealt the SEC some of its biggest setbacks.  Late last year, a federal judge in Manhattan rejected an SEC plan to settle its lawsuit against Citigroup in one of the biggest cases to emerge from the mortgage meltdown, saying the deal was too weak and failed to hold the bank accountable for wrongdoing.  More recently, critics of the Dodd-Frank act mounted a legal challenge that torpedoed an SEC rule designed to make it easier for major shareholders to remove corporate board members and nominate new ones. That decision had a chilling effect on the pace of SEC regulation. Many of Schapiro’s critics say she let the industry steamroll over her agency. “She is not someone who relishes conflict,” said Barbara Roper, a director at the Consumer Federation of America. “That is a very fine personal quality, but it is not necessarily the quality we need in the leader of the SEC in this environment.” The battles in the courts, partisanstruggles on the five-member commission and push-back from House Republicans on the Dodd-Frank rule called for someone more thick-skinned and combative, her critics said.   And those critics are not sure they will get that leader in Walter, a close ally of Schapiro’s who has served on the commission since July 2008. The names of several other potential Schapiro successors have surfaced, including Mary J. Miller, a senior Treasury Department official. Rumors of Schapiro’s departure had circulated for months, and many expected her to step down after the presidential election. The pressures of the job had exhausted her, people who know her said. During Thanksgiving break, surrounded by family, she decided the timing of her departure, she said.  “I have no plans at all,” she said. “I haven’t had time to think about what I want to do next.”  But if Walter wants the top job, she would have to be renominated and reconfirmed before her term expires in December 2013.  Without Schapiro, the remaining four members on the commission will be evenly split between Republicans and Democrats, creating the potential for gridlock.  Like Schapiro, Walter served at the self-regulatory body known as FINRA before joining the SEC. A lawyer by training, she was the general counsel of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission in 1994 and held various positions at the SEC before she was confirmed as commissioner. Bartlett Naylor, a financial policy advocate at Congress Watch, describes Walter as a Schapiro clone who voted with the chairman on nearly every policy decision. Walter declined to comment on her future plans on the commission. But she praised Schapiro as an unflappable protector of investors who has handled the pressures of the job with grace. “I only hope that I will be able to do as well, and if I can, it will be because of all the work she’s done in the past four years,” Walter said.             business economy      false after3th true          Please provide a valid email address.

                    Money Funds, Waiting for the Fog to Lift                
Still awaiting new rules from regulators, the money-fund industry is dealing with an old reality: low interest rates that discourage investors and compress fees.

Hudson Executive Capital had already set out to not be the typical activist hedge fund. Its stated mission is to be constructive in dealing with corporate boards, rather than taking combative stances of the likes of William A. Ackman and Carl C. Icahn.Now, the firm is adding to its executive roster two prominent names who are unlikely hires for the sharp-elbowed world of hedge fund investing.Hudson Executive said on Wednesday that it had named Mary L. Schapiro, the former chairwoman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, as a senior adviser for corporate governance and regulatory issues. And it was bringing on board Richard M. Kovacevich, the former chairman and chief executive of Wells Fargo, as one of its “C.E.O. Partners.”The appointments add more well-known names to Hudson Executive, which was founded in January by two prominent deal makers in the world of corporate mergers: Douglas L. Braunstein, a former chief financial officer of JPMorgan Chase, and James C. Woolery, most recently the chairman-elect of the law firm Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft.

Both founders have said that they intend to be like other activist firms in terms of persuading companies to shift their corporate strategies. But they have distinguished their approach by pledging to work hand-in-hand with boards and management teams. Continue reading the main story

The aim, Hudson Executive has said, is to be helpful to companies. That may extend to corporations under pressure from other activists who are pursuing an unwelcome and more aggressive campaign. It is a tactic that Mr. Braunstein and Mr. Woolery believe can be profitable.

That angle has already drawn the support of prominent current and former corporate chieftains, many of whom previously had been clients of the firm’s founding partners. Among them are Ivan Seidenberg, formerly head of Verizon, and Darwin Deason, the chairman of Affiliated Computer Services.

Now, Hudson Executive is adding individuals with unusual experiences. Ms. Schapiro served as the first S.E.C. chairwoman during the Obama administration, overseeing moves like a lawsuit against Goldman Sachs over a mortgage-related investment created during the debt boom. In 2013, she joined the Promontory Financial Group, a bank consulting firm often criticized for its work in helping clients negotiate regulatory hurdles. She left as a full-time employee after less than a year.Ms. Schapiro is also a director at General Electric.Mr. Kovacevich led Wells Fargo during the financial crisis, watching as many of its competitors struggled. It was under him that the bank agreed to buy Wachovia in 2008 for $15.1 billion to bolster its nationwide presence. He left the bank in 2010.“We are pleased to add Dick Kovacevich and Mary Schapiro to our team and look forward to working with them and all of our Advisory Partners to generate investment opportunities and returns through Constructive Engagement,” Mr. Braunstein said in a statement.

Mary L. Schapiro (born June 19, 1955) served as the 29th Chair of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). She was appointed by President Barack Obama, unanimously confirmed by the U.S. Senate, and assumed the Chairship on January 27, 2009. She is the first woman to be the permanent Chair of the SEC.[3] In 2009, Forbes ranked her the 56th most powerful woman in the world.[4]
Schapiro served in various roles as a financial services regulator in the administrations of Ronald Reagan, George H. W. Bush, and Bill Clinton. From 2006 to early 2009, she was the Chairman and CEO of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), the securities industry's self-regulatory organization for broker-dealers and exchanges in the United States.[1]

Early life and education[edit]
Schapiro was born in New York City[5] to Robert and Mary Susan "Sue" Hall Schapiro.[6] Schapiro's mother was a member of the Presbyterian church.[7] One of four children, Schapiro grew up in Babylon, N.Y., where her father owned the Tempus Fugit antique store.[8] and her mother was a reference librarian.[9] Schapiro graduated from Babylon High School, and matriculated at Franklin & Marshall College, where she was graduated in 1977. In 1980 she earned a Juris Doctor (J.D.) degree with honors from George Washington University Law School.[1]
Career prior to the SEC[edit]
Schapiro was appointed in 1988 by President Ronald Reagan to fill one of two Democratic seats on the SEC. President George H. W. Bush reappointed her to this position in 1989. President Bill Clinton appointed Schapiro acting Chair of the SEC, and then appointed her Chair of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission in 1994.
In 1996 Schapiro joined the National Association of Securities Dealers (NASD) (now the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority) as the president of NASD Regulation. In 2002 she became the Vice Chair of the NASD.
In 2005 Schapiro oversaw a wide-reaching probe into gift-giving and entertaining on Wall Street, uncovering several instances of lavish and excessive activities, which led to many charges.[10]
In 2006 she became NASD's Chair and CEO. In that position, she oversaw NASD's consolidation with NYSE Member Regulation to form the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.[11]
In January 2008, President George W. Bush appointed Schapiro to the 19-member council of the President's Advisory Council on Financial Literacy. In 2008, Schapiro was named to Investment Advisor magazine's IA 25, the list of the 25 most influential people in and around the investment advisory business.[12]
In 2008, her last year at FINRA, Schapiro earned a regular compensation package of $3.3 million; on departure from FINRA, she received additional lump sum retirement benefit payments to a total of just under $9 million.[13]She received $8.99 million as a "final distribution," including $7.6 million in vested retirement benefits, according to a Finra report. She makes $163,500 at the SEC.[14]
SEC Chair[edit]
In January 2009 the U.S. Senate unanimously confirmed Schapiro's appointment by President Barack Obama to be the SEC's first female permanent Chair.[1]
Schapiro partially blamed the financial crises of 2008 on deregulation, telling senators that the regulatory system had "not kept pace with the markets and the needs of investors". As the SEC's head, she said, she would press for tighter regulation of financial instruments, including derivatives.[15]
During Schapiro's tenure at the SEC, the agency improved its enforcement program, creating new structures, procedures, and programs to better address the modern financial markets, including: bringing 735 enforcement actions in FY 2011 and a near record of 734 actions in FY 2012; obtaining more than $11 billion in ordered disgorgements and penalties since FY 2009; prosecuting the largest insider trading scheme ever discovered, winning a record $92.8 million fine in the civil case against the CEO of the Galleon Hedge Fund; and bringing financial-crisis related actions against Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, among others.[16][17] Also during Schapiro’s tenure, the SEC brought a record number of enforcement actions and returned more than $6 billion to harmed investors.[2] Schapiro also led the agency through one of its most active rulemaking periods, and enacted many other investor protection measures, including adopting more than three quarters of the rules required by the Dodd-Frank Act.[18]
An early setback for Schapiro as SEC Chair occurred in September 2009 when U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff rejected the SEC's proposed $33 million settlement with Bank of America. BoA had been charged with failure to disclose bonuses paid to Merrill Lynch executive before the two companies merged. Under the settlement's terms BoA was allowed to deny any wrongdoing, which they did when pressed by Rakoff on the matter of guilt.[19] Rakoff said the settlement did not "comport with the most elementary notions of justice and morality".[20] Seven months later, Rakoff approved a $150 million settlement of the BoA case; BoA did not have to change its declaration of innocence.[21]
Upon Schapiro's departure from the SEC in December 2012, President Obama commended Schapiro's contributions as Chair in an official White House statement.[22]
Subsequent career[edit]
In April 2013, Schapiro joined Promontory Financial Group where she is Advisory Board Vice Chair.[23][24] In 2014 she joined the board of directors of General Electric,[25] and in 2015, she joined the board of directors of the London Stock Exchange Group.[26] In 2017, she was elected to the board of directors of CVS Health.[27]
Personal life[edit]
Schapiro is married to Charles "Chas" Cadwell, a former official with the U.S. Small Business Administration.[28] They have two daughters.[29] She serves as treasurer of the Humane Rescue Alliance, formerly the Washington Humane Society.[30]

Mary L. Schapiro (born June 19, 1955) served as the 29th Chair of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). She was appointed by President Barack Obama, unanimously confirmed by the U.S. Senate, and assumed the Chairship on January 27, 2009. She is the first woman to be the permanent Chair of the SEC.[3] In 2009, Forbes ranked her the 56th most powerful woman in the world.[4]
Schapiro served in various roles as a financial services regulator in the administrations of Ronald Reagan, George H. W. Bush, and Bill Clinton. From 2006 to early 2009, she was the Chairman and CEO of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), the securities industry's self-regulatory organization for broker-dealers and exchanges in the United States.[1]

Early life and education[edit]
Schapiro was born in New York City[5] to Robert and Mary Susan "Sue" Hall Schapiro.[6] Schapiro's mother was a member of the Presbyterian church.[7] One of four children, Schapiro grew up in Babylon, N.Y., where her father owned the Tempus Fugit antique store.[8] and her mother was a reference librarian.[9] Schapiro graduated from Babylon High School, and matriculated at Franklin & Marshall College, where she was graduated in 1977. In 1980 she earned a Juris Doctor (J.D.) degree with honors from George Washington University Law School.[1]
Career prior to the SEC[edit]
Schapiro was appointed in 1988 by President Ronald Reagan to fill one of two Democratic seats on the SEC. President George H. W. Bush reappointed her to this position in 1989. President Bill Clinton appointed Schapiro acting Chair of the SEC, and then appointed her Chair of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission in 1994.
In 1996 Schapiro joined the National Association of Securities Dealers (NASD) (now the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority) as the president of NASD Regulation. In 2002 she became the Vice Chair of the NASD.
In 2005 Schapiro oversaw a wide-reaching probe into gift-giving and entertaining on Wall Street, uncovering several instances of lavish and excessive activities, which led to many charges.[10]
In 2006 she became NASD's Chair and CEO. In that position, she oversaw NASD's consolidation with NYSE Member Regulation to form the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.[11]
In January 2008, President George W. Bush appointed Schapiro to the 19-member council of the President's Advisory Council on Financial Literacy. In 2008, Schapiro was named to Investment Advisor magazine's IA 25, the list of the 25 most influential people in and around the investment advisory business.[12]
In 2008, her last year at FINRA, Schapiro earned a regular compensation package of $3.3 million; on departure from FINRA, she received additional lump sum retirement benefit payments to a total of just under $9 million.[13]She received $8.99 million as a "final distribution," including $7.6 million in vested retirement benefits, according to a Finra report. She makes $163,500 at the SEC.[14]
SEC Chair[edit]
In January 2009 the U.S. Senate unanimously confirmed Schapiro's appointment by President Barack Obama to be the SEC's first female permanent Chair.[1]
Schapiro partially blamed the financial crises of 2008 on deregulation, telling senators that the regulatory system had "not kept pace with the markets and the needs of investors". As the SEC's head, she said, she would press for tighter regulation of financial instruments, including derivatives.[15]
During Schapiro's tenure at the SEC, the agency improved its enforcement program, creating new structures, procedures, and programs to better address the modern financial markets, including: bringing 735 enforcement actions in FY 2011 and a near record of 734 actions in FY 2012; obtaining more than $11 billion in ordered disgorgements and penalties since FY 2009; prosecuting the largest insider trading scheme ever discovered, winning a record $92.8 million fine in the civil case against the CEO of the Galleon Hedge Fund; and bringing financial-crisis related actions against Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, among others.[16][17] Also during Schapiro’s tenure, the SEC brought a record number of enforcement actions and returned more than $6 billion to harmed investors.[2] Schapiro also led the agency through one of its most active rulemaking periods, and enacted many other investor protection measures, including adopting more than three quarters of the rules required by the Dodd-Frank Act.[18]
An early setback for Schapiro as SEC Chair occurred in September 2009 when U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff rejected the SEC's proposed $33 million settlement with Bank of America. BoA had been charged with failure to disclose bonuses paid to Merrill Lynch executive before the two companies merged. Under the settlement's terms BoA was allowed to deny any wrongdoing, which they did when pressed by Rakoff on the matter of guilt.[19] Rakoff said the settlement did not "comport with the most elementary notions of justice and morality".[20] Seven months later, Rakoff approved a $150 million settlement of the BoA case; BoA did not have to change its declaration of innocence.[21]
Upon Schapiro's departure from the SEC in December 2012, President Obama commended Schapiro's contributions as Chair in an official White House statement.[22]
Subsequent career[edit]
In April 2013, Schapiro joined Promontory Financial Group where she is Advisory Board Vice Chair.[23][24] In 2014 she joined the board of directors of General Electric,[25] and in 2015, she joined the board of directors of the London Stock Exchange Group.[26] In 2017, she was elected to the board of directors of CVS Health.[27]
Personal life[edit]
Schapiro is married to Charles "Chas" Cadwell, a former official with the U.S. Small Business Administration.[28] They have two daughters.[29] She serves as treasurer of the Humane Rescue Alliance, formerly the Washington Humane Society.[30]

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).

Every morning when I pick up the newspaper and read about an earthquake in Japan or problems in European financial institutions, the first question I ask our staff is 'What is money-market-fund exposure?'
Mary Schapiro


Morning,
Financial,
Problems



















Under the Dodd-Frank law, the SEC got the lion's share of the rules to write, more than 100 rules, and we have done an extraordinary amount of that. Eighty percent have been either proposed or adopted. So, a lot, a lot accomplished but of course, more to do.
Mary Schapiro


Lion,
Law,
Rules
























I don't feel any pressure at all to go along with anybody. I feel pressure to do the right thing for U.S. markets and U.S. investors.
Mary Schapiro


Do The Right Thing,
Go



















I came in with the intention of serving as long as it made sense for me to do so. The election was a natural moment to think about whether I wanted to stay longer, and I'm thrilled to turn the reins over to my longtime colleague Elisse Walter.
Mary Schapiro


Moment,
Long,
Me



















There are no absolutes in this world, and there will always be mistakes that are made within brokerage firms; there will always be people who set out to deceive the regulators and even deceive their own senior management.
Mary Schapiro


Mistakes,
Management,
World



















It has been an incredibly rewarding experience to work with so many dedicated SEC staff who strive every day to protect investors and ensure our markets operate with integrity.
Mary Schapiro


Work,
Integrity,
Experience



















When the SEC needs to be deterring corporate wrongdoing, the 'penalty pilot' program sends the wrong message.
Mary Schapiro


Pilot,
Wrong,
Needs



















Too often, investors are the target of fraudulent schemes disguised as investment opportunities. As you know, if the balance is tipped to the point where investors are not confident that there are appropriate protections, investors will lose confidence in our markets, and capital formation will ultimately be made more difficult and expensive.
Mary Schapiro


Confidence,
Balance,
Know



















In my case, there's no revolving door... I won't be going back to government.
Mary Schapiro


Door,
Government,
Back
























I work on weekends, but from home.
Mary Schapiro


Work,
Home,
Weekends



















The SEC got more than 100 rules to write under Dodd-Frank, the lion's share of all the agencies. And we've moved, I think, with a tremendous sense of urgency. But it takes a long time to write rules and get them approved by a five-member commission.
Mary Schapiro


Time,
Lion,
Rules



















We have new rules that give shareholders the ability to vote on executive compensation. We have new rules for asset-backed securities. We have new rules around credit rating agencies.
Mary Schapiro


Rules,
Credit,
New



















The SEC has actually progressively loosened up the rules and recognized the value of social media, but the goal is always going to be to get information out as broadly as possible as quickly as possible.
Mary Schapiro


Social Media,
Goal,
Value
