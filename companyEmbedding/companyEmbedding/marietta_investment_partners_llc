James M. Rauh
Director of Wealth Management Strategies
Throughout my career, I have been fascinated by the investment business. The capital markets offer dynamic ways to grow assets, capture investment income, take advantage of opportunities and design strategies to achieve long-term goals.
I believe investors are interested in establishing relationships with people and an organization they can trust and rely upon, and they seek sound advice and insights from successful professionals. We come to work each day to help our clients preserve and grow their wealth. We also focus on helping our client families advance their shared values and plan for future generations. Throughout my career, I have provided counsel to high net worth individuals and their families and have led teams delivering investment management, retirement, philanthropic and estate planning strategies.
I am a director of Versiti, the Blood Center of Wisconsin, and City Year Milwaukee. I am a member of the University of Wisconsin Department of Economics Advisory Board, and a former director of Northern Trust Bank fsb, Northern Trust Global Advisors, Northern Trust Securities, Inc. and Robert W. Baird & Co.

Lori J. Brook
Partner and Operations Manager
I have been a member of the Marietta team since the founding of the company in 2000. During my time here, I have been a part of the implementation of the portfolio, trading, and reporting infrastructure that is integral to our investment activities. I am proud of the shape our systems have taken; they provide freedom from distraction to our investment team which in turn enables them to focus on managing the money of Marietta’s most important asset—our clients. Our clients are wonderful, as is our team here at Marietta. What brings me enjoyment, besides finding ways to better our systems, is the pleasure of working with and for a great group of people—our clients as well as my colleagues.
Outside the office, I most love being a Mom. I inform my son to try to be happy no matter what life hands him, and encourage him to be the best he can be. Being able to watch my son play a variety of sports and grow into the man I always hoped he would, is truly amazing. I am very blessed with a wonderful group of genuinely supportive friends and family. In my spare time, my son and I have been volunteering with Elmbrook, Upward, and Feed My Sheep Ministries since 2005. I even enjoy, with a true smile, helping my friends move or shovel snow.

Amanda K. Grams
Portfolio Administrator
I joined Marietta in 2014  after receiving my BBA in Finance from UW-Milwaukee.  As a member of the operations team, I interact with our clients on a daily basis and strive to provide them with the highest quality service.  At Marietta, our clients know that when they contact us, they will receive a warm, personal greeting by a knowledgeable member of our staff who is eager and ready to assist them.
My interest in finance stems from a desire to help others achieve strong financial health, and prepare for the future.  I am excited to be part of a firm that provides confident, well-researched investment guidance.
Outside of the office, I can most often be found in the kitchen, trying out a new recipe, or enjoying the outdoors with family and friends.  My husband and I share a passion for travel and are always on the lookout for the next great getaway destination.

Robert C. Draper, J.D.
Portfolio Manager and Chief Compliance Officer
In my role, I manage individual client investment portfolios and research equity investment opportunities based on their potential to appreciate in value. In addition, as the Chief Compliance Officer, I administer our firm’s policies for maintaining compliance with state and federal laws governing the investment advisor industry.
In the investment industry there’s always uncertainty—making investing a potentially stressful and intimidating task for our clients. At Marietta, I believe we provide value to our clients by bringing some clarity to the investment process; helping our clients understand both the risks and the potential for growth in their portfolios. Our task is to resolve the uncertainty in these aspects of the markets to find optimal investments that match our clients’ goals. The core component of investment research is central to this ability. We continuously evaluate different sources of information to maximize our insights—enabling us to make smart choices for our clients and invest with confidence in this unpredictable world.
While I am driven by the analytical challenges in this profession, at the end of the day the most rewarding aspect of this job is the service that we offer to our clients. Standing side-by-side with our clients, I work with our team to guide them through the investment markets—giving them peace-of-mind that we have their best interests at heart. I feel that it’s this personal focus that sets us apart and reinforces the strong, lasting relationships we build with our clients.

Charles P. Evans
Associate Director
My path to investment management took a circuitous route through China. While at Middlebury College, I majored in International Studies with a focus on East Asia and Mandarin Chinese. My move to Shanghai in 2009 coincided with the late innings of China’s great economic boom, and my three years living abroad was a fascinating, exhilarating experience that stoked my interest in global economies. When the opportunity arose to assist Marietta’s globally-oriented investment team and reunite with my family, I happily returned to Milwaukee.
It’s a privilege to work with Marietta’s clients to establish and achieve their investment goals, and I look forward each day to collaborating with my colleagues to bring our clients the highest possible quality of service. I understand the tremendous value and power of investing; when done wisely, it provides security, comfort, and peace of mind for the future. I take great satisfaction in being able to provide these benefits to our clients. When our clients succeed, we succeed.
I am proud to call Milwaukee home, and enjoy spending time with my family, especially during our annual summer fishing trip up north. I also like giving back to the community and volunteer at a number of local organizations, including Make A Difference-Wisconsin, Habitat for Humanity, and Growing Power. In addition, I’m a member of the Rotary Club of Milwaukee, an organization committed to impacting positive change locally and around the globe. My greatest passion is for the outdoors, and I have a lifetime goal to explore every one of America’s National Parks.

John T. Evans, Ph.D.
Founder and Managing Partner
With 39 years of experience as an investment portfolio manager, I bring wisdom to investment discussions. If knowledge is knowing what to do, then wisdom is knowing what not to do. An important lesson I’ve learned is that intellectual humility is a necessary prerequisite to successful investing; investing must never become an ego sport.
My objective is to provide clients with peace of mind, which can be achieved only when the clients know their portfolios are structured to meet their unique circumstances and also the anticipated investment outlook. My clients are aware of my genuine concern for their happiness and prosperity, and I especially enjoy sharing perspectives on life in general as well as investment markets. I also take great pride in the dedication of my colleagues to assist clients and maintain the professional integrity of the firm, and I enjoy the congenial spirit of our dynamic, forward-thinking team.
My greatest joy is my family, with my favorite moments being the times my wife and I spend with our two daughters, son and now our 1-year old grandson. My favorite activities, as well as my greatest frustrations, are fishing for muskies and golfing. I also enjoy watching sports, politics, and investment shows, and take an active interest in history and historic preservation.

Robert B. Pieters
Senior Marketing Advisor
I joined Marietta in 2009 as Senior Marketing Advisor. I provide counsel and perspective to clients and to individuals who are looking for investment management solutions.
Before joining Marietta, I was President & CEO of Lutheran Living Services for eleven years. Prior to that, I was with Federated Bank for 17 years, first as CFO, then as CEO for the last 12 years.  Following an acquisition, I served 4 years as Bank Group President at Firstar (now U.S.) Bank Milwaukee.  I began my professional career as an auditor with the international audit, tax and advisory firm KPMG LLP.
I became a client of Marietta before being invited to join the firm.  I was initially drawn to Marietta for a number of reasons but primarily the integrity and expertise of the management team. Their opportunistic investment style and international focus made more sense to me than owning style-bound mutual funds filed with dozens if not hundreds of companies I had little hope of ever knowing enough about.  Since coming onboard, I have enjoyed sharing my positive experience at Marietta and spreading the news of its sterling customer service and talented investment team.
When not at work, I look forward to time spent with family and friends, exploring the outdoors, jogging and golf.  My family and I are frequent travelers, especially to the Southwest, where we have grown to love the climate and culture.

Jonathan A. Smucker, MBA
Portfolio Manager
As a Portfolio Manager, I enjoy knowing that when we succeed, there is an immediate, direct, and tangible benefit for our clients. I take protecting and growing the investment assets of our clientele very seriously. Investing can be stressful, so I strive to make every client’s experience as comfortable as possible. I believe that each individual client has unique preferences and needs in regards to service; therefore, it is not only our job to satisfy completely each client’s needs, but also to adapt to meet each client’s preferences.
My passion comes from my interest in economics, financial systems, business, and current events, and is invigorated everyday by my colleagues. Marietta’s team approach is fresh, rewarding, and provides a venue for profound idea exchange and dialogue. I feel it’s our team approach that makes the difference in our client experience.
In my spare time, I enjoy playing music, baseball, and basketball. I enjoy exploring new places, from a rarely traveled river to a new city, and am also a constant advocate for Milwaukee as a great place to live, work, visit, and play.

Breanna S. Ellsworth
Research Analyst
I joined Marietta in 2012 after graduating from UW-Madison with a degree in finance. In my time as a portfolio administrator, I have learned the foundation of our business – building trusted relationships with our clients, responding to their requests, and executing trades and other operational duties.  As I transition to the research team, I am appreciative of Marietta’s investment in its people, and feel privileged to be part of a firm that encourages each team member’s individual growth.
My favorite part of my job is connecting with people.  Whether engaging colleagues in discussions of global markets, or conversing with clients about individual stock performance, I enjoy sharing ideas with people of varied backgrounds and perspectives. I am especially delighted when clients share stories about their lives and families with us; it shows they value their relationship with us beyond the “numbers.”
Outside of the office, I enjoy playing tennis, biking, and volunteering as a tutor for elementary school children at Our Next Generation Kids.  I’m also an avid traveler with a sweet spot for Scandinavia, which I first visited while studying abroad at Copenhagen Business School in Denmark.  A Twin Cities native, I remain a proud Minnesotan at heart, although most weekends you will find me with friends, cheering on the Badgers.

Mary T. Allmon, CFP®
Partner and Portfolio Manager
I began my career in investment management when I joined Marietta in 2005. My interest in business took root at an early age, when I helped my parents run our small, family-owned store.  Observing the strong relationships my parents built with our customers was an invaluable experience that continues to guide me at Marietta as I serve the needs of our diverse clientele.
I went on to study business organization and development at Marquette University, where I took great interest in researching how companies are structured and what drives economic successes and failures.  Today, I delight in identifying successful companies to invest in, sharing my analysis with our clients, and working together to create a customized portfolio suited to their individual needs.   Our dedication to client service distinguishes Marietta from other firms, and I find it immensely satisfying to help our clients achieve their financial goals.
I am invested in the long-term success of Milwaukee, and my hobbies and interests support my commitment to be a conscientious member of the community.  I enjoy exploring the city by bike and on foot, and am actively involved in Girls on the Run – Milwaukee and the Milwaukee Running Festival.  An avid reader, I devour nonfiction books, daily newspapers and weekly magazines, and challenge myself to learn something new each day.
