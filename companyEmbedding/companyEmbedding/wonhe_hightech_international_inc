	Exhibit 99.2



	 




	Letter
	from the Chairman of the Board of Directors






	 





	Dear
	investors:




	 




	It
	is with great pleasure to present annual report of WONHE Multimedia Commerce Ltd (hereinafter referred to as “Company”)
	for the financial year ended 31 December 2016 (

	FY16

	) and the Company’s strategic plan for the years ahead.




	 




	In
	FY16, the Company continued to position itself to capitalize on the expansion on the range of the WONHE router products and this
	strategy generated new opportunities and has provided growth in the Company’s business.




	 





	Significant
	growth in financial performance





	 




	Being
	the second year of its successful listing on ASX in FY15, FY16 has been another year of significant growth, achieving a total
	consolidated revenue and consolidated net profit after income tax of AU$66,165 million and AU$13,598 million respectively, which
	represent an increase of 199.19% (in revenue) and 227.45% (in net profit after income tax) against the 2015’s financial
	results.




	 








	●




	The
	Company’s year on year growth in earnings per share was 203.87% in FY16.










	●




	Year-on-year
	growth of net profit rate of assets was 64.43% in FY16.










	●




	Year-on-year
	growth of return on equity in FY16 was 85.20%;










	●




	Year-on-year
	growth of turnover rate of shareholders' equity was 112.08% in FY16.







	 







	Significant
	growth in sale and distribution in WONHE router products






	 




	The
	Company’s outstanding 2016 financial performance was principally driven by the significant increase in the sale and distribution
	of WONHE’s new commercial and home router products, which were released to the market in FY15, by Shenzhen WONHE Technology
	Co., Ltd (a Chinese Company) (“

	Shenzhen WONHE

	”), and the continuously solid performance of the WONHE Group’s
	home media center HMC-720 router products.




	 









	 





	 





	 




	Being
	the first full 12 months after release to the market, we saw the annualized sale (in quantity) of the WONHE Group’s YLT-100S
	type home router and YLT-300S type commercial router products grow by 109.24% and 242.46% respectively, generating a total revenue
	of AU$3.672 million and AU$27,321 million respectively and which collectively represented 46.85% of the annual sales revenue of
	the products sold by WOHNE Group for FY16.




	 




	The
	WONHE Group’s well-performed home media center HMC-720, which remained the main contributor of the WONHE Group’s total
	sales revenue, achieved AU$34.016 million in sales revenue, which represented 51.41% of the annual sales revenue of the products
	sold by WONHE Group and which reflected a growth of 6.93% against the 2015’s sales revenue generated from the home media
	center HMC-720.




	 





	New
	products development





	 




	Throughout
	FY16, the Company continued its research and development activity with a view to improving existing, and expanding new, WONHE
	router products.




	 




	Following
	on its success in the development of marketable router products (namely YLT-100S type home routers and YLT-300S type commercial
	routers commercial router products), in October 2016, the Company released a new model home router (YLT-300J) to the consumer
	market. The YLT-300J home router uses dual system storage, multi-port switching, with easy management of the APP side of the control
	platform, in order to improve home data storage.




	 




	For
	the first 3 months following its release, the WONHE YLT-300J home router products already generated AU$1.156 million in sales
	revenue, which represented 1.75% of the annual sales revenue from sale of the products sold by WONHE Group.




	 





	Beijing
	Wireless Network Agreement Amendments






	 





	As
	announced by the Company in January 2016, Shenzhen WONHE entered into a “Beijing Wireless Network Coverage Project”
	Agreement with Guangdong Kesheng Enterprise Co., Ltd on January 12, 2016. The Agreement contemplated that the parties would work
	together to develop a wireless network in certain designated areas in Beijing. The commercial purpose of the network was to provide
	a vehicle for advertising and marketing with revenue generated to be shared between the parties. Under the agreement, Shenzhen
	WONHE committed to provide RMB392,990,000 to the project, including RMB226,010,000 in cash and RMB118,980,000 in commercial routers
	and other equipment.




	 











	 



	2



	 







	 





	 




	In
	December 2016, the Company had agreed with Guangdong Kesheng Enterprise Co. Ltd to vary the agreement as follows:




	 








	●




	Shenzhen
	WONHE ceased to participate in the construction and operation of the wireless network,
	and its commitment to the development of the data system used for the network, while
	Shenzhen WONHE was released from its obligation to contribute capital in 2017 and 2018
	(as contemplated by the original agreement), and will no longer be entitled to fixed
	amount payments and/or profits distributions.






	 








	●




	Shenzhen
	WONHE will continue to supply 36,300 routers to Guangdong Kesheng at a unit price of
	RMB1,800 (AU$ 364.47) throughout the period ended December 2017.






	 








	●




	As
	of November 2016, Shenzhen WONHE had contributed, by way of cash payments, the supply
	of equipment and engineering construction services, and the network from a pilot in the
	Tongzhou District of Beijing, a total contribution valued at RMB175,755,641 (approx.
	AU$34.4 million) to the wireless network product under the agreement. Under the variation,
	the parties had agreed that Shenzhen WONHE’s total contribution of RMB175,755,641
	will be repaid to Shenzhen WONHE by Guangdong Kesheng, together with interests accruing
	at interest rate of 4.75% per annum from 1 December 2016, in three annual instalments
	with the first installment due on 31 December 2017.






	 




	The
	variation to the agreement was driven by a strategic direction of the Company to concentrate its efforts upon further development
	of its core business of supplying WONHE routers. The WONHE router’s strong sales performance and good financial results
	in FY16 confirmed the value of the Company’s core business of supplying routers and we are seeing the opportunities to further
	expand WONHE routers supply business.






	 








	Insight
	to the Group’s strategy






	 




	Looking
	ahead, the Company will concentrate on building a sustainable routers supply business, as well as considering other strategic
	opportunities in the future. Within the context of this strategic framework there are specific areas of focus for the WONHE Group
	– that will help ensure sustainable growth for the future. These include:




	 








	●




	Promotion,
	sale and distribution of Home Media Center equipment, Commercial Router and Domestic
	Router products in Chinese market;






	 








	●




	Continuous
	research and development of new WONHE product range and improvement of existing product
	range;






	 








	●




	Expansion
	of the distribution network of Home Media Center equipment, Commercial Router and Domestic
	Router products in other Provinces in China, such as Hainan Province, Fujian, Jiangsu,
	Zhejiang, Shandong, Hebei, Tianjin, Liaoning province.






	 




	We
	look forward to continuing along our success path together with you and thank you for your support.




	 




	Yours
	sincerely




	 





	Mr.
	Qing Tong






	Chairman
	of the Board of Directors

	ASX
	Announcement






	Successful
	development of new generation of router products and product performance






	 





	Wonhe
	Multimedia Commerce Limited (ASX: WMC) (“

	Company

	”) is pleased to provide the market with an update in relation
	to its activities.





	 






	Successful
	development of New Wireless Intelligent Communication Solution Router






	 





	The
	Company is pleased to introduce the next generation of its router products – Power WiFi routers, – engineered to meet
	the evolving demands of the next generation of wireless communications.




	 




	The
	current cable-based router products, which are designed to operate through network cable, can be functionally difficult to control
	and manage. With multiple cable connections, data communications can also be slow. The Power WiFi router is designed to take advantage
	of wireless networks to allow rapid flow of data between computer networks via WiFi signals, providing more efficient and effective
	intelligence communications. By eliminating the need of network cable, the Power WiFi router will provide an “easier to
	use and manage” solution for consumers and businesses.




	 




	The
	new Power WiFi router products will be released to the market in June 2017. Being a simpler and more efficient communications
	solutions, the Company believes that the new Power WiFi router products will be welcomed by the market, providing greater sales
	revenue for the WONHE Group and increasing the market share of WONHE’s router products.





	 






	Strong
	performance on YLT-300J router products





	 




	The
	Company is also pleased to announce that the WONHE Group’s new model YLT-300J home router products have continued with its
	strong sale performance since their release in October 2016.




	 




	The
	WONHE Group’s YLT-300J home router uses dual system storage, multi-port switching, with easy management of the APP side
	of the control platform, engineered to improve home data storage.




	 




	In
	the first 3 months following release, the WONHE YLT-300J home router products generated approximately AU$ 1.156 million in sales
	revenue, which represented 1.75% of the annual sales revenue from sale of the products sold by WONHE Group in the year ended 31
	December 2016.




	 












	The
	WONHE Group’s YLT-300J home router products have continued its strong sales performance in the first quarter of the 2017
	year, generating approximately AUD 2.68 million in sales revenue which represented a 132% increase from its sales revenue generated
	for the last quarter of 2016 year. The Company believes that the WONHE Group’s YLT-300J home router products will maintain
	a steady growth in sales in the remaining quarters of the 2017 year.




	 




	The
	WONHE Group continues to develop and innovate its router products with a view to maintaining a competitive advantage over the
	market in which it operates.




	 




	The
	WONHE Group’s technical director, Mr Gang XIONG, said “the WONHE Group believes that continued development and innovation
	of router products is crucial for the long term success of the business of the WONHE Group. The WONHE Group will continue to invest
	in product development and innovation in order to meet the market demand for intelligent products”.

Emily Leehan, a senior airman in the Air Force, stood at the altar at Quincy Cellars in New York on Saturday to marry Marine Sgt. Joshua Newville and recited separate vows to his son Gage. As she shared her meaningful words, her soon-to-be stepson became overwhelmed with emotion, welled up with tears and embraced her. "When she started reciting the vows, that's when the emotion took over and he lost it," Newville told ABC News.

Man arrested after stranding daughter in desert without shoes


An Arizona dad landed behind bars for allegedly stranding his 10-year-old daughter in the desert without shoes or water. Christopher Charles Watson, 28, of Kingman, was charged with felony domestic child abuse after the girl was found alone sobbing Saturday morning in 91-degree heat, according to news station KSNV. Authorities said that Watson and his daughter got into a fight so he decided to take her for a car ride to calm her down. He admitted to officers that he forced her out of the truck and left her shoeless in the desert. Police said that a passerby contacted 911 after she saw her crying and walking barefoot on asphalt and took the girl home. According to Watson, he drove home and waited

Street signs warning of 'easily startled' police posted around Twin Cities


Ruszczyk's death was the latest of several fatal officer-involved shootings in Minnesota. Philando Castile was shot and killed by a St. Anthony officer during a traffic stop in July 2016, sparking nationwide protests. Less than a year earlier, a Minneapolis officer fatally shot Jamar Clark after a scuffle with officers in front of an apartment building. Addy Free spotted the St. Paul sign at a busy intersection Sunday morning on his way home from work. He snapped a photo, which has since been shared over 18,000 times on Facebook. "I wish there weren't so much truth to the sign," Free said. "Police are given a challenging job, with not enough training to counter overreaction and implicit bias."

Obama Shut Down Scaramucci In The Most Presidential Way Possible


Anthony Scaramucci, the new communications director of President Donald Trump’s White House, once went head-to-head with President Barack Obama during a televised event on CNBC. And it didn’t go well for Scaramucci, who at the time was a hedge fund manager.  “I represent the Wall Street community, we have felt like a piñata,” Scaramucci said during the 2010 Q&A session, adding that investors felt like they’d been “whacked with a stick.” “I certainly think that Main Street and Wall Street are connected,” Scaramucci said. “And if we’re going to heal the society and make the economy better, how are we going to work towards that, healing Wall Street and Main Street?”  “I have been amused over the

The boy was screaming with 7 hours left to fly. Then she held out her hand.


She’s a shy Jewish woman from Charlotte. He’s a little boy, apparently African and Muslim, who was screaming aboard a transatlantic flight. Their July 14 encounter between Brussels and New York made the eight-hour flight go easier for their fellow passengers. The virtually wordless connection - neither spoke the others’ language - also offered a lesson in compassion that has circulated widely online. By her account, Rochel Groner, 33, is among the least likely people to make a public display. “I’m the type of person who would let somebody step on my foot for like a half- hour before I would say something,” she says.

This Illegal Hike in Hawaii Is Nicknamed the "Stairway to Heaven" For Good Reason


One of Hawaii's most epic hikes, known as the Haiku Stairs, is famous for its stunning views and illegal climb. Despite being a steep 3,922-step hike - and not to mention dangerous since becoming damaged by a storm in 2015 - the ladder remains a popular destination among hikers and visitors. The "Stairway to Heaven" is an appropriate nickname as some of the peaks even tower above the clouds and offer incredible sights of the island of Oahu below. The almost-vertical ladder, which reaches the top of Pu'u Keahi a Kahoe, has a height of over 2,500 feet. Although it was built in 1943 during World War II, it wasn't until 1987 when the Haiku Stairs was deemed off limits to the public. But according

The Best Marvel Cosplay From Comic-Con 2017


San Diego Comic-Con has expanded to be much more than a comics-focused event, but that doesn't mean comics don't still have a strong presence.

In the gallery above, you'll find a collection of photos showing some of the best Marvel cosplay from this year's show. We also have galleries featuring everything from the first-ever Doomfist cosplay based on Overwatch's upcoming character to an astoundingly wide array of fidget spinners.

'You have to talk to the unconverted': A handful of Democratic lawmakers are trying to break through on Fox News


Rep. Sean Patrick Maloney has observed a difference in reactions to his appearances on different cable television networks. "In my district, when I go on Rachel Maddow, I hear about it from my liberal friends," Maloney said. "When I go on Fox, I hear about it from everyone else." Since President Donald Trump's electoral victory in November, Maloney has been one of a handful of Democrats who are trying anew to win over potential voters by appearing on Fox News, the highly rated cable network that has long been shunned by many Democrats over its programming, which often leans to the right. But several younger members of Congress like Maloney and Rep. Eric Swalwell have made regular appearances

Jordan Spieth won The Open Championship after his caddie saved him from making a major mistake


Jordan Spieth went on an epic run on the final five holes to win the British Open on Sunday, but it might never have happened if not for his caddie saving the day on the wild 13th hole. At No. 13, Spieth hit his tee shot about 100 yards to the right of the fairway. After a nearly 15-minute delay, Spieth eventually decided to declare an unplayable lie and take a drop farther back on the practice range.
