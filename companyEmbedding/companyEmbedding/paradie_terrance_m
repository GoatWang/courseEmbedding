CLEVELAND, April 2, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- TransDigm Group Incorporated (the "Company") (NYSE:  TDG) today announced that it has hired Terrance Paradie as Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of TransDigm Group Incorporated.
Mr. Paradie was most recently Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer for Cliffs Natural Resources Inc. (NYSE:  CLF). Cliffs is an international mining company, headquartered in Cleveland, Ohio with annual revenues of approximately $5 billion. Terry has been at Cliffs since 2007. His prior responsibilities at Cliffs included Sr. Vice President/Corporate Controller and operating responsibility for two domestic iron ore mines. 
Prior to his tenure at Cliffs, Terry was a partner at KPMG LLP. During his 15 years at KPMG, Terry had a broad range of client responsibilities in audit, M&A, financial structuring and operational assistance across a broad range of industries. 
Terry is a 1991 graduate of the University of Windsor with a degree in Accounting and Finance as well as a Certified Public Accountant. He and his wife, Christine, and their 14 year old daughter live in Ashtabula, Ohio, a suburb of Cleveland. Terry will start with the Company around April 15, 2015.
After 15 years with the Company, Greg Rufus, our long term CFO, has announced his intention to retire in the fourth quarter of calendar year 2016. To ensure a smooth transition and transfer of TransDigm culture, Greg will work closely with Terry as he comes up to speed. Greg will also work with the Company's CEO to assist in managing TransDigm's continued growth, developing the next generation of management, and utilizing his skills and business judgement on various projects. 
W. Nicholas Howley, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, stated "Terry is a good fit with the TransDigm team. He has a broad range of public accounting, public reporting, internal control, financing, operations and M&A experience that we believe is important for the CFO of a lean decentralized business like TransDigm. He has worked his way through complicated financial and operational re-structuring issues at Cliffs Natural Resources. This has served to further his financial and operational skills. We are fortunate to have attracted a financial executive with the experience, skills and cultural fit that Terry brings to the Company."
Mr. Howley added, "Greg has been a significant contributor and a true partner in the success and growth of TransDigm over the last 15 years. He has been a major part of almost every key decision over that time. I can't thank him enough for his hard work and support as a key member of the senior executive team at TransDigm for most of our history as well as his substantial contribution to our value focused strategy, performance and culture."

Robert Stallard

Q 
Yeah. Have you seen any airlines maybe buying fewer spares, because of the foreign exchange pressures that they 
are dealing with?

Chairman & Chief Executive Officer 
A 
Well, we surely have seen some buying fewer spares obviously. If you see across the industry, I don't know that I 
can attribute it to that, I surely haven't heard anyone say that. 
...................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................... 
Robert Stallard 
RBC Capital Markets LLC 
Q 
Okay. Then, Terry, just a couple of quick ones for you. Can you reconfirm the interest guidance, I missed that? 
And also how does the PneuDraulics tax impact flow through over the next couple of years? Thank you. 
...................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................... 
Terrance M. Paradie 
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President 
A 
Yeah. So the interest guidance for the full year this year was $420 million and what we'll have, from a 
PneuDraulics standpoint is we will get a tax benefit of just over $100 million taken over the next 15 years, that 
won't impact the rate, it will impact our cash taxes. So from a GAAP standpoint, the tax rate will be sort of our 
normal effective rate, which right now is around 32%. We've lowered it for this year down to 31% because of 
discrete items but our normal rate's around 32% going forward. 
...................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................... 
Robert Stallard

Q 
Thanks so much.

Gautam J. Khanna 
Cowen & Co. LLC 
Q 
Okay, great. Last June and September, you had very strong aftermarket sales growth and was there anything 
looking back by region or by product that made the compare much tougher this time around? I mean, was there 
any geography that stood out when you looked back, and so maybe on a year-on-year basis that would explain 
some difference? 
...................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................... 
Nick Howley 
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer 
A 
Not that is obvious to me. It could be, but I don't recall it and I don't know the answer to that question, is the real 
answer. I would say the big spike ups in those two quarters came after probably a two or three quarter period 
where there was very low growth. Once again, that we and everybody in the industry were trying to figure out what

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
