Melville-based Henry Schein Inc. has elected a new member, Bradley T. Sheares, to its board of directors, the company said Monday.
Schein distributes health care products and services to dental, medical and veterinary offices.
Sheares most recently served as chief executive of Reliant Pharmaceuticals, Inc., leading that company as it was acquired by GlaxoSmithKline plc. in December 2007. 
Before heading Reliant he was president of the U.S. human health division of Merck & Co. from 2001-2006, the culmination of a 19-year career with that company. Sheares has served on the boards of Honeywell International, The Progressive Corp., IMS Health and Covance Inc.
"Clearly the medical landscape in the United States and around the world is quickly changing, with health care focusing more closely on disease prevention and wellness," Stanley M. Bergman, chairman and chief executive of Henry Schein, said in a statement. Sheares' "insights into these emerging developments will figure prominently as we position our company to take full advantage of new market opportunities . . ."

Henry Schein Elects Dr. Bradley T. Sheares to Board of Directors

By: HMT Mag   
Jan 25, 2010 58 0 



 




MELVILLE, N.Y., Jan. 25 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ — Henry Schein, Inc. (Nasdaq: HSIC), the largest distributor of health care products and services to office-based dental, medical and veterinary practitioners, today announced the election of Bradley T. Sheares, Ph.D. to the Company’s Board of Directors.  
Dr. Sheares brings a wealth of health care experience to the Henry Schein Board.  He most recently served as Chief Executive Officer of Reliant Pharmaceuticals, Inc., a pharmaceutical company with integrated sales, marketing and development expertise that marketed a portfolio of branded cardiovascular pharmaceutical products, leading that company from January 2007 through its acquisition by GlaxoSmithKline plc in December 2007.  Prior to joining Reliant, Dr. Sheares served as President of U.S. Human Health at Merck & Co. from March 2001 until July 2006, the culmination of a 19-year career with that company.  
In addition, Dr. Sheares brings extensive Board leadership experience from a wide range of public companies to Henry Schein.  He also serves as a director of Honeywell International, a diversified technology and manufacturing company; The Progressive Corporation, one of the nation’s largest insurance holding companies; IMS Health, the world’s leading provider of market intelligence to the pharmaceutical and health care industries; and Covance Inc., one of the world’s largest and most comprehensive drug development companies.
“We are delighted to welcome Dr. Sheares to the Henry Schein Board of Directors and look forward to the valuable new perspective that he will be able to share with us,” said Stanley M. Bergman, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer for Henry Schein. “Clearly the medical landscape in the United States and around the world is quickly changing, with health care focusing more closely on disease prevention and wellness.  Dr. Sheares’ insights into these emerging developments will figure prominently as we position our Company to take full advantage of new market opportunities and support our customers in the efficient and effective delivery of care to patients.”  
Dr. Sheares is the former chair of the Board of Directors of the National Pharmaceutical Council, which focuses on broadly communicating the economic, clinical and societal value of pharmaceuticals.  Dr. Sheares holds a bachelor’s degree in chemistry from Fisk University and earned his doctorate in biochemistry from Purdue University.  He completed his postdoctoral training as a Lucille P. Markey Scholar and National Institutes of Health Research Fellow at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
“It is a pleasure to join this distinguished Board and to be part of a company with such a rich history and promising future,” said Dr. Sheares. “Having met extensively with the senior leadership of Henry Schein, I have been impressed by the organization’s resolve to help physicians, dentists and veterinarians navigate this fast-changing health care landscape, as well as the Company’s values-based culture and high standards of corporate conduct.  I look forward to joining this strong team that will help Henry Schein continue its remarkable growth for many years to come.”
