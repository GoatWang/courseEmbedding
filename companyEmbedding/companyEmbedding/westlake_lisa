                           Using an exercise ball for strength and fitness may be a relatively new concept, but it's not just another exercise fad. The
                              ball has been used extensively in rehabilitation and physiotherapy for over 30 years, with phenomenal results. Now fitness
                              expert Lisa Westlake offers exercise buffs a simple, highly effective way to achieve a strong, defined physique using this
                              revolutionary fitness tool. Based on the concept that working out on the "wobbly" ball forces us to use extra muscles and
                              cultivate new skills, Westlake has developed over 90 innovative exercise techniques that will help readers achieve better
                              muscle tone and definition as well as a stronger, healthier, injury-free body. Great for elite athletes, regular gym-goers,
                              and determined beginners alike, Get on the Ball will show readers step-by-step how to use their exercise ball to achieve improved
                              health and appearance. This extensive step-by-step guide is illustrated throughout with 120 duotone photographs. - Publisher

                              "We understand this challenge and this is why we have created The Post Pregnancy Exercise DVD, which provides safe and effective
                                 workouts that you can do in the comfort of your own home. The DVD can be followed by all mums (for example new mums or mums
                                 with older children) and can be followed by someone with a basic or a more advanced level of fitness. Lisa Westlake is our
                                 incredible fitness instructor and postnatal exercise specialist throughout the DVD. With her extensive physiotherapy experience
                                 and qualifications (Lisa is one of the most awarded fitness professionals in Australia), Lisa is the perfect fitness instructor
                                 to bring The Healthy Mummy Post Pregnancy Exercise DVD to life - you will love working out with her. The exercises in the
                                 DVD are effective and safe and Lisa will guide you through each of the workouts. As well as assisting in the improvement of
                                 your overall fitness levels, the workouts in the DVD will also help in the burning of calories, the improvement of your core
                                 strength and the strengthening of your pelvic floor. The six workouts are broken down into 10 and 15 minute sections that
                                 you can do when it suits you - or if you have the time and energy you can do the DVD as one 70 minute continuous workout.
                                 The DVD also covers special considerations post-birth, such as caesarean sections, back strains, muscle separation, incontinence
                                 and pelvic floor issues"--Publisher's website
