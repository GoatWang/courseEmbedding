Through its core programs, the nonprofit has provided financial dignity and economic empowerment to over 2.6 million individuals worldwide, and $2 billion in economic activity for the disenfranchised—turning check cashing customers into banking customers, renters into homeowners, small business dreamers into small business owners, and minimum wage workers into living wage consumers.

2010 Wall Street Journal CEO Council Annual Meeting

                  Wall Street Journal’s annual CEO Council meeting released specific priorities that both government and business must address to restore global growth and to increase public confidence in business. The plans voted by CEO Council members as the top two priorities each focused on job creation – leading with a call to foster global trade, followed by a call for the president to encourage a competitive business environment and be an advocate for business in general. The CEO Council worked together in task force sessions charged with identifying and ranking the most urgent priorities.  Leading subject-matter experts provided key perspectives and information for the discussion, which focused on five key topics: fresh approaches to energy and the environment, the future of global finance, creating sustainable jobs, restoring confidence in business and next step for healthcare.
