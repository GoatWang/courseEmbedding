The concept is truly applicable in some niches such as electronics and mobile handsets.Two companies which stand apart from the crowd when we talk about the product concept are Apple and google. Both of these companies have strived hard on their products and deliver us feature rich, innovative and diverse application products and people just love these brands.One problem which has been associated with the product concept is that it might also lead to marketing myopia. Thus companies need to take innovations and features seriously and provide only those which the customer needs. The customer needs should be given priority.In the past several of Microsofts product have been brought under the hammer with people feeling more and more disgruntled with the operating systems because of lack of innovation and new features. Each microsoft operating system appears almost similar with just few tweaks.   On the other hand, innovating too soon becomes a problem. Several innovative products are marked as experimental in the market instead of being adopted as a result of which these products have less shelf life and might have to be taken off the market.Thus companies following the product concept need to concentrate on their technology such that they provide with excellent feature rich and innovative products for optimum customer satisfaction.Also read – Company orientation towards the marketplace Share25 Share2 Tweet +12Related Posts:Advertising theoryAdverse SelectionAdoption theory – Theory of product adoptionCustomer perceived valueBehavioral Decision Theory – A consumer behavior theoryAdaptation level theoryAdaptation of product or Product adaptationAbout Hitesh BhasinI love writing about the latest in marketing and advertising.

The USPTO makes this data available for search by the public so that individuals can locate ownership information for intellectual property, much the same way a county might make real estate property ownership information available.
Since our website is synchronized with the USPTO data, we recommend making any data changes with the USPTO directly. Our website will auto-update when the USPTO data is updated.
You may also contact Trademarkia to make a request for the removal of your personally identifiable information or trademark data.  Such requests must be made in writing and will be subject to verification of ownership.  This policy allows verified trademark owners to specify: (A) that their identifiable information be masked, or (B) that their trademark pages permanently deleted from Trademarkia.com.  
                                                Requests may be made directly to customer.service@trademarkia.com and every effort will be made to honor them within 48 hours.
