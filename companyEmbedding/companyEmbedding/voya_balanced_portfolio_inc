1The Adviser has contractually agreed to limit expenses of the Portfolio. This expense limitation agreement excludes interest, taxes, investment-related costs, leverage expenses, and extraordinary expenses and may be subject to possible recoupment. Please see the Portfolio's prospectus for more information.
					

2The Adviser has contractually agreed to waive a portion of the management fee through May 1, 2018.
					


The performance quoted represents past performance and does not guarantee future results. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance information shown. The investment return and principal value of an investment in the Portfolio will fluctuate, so that your shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. See above “Average Annual Total Returns %” for performance information current to the most recent month-end. Returns for the other share classes will vary due to different charges and expenses. Performance assumes reinvestment of distributions and does not account for taxes.Total investment return at net asset value has been calculated assuming a purchase at net asset value at the beginning of the period and a sale at net asset value at the end of the period; and assumes reinvestment of dividends, capital gain distributions and return of capital distributions/allocations, if any, in accordance with the provisions of the dividend reinvestment plan. Net asset value equals total Fund assets net of Fund expenses such as operating costs and management fees. Total investment return at net asset value is not annualized for periods less than one year.



Benchmark Disclosures

S&P Target Risk Growth Index
The Standard and Poor's ("S&P") Target Risk Growth Index is a broad-based index that seeks to measure the performance of an asset allocation strategy targeted to a growth-focused risk profile. The index is fully investable, with varying levels of exposure to equities and fixed-income through a family of exchange-traded funds. The index offers increased exposure to equities, while also using some fixed-income exposure to diversify risk. The index returns include the reinvestment of dividends and distributions net of withholding taxes, but do not reflect fees, brokerage commissions, or other expenses. Investors cannot directly invest in an index.




Principal Risks
All investing involves risks of fluctuating prices and the uncertainties of rates of return and yield inherent in investing. Securities of Mid-Sized Companies may entail greater volatility and less liquidity than larger companies. Convertible Securities with longer maturities tend to be more sensitive to changes in interest rates, usually making them more volatile than convertible securities with shorter maturities. Foreign Investing does pose special risks including currency fluctuation, economic and political risks not found in investments that are solely domestic. The Portfolio may use Derivatives, such as options and futures, which can be illiquid, may disproportionately increase losses and have a potentially large impact on Portfolio performance. High-Yield Securities, or “junk bonds”, are rated lower than investment-grade bonds because there is a greater possibility that the issuer may be unable to make interest and principal payments on those securities. To the extent that the Portfolio invests in Mortgage-Related Securities, its exposure to prepayment and extension risks may be greater than investments in other fixed-income securities. The Portfolio may use Derivatives, such as options and futures, which can be illiquid, may disproportionately increase losses and have a potentially large impact on Portfolio performance. Foreign Investing does pose special risks including currency fluctuation, economic and political risks not found in investments that are solely domestic. As Interest Rates rise, bond prices fall, reducing the value of the Portfolio’s share price. Other risks of the Portfolio include but are not limited to: Market Trends Risks; Other Investment Companies Risks; Price Volatility Risks; Securities Lending Risks; Portfolio Turnover Risks; Credit Risks; Extension Risks; Investment Models Risks; Municipal Securities Risks; Other Investment Companies Risks; Prepayment Risks; Price Volatility Risks; U.S. Government Securities and Obligations Risks; Inability to Sell Securities Risks; Portfolio Turnover Risks; and Securities Lending Risks. Investors should consult the Portfolio’s Prospectus and Statement of Additional Information for a more detailed discussion of the Portfolio’s risks.

nPrice to Cash Flow
The ratio of a stock's price to its cash flow per share. The price-to-cash flow ratio is an indicator of a stock's valuation.

nWeighted Average Market Capitalization
The value of a corporation as determined by the market price of its issues and outstanding common stock.


nR2
The proportion of the variation in a portfolio's returns that can be explained by the variability of the returns of an index. High R-squared (close to 1.0) is usually consistent with broad diversification.


nBeta
The sensitivity of a portfolio's returns to changes in the return of the market as measured by the index or benchmark that represents the market. A portfolio with a beta of 1.0 behaves exactly like the index. A beta less than 1.0 suggests lower risk than the index, while a beta greater than 1.0 indicates a risk level higher than the index.


nStandardDeviation
A measure of the degree to which an individual probability value varies from the distribution mean. The higher the number, the greater the risk.

nTrackingErr
A measure of how closely the returns of a portfolio tend to follow the returns of the index to which it is benchmarked; specifically, the variability of excess returns around the average.


nAlpha
A measure of risk-adjusted performance; alpha reflects the difference between a portfolio's actual return and the return that could be expected give its risk as measured by beta.
