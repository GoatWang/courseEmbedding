Bright Future
HELPING KIDS REACH THEIR FULL POTENTIAL FOR MORE THAN 100 YEARS













 
Since our founding, we’ve had a commitment for more than just making great products – we’ve helped children in need. Beginning with the creation of the Milton Hershey School in 1909, we have been dedicated to giving children from disadvantaged communities the skills, education and support they need to build bright futures and lead more successful lives. We’ve learned that children make the most of their education when they have energy and nourishment, allowing them to focus on their studies, rather than their stomachs. And we believe bright futures start with basic nutrition.

MILTON HERSHEY'S LEGACY HELPS 2,000 KIDS THRIVE AS ONGOING BENEFICIARIES OF THE HERSHEY COMPANY'S SUCCESS









Milton Hershey School (MHS), founded in 1909 as a school for orphan boys, is a product of the love Milton Hershey and his wife, Catherine, shared for children. Unable to have children of their own, the couple developed a profound and deeply felt concern for the well-being of all children, especially those less fortunate. Wanting their good fortune to make a lasting positive difference, Milton and Catherine Hershey decided to found the School and fund its operations.
Following the death of his wife, Mr. Hershey donated virtually his entire personal fortune to The Hershey Trust Company to administer Milton Hershey School. The Hershey Trust Company is the largest shareholder, making the school the largest beneficiary of The Hershey Company. Today, Milton Hershey School is a coeducational home and school that is true to its ideals and remains focused on helping children. The school provides a free world-class education, as well as meals, clothing, a nurturing home, health care, counseling and career training, to over 2,000 children in social and financial need.
The Hershey Company is proud to help the school continue to grow, not only by building our business but also through direct partnerships with students and houseparents. Various departments and plants host career days and tours, and many Milton Hershey School students work in internships at The Hershey Company. Through our "Project Fellowship" program, groups of employees pair up with student homes for mutually fulfilling and fun ongoing relationships. Project Fellowship involves employees from our U.S. and international locations at many levels, bringing a global experience and strong role models to Milton Hershey School students.

History[edit]
On April 28, 1905, the Pennsylvania Department of State issued a charter creating the Hershey Trust Company.[3] In 1909, when Hershey founded the Milton Hershey School, Hershey appointed the Trust as administrator of the school trust.
2011 investigation of the Hershey Trust Company[edit]
In February 2011, Robert Reese, a former board member and president of the Trust, filed a lawsuit against the Hershey Trust Company alleging that Trust had been improperly using the Trust's money.[4] One particular issue was the purchase of the Wren Dale Golf Course, in which the Hershey Trust overpaid for the property, to the benefit of board members who were both owners of the Wren Dale Golf Course and on the Hershey Trust board.[5][6] Reese withdrew the lawsuit in April 2011, due to deteriorating health. Reese suggested the Pennsylvania Attorney General had enough cause to investigate the Hershey Trust.[7]
In 2013, Kathleen Kane, the Pennsylvania Attorney General, announced the conclusion of a two-year investigation into the operations of the Hershey Trust Company, in which the Office of Attorney General and the Hershey Trust Company agreed that there was a finding of no wrongdoing, but reforms were required of the trust company.[8][9]
2016 developments[edit]
In May, 2016, the state attorney general asked the company to remove three members from the ten-person board. The attorney general said that the three had allowed "apparent violations" of the 2013 agreement. At about the same time, in an unrelated investigation, John Estey, former chief of staff to Gov. Ed Rendell and a high-ranking executive of the company was charged with wire fraud, having pocketed $13,000 that an FBI sting operation had given to him in an investigation into illegal lobbying of legislators.[1][10]

Early years[edit]
After an apprenticeship to a confectioner in 1873, Milton S. Hershey founded a candy shop in Philadelphia. This candy shop was only open for six years, after which Hershey apprenticed with another confectioner in Denver, where he learned to make caramel.[7] After another failed business attempt in New York, Hershey returned to Pennsylvania, where in 1886 he founded the Lancaster Caramel Company. The use of fresh milk in caramels proved successful,[8] and in 1900, after seeing chocolate-making machines for the first time at the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago, Hershey sold his caramel company for $1,000,000[8] (equal to $28,788,000 today), and began to concentrate on chocolate manufacturing, stating to people who questioned him, "Caramels are just a fad, but chocolate is a permanent thing."
In 1896, Milton built a milk-processing plant so he could create and refine a recipe for milk chocolate candies. In 1899, he developed the Hershey process, which is less sensitive to milk quality than traditional methods. In 1900, he began manufacturing Hershey's Milk Chocolate Bars, also called Hershey's Bars or Hershey Bars.

Hershey, Pennsylvania[edit]
In 1903, Hershey began construction of a chocolate plant in his hometown of Derry Church, Pennsylvania, which later came to be known as Hershey, Pennsylvania.[8] The town was an inexpensive place for the workers and their families to live. Milton treated the people well and provided leisure activities to make sure the citizens enjoyed themselves. The milk chocolate bars manufactured at this plant proved popular, and the company grew rapidly.
Hershey's Kisses[edit]
In 1907, he introduced a new candy, bite-sized, flat-bottomed, conical-shaped pieces of chocolate that he named "Hershey's Kiss". Initially, they were individually wrapped by hand in squares of aluminum foil, and the introduction of machine wrapping in 1921 simplified the process while adding the small paper ribbon to the top of the package to indicate that it was a genuine Hershey product.[8] Today, 80 million of the candies are produced each day. Other products introduced included Mr. Goodbar (1925), containing peanuts in milk chocolate, Hershey's Syrup (1926), semisweet chocolate chips (1928), and the Krackel bar containing crisped rice (1938).
Labor troubles[edit]
Labor unrest came to Hershey in the late 1930s as a Congress of Industrial Organizations-backed union attempted to organize the factory workers. A failed sit-down strike in 1937 ended in violence, as loyalist workers and local dairy farmers beat many of the strikers as they attempted to leave the plant. By 1940, an affiliate of the American Federation of Labor had successfully organized Hershey's workers under the leadership of John Shearer, who became the first president of Local Chapter Number 464 of the Bakery, Confectionery, Tobacco Workers and Grain Millers' International Union. Local 464 still represents the Hershey workforce.
M&M's[edit]
Shortly before World War II, Bruce Murrie, son of long-time Hershey's president William F.R. Murrie, struck a deal with Forrest Mars to create a hard sugar-coated chocolate that would be called M&M's (for Mars and Murrie). Murrie had 20% interest in the confection, which used Hershey chocolate during the rationing era during World War 2. In 1948, Mars bought out Murrie's interest and became one of Hershey's main competitors.[9]
21st century[edit]
In April 2006, the Chocolate Manufacturers Association in the United States, whose members include Hershey, Nestlé, and Archer Daniels Midland, lobbied the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to change the legal definition of chocolate to let them substitute partially hydrogenated vegetable oils for cocoa butter in addition to using artificial sweeteners and milk substitutes.[10] Currently, the Food and Drug Administration does not allow a product to be called "chocolate" if the product contains any of these ingredients.[11][12]
In June 2006, Philadelphia city councilman Juan Ramos called for Hershey's to stop marketing "Ice Breakers Pacs", a kind of mint, due to the resemblance of its packaging to a kind that was used for illegal street drugs.[13]
In September 2006, ABC News reported that several Hershey chocolate products were reformulated to replace cocoa butter with vegetable oil as an emulsifier. According to the company, this change was made to reduce the costs of producing the products instead of raising their prices or decreasing the sizes. Some consumers complained that the taste was different, but the company stated that in the company-sponsored blind taste tests, about half of consumers preferred the new versions. As the new versions no longer met the Food and Drug Administration's official definition of "milk chocolate", the changed items were relabeled from stating they were "milk chocolate" and "made with chocolate" to "chocolate candy" and "chocolaty."[14]
In April 2014, the Hershey chocolate plant on East Chocolate Avenue in Hershey Pennsylvania was demolished to make way for mixed-use development.[15]
A 2016 attempt to sell Hershey to Mondelez International was scuttled because of objections by the Hershey Trust.[16]
Reese's Peanut Butter Cups[edit]
Harry Burnett Reese worked at Hershey, beginning in 1917, as a dairyman for the Hershey Farms. In 1921, he went to work in the factory, and by 1925, he had developed an assortment of candies which he sold to department stores in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, advertised as "made in Hershey". In 1926, he built his own factory, and in 1941, with the wartime rationing of sugar, Reese focused all of his production resources on his own confectionery specialty, Reese's Peanut Butter Cups, which required less sugar than most other confections of the time. In 1956, Reese died, leaving the company to his six sons. In June 1963, Hershey Chocolate Corporation acquired Reese's company for $23.3 million at a time when Reese's sales were $14 million annually.[17]
Cadbury's[edit]
In 1988, Hershey's acquired the rights to manufacture and distribute many Cadbury-branded products in the United States (except gum and mints, which are part of Mondelēz International). In 2015, they sued a British importer to halt imports of British Cadbury chocolate, angering consumers.[18][19]
Krave Jerky[edit]
In 2005, Krave Jerky was founded by Jon Sebastiani after he trained for a marathon and looked for a healthy source of energy.[20] Alliance Consumer Growth, a private equity group, invested in Krave Jerky in 2012.[21] Hershey's purchased the company in 2015 for $240 million.[22] In February and April 2007, Hershey's announced that their Smiths Falls[23][24] and Oakdale[25][26] plants would close in 2008, being replaced in part by a new facility in Monterrey, Mexico. The Oakdale factory closed on February 1, 2008.[27] Hershey chocolate factory in São Roque, Brazil, was opened in August 2002.
Hershey also has plants in Stuarts Draft, Virginia; Lancaster, Pennsylvania; Hazleton, Pennsylvania; Memphis, Tennessee; Robinson, Illinois, and Guadalajara, Mexico.
Visitors to Hershey can experience Hershey's Chocolate World visitors center and its simulated tour ride. Public tours were once operated in the Pennsylvania and California factories, which ended in Pennsylvania in 1973 as soon as Hershey's Chocolate World opened,[28] and later in California following the September 11, 2001, attacks, due to security concerns.[26]
On September 18, 2012, Hershey opened a new and expanded West Hershey plant. The plant was completed at a budget of $300 million.[29]
Other sales and acquisitions[edit]
In 1969, Hershey received a license from Rowntree's to manufacture and market Kit Kat and Rolo in the United States. As of September 2013, Hershey continued to make and market these brands in the U.S. under license from Nestlé, owners of the Rowntree brand. That license would be revoked and revert to Nestlé if Hershey is sold.[16] In 1977, Hershey acquired Y&S Candies, founded in 1845, and became the makers of Twizzlers licorice candies. In 1986, Hershey's began a brief foray into cough drops when it acquired the Luden's cough drops brand. By 2001, though, the brand had been sold to Pharmacia (now part of Pfizer),[30] and Luden's eventually became a product of Prestige Brands.[31] Hershey's kept Luden's 5th Avenue bar. In 1988, Hershey's acquired the rights to manufacture and distribute many Cadbury-branded products in the United States (except gum and mints, which are part of Mondelēz International). In 1996, Hershey purchased the American operations of the Leaf Candy Company from Huhtamäki.
In 1999, the Hershey Pasta Group was divested to several equity partners to form the New World Pasta company (now part of Ebro Foods).
On July 25, 2002, it became public knowledge that the Hershey Trust Company was seeking to sell its controlling interest in the Hershey Foods Corporation. The value of Hershey stock skyrocketed 25% with over 19 million shares trading that day. Over the following 55 days, widespread press coverage, as well as pressure from Pennsylvania Attorney General Mike Fisher, the community of Hershey, and Dauphin County Orphans' Court Senior Judge Warren G. Morgan, led to the sale being abandoned. The seven Hershey trustees who voted to sell Hershey Foods on September 17, 2002, for US$12.5 billion to the William Wrigley Jr. Company (now part of Mars Incorporated) were removed by Attorney General Fisher and Judge Morgan.[32] Ten of the 17 trustees were forced to resign and four new members who lived locally were appointed. The former Pennsylvania Attorney General, LeRoy S. Zimmerman, became the new chairman of the reconstituted Milton Hershey School Trustees. Mr. Zimmerman has publicly committed to having the Milton Hershey School Trust always retain its interest in The Hershey Company. If Hershey was to be sold, the rights to make and market Kit Kat and Rolo products in the U.S. would have reverted to Nestlé.
In December 2004, Hershey acquired the Mauna Loa Macadamia Nut Corp. from The Shansby Group.[33]
In July 2005, Hershey acquired the Berkeley, California-based boutique chocolate-maker Scharffen Berger.[34] In November 2005, Hershey acquired Joseph Schmidt Confections, the San Francisco-based chocolatier, and in November 2006, Hershey acquired Dagoba Organic Chocolate, a boutique chocolate maker based in Ashland, Oregon.
In December 2011, Hershey reached an agreement to acquire Brookside Foods Ltd., a privately held confectionery company based in Abbotsford, British Columbia.[35]
In 2015, Hershey announced that they had acquired Krave Jerky, marking the company's first foray outside of the confectionery market in more than a decade.[36]
In 2016, Hershey acquired barkTHINS, a New York-based chocolate snack foods company which expected to generate between $65 million and $75 million in revenue for that year, for $290 million.[37][38]
Hershey's chocolate is available across the United States, due to their wide network of distribution.[39] They have three mega distribution centers, with modern technology and labor management systems.[40]
Product recalls[edit]

In November 2006, the Smiths Falls production plant in Ontario temporarily shut down and several products were voluntarily recalled after concerns over Salmonella contamination possibly found in soy lecithin within their production line. It is believed that most of the products involved in the recall never made it to the retail level.[41][42]
In July 1998, a number of 100 g (3.5 oz) milk chocolate bars being sold for fundraising events were recalled because they may have contained traces of almonds not listed in the ingredients.[43]

Philanthropy[edit]
Hershey has made large contributions to education. One of their most notable contributions was the Elizabethtown College Honors Program.[44] The program was established in 1999 and is funded partially through the endowment.
In 2015, Hershey announced a commitment with Clinton Global Initiative to help build a sustainable supply chain to support basic nutrition for children in Ghana.[45]
Criticism[edit]
Cocoa purchase[edit]
Hershey has been criticized for not having programs to ensure sustainable and ethical cocoa purchase, lagging behind its competitors in fair trade measures.[46] Regarding Hershey's corporate practices, the Global Exchange report comments that:

Hershey has no policies in place to purchase cocoa that has been produced without the use of labor exploitation, and the company has consistently refused to provide public information about its cocoa sources. Additionally, Hershey has made no move to shift to third-party certification for the cocoa that it sources from West Africa. No information is available from Hershey about how the money it has invested in various programs in West Africa has actually impacted reductions in forced, trafficked, and child labor among the suppliers of its cocoa. Finally, Hershey's efforts to further cut costs in its cocoa production has led to a reduction in good jobs in the United States.[47]

The "Raise the Bar, Hershey!" campaign was launched in September 2010 by Global Exchange, Green America. the Oasis Trust, and the International Labor Rights Forum. The purpose of the Raise the Bar Campaign is to pressure Hershey to commit "to take immediate action to eliminate forced and child labor … from Hershey's cocoa supply"; "to sourcing 100% Fair Trade Certified™ cocoa beans by 2012 for at least one of its top five selling chocolate bars … making at least one additional top five selling bar 100% Fair Trade Certified™ every two years thereafter"; and that "the majority of Hershey's cocoa across all products will be Fair Trade Certified™ by 2022." Pressure was particularly directed at Whole Foods Market, which announced on October 3, 2012 that it would cease carrying Hershey's Scharffen Berger line.[48] The Campaign stated that "Whole Foods’ decision follows more than 40 natural food retailers and coops publicly expressing concern about carrying Scharffen Berger and Dagoba products as a consequence of the giant chocolate maker's refusal to address child labor in its supply chain."[48] The same day, Hershey's announced, "it will source 100 percent certified cocoa for its global chocolate product lines by 2020 and accelerate its programs to help eliminate child labor in the cocoa regions of West Africa."[49]

History[edit]

Early years[edit]
After an apprenticeship to a confectioner in 1873, Milton S. Hershey founded a candy shop in Philadelphia. This candy shop was only open for six years, after which Hershey apprenticed with another confectioner in Denver, where he learned to make caramel.[7] After another failed business attempt in New York, Hershey returned to Pennsylvania, where in 1886 he founded the Lancaster Caramel Company. The use of fresh milk in caramels proved successful,[8] and in 1900, after seeing chocolate-making machines for the first time at the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago, Hershey sold his caramel company for $1,000,000[8] (equal to $28,788,000 today), and began to concentrate on chocolate manufacturing, stating to people who questioned him, "Caramels are just a fad, but chocolate is a permanent thing."
In 1896, Milton built a milk-processing plant so he could create and refine a recipe for milk chocolate candies. In 1899, he developed the Hershey process, which is less sensitive to milk quality than traditional methods. In 1900, he began manufacturing Hershey's Milk Chocolate Bars, also called Hershey's Bars or Hershey Bars.

Hershey, Pennsylvania[edit]
In 1903, Hershey began construction of a chocolate plant in his hometown of Derry Church, Pennsylvania, which later came to be known as Hershey, Pennsylvania.[8] The town was an inexpensive place for the workers and their families to live. Milton treated the people well and provided leisure activities to make sure the citizens enjoyed themselves. The milk chocolate bars manufactured at this plant proved popular, and the company grew rapidly.
Hershey's Kisses[edit]
In 1907, he introduced a new candy, bite-sized, flat-bottomed, conical-shaped pieces of chocolate that he named "Hershey's Kiss". Initially, they were individually wrapped by hand in squares of aluminum foil, and the introduction of machine wrapping in 1921 simplified the process while adding the small paper ribbon to the top of the package to indicate that it was a genuine Hershey product.[8] Today, 80 million of the candies are produced each day. Other products introduced included Mr. Goodbar (1925), containing peanuts in milk chocolate, Hershey's Syrup (1926), semisweet chocolate chips (1928), and the Krackel bar containing crisped rice (1938).
Labor troubles[edit]
Labor unrest came to Hershey in the late 1930s as a Congress of Industrial Organizations-backed union attempted to organize the factory workers. A failed sit-down strike in 1937 ended in violence, as loyalist workers and local dairy farmers beat many of the strikers as they attempted to leave the plant. By 1940, an affiliate of the American Federation of Labor had successfully organized Hershey's workers under the leadership of John Shearer, who became the first president of Local Chapter Number 464 of the Bakery, Confectionery, Tobacco Workers and Grain Millers' International Union. Local 464 still represents the Hershey workforce.
M&M's[edit]
Shortly before World War II, Bruce Murrie, son of long-time Hershey's president William F.R. Murrie, struck a deal with Forrest Mars to create a hard sugar-coated chocolate that would be called M&M's (for Mars and Murrie). Murrie had 20% interest in the confection, which used Hershey chocolate during the rationing era during World War 2. In 1948, Mars bought out Murrie's interest and became one of Hershey's main competitors.[9]
21st century[edit]
In April 2006, the Chocolate Manufacturers Association in the United States, whose members include Hershey, Nestlé, and Archer Daniels Midland, lobbied the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to change the legal definition of chocolate to let them substitute partially hydrogenated vegetable oils for cocoa butter in addition to using artificial sweeteners and milk substitutes.[10] Currently, the Food and Drug Administration does not allow a product to be called "chocolate" if the product contains any of these ingredients.[11][12]
In June 2006, Philadelphia city councilman Juan Ramos called for Hershey's to stop marketing "Ice Breakers Pacs", a kind of mint, due to the resemblance of its packaging to a kind that was used for illegal street drugs.[13]
In September 2006, ABC News reported that several Hershey chocolate products were reformulated to replace cocoa butter with vegetable oil as an emulsifier. According to the company, this change was made to reduce the costs of producing the products instead of raising their prices or decreasing the sizes. Some consumers complained that the taste was different, but the company stated that in the company-sponsored blind taste tests, about half of consumers preferred the new versions. As the new versions no longer met the Food and Drug Administration's official definition of "milk chocolate", the changed items were relabeled from stating they were "milk chocolate" and "made with chocolate" to "chocolate candy" and "chocolaty."[14]
In April 2014, the Hershey chocolate plant on East Chocolate Avenue in Hershey Pennsylvania was demolished to make way for mixed-use development.[15]
A 2016 attempt to sell Hershey to Mondelez International was scuttled because of objections by the Hershey Trust.[16]
Reese's Peanut Butter Cups[edit]
Harry Burnett Reese worked at Hershey, beginning in 1917, as a dairyman for the Hershey Farms. In 1921, he went to work in the factory, and by 1925, he had developed an assortment of candies which he sold to department stores in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, advertised as "made in Hershey". In 1926, he built his own factory, and in 1941, with the wartime rationing of sugar, Reese focused all of his production resources on his own confectionery specialty, Reese's Peanut Butter Cups, which required less sugar than most other confections of the time. In 1956, Reese died, leaving the company to his six sons. In June 1963, Hershey Chocolate Corporation acquired Reese's company for $23.3 million at a time when Reese's sales were $14 million annually.[17]
Cadbury's[edit]
In 1988, Hershey's acquired the rights to manufacture and distribute many Cadbury-branded products in the United States (except gum and mints, which are part of Mondelēz International). In 2015, they sued a British importer to halt imports of British Cadbury chocolate, angering consumers.[18][19]
Krave Jerky[edit]
In 2005, Krave Jerky was founded by Jon Sebastiani after he trained for a marathon and looked for a healthy source of energy.[20] Alliance Consumer Growth, a private equity group, invested in Krave Jerky in 2012.[21] Hershey's purchased the company in 2015 for $240 million.[22] In February and April 2007, Hershey's announced that their Smiths Falls[23][24] and Oakdale[25][26] plants would close in 2008, being replaced in part by a new facility in Monterrey, Mexico. The Oakdale factory closed on February 1, 2008.[27] Hershey chocolate factory in São Roque, Brazil, was opened in August 2002.
Hershey also has plants in Stuarts Draft, Virginia; Lancaster, Pennsylvania; Hazleton, Pennsylvania; Memphis, Tennessee; Robinson, Illinois, and Guadalajara, Mexico.
Visitors to Hershey can experience Hershey's Chocolate World visitors center and its simulated tour ride. Public tours were once operated in the Pennsylvania and California factories, which ended in Pennsylvania in 1973 as soon as Hershey's Chocolate World opened,[28] and later in California following the September 11, 2001, attacks, due to security concerns.[26]
On September 18, 2012, Hershey opened a new and expanded West Hershey plant. The plant was completed at a budget of $300 million.[29]
Other sales and acquisitions[edit]
In 1969, Hershey received a license from Rowntree's to manufacture and market Kit Kat and Rolo in the United States. As of September 2013, Hershey continued to make and market these brands in the U.S. under license from Nestlé, owners of the Rowntree brand. That license would be revoked and revert to Nestlé if Hershey is sold.[16] In 1977, Hershey acquired Y&S Candies, founded in 1845, and became the makers of Twizzlers licorice candies. In 1986, Hershey's began a brief foray into cough drops when it acquired the Luden's cough drops brand. By 2001, though, the brand had been sold to Pharmacia (now part of Pfizer),[30] and Luden's eventually became a product of Prestige Brands.[31] Hershey's kept Luden's 5th Avenue bar. In 1988, Hershey's acquired the rights to manufacture and distribute many Cadbury-branded products in the United States (except gum and mints, which are part of Mondelēz International). In 1996, Hershey purchased the American operations of the Leaf Candy Company from Huhtamäki.
In 1999, the Hershey Pasta Group was divested to several equity partners to form the New World Pasta company (now part of Ebro Foods).
On July 25, 2002, it became public knowledge that the Hershey Trust Company was seeking to sell its controlling interest in the Hershey Foods Corporation. The value of Hershey stock skyrocketed 25% with over 19 million shares trading that day. Over the following 55 days, widespread press coverage, as well as pressure from Pennsylvania Attorney General Mike Fisher, the community of Hershey, and Dauphin County Orphans' Court Senior Judge Warren G. Morgan, led to the sale being abandoned. The seven Hershey trustees who voted to sell Hershey Foods on September 17, 2002, for US$12.5 billion to the William Wrigley Jr. Company (now part of Mars Incorporated) were removed by Attorney General Fisher and Judge Morgan.[32] Ten of the 17 trustees were forced to resign and four new members who lived locally were appointed. The former Pennsylvania Attorney General, LeRoy S. Zimmerman, became the new chairman of the reconstituted Milton Hershey School Trustees. Mr. Zimmerman has publicly committed to having the Milton Hershey School Trust always retain its interest in The Hershey Company. If Hershey was to be sold, the rights to make and market Kit Kat and Rolo products in the U.S. would have reverted to Nestlé.
In December 2004, Hershey acquired the Mauna Loa Macadamia Nut Corp. from The Shansby Group.[33]
In July 2005, Hershey acquired the Berkeley, California-based boutique chocolate-maker Scharffen Berger.[34] In November 2005, Hershey acquired Joseph Schmidt Confections, the San Francisco-based chocolatier, and in November 2006, Hershey acquired Dagoba Organic Chocolate, a boutique chocolate maker based in Ashland, Oregon.
In December 2011, Hershey reached an agreement to acquire Brookside Foods Ltd., a privately held confectionery company based in Abbotsford, British Columbia.[35]
In 2015, Hershey announced that they had acquired Krave Jerky, marking the company's first foray outside of the confectionery market in more than a decade.[36]
In 2016, Hershey acquired barkTHINS, a New York-based chocolate snack foods company which expected to generate between $65 million and $75 million in revenue for that year, for $290 million.[37][38]
Hershey's chocolate is available across the United States, due to their wide network of distribution.[39] They have three mega distribution centers, with modern technology and labor management systems.[40]
Product recalls[edit]

In November 2006, the Smiths Falls production plant in Ontario temporarily shut down and several products were voluntarily recalled after concerns over Salmonella contamination possibly found in soy lecithin within their production line. It is believed that most of the products involved in the recall never made it to the retail level.[41][42]
In July 1998, a number of 100 g (3.5 oz) milk chocolate bars being sold for fundraising events were recalled because they may have contained traces of almonds not listed in the ingredients.[43]

Philanthropy[edit]
Hershey has made large contributions to education. One of their most notable contributions was the Elizabethtown College Honors Program.[44] The program was established in 1999 and is funded partially through the endowment.
In 2015, Hershey announced a commitment with Clinton Global Initiative to help build a sustainable supply chain to support basic nutrition for children in Ghana.[45]
Criticism[edit]
Cocoa purchase[edit]
Hershey has been criticized for not having programs to ensure sustainable and ethical cocoa purchase, lagging behind its competitors in fair trade measures.[46] Regarding Hershey's corporate practices, the Global Exchange report comments that:

Hershey has no policies in place to purchase cocoa that has been produced without the use of labor exploitation, and the company has consistently refused to provide public information about its cocoa sources. Additionally, Hershey has made no move to shift to third-party certification for the cocoa that it sources from West Africa. No information is available from Hershey about how the money it has invested in various programs in West Africa has actually impacted reductions in forced, trafficked, and child labor among the suppliers of its cocoa. Finally, Hershey's efforts to further cut costs in its cocoa production has led to a reduction in good jobs in the United States.[47]

The "Raise the Bar, Hershey!" campaign was launched in September 2010 by Global Exchange, Green America. the Oasis Trust, and the International Labor Rights Forum. The purpose of the Raise the Bar Campaign is to pressure Hershey to commit "to take immediate action to eliminate forced and child labor … from Hershey's cocoa supply"; "to sourcing 100% Fair Trade Certified™ cocoa beans by 2012 for at least one of its top five selling chocolate bars … making at least one additional top five selling bar 100% Fair Trade Certified™ every two years thereafter"; and that "the majority of Hershey's cocoa across all products will be Fair Trade Certified™ by 2022." Pressure was particularly directed at Whole Foods Market, which announced on October 3, 2012 that it would cease carrying Hershey's Scharffen Berger line.[48] The Campaign stated that "Whole Foods’ decision follows more than 40 natural food retailers and coops publicly expressing concern about carrying Scharffen Berger and Dagoba products as a consequence of the giant chocolate maker's refusal to address child labor in its supply chain."[48] The same day, Hershey's announced, "it will source 100 percent certified cocoa for its global chocolate product lines by 2020 and accelerate its programs to help eliminate child labor in the cocoa regions of West Africa."[49]

Early years[edit]
After an apprenticeship to a confectioner in 1873, Milton S. Hershey founded a candy shop in Philadelphia. This candy shop was only open for six years, after which Hershey apprenticed with another confectioner in Denver, where he learned to make caramel.[7] After another failed business attempt in New York, Hershey returned to Pennsylvania, where in 1886 he founded the Lancaster Caramel Company. The use of fresh milk in caramels proved successful,[8] and in 1900, after seeing chocolate-making machines for the first time at the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago, Hershey sold his caramel company for $1,000,000[8] (equal to $28,788,000 today), and began to concentrate on chocolate manufacturing, stating to people who questioned him, "Caramels are just a fad, but chocolate is a permanent thing."
In 1896, Milton built a milk-processing plant so he could create and refine a recipe for milk chocolate candies. In 1899, he developed the Hershey process, which is less sensitive to milk quality than traditional methods. In 1900, he began manufacturing Hershey's Milk Chocolate Bars, also called Hershey's Bars or Hershey Bars.

Hershey, Pennsylvania[edit]
In 1903, Hershey began construction of a chocolate plant in his hometown of Derry Church, Pennsylvania, which later came to be known as Hershey, Pennsylvania.[8] The town was an inexpensive place for the workers and their families to live. Milton treated the people well and provided leisure activities to make sure the citizens enjoyed themselves. The milk chocolate bars manufactured at this plant proved popular, and the company grew rapidly.
Hershey's Kisses[edit]
In 1907, he introduced a new candy, bite-sized, flat-bottomed, conical-shaped pieces of chocolate that he named "Hershey's Kiss". Initially, they were individually wrapped by hand in squares of aluminum foil, and the introduction of machine wrapping in 1921 simplified the process while adding the small paper ribbon to the top of the package to indicate that it was a genuine Hershey product.[8] Today, 80 million of the candies are produced each day. Other products introduced included Mr. Goodbar (1925), containing peanuts in milk chocolate, Hershey's Syrup (1926), semisweet chocolate chips (1928), and the Krackel bar containing crisped rice (1938).
Labor troubles[edit]
Labor unrest came to Hershey in the late 1930s as a Congress of Industrial Organizations-backed union attempted to organize the factory workers. A failed sit-down strike in 1937 ended in violence, as loyalist workers and local dairy farmers beat many of the strikers as they attempted to leave the plant. By 1940, an affiliate of the American Federation of Labor had successfully organized Hershey's workers under the leadership of John Shearer, who became the first president of Local Chapter Number 464 of the Bakery, Confectionery, Tobacco Workers and Grain Millers' International Union. Local 464 still represents the Hershey workforce.
M&M's[edit]
Shortly before World War II, Bruce Murrie, son of long-time Hershey's president William F.R. Murrie, struck a deal with Forrest Mars to create a hard sugar-coated chocolate that would be called M&M's (for Mars and Murrie). Murrie had 20% interest in the confection, which used Hershey chocolate during the rationing era during World War 2. In 1948, Mars bought out Murrie's interest and became one of Hershey's main competitors.[9]
21st century[edit]
In April 2006, the Chocolate Manufacturers Association in the United States, whose members include Hershey, Nestlé, and Archer Daniels Midland, lobbied the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to change the legal definition of chocolate to let them substitute partially hydrogenated vegetable oils for cocoa butter in addition to using artificial sweeteners and milk substitutes.[10] Currently, the Food and Drug Administration does not allow a product to be called "chocolate" if the product contains any of these ingredients.[11][12]
In June 2006, Philadelphia city councilman Juan Ramos called for Hershey's to stop marketing "Ice Breakers Pacs", a kind of mint, due to the resemblance of its packaging to a kind that was used for illegal street drugs.[13]
In September 2006, ABC News reported that several Hershey chocolate products were reformulated to replace cocoa butter with vegetable oil as an emulsifier. According to the company, this change was made to reduce the costs of producing the products instead of raising their prices or decreasing the sizes. Some consumers complained that the taste was different, but the company stated that in the company-sponsored blind taste tests, about half of consumers preferred the new versions. As the new versions no longer met the Food and Drug Administration's official definition of "milk chocolate", the changed items were relabeled from stating they were "milk chocolate" and "made with chocolate" to "chocolate candy" and "chocolaty."[14]
In April 2014, the Hershey chocolate plant on East Chocolate Avenue in Hershey Pennsylvania was demolished to make way for mixed-use development.[15]
A 2016 attempt to sell Hershey to Mondelez International was scuttled because of objections by the Hershey Trust.[16]
Reese's Peanut Butter Cups[edit]
Harry Burnett Reese worked at Hershey, beginning in 1917, as a dairyman for the Hershey Farms. In 1921, he went to work in the factory, and by 1925, he had developed an assortment of candies which he sold to department stores in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, advertised as "made in Hershey". In 1926, he built his own factory, and in 1941, with the wartime rationing of sugar, Reese focused all of his production resources on his own confectionery specialty, Reese's Peanut Butter Cups, which required less sugar than most other confections of the time. In 1956, Reese died, leaving the company to his six sons. In June 1963, Hershey Chocolate Corporation acquired Reese's company for $23.3 million at a time when Reese's sales were $14 million annually.[17]
Cadbury's[edit]
In 1988, Hershey's acquired the rights to manufacture and distribute many Cadbury-branded products in the United States (except gum and mints, which are part of Mondelēz International). In 2015, they sued a British importer to halt imports of British Cadbury chocolate, angering consumers.[18][19]
Krave Jerky[edit]
In 2005, Krave Jerky was founded by Jon Sebastiani after he trained for a marathon and looked for a healthy source of energy.[20] Alliance Consumer Growth, a private equity group, invested in Krave Jerky in 2012.[21] Hershey's purchased the company in 2015 for $240 million.[22] In February and April 2007, Hershey's announced that their Smiths Falls[23][24] and Oakdale[25][26] plants would close in 2008, being replaced in part by a new facility in Monterrey, Mexico. The Oakdale factory closed on February 1, 2008.[27] Hershey chocolate factory in São Roque, Brazil, was opened in August 2002.
Hershey also has plants in Stuarts Draft, Virginia; Lancaster, Pennsylvania; Hazleton, Pennsylvania; Memphis, Tennessee; Robinson, Illinois, and Guadalajara, Mexico.
Visitors to Hershey can experience Hershey's Chocolate World visitors center and its simulated tour ride. Public tours were once operated in the Pennsylvania and California factories, which ended in Pennsylvania in 1973 as soon as Hershey's Chocolate World opened,[28] and later in California following the September 11, 2001, attacks, due to security concerns.[26]
On September 18, 2012, Hershey opened a new and expanded West Hershey plant. The plant was completed at a budget of $300 million.[29]
Other sales and acquisitions[edit]
In 1969, Hershey received a license from Rowntree's to manufacture and market Kit Kat and Rolo in the United States. As of September 2013, Hershey continued to make and market these brands in the U.S. under license from Nestlé, owners of the Rowntree brand. That license would be revoked and revert to Nestlé if Hershey is sold.[16] In 1977, Hershey acquired Y&S Candies, founded in 1845, and became the makers of Twizzlers licorice candies. In 1986, Hershey's began a brief foray into cough drops when it acquired the Luden's cough drops brand. By 2001, though, the brand had been sold to Pharmacia (now part of Pfizer),[30] and Luden's eventually became a product of Prestige Brands.[31] Hershey's kept Luden's 5th Avenue bar. In 1988, Hershey's acquired the rights to manufacture and distribute many Cadbury-branded products in the United States (except gum and mints, which are part of Mondelēz International). In 1996, Hershey purchased the American operations of the Leaf Candy Company from Huhtamäki.
In 1999, the Hershey Pasta Group was divested to several equity partners to form the New World Pasta company (now part of Ebro Foods).
On July 25, 2002, it became public knowledge that the Hershey Trust Company was seeking to sell its controlling interest in the Hershey Foods Corporation. The value of Hershey stock skyrocketed 25% with over 19 million shares trading that day. Over the following 55 days, widespread press coverage, as well as pressure from Pennsylvania Attorney General Mike Fisher, the community of Hershey, and Dauphin County Orphans' Court Senior Judge Warren G. Morgan, led to the sale being abandoned. The seven Hershey trustees who voted to sell Hershey Foods on September 17, 2002, for US$12.5 billion to the William Wrigley Jr. Company (now part of Mars Incorporated) were removed by Attorney General Fisher and Judge Morgan.[32] Ten of the 17 trustees were forced to resign and four new members who lived locally were appointed. The former Pennsylvania Attorney General, LeRoy S. Zimmerman, became the new chairman of the reconstituted Milton Hershey School Trustees. Mr. Zimmerman has publicly committed to having the Milton Hershey School Trust always retain its interest in The Hershey Company. If Hershey was to be sold, the rights to make and market Kit Kat and Rolo products in the U.S. would have reverted to Nestlé.
In December 2004, Hershey acquired the Mauna Loa Macadamia Nut Corp. from The Shansby Group.[33]
In July 2005, Hershey acquired the Berkeley, California-based boutique chocolate-maker Scharffen Berger.[34] In November 2005, Hershey acquired Joseph Schmidt Confections, the San Francisco-based chocolatier, and in November 2006, Hershey acquired Dagoba Organic Chocolate, a boutique chocolate maker based in Ashland, Oregon.
In December 2011, Hershey reached an agreement to acquire Brookside Foods Ltd., a privately held confectionery company based in Abbotsford, British Columbia.[35]
In 2015, Hershey announced that they had acquired Krave Jerky, marking the company's first foray outside of the confectionery market in more than a decade.[36]
In 2016, Hershey acquired barkTHINS, a New York-based chocolate snack foods company which expected to generate between $65 million and $75 million in revenue for that year, for $290 million.[37][38]
Hershey's chocolate is available across the United States, due to their wide network of distribution.[39] They have three mega distribution centers, with modern technology and labor management systems.[40]
Product recalls[edit]

In November 2006, the Smiths Falls production plant in Ontario temporarily shut down and several products were voluntarily recalled after concerns over Salmonella contamination possibly found in soy lecithin within their production line. It is believed that most of the products involved in the recall never made it to the retail level.[41][42]
In July 1998, a number of 100 g (3.5 oz) milk chocolate bars being sold for fundraising events were recalled because they may have contained traces of almonds not listed in the ingredients.[43]

Philanthropy[edit]
Hershey has made large contributions to education. One of their most notable contributions was the Elizabethtown College Honors Program.[44] The program was established in 1999 and is funded partially through the endowment.
In 2015, Hershey announced a commitment with Clinton Global Initiative to help build a sustainable supply chain to support basic nutrition for children in Ghana.[45]
Criticism[edit]
Cocoa purchase[edit]
Hershey has been criticized for not having programs to ensure sustainable and ethical cocoa purchase, lagging behind its competitors in fair trade measures.[46] Regarding Hershey's corporate practices, the Global Exchange report comments that:

Hershey has no policies in place to purchase cocoa that has been produced without the use of labor exploitation, and the company has consistently refused to provide public information about its cocoa sources. Additionally, Hershey has made no move to shift to third-party certification for the cocoa that it sources from West Africa. No information is available from Hershey about how the money it has invested in various programs in West Africa has actually impacted reductions in forced, trafficked, and child labor among the suppliers of its cocoa. Finally, Hershey's efforts to further cut costs in its cocoa production has led to a reduction in good jobs in the United States.[47]

The "Raise the Bar, Hershey!" campaign was launched in September 2010 by Global Exchange, Green America. the Oasis Trust, and the International Labor Rights Forum. The purpose of the Raise the Bar Campaign is to pressure Hershey to commit "to take immediate action to eliminate forced and child labor … from Hershey's cocoa supply"; "to sourcing 100% Fair Trade Certified™ cocoa beans by 2012 for at least one of its top five selling chocolate bars … making at least one additional top five selling bar 100% Fair Trade Certified™ every two years thereafter"; and that "the majority of Hershey's cocoa across all products will be Fair Trade Certified™ by 2022." Pressure was particularly directed at Whole Foods Market, which announced on October 3, 2012 that it would cease carrying Hershey's Scharffen Berger line.[48] The Campaign stated that "Whole Foods’ decision follows more than 40 natural food retailers and coops publicly expressing concern about carrying Scharffen Berger and Dagoba products as a consequence of the giant chocolate maker's refusal to address child labor in its supply chain."[48] The same day, Hershey's announced, "it will source 100 percent certified cocoa for its global chocolate product lines by 2020 and accelerate its programs to help eliminate child labor in the cocoa regions of West Africa."[49]

Early years[edit]
After an apprenticeship to a confectioner in 1873, Milton S. Hershey founded a candy shop in Philadelphia. This candy shop was only open for six years, after which Hershey apprenticed with another confectioner in Denver, where he learned to make caramel.[7] After another failed business attempt in New York, Hershey returned to Pennsylvania, where in 1886 he founded the Lancaster Caramel Company. The use of fresh milk in caramels proved successful,[8] and in 1900, after seeing chocolate-making machines for the first time at the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago, Hershey sold his caramel company for $1,000,000[8] (equal to $28,788,000 today), and began to concentrate on chocolate manufacturing, stating to people who questioned him, "Caramels are just a fad, but chocolate is a permanent thing."
In 1896, Milton built a milk-processing plant so he could create and refine a recipe for milk chocolate candies. In 1899, he developed the Hershey process, which is less sensitive to milk quality than traditional methods. In 1900, he began manufacturing Hershey's Milk Chocolate Bars, also called Hershey's Bars or Hershey Bars.

Hershey, Pennsylvania[edit]
In 1903, Hershey began construction of a chocolate plant in his hometown of Derry Church, Pennsylvania, which later came to be known as Hershey, Pennsylvania.[8] The town was an inexpensive place for the workers and their families to live. Milton treated the people well and provided leisure activities to make sure the citizens enjoyed themselves. The milk chocolate bars manufactured at this plant proved popular, and the company grew rapidly.
Hershey's Kisses[edit]
In 1907, he introduced a new candy, bite-sized, flat-bottomed, conical-shaped pieces of chocolate that he named "Hershey's Kiss". Initially, they were individually wrapped by hand in squares of aluminum foil, and the introduction of machine wrapping in 1921 simplified the process while adding the small paper ribbon to the top of the package to indicate that it was a genuine Hershey product.[8] Today, 80 million of the candies are produced each day. Other products introduced included Mr. Goodbar (1925), containing peanuts in milk chocolate, Hershey's Syrup (1926), semisweet chocolate chips (1928), and the Krackel bar containing crisped rice (1938).
Labor troubles[edit]
Labor unrest came to Hershey in the late 1930s as a Congress of Industrial Organizations-backed union attempted to organize the factory workers. A failed sit-down strike in 1937 ended in violence, as loyalist workers and local dairy farmers beat many of the strikers as they attempted to leave the plant. By 1940, an affiliate of the American Federation of Labor had successfully organized Hershey's workers under the leadership of John Shearer, who became the first president of Local Chapter Number 464 of the Bakery, Confectionery, Tobacco Workers and Grain Millers' International Union. Local 464 still represents the Hershey workforce.
M&M's[edit]
Shortly before World War II, Bruce Murrie, son of long-time Hershey's president William F.R. Murrie, struck a deal with Forrest Mars to create a hard sugar-coated chocolate that would be called M&M's (for Mars and Murrie). Murrie had 20% interest in the confection, which used Hershey chocolate during the rationing era during World War 2. In 1948, Mars bought out Murrie's interest and became one of Hershey's main competitors.[9]
21st century[edit]
In April 2006, the Chocolate Manufacturers Association in the United States, whose members include Hershey, Nestlé, and Archer Daniels Midland, lobbied the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to change the legal definition of chocolate to let them substitute partially hydrogenated vegetable oils for cocoa butter in addition to using artificial sweeteners and milk substitutes.[10] Currently, the Food and Drug Administration does not allow a product to be called "chocolate" if the product contains any of these ingredients.[11][12]
In June 2006, Philadelphia city councilman Juan Ramos called for Hershey's to stop marketing "Ice Breakers Pacs", a kind of mint, due to the resemblance of its packaging to a kind that was used for illegal street drugs.[13]
In September 2006, ABC News reported that several Hershey chocolate products were reformulated to replace cocoa butter with vegetable oil as an emulsifier. According to the company, this change was made to reduce the costs of producing the products instead of raising their prices or decreasing the sizes. Some consumers complained that the taste was different, but the company stated that in the company-sponsored blind taste tests, about half of consumers preferred the new versions. As the new versions no longer met the Food and Drug Administration's official definition of "milk chocolate", the changed items were relabeled from stating they were "milk chocolate" and "made with chocolate" to "chocolate candy" and "chocolaty."[14]
In April 2014, the Hershey chocolate plant on East Chocolate Avenue in Hershey Pennsylvania was demolished to make way for mixed-use development.[15]
A 2016 attempt to sell Hershey to Mondelez International was scuttled because of objections by the Hershey Trust.[16]
Reese's Peanut Butter Cups[edit]
Harry Burnett Reese worked at Hershey, beginning in 1917, as a dairyman for the Hershey Farms. In 1921, he went to work in the factory, and by 1925, he had developed an assortment of candies which he sold to department stores in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, advertised as "made in Hershey". In 1926, he built his own factory, and in 1941, with the wartime rationing of sugar, Reese focused all of his production resources on his own confectionery specialty, Reese's Peanut Butter Cups, which required less sugar than most other confections of the time. In 1956, Reese died, leaving the company to his six sons. In June 1963, Hershey Chocolate Corporation acquired Reese's company for $23.3 million at a time when Reese's sales were $14 million annually.[17]
Cadbury's[edit]
In 1988, Hershey's acquired the rights to manufacture and distribute many Cadbury-branded products in the United States (except gum and mints, which are part of Mondelēz International). In 2015, they sued a British importer to halt imports of British Cadbury chocolate, angering consumers.[18][19]
Krave Jerky[edit]
In 2005, Krave Jerky was founded by Jon Sebastiani after he trained for a marathon and looked for a healthy source of energy.[20] Alliance Consumer Growth, a private equity group, invested in Krave Jerky in 2012.[21] Hershey's purchased the company in 2015 for $240 million.[22] In February and April 2007, Hershey's announced that their Smiths Falls[23][24] and Oakdale[25][26] plants would close in 2008, being replaced in part by a new facility in Monterrey, Mexico. The Oakdale factory closed on February 1, 2008.[27] Hershey chocolate factory in São Roque, Brazil, was opened in August 2002.
Hershey also has plants in Stuarts Draft, Virginia; Lancaster, Pennsylvania; Hazleton, Pennsylvania; Memphis, Tennessee; Robinson, Illinois, and Guadalajara, Mexico.
Visitors to Hershey can experience Hershey's Chocolate World visitors center and its simulated tour ride. Public tours were once operated in the Pennsylvania and California factories, which ended in Pennsylvania in 1973 as soon as Hershey's Chocolate World opened,[28] and later in California following the September 11, 2001, attacks, due to security concerns.[26]
On September 18, 2012, Hershey opened a new and expanded West Hershey plant. The plant was completed at a budget of $300 million.[29]
Other sales and acquisitions[edit]
In 1969, Hershey received a license from Rowntree's to manufacture and market Kit Kat and Rolo in the United States. As of September 2013, Hershey continued to make and market these brands in the U.S. under license from Nestlé, owners of the Rowntree brand. That license would be revoked and revert to Nestlé if Hershey is sold.[16] In 1977, Hershey acquired Y&S Candies, founded in 1845, and became the makers of Twizzlers licorice candies. In 1986, Hershey's began a brief foray into cough drops when it acquired the Luden's cough drops brand. By 2001, though, the brand had been sold to Pharmacia (now part of Pfizer),[30] and Luden's eventually became a product of Prestige Brands.[31] Hershey's kept Luden's 5th Avenue bar. In 1988, Hershey's acquired the rights to manufacture and distribute many Cadbury-branded products in the United States (except gum and mints, which are part of Mondelēz International). In 1996, Hershey purchased the American operations of the Leaf Candy Company from Huhtamäki.
In 1999, the Hershey Pasta Group was divested to several equity partners to form the New World Pasta company (now part of Ebro Foods).
On July 25, 2002, it became public knowledge that the Hershey Trust Company was seeking to sell its controlling interest in the Hershey Foods Corporation. The value of Hershey stock skyrocketed 25% with over 19 million shares trading that day. Over the following 55 days, widespread press coverage, as well as pressure from Pennsylvania Attorney General Mike Fisher, the community of Hershey, and Dauphin County Orphans' Court Senior Judge Warren G. Morgan, led to the sale being abandoned. The seven Hershey trustees who voted to sell Hershey Foods on September 17, 2002, for US$12.5 billion to the William Wrigley Jr. Company (now part of Mars Incorporated) were removed by Attorney General Fisher and Judge Morgan.[32] Ten of the 17 trustees were forced to resign and four new members who lived locally were appointed. The former Pennsylvania Attorney General, LeRoy S. Zimmerman, became the new chairman of the reconstituted Milton Hershey School Trustees. Mr. Zimmerman has publicly committed to having the Milton Hershey School Trust always retain its interest in The Hershey Company. If Hershey was to be sold, the rights to make and market Kit Kat and Rolo products in the U.S. would have reverted to Nestlé.
In December 2004, Hershey acquired the Mauna Loa Macadamia Nut Corp. from The Shansby Group.[33]
In July 2005, Hershey acquired the Berkeley, California-based boutique chocolate-maker Scharffen Berger.[34] In November 2005, Hershey acquired Joseph Schmidt Confections, the San Francisco-based chocolatier, and in November 2006, Hershey acquired Dagoba Organic Chocolate, a boutique chocolate maker based in Ashland, Oregon.
In December 2011, Hershey reached an agreement to acquire Brookside Foods Ltd., a privately held confectionery company based in Abbotsford, British Columbia.[35]
In 2015, Hershey announced that they had acquired Krave Jerky, marking the company's first foray outside of the confectionery market in more than a decade.[36]
In 2016, Hershey acquired barkTHINS, a New York-based chocolate snack foods company which expected to generate between $65 million and $75 million in revenue for that year, for $290 million.[37][38]
Hershey's chocolate is available across the United States, due to their wide network of distribution.[39] They have three mega distribution centers, with modern technology and labor management systems.[40]
Product recalls[edit]

In November 2006, the Smiths Falls production plant in Ontario temporarily shut down and several products were voluntarily recalled after concerns over Salmonella contamination possibly found in soy lecithin within their production line. It is believed that most of the products involved in the recall never made it to the retail level.[41][42]
In July 1998, a number of 100 g (3.5 oz) milk chocolate bars being sold for fundraising events were recalled because they may have contained traces of almonds not listed in the ingredients.[43]

Philanthropy[edit]
Hershey has made large contributions to education. One of their most notable contributions was the Elizabethtown College Honors Program.[44] The program was established in 1999 and is funded partially through the endowment.
In 2015, Hershey announced a commitment with Clinton Global Initiative to help build a sustainable supply chain to support basic nutrition for children in Ghana.[45]
Criticism[edit]
Cocoa purchase[edit]
Hershey has been criticized for not having programs to ensure sustainable and ethical cocoa purchase, lagging behind its competitors in fair trade measures.[46] Regarding Hershey's corporate practices, the Global Exchange report comments that:

Hershey has no policies in place to purchase cocoa that has been produced without the use of labor exploitation, and the company has consistently refused to provide public information about its cocoa sources. Additionally, Hershey has made no move to shift to third-party certification for the cocoa that it sources from West Africa. No information is available from Hershey about how the money it has invested in various programs in West Africa has actually impacted reductions in forced, trafficked, and child labor among the suppliers of its cocoa. Finally, Hershey's efforts to further cut costs in its cocoa production has led to a reduction in good jobs in the United States.[47]

The "Raise the Bar, Hershey!" campaign was launched in September 2010 by Global Exchange, Green America. the Oasis Trust, and the International Labor Rights Forum. The purpose of the Raise the Bar Campaign is to pressure Hershey to commit "to take immediate action to eliminate forced and child labor … from Hershey's cocoa supply"; "to sourcing 100% Fair Trade Certified™ cocoa beans by 2012 for at least one of its top five selling chocolate bars … making at least one additional top five selling bar 100% Fair Trade Certified™ every two years thereafter"; and that "the majority of Hershey's cocoa across all products will be Fair Trade Certified™ by 2022." Pressure was particularly directed at Whole Foods Market, which announced on October 3, 2012 that it would cease carrying Hershey's Scharffen Berger line.[48] The Campaign stated that "Whole Foods’ decision follows more than 40 natural food retailers and coops publicly expressing concern about carrying Scharffen Berger and Dagoba products as a consequence of the giant chocolate maker's refusal to address child labor in its supply chain."[48] The same day, Hershey's announced, "it will source 100 percent certified cocoa for its global chocolate product lines by 2020 and accelerate its programs to help eliminate child labor in the cocoa regions of West Africa."[49]

Hershey Trust Halts Auction Despite Offer Of $12 Billion

The charitable trust that controls the Hershey Foods Corporation abandoned its auction late last night even though it was on the verge of accepting a $12.5 billion cash-and-stock offer from the Wm. Wrigley Jr. Company, executives close to the negotiations said.After a 10-hour board meeting in the Philadelphia suburb of Valley Forge, the trust said it had asked company executives to end their search for a buyer. Ten of the board's 17 members voted to halt the auction, a person close to the board said.Hershey's board had planned to meet today to vote to accept Wrigley's offer, valued at $89 a share, the executives said. Wrigley's offer, a 42 percent premium over Hershey's stock price before the company was put up for sale, had included several provisions, including a guarantee that the company's factories would be kept open, to make it more acceptable to local politicians and employees, who had objected to the sale, the executives said.The combined company was going to be called Wrigley Hershey, they said. A deal with Wrigley would have been a radical transaction, fundamentally reshaping the company, whose brands include Doublemint and Big Red chewing gum.

A person close to the trust's board said that the trustees had been overwhelmed by the outcry of protest from the community since the trust announced in July that it was considering selling its stake in Hershey Foods to diversify the trust's $5.9 billion base of assets.

''The trust board has rejected all the bids that have been received,'' Rick Kelly, a spokesman for the trust, said after the board meeting last night. ''It is asking the company to end the process of exploring a sale.'' He added, ''This is the culmination of months and months of reviewing the diversification options.''The executives said that the trust had also received a second offer in the form of a joint bid from Nestlé and Cadbury Schweppes worth about $10.5 billion.Now the trust, which controls 77 percent of Hershey's voting stock and owns 31 percent of the common shares, plans to consider a stock buyback program, a person close to the company said.

The trust had argued that it needed to diversify its holdings to protect the financing for its main beneficiary, the Milton Hershey School, which educates and shelters nearly 1,300 students.But Pennsylvania's attorney general, Mike Fisher, sought to block any sale in the Dauphin County Orphans Court, which oversees charitable trust activities, arguing that court approval was needed for any deal and contending that a sale could devastate the town, where about 6,200 people work for the company.Two weeks ago, Judge Warren Morgan issued a temporary injunction to block the possible sale of the Hershey after Mr. Fisher argued that a sale would cause ''irreparable harm'' to the hometown of the candy maker, the nation's largest. Judge Morgan criticized the Hershey Trust for considering a sale in his 16-page opinion, saying that the trustees showed ''a capriciousness that is an abuse of their discretion.''The trust appealed last week, arguing that the temporary injunction preventing the trust from selling the company should be overturned and contending that the injunction prevents the trustees from carrying out their obligation.Most legal experts had expected the decision to be overturned eventually. The injunction prevented the trust from entering into a binding arrangement but did not prevent the company from continuing the auction and making a preliminary deal.Jack Stover, a lawyer for the trust, said in court that Mr. Fisher, who is running for governor, ''has staged what we believe is an unprecedented attempt to exercise authority over a charitable trust in Pennsylvania.''

Several trustees were particularly upset with Mr. Fisher, who recommended in December that the trust consider diversifying its assets only to become its most vocal critic after the auction was announced. Continue reading the main story

History[edit]
On April 28, 1905, the Pennsylvania Department of State issued a charter creating the Hershey Trust Company.[3] In 1909, when Hershey founded the Milton Hershey School, Hershey appointed the Trust as administrator of the school trust.
2011 investigation of the Hershey Trust Company[edit]
In February 2011, Robert Reese, a former board member and president of the Trust, filed a lawsuit against the Hershey Trust Company alleging that Trust had been improperly using the Trust's money.[4] One particular issue was the purchase of the Wren Dale Golf Course, in which the Hershey Trust overpaid for the property, to the benefit of board members who were both owners of the Wren Dale Golf Course and on the Hershey Trust board.[5][6] Reese withdrew the lawsuit in April 2011, due to deteriorating health. Reese suggested the Pennsylvania Attorney General had enough cause to investigate the Hershey Trust.[7]
In 2013, Kathleen Kane, the Pennsylvania Attorney General, announced the conclusion of a two-year investigation into the operations of the Hershey Trust Company, in which the Office of Attorney General and the Hershey Trust Company agreed that there was a finding of no wrongdoing, but reforms were required of the trust company.[8][9]
2016 developments[edit]
In May, 2016, the state attorney general asked the company to remove three members from the ten-person board. The attorney general said that the three had allowed "apparent violations" of the 2013 agreement. At about the same time, in an unrelated investigation, John Estey, former chief of staff to Gov. Ed Rendell and a high-ranking executive of the company was charged with wire fraud, having pocketed $13,000 that an FBI sting operation had given to him in an investigation into illegal lobbying of legislators.[1][10]

The Hershey Company, known until April 2005 as the Hershey Foods Corporation[4] and commonly called Hershey's, is one of the largest chocolate manufacturers in North America. Its headquarters are in Hershey, Pennsylvania, which is also home to Hershey's Chocolate World. It was founded by Milton S. Hershey in 1894 as the Hershey Chocolate Company, a subsidiary of his Lancaster Caramel Company. Hershey's products are sold in over 60 countries worldwide.[5][6] In addition, Hershey is a member of the World Cocoa Foundation. It is also associated with the Hersheypark Stadium and the Giant Center.

History[edit]

Early years[edit]
After an apprenticeship to a confectioner in 1873, Milton S. Hershey founded a candy shop in Philadelphia. This candy shop was only open for six years, after which Hershey apprenticed with another confectioner in Denver, where he learned to make caramel.[7] After another failed business attempt in New York, Hershey returned to Pennsylvania, where in 1886 he founded the Lancaster Caramel Company. The use of fresh milk in caramels proved successful,[8] and in 1900, after seeing chocolate-making machines for the first time at the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago, Hershey sold his caramel company for $1,000,000[8] (equal to $28,788,000 today), and began to concentrate on chocolate manufacturing, stating to people who questioned him, "Caramels are just a fad, but chocolate is a permanent thing."
In 1896, Milton built a milk-processing plant so he could create and refine a recipe for milk chocolate candies. In 1899, he developed the Hershey process, which is less sensitive to milk quality than traditional methods. In 1900, he began manufacturing Hershey's Milk Chocolate Bars, also called Hershey's Bars or Hershey Bars.

Hershey, Pennsylvania[edit]
In 1903, Hershey began construction of a chocolate plant in his hometown of Derry Church, Pennsylvania, which later came to be known as Hershey, Pennsylvania.[8] The town was an inexpensive place for the workers and their families to live. Milton treated the people well and provided leisure activities to make sure the citizens enjoyed themselves. The milk chocolate bars manufactured at this plant proved popular, and the company grew rapidly.
Hershey's Kisses[edit]
In 1907, he introduced a new candy, bite-sized, flat-bottomed, conical-shaped pieces of chocolate that he named "Hershey's Kiss". Initially, they were individually wrapped by hand in squares of aluminum foil, and the introduction of machine wrapping in 1921 simplified the process while adding the small paper ribbon to the top of the package to indicate that it was a genuine Hershey product.[8] Today, 80 million of the candies are produced each day. Other products introduced included Mr. Goodbar (1925), containing peanuts in milk chocolate, Hershey's Syrup (1926), semisweet chocolate chips (1928), and the Krackel bar containing crisped rice (1938).
Labor troubles[edit]
Labor unrest came to Hershey in the late 1930s as a Congress of Industrial Organizations-backed union attempted to organize the factory workers. A failed sit-down strike in 1937 ended in violence, as loyalist workers and local dairy farmers beat many of the strikers as they attempted to leave the plant. By 1940, an affiliate of the American Federation of Labor had successfully organized Hershey's workers under the leadership of John Shearer, who became the first president of Local Chapter Number 464 of the Bakery, Confectionery, Tobacco Workers and Grain Millers' International Union. Local 464 still represents the Hershey workforce.
M&M's[edit]
Shortly before World War II, Bruce Murrie, son of long-time Hershey's president William F.R. Murrie, struck a deal with Forrest Mars to create a hard sugar-coated chocolate that would be called M&M's (for Mars and Murrie). Murrie had 20% interest in the confection, which used Hershey chocolate during the rationing era during World War 2. In 1948, Mars bought out Murrie's interest and became one of Hershey's main competitors.[9]
21st century[edit]
In April 2006, the Chocolate Manufacturers Association in the United States, whose members include Hershey, Nestlé, and Archer Daniels Midland, lobbied the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to change the legal definition of chocolate to let them substitute partially hydrogenated vegetable oils for cocoa butter in addition to using artificial sweeteners and milk substitutes.[10] Currently, the Food and Drug Administration does not allow a product to be called "chocolate" if the product contains any of these ingredients.[11][12]
In June 2006, Philadelphia city councilman Juan Ramos called for Hershey's to stop marketing "Ice Breakers Pacs", a kind of mint, due to the resemblance of its packaging to a kind that was used for illegal street drugs.[13]
In September 2006, ABC News reported that several Hershey chocolate products were reformulated to replace cocoa butter with vegetable oil as an emulsifier. According to the company, this change was made to reduce the costs of producing the products instead of raising their prices or decreasing the sizes. Some consumers complained that the taste was different, but the company stated that in the company-sponsored blind taste tests, about half of consumers preferred the new versions. As the new versions no longer met the Food and Drug Administration's official definition of "milk chocolate", the changed items were relabeled from stating they were "milk chocolate" and "made with chocolate" to "chocolate candy" and "chocolaty."[14]
In April 2014, the Hershey chocolate plant on East Chocolate Avenue in Hershey Pennsylvania was demolished to make way for mixed-use development.[15]
A 2016 attempt to sell Hershey to Mondelez International was scuttled because of objections by the Hershey Trust.[16]
Reese's Peanut Butter Cups[edit]
Harry Burnett Reese worked at Hershey, beginning in 1917, as a dairyman for the Hershey Farms. In 1921, he went to work in the factory, and by 1925, he had developed an assortment of candies which he sold to department stores in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, advertised as "made in Hershey". In 1926, he built his own factory, and in 1941, with the wartime rationing of sugar, Reese focused all of his production resources on his own confectionery specialty, Reese's Peanut Butter Cups, which required less sugar than most other confections of the time. In 1956, Reese died, leaving the company to his six sons. In June 1963, Hershey Chocolate Corporation acquired Reese's company for $23.3 million at a time when Reese's sales were $14 million annually.[17]
Cadbury's[edit]
In 1988, Hershey's acquired the rights to manufacture and distribute many Cadbury-branded products in the United States (except gum and mints, which are part of Mondelēz International). In 2015, they sued a British importer to halt imports of British Cadbury chocolate, angering consumers.[18][19]
Krave Jerky[edit]
In 2005, Krave Jerky was founded by Jon Sebastiani after he trained for a marathon and looked for a healthy source of energy.[20] Alliance Consumer Growth, a private equity group, invested in Krave Jerky in 2012.[21] Hershey's purchased the company in 2015 for $240 million.[22] In February and April 2007, Hershey's announced that their Smiths Falls[23][24] and Oakdale[25][26] plants would close in 2008, being replaced in part by a new facility in Monterrey, Mexico. The Oakdale factory closed on February 1, 2008.[27] Hershey chocolate factory in São Roque, Brazil, was opened in August 2002.
Hershey also has plants in Stuarts Draft, Virginia; Lancaster, Pennsylvania; Hazleton, Pennsylvania; Memphis, Tennessee; Robinson, Illinois, and Guadalajara, Mexico.
Visitors to Hershey can experience Hershey's Chocolate World visitors center and its simulated tour ride. Public tours were once operated in the Pennsylvania and California factories, which ended in Pennsylvania in 1973 as soon as Hershey's Chocolate World opened,[28] and later in California following the September 11, 2001, attacks, due to security concerns.[26]
On September 18, 2012, Hershey opened a new and expanded West Hershey plant. The plant was completed at a budget of $300 million.[29]
Other sales and acquisitions[edit]
In 1969, Hershey received a license from Rowntree's to manufacture and market Kit Kat and Rolo in the United States. As of September 2013, Hershey continued to make and market these brands in the U.S. under license from Nestlé, owners of the Rowntree brand. That license would be revoked and revert to Nestlé if Hershey is sold.[16] In 1977, Hershey acquired Y&S Candies, founded in 1845, and became the makers of Twizzlers licorice candies. In 1986, Hershey's began a brief foray into cough drops when it acquired the Luden's cough drops brand. By 2001, though, the brand had been sold to Pharmacia (now part of Pfizer),[30] and Luden's eventually became a product of Prestige Brands.[31] Hershey's kept Luden's 5th Avenue bar. In 1988, Hershey's acquired the rights to manufacture and distribute many Cadbury-branded products in the United States (except gum and mints, which are part of Mondelēz International). In 1996, Hershey purchased the American operations of the Leaf Candy Company from Huhtamäki.
In 1999, the Hershey Pasta Group was divested to several equity partners to form the New World Pasta company (now part of Ebro Foods).
On July 25, 2002, it became public knowledge that the Hershey Trust Company was seeking to sell its controlling interest in the Hershey Foods Corporation. The value of Hershey stock skyrocketed 25% with over 19 million shares trading that day. Over the following 55 days, widespread press coverage, as well as pressure from Pennsylvania Attorney General Mike Fisher, the community of Hershey, and Dauphin County Orphans' Court Senior Judge Warren G. Morgan, led to the sale being abandoned. The seven Hershey trustees who voted to sell Hershey Foods on September 17, 2002, for US$12.5 billion to the William Wrigley Jr. Company (now part of Mars Incorporated) were removed by Attorney General Fisher and Judge Morgan.[32] Ten of the 17 trustees were forced to resign and four new members who lived locally were appointed. The former Pennsylvania Attorney General, LeRoy S. Zimmerman, became the new chairman of the reconstituted Milton Hershey School Trustees. Mr. Zimmerman has publicly committed to having the Milton Hershey School Trust always retain its interest in The Hershey Company. If Hershey was to be sold, the rights to make and market Kit Kat and Rolo products in the U.S. would have reverted to Nestlé.
In December 2004, Hershey acquired the Mauna Loa Macadamia Nut Corp. from The Shansby Group.[33]
In July 2005, Hershey acquired the Berkeley, California-based boutique chocolate-maker Scharffen Berger.[34] In November 2005, Hershey acquired Joseph Schmidt Confections, the San Francisco-based chocolatier, and in November 2006, Hershey acquired Dagoba Organic Chocolate, a boutique chocolate maker based in Ashland, Oregon.
In December 2011, Hershey reached an agreement to acquire Brookside Foods Ltd., a privately held confectionery company based in Abbotsford, British Columbia.[35]
In 2015, Hershey announced that they had acquired Krave Jerky, marking the company's first foray outside of the confectionery market in more than a decade.[36]
In 2016, Hershey acquired barkTHINS, a New York-based chocolate snack foods company which expected to generate between $65 million and $75 million in revenue for that year, for $290 million.[37][38]
Hershey's chocolate is available across the United States, due to their wide network of distribution.[39] They have three mega distribution centers, with modern technology and labor management systems.[40]
Product recalls[edit]

In November 2006, the Smiths Falls production plant in Ontario temporarily shut down and several products were voluntarily recalled after concerns over Salmonella contamination possibly found in soy lecithin within their production line. It is believed that most of the products involved in the recall never made it to the retail level.[41][42]
In July 1998, a number of 100 g (3.5 oz) milk chocolate bars being sold for fundraising events were recalled because they may have contained traces of almonds not listed in the ingredients.[43]

Philanthropy[edit]
Hershey has made large contributions to education. One of their most notable contributions was the Elizabethtown College Honors Program.[44] The program was established in 1999 and is funded partially through the endowment.
In 2015, Hershey announced a commitment with Clinton Global Initiative to help build a sustainable supply chain to support basic nutrition for children in Ghana.[45]
Criticism[edit]
Cocoa purchase[edit]
Hershey has been criticized for not having programs to ensure sustainable and ethical cocoa purchase, lagging behind its competitors in fair trade measures.[46] Regarding Hershey's corporate practices, the Global Exchange report comments that:

Hershey has no policies in place to purchase cocoa that has been produced without the use of labor exploitation, and the company has consistently refused to provide public information about its cocoa sources. Additionally, Hershey has made no move to shift to third-party certification for the cocoa that it sources from West Africa. No information is available from Hershey about how the money it has invested in various programs in West Africa has actually impacted reductions in forced, trafficked, and child labor among the suppliers of its cocoa. Finally, Hershey's efforts to further cut costs in its cocoa production has led to a reduction in good jobs in the United States.[47]

The "Raise the Bar, Hershey!" campaign was launched in September 2010 by Global Exchange, Green America. the Oasis Trust, and the International Labor Rights Forum. The purpose of the Raise the Bar Campaign is to pressure Hershey to commit "to take immediate action to eliminate forced and child labor … from Hershey's cocoa supply"; "to sourcing 100% Fair Trade Certified™ cocoa beans by 2012 for at least one of its top five selling chocolate bars … making at least one additional top five selling bar 100% Fair Trade Certified™ every two years thereafter"; and that "the majority of Hershey's cocoa across all products will be Fair Trade Certified™ by 2022." Pressure was particularly directed at Whole Foods Market, which announced on October 3, 2012 that it would cease carrying Hershey's Scharffen Berger line.[48] The Campaign stated that "Whole Foods’ decision follows more than 40 natural food retailers and coops publicly expressing concern about carrying Scharffen Berger and Dagoba products as a consequence of the giant chocolate maker's refusal to address child labor in its supply chain."[48] The same day, Hershey's announced, "it will source 100 percent certified cocoa for its global chocolate product lines by 2020 and accelerate its programs to help eliminate child labor in the cocoa regions of West Africa."[49]

The Hershey Company, known until April 2005 as the Hershey Foods Corporation[4] and commonly called Hershey's, is one of the largest chocolate manufacturers in North America. Its headquarters are in Hershey, Pennsylvania, which is also home to Hershey's Chocolate World. It was founded by Milton S. Hershey in 1894 as the Hershey Chocolate Company, a subsidiary of his Lancaster Caramel Company. Hershey's products are sold in over 60 countries worldwide.[5][6] In addition, Hershey is a member of the World Cocoa Foundation. It is also associated with the Hersheypark Stadium and the Giant Center.

Early years[edit]
After an apprenticeship to a confectioner in 1873, Milton S. Hershey founded a candy shop in Philadelphia. This candy shop was only open for six years, after which Hershey apprenticed with another confectioner in Denver, where he learned to make caramel.[7] After another failed business attempt in New York, Hershey returned to Pennsylvania, where in 1886 he founded the Lancaster Caramel Company. The use of fresh milk in caramels proved successful,[8] and in 1900, after seeing chocolate-making machines for the first time at the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago, Hershey sold his caramel company for $1,000,000[8] (equal to $28,788,000 today), and began to concentrate on chocolate manufacturing, stating to people who questioned him, "Caramels are just a fad, but chocolate is a permanent thing."
In 1896, Milton built a milk-processing plant so he could create and refine a recipe for milk chocolate candies. In 1899, he developed the Hershey process, which is less sensitive to milk quality than traditional methods. In 1900, he began manufacturing Hershey's Milk Chocolate Bars, also called Hershey's Bars or Hershey Bars.

Hershey, Pennsylvania[edit]
In 1903, Hershey began construction of a chocolate plant in his hometown of Derry Church, Pennsylvania, which later came to be known as Hershey, Pennsylvania.[8] The town was an inexpensive place for the workers and their families to live. Milton treated the people well and provided leisure activities to make sure the citizens enjoyed themselves. The milk chocolate bars manufactured at this plant proved popular, and the company grew rapidly.
Hershey's Kisses[edit]
In 1907, he introduced a new candy, bite-sized, flat-bottomed, conical-shaped pieces of chocolate that he named "Hershey's Kiss". Initially, they were individually wrapped by hand in squares of aluminum foil, and the introduction of machine wrapping in 1921 simplified the process while adding the small paper ribbon to the top of the package to indicate that it was a genuine Hershey product.[8] Today, 80 million of the candies are produced each day. Other products introduced included Mr. Goodbar (1925), containing peanuts in milk chocolate, Hershey's Syrup (1926), semisweet chocolate chips (1928), and the Krackel bar containing crisped rice (1938).
Labor troubles[edit]
Labor unrest came to Hershey in the late 1930s as a Congress of Industrial Organizations-backed union attempted to organize the factory workers. A failed sit-down strike in 1937 ended in violence, as loyalist workers and local dairy farmers beat many of the strikers as they attempted to leave the plant. By 1940, an affiliate of the American Federation of Labor had successfully organized Hershey's workers under the leadership of John Shearer, who became the first president of Local Chapter Number 464 of the Bakery, Confectionery, Tobacco Workers and Grain Millers' International Union. Local 464 still represents the Hershey workforce.
M&M's[edit]
Shortly before World War II, Bruce Murrie, son of long-time Hershey's president William F.R. Murrie, struck a deal with Forrest Mars to create a hard sugar-coated chocolate that would be called M&M's (for Mars and Murrie). Murrie had 20% interest in the confection, which used Hershey chocolate during the rationing era during World War 2. In 1948, Mars bought out Murrie's interest and became one of Hershey's main competitors.[9]
21st century[edit]
In April 2006, the Chocolate Manufacturers Association in the United States, whose members include Hershey, Nestlé, and Archer Daniels Midland, lobbied the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to change the legal definition of chocolate to let them substitute partially hydrogenated vegetable oils for cocoa butter in addition to using artificial sweeteners and milk substitutes.[10] Currently, the Food and Drug Administration does not allow a product to be called "chocolate" if the product contains any of these ingredients.[11][12]
In June 2006, Philadelphia city councilman Juan Ramos called for Hershey's to stop marketing "Ice Breakers Pacs", a kind of mint, due to the resemblance of its packaging to a kind that was used for illegal street drugs.[13]
In September 2006, ABC News reported that several Hershey chocolate products were reformulated to replace cocoa butter with vegetable oil as an emulsifier. According to the company, this change was made to reduce the costs of producing the products instead of raising their prices or decreasing the sizes. Some consumers complained that the taste was different, but the company stated that in the company-sponsored blind taste tests, about half of consumers preferred the new versions. As the new versions no longer met the Food and Drug Administration's official definition of "milk chocolate", the changed items were relabeled from stating they were "milk chocolate" and "made with chocolate" to "chocolate candy" and "chocolaty."[14]
In April 2014, the Hershey chocolate plant on East Chocolate Avenue in Hershey Pennsylvania was demolished to make way for mixed-use development.[15]
A 2016 attempt to sell Hershey to Mondelez International was scuttled because of objections by the Hershey Trust.[16]
Reese's Peanut Butter Cups[edit]
Harry Burnett Reese worked at Hershey, beginning in 1917, as a dairyman for the Hershey Farms. In 1921, he went to work in the factory, and by 1925, he had developed an assortment of candies which he sold to department stores in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, advertised as "made in Hershey". In 1926, he built his own factory, and in 1941, with the wartime rationing of sugar, Reese focused all of his production resources on his own confectionery specialty, Reese's Peanut Butter Cups, which required less sugar than most other confections of the time. In 1956, Reese died, leaving the company to his six sons. In June 1963, Hershey Chocolate Corporation acquired Reese's company for $23.3 million at a time when Reese's sales were $14 million annually.[17]
Cadbury's[edit]
In 1988, Hershey's acquired the rights to manufacture and distribute many Cadbury-branded products in the United States (except gum and mints, which are part of Mondelēz International). In 2015, they sued a British importer to halt imports of British Cadbury chocolate, angering consumers.[18][19]
Krave Jerky[edit]
In 2005, Krave Jerky was founded by Jon Sebastiani after he trained for a marathon and looked for a healthy source of energy.[20] Alliance Consumer Growth, a private equity group, invested in Krave Jerky in 2012.[21] Hershey's purchased the company in 2015 for $240 million.[22] In February and April 2007, Hershey's announced that their Smiths Falls[23][24] and Oakdale[25][26] plants would close in 2008, being replaced in part by a new facility in Monterrey, Mexico. The Oakdale factory closed on February 1, 2008.[27] Hershey chocolate factory in São Roque, Brazil, was opened in August 2002.
Hershey also has plants in Stuarts Draft, Virginia; Lancaster, Pennsylvania; Hazleton, Pennsylvania; Memphis, Tennessee; Robinson, Illinois, and Guadalajara, Mexico.
Visitors to Hershey can experience Hershey's Chocolate World visitors center and its simulated tour ride. Public tours were once operated in the Pennsylvania and California factories, which ended in Pennsylvania in 1973 as soon as Hershey's Chocolate World opened,[28] and later in California following the September 11, 2001, attacks, due to security concerns.[26]
On September 18, 2012, Hershey opened a new and expanded West Hershey plant. The plant was completed at a budget of $300 million.[29]
Other sales and acquisitions[edit]
In 1969, Hershey received a license from Rowntree's to manufacture and market Kit Kat and Rolo in the United States. As of September 2013, Hershey continued to make and market these brands in the U.S. under license from Nestlé, owners of the Rowntree brand. That license would be revoked and revert to Nestlé if Hershey is sold.[16] In 1977, Hershey acquired Y&S Candies, founded in 1845, and became the makers of Twizzlers licorice candies. In 1986, Hershey's began a brief foray into cough drops when it acquired the Luden's cough drops brand. By 2001, though, the brand had been sold to Pharmacia (now part of Pfizer),[30] and Luden's eventually became a product of Prestige Brands.[31] Hershey's kept Luden's 5th Avenue bar. In 1988, Hershey's acquired the rights to manufacture and distribute many Cadbury-branded products in the United States (except gum and mints, which are part of Mondelēz International). In 1996, Hershey purchased the American operations of the Leaf Candy Company from Huhtamäki.
In 1999, the Hershey Pasta Group was divested to several equity partners to form the New World Pasta company (now part of Ebro Foods).
On July 25, 2002, it became public knowledge that the Hershey Trust Company was seeking to sell its controlling interest in the Hershey Foods Corporation. The value of Hershey stock skyrocketed 25% with over 19 million shares trading that day. Over the following 55 days, widespread press coverage, as well as pressure from Pennsylvania Attorney General Mike Fisher, the community of Hershey, and Dauphin County Orphans' Court Senior Judge Warren G. Morgan, led to the sale being abandoned. The seven Hershey trustees who voted to sell Hershey Foods on September 17, 2002, for US$12.5 billion to the William Wrigley Jr. Company (now part of Mars Incorporated) were removed by Attorney General Fisher and Judge Morgan.[32] Ten of the 17 trustees were forced to resign and four new members who lived locally were appointed. The former Pennsylvania Attorney General, LeRoy S. Zimmerman, became the new chairman of the reconstituted Milton Hershey School Trustees. Mr. Zimmerman has publicly committed to having the Milton Hershey School Trust always retain its interest in The Hershey Company. If Hershey was to be sold, the rights to make and market Kit Kat and Rolo products in the U.S. would have reverted to Nestlé.
In December 2004, Hershey acquired the Mauna Loa Macadamia Nut Corp. from The Shansby Group.[33]
In July 2005, Hershey acquired the Berkeley, California-based boutique chocolate-maker Scharffen Berger.[34] In November 2005, Hershey acquired Joseph Schmidt Confections, the San Francisco-based chocolatier, and in November 2006, Hershey acquired Dagoba Organic Chocolate, a boutique chocolate maker based in Ashland, Oregon.
In December 2011, Hershey reached an agreement to acquire Brookside Foods Ltd., a privately held confectionery company based in Abbotsford, British Columbia.[35]
In 2015, Hershey announced that they had acquired Krave Jerky, marking the company's first foray outside of the confectionery market in more than a decade.[36]
In 2016, Hershey acquired barkTHINS, a New York-based chocolate snack foods company which expected to generate between $65 million and $75 million in revenue for that year, for $290 million.[37][38]
Hershey's chocolate is available across the United States, due to their wide network of distribution.[39] They have three mega distribution centers, with modern technology and labor management systems.[40]
Product recalls[edit]

In November 2006, the Smiths Falls production plant in Ontario temporarily shut down and several products were voluntarily recalled after concerns over Salmonella contamination possibly found in soy lecithin within their production line. It is believed that most of the products involved in the recall never made it to the retail level.[41][42]
In July 1998, a number of 100 g (3.5 oz) milk chocolate bars being sold for fundraising events were recalled because they may have contained traces of almonds not listed in the ingredients.[43]

Philanthropy[edit]
Hershey has made large contributions to education. One of their most notable contributions was the Elizabethtown College Honors Program.[44] The program was established in 1999 and is funded partially through the endowment.
In 2015, Hershey announced a commitment with Clinton Global Initiative to help build a sustainable supply chain to support basic nutrition for children in Ghana.[45]
Criticism[edit]
Cocoa purchase[edit]
Hershey has been criticized for not having programs to ensure sustainable and ethical cocoa purchase, lagging behind its competitors in fair trade measures.[46] Regarding Hershey's corporate practices, the Global Exchange report comments that:

Hershey has no policies in place to purchase cocoa that has been produced without the use of labor exploitation, and the company has consistently refused to provide public information about its cocoa sources. Additionally, Hershey has made no move to shift to third-party certification for the cocoa that it sources from West Africa. No information is available from Hershey about how the money it has invested in various programs in West Africa has actually impacted reductions in forced, trafficked, and child labor among the suppliers of its cocoa. Finally, Hershey's efforts to further cut costs in its cocoa production has led to a reduction in good jobs in the United States.[47]

The "Raise the Bar, Hershey!" campaign was launched in September 2010 by Global Exchange, Green America. the Oasis Trust, and the International Labor Rights Forum. The purpose of the Raise the Bar Campaign is to pressure Hershey to commit "to take immediate action to eliminate forced and child labor … from Hershey's cocoa supply"; "to sourcing 100% Fair Trade Certified™ cocoa beans by 2012 for at least one of its top five selling chocolate bars … making at least one additional top five selling bar 100% Fair Trade Certified™ every two years thereafter"; and that "the majority of Hershey's cocoa across all products will be Fair Trade Certified™ by 2022." Pressure was particularly directed at Whole Foods Market, which announced on October 3, 2012 that it would cease carrying Hershey's Scharffen Berger line.[48] The Campaign stated that "Whole Foods’ decision follows more than 40 natural food retailers and coops publicly expressing concern about carrying Scharffen Berger and Dagoba products as a consequence of the giant chocolate maker's refusal to address child labor in its supply chain."[48] The same day, Hershey's announced, "it will source 100 percent certified cocoa for its global chocolate product lines by 2020 and accelerate its programs to help eliminate child labor in the cocoa regions of West Africa."[49]

Hershey Trust Company

Introduction
In early 1903, while he made plans to break ground for his chocolate factory in a field near the tiny community of Derry Church, Pennsylvania, Milton Hershey thought about the needs of his future workers. He had the foresight to recognize that if his chocolate making idea was to work for the benefit of all, he would need a place for his workers to live self-reliant, independent lives. They would need comfortable homes, health and recreational facilities, and schools for their children.
Milton Hershey was more than a dreamer. He was a man of action. While the chocolate factory was still under construction, he began to implement his ideas for a model industrial community. In 1905 the Hershey Chocolate factory began operations. That same year Milton Hershey established Hershey Trust Company to serve as the community's bank in accommodating its financial needs. A state charter was granted on April 27, 1905 and Hershey Trust Company opened for business on June 15, 1905 in offices located in the Cocoa House, the first commercial building built in the new community. A published brochure advertised a wide scope of banking services. In addition to handling the Hershey business payrolls, the Trust Company offered savings accounts, mortgages, and commercial and personal loans.
The Town's Bank
The decision to establish a trust company rather than a bank was made after Milton Hershey sought advice from the Northern National Bank of Lancaster, Pennsylvania. In his reply, E.J. Ryder, the Northern National cashier, suggested that in addition to taking mortgages, a trust company would have the added advantage of doing fiduciary business.
Still, in 1905 Milton Hershey’s town was more of an idea than an actuality. Though the chocolate factory began operations during the summer of 1905, little else was operating in town. Another year would pass before the community was officially named, when the United States Postmaster granted Milton Hershey permission to establish a new post office.
The original staff for the Trust Company was modest, consisting of the cashier and a teller. And in keeping with the tradition of other local financial institutions, the original board of directors was comprised of respected local business and community leaders.
Hershey Trust Company quickly became the town’s financial center, playing an important role in financing Milton Hershey’s construction and development plans. From its beginning, the Trust Company was instrumental in the growth and development of the town, advertising mortgages that encouraged people to build a home in the new community. The Trust Company advertised frequently in the local papers, encouraging residents to start savings accounts and to plan for the future. To broaden its accessibility, special deposit stations were established on Hershey trolleys. Specialized savings accounts, such as Christmas Savings Clubs, were clever gimmicks promoted by the Trust Company to encourage new account business. 

Growth and Expansion
Business grew rapidly and in 1910 a second clerk was added to the staff. That same year the board voted to appropriate $20,000 to build a new building to house the Trust Company offices. After nearly two years of planning and development, ground was broken on August 20, 1912 for a new bank building at the intersection of Cocoa and Chocolate Avenues.
Consistent with the financial institutions of the time, the Trust Company building was designed to impress the public. The building was designed by C. Emlen Urban, a noted Lancaster architect. Urban was responsible for all of Hershey’s major buildings designed before 1926, including the original factory and offices, the original Hershey Inn, the first Hershey Department Store building, the Community Building and High Point. The building design incorporated Renaissance style elements and was constructed of marble and brick on a granite foundation. The floor plan was designed to offer separate office space for other Hershey businesses. Large windows, massive interior pillars, bronze grill work, mahogany desks and trim, and marble flooring decorated the bank space. The bank vault was a particularly imposing feature of the building. A Seth Thomas 30 day clock was positioned above the vault door, guarded by two magnificent lions in bas-relief, representing ‘Time’ and ‘Strength.’ 

Milton Hershey's Vision:  Creating the Milton Hershey School
When Catherine and Milton Hershey created the Deed of Trust establishing the Hershey Industrial School (now Milton Hershey School), Hershey Trust Company was appointed trustee for the School. The original endowment was 486 acres of farmland including The Homestead, Milton Hershey’s birthplace. The Homestead served as both home and classroom to the first students. During the early years, Milton Hershey paid for many of the school’s expenses out of his own pocket. That all changed in 1918.
That year Milton Hershey quietly gifted the School Trust with all of his Hershey Chocolate Company stock, then valued at $60 million. At that time, Hershey Chocolate Company consisted not only of the Chocolate factory, but all of the Hershey enterprises including the Hershey Improvement Company, the Hershey utilities (water, sewer, electric, phone), the Hershey Transit Company, the Hershey Department Store, the Greenhouse and Nursery, and the Hershey Inn. In addition to the Hershey enterprises, the Chocolate Company holdings also included Milton Hershey’s Cuban holdings.
With Milton Hershey’s gift, the Trust Company needed to direct more of its efforts toward the management of the School Trust’s assets. In particular, the Trust Company assumed responsibility for Milton Hershey’s land assets, by then more than 10,000 acres of land in and around Hershey as well as his other financial investments. As the Trust Company assumed these new responsibilities, it became apparent that the town needed a new financial institution to provide the more traditional banking services for the community.
Establishing the Hershey National Bank
Therefore, to free the Trust Company for its duties as Trustee of the School Trust, the Hershey National Bank, a nationally chartered institution, was established in 1925 to handle the town's commercial banking needs. The bank operated as a separate entity, though the Trust Company, as trustee, owned majority equity ownership in the bank. The Trust Company continued to maintain offices in the Bank/Trust building at the corner of Chocolate and Cocoa Avenues.
With the establishment of the Hershey Bank, the Trust Company could now focus its efforts on trust and related businesses. Though at the time Hershey Trust Company did not actively solicit private trust business, it did accept most requests to establish private trust accounts. Furthermore, the Trust Company continued to make mortgage loans, thus playing a significant role in the growth and development of the town. This was particularly important with a new and rapidly expanding community. Hershey Trust’s mortgage business was more than a financial transaction.
Like other Hershey businesses, the Trust Company was an instrument to carry out Milton Hershey’s plans for his model community. The Depression of the 1930s was a time of significant financial hardship for all of the United States. While no one lost their job due to cutbacks in Hershey, work hours were often reduced and Hershey employees often saw a resulting reduction in their paycheck. During the Depression Milton Hershey encouraged the Trust Company to be lenient in handling mortgages that fell behind in payments. Throughout the Depression, Hershey Trust Company only foreclosed on two Hershey mortgages. Hershey Trust Company’s financial strength also enabled it to support another financial institution, Northern Trust and Saving Company of Lancaster, and prevent its collapse during the financial strain caused by the Depression.

Serving the Community:  The M.S. Hershey Foundation
During the Great Depression Milton Hershey realized that young men and women just graduating from high school had limited opportunities for employment. In 1935, Milton Hershey established The M.S. Hershey Foundation, and endowed it with 5000 shares of Hershey Chocolate Corporation stock. Hershey Trust Company, as the trustee, served as the financial steward for Milton Hershey’s vision for the community’s youth.
In 1938, the Foundation endowed the Hershey Junior College, offering tuition free higher education to all Derry Township residents and employees of the Hershey corporations. The Junior College maintained high academic standards and helped hundreds of Hershey residents receive a college education. Rising costs, an inadequate facility and the establishment of the Harrisburg Area Community College led to the closing of the Hershey Junior College in 1965.
After the closure of the Junior College, the Foundation’s role broadened with its support of the Hershey Educational and Cultural Center first established in May 1966. The Foundation then entered a period of assuming ownership of many of the community’s cultural organizations. It assumed operation of the Hershey Theatre in 1970, Hershey Museum in 1981 and the Hershey Gardens in 1989. As part of the Foundation, these cultural institutions gained non-profit status, enabling them to accept donations and apply for grants. Hershey Community Archives was established in 1984 as a cooperative project of the Foundation and the Hershey enterprises. Today the Trust Company continues its role as trustee for the Foundation. In order to provide as much benefit to the community as possible, it has never sought a change in the original trust agreement calling for a yearly fee of $1,000 to be paid to the trustee.
One Last Gift
The community of Hershey remained an enduring passion for Milton Hershey throughout his life. His final will was a reflection of his concern and commitment to his community. Through his will, Milton Hershey directed that the Trust Company serve as trustee for a new trust fund. This fund, created with the remainder of his estate, helped relieve the tax burden of maintaining the Township’s public schools. Under the stewardship of Hershey Trust Company, Milton Hershey’s Testamentary Trust Fund has grown to $33 million today. With its quarterly payments to the School District, this gift plays an important role in supporting the high level of public education valued in the Hershey community.
Keeping the Legacy Alive:  Milton S. Hershey Medical Center
The role of Hershey Trust Company seemed clear following the death of Milton Hershey: to be a good steward of Milton Hershey’s fortune and to stay true to his vision for the Milton Hershey School and his passion for the community. The Trust Company excelled in its responsibility and stewardship of those trust funds. Management of the Milton Hershey School Trust was so good that income generated often outpaced the School’s needs. As the surplus income fund grew, the Board confronted the dilemma of earning too much money, and how to best use excess funds to serve Milton Hershey’s legacy of providing for others.
It was Samuel Hinkle, President of the Hershey Chocolate Corporation and a director of the Trust Company Board, who first proposed using the money for the "construction, operation and endowment of a medical center." On August 23, 1963, the Trust Company Board used The M.S. Hershey Foundation as the conduit for a $50 million gift from the Milton Hershey School Trust to Pennsylvania State University for a medical school and teaching hospital known as The Milton S. Hershey Medical Center. Breaking ground on February 26, 1966, the Medical Center was completed in 1970 and a formal dedication for The Milton S. Hershey Medical Center was held June 5, 1971. In the 1990s, the Medical Center emerged as the township's largest employer, with more than 6000 employees.
The establishment of the Hershey Medical Center had a dramatic impact on the community as well. Derry Township's population boomed with the influx of Medical Center personnel and their families. The township’s population grew from 15,500 in 1970 to 21,273 in 2000. New housing developments, such as Briarcrest and Glen Acres, were established in response.
Hershey Trust Company Today
One of Hershey Trust Company’s most important roles is being a prudent steward of the land acquired by Milton Hershey while honoring his vision for a community featuring open green space. As the trustee of most of Derry Township’s undeveloped land, Hershey Trust Company is committed to limited development, maintaining most of its holdings as farmland and open space. It seeks to balance the need to preserve open land while accommodating a real need to provide for the growth and development necessary to remain a healthy community.
As banking laws evolved in the 1970s and 1980s the tradition of small independent banks gave way to expansions and mergers. In 1986, Hershey Trust Company sold its ownership of the Hershey Bank to PNC Corporation. About the same time, Hershey Trust Company began to focus on developing more traditional trust business.
Hershey Trust Company’s decision to actively seek private trust business grew out of changes resulting from the 1984 restructuring of Hershey Foods (now The Hershey Company) stock. By 1981, Hershey Trust’s ownership of Hershey Foods Corporation had shrunk to 50.1%. Both companies shared real concerns about losing control of Hershey Foods Corporation through a corporate raid or hostile takeover. A two-tier stock plan enabled Hershey Trust Company to maintain majority ownership of Milton Hershey’s company while freeing assets to diversify the School Trust’s holdings. New staff was added to invest and manage monies realized from the sale of Hershey Foods stock. The increased staff provided Hershey Trust Company with enhanced expertise in money management and beginning in 1989 the company began actively soliciting private business.
Following the sale of Hershey Bank, Hershey Trust Company needed to physically relocate and establish an identity separate from the bank. Hershey Trust Company’s move to High Point in 1991 provided them with much needed space for their expanded staff. 
In 2011, Hershey Trust Company sold its private wealth management group to Bryn Mawr Bank Corporation in order to focus its talents and energies on managing the assets of the Milton Hershey School trust fund.
Today, Hershey Trust Company stands alone as being the same company doing business in the same town for one hundred years. And their unique ownership structure virtually assures that they will continue doing business that way for the next 100 years.
