Investing Insights



Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/28/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.

About Hudson Valley Lighting



“Of all the original phenomena, light is the most enthralling.”
—Leonardo da Vinci
At Hudson Valley Lighting, we couldn’t agree more. More than mere backdrop, light animates each moment of our lives. We believe that a decorative lighting fixture allows the “original phenomena” to discover its most enthralling potential when it is designed to enhance the warmth and comfort of home, while simultaneously serving as a focal point of style and self-expression.
