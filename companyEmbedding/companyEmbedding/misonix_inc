TAKING ULTRASONIC SURGERY FURTHER


ALTERING LIVES Therapeutic ultrasound is an advanced technology with very unique characteristics that can improve surgeries around the world. Very similar to an ultrasonic cleaner that is used daily to make jewelry shiny, ultrasonic tools used in surgery are able to remove specifically targeted structures on a microscopic, even cellular level. Diseased tissues can be removed while important nerves in the proximity are spared. Collateral damage is kept minimal. Bleeding can be reduced and with the appropriate tool even stopped. Harmful bacteria can be destroyed and infection causing biofilms, like caries causing plaque, can be reduced. The formation of cell regrowth in open wounds can increase as can healing rates and patient outcomes.
ULTRASOUND EMPOWERS We at Misonix have recognized the tremendous potential in advancing surgical tools with ultrasound. We have made it our mission to offer surgeons superior tools for their challenging tasks and to facilitate surgeries that can be life-altering in their outcome. The results have been overwhelmingly positive – from both surgeons and patients. And this is why we are who we are: experts, leaders and pioneers in engineering advanced surgical tools – purely driven by sound. Ultrasonic sound.

PRINCIPLE OF
OPERATIONTISSUE SPECIFIC
ASPIRATION

TISSUE SPECIFIC ASPIRATION

SonaStar® is engineered to provide powerful and precise ultrasonic aspiration with maximum control and ease-of-use.
SonaStar’s® Dynamic Tissue Response is a combination of internal system responses that combine to preserve nerves and blood vessels while helping to remove tough tissues.
Sophisticated electronic circuitry inside the console constantly monitors and adjusts the tip vibration to maximize performance.
OsteoSculpt® bone shaver tips are designed to remove hard tissue efficiently with minimal impact to adjacent anatomy.

POWER


POWER

The SonaStar® is an innovation leader in ultrasonic aspiration offering a curved extended handpiece plus a compact, short-straight handpiece, both operating at a powerful 23kHz frequency for quick and efficient removal of hard, dense and calcified tumors.
Active process controls within the unit maintain all performance parameters like vibration, irrigation and aspiration at optimum settings.
OsteoSculpt® bone shaving technology is designed to enable safe and effortless removal of osseous structures to gain access to the surgical site. Different head sizes offer varying degrees of shaving aggressiveness.

PRECISION


PRECISION

SonaStar® offers a wide range of aspiration tips, including straight, short and long, curved extended precision tips (1.1mm) to address most delicate surgical needs including MIS applications.
OsteoSculpt® bone shaver tips are designed to remove hard tissue efficiently with minimal impact to adjacent anatomy.

CONTROL


CONTROL

Dynamic Tissue Response (DTR) management enables intuitive control over loading characteristics from delicate tumor removal and vessel sparing tissue emulsification to debulking of calcified tumors.
A unique “Linear” mode also allows the surgeon maximum control with load adjustments being as intuitive as varying an automobile’s speed with a gas pedal.
The SonaStar® convenient, wireless footswitch controls up to four functions: vibration, flush irrigation, coagulation, and coagulation/vibration simultaneously.

PRINCIPLE OF
OPERATION


Ultrasonic aspirators are designed to break up and remove specific soft or hard tissue (bone) during surgical procedures. These devices use mechanical vibration at ultrasonic frequencies while providing suction and/or irrigation to the surgical site.
Ultrasonic aspirators typically consist of a main control unit that includes a generator which delivers ultrasound energy, a pump used to supply suction and irrigation as well as a detachable handpiece.
The ultrasonic energy is then converted to mechanical vibrations in the handpiece.
These vibrations are applied to the soft tissue or bone that the surgeon is intending to remove.
Ultrasound surgical aspirators are often the tool of choice for surgeons looking to remove brain tumors and for general surgery procedures such as removing tumors from the liver.

Close×Ultrasound Terminology

ULTRASOUND
Mechanical vibration that happens at a frequency above human hearing – typically above 20 KHz
AMPLITUDE
The distance the titanium tip vibrates back and forth during surgery (typically expressed in microns, i.e. 0 – 350 microns)
FREQUENCY
How fast the tip vibrates expressed in how many 1,000’s of cycles per second or kilohertz (kHz) i.e. 23kHz. A higher frequency signifies would result in less “power”.

TAKING ULTRASONIC SURGERY FURTHER


ALTERING LIVES Therapeutic ultrasound is an advanced technology with very unique characteristics that can improve surgeries around the world. Very similar to an ultrasonic cleaner that is used daily to make jewelry shiny, ultrasonic tools used in surgery are able to remove specifically targeted structures on a microscopic, even cellular level. Diseased tissues can be removed while important nerves in the proximity are spared. Collateral damage is kept minimal. Bleeding can be reduced and with the appropriate tool even stopped. Harmful bacteria can be destroyed and infection causing biofilms, like caries causing plaque, can be reduced. The formation of cell regrowth in open wounds can increase as can healing rates and patient outcomes.
ULTRASOUND EMPOWERS We at Misonix have recognized the tremendous potential in advancing surgical tools with ultrasound. We have made it our mission to offer surgeons superior tools for their challenging tasks and to facilitate surgeries that can be life-altering in their outcome. The results have been overwhelmingly positive – from both surgeons and patients. And this is why we are who we are: experts, leaders and pioneers in engineering advanced surgical tools – purely driven by sound. Ultrasonic sound.
