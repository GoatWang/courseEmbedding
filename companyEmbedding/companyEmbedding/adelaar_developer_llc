You can think of these as two different company structures with very different tax requirements. Whichever way you choose to go, you're going to look more legit than the other guys. So just take a minute to consider your short-and long-term business goals to figure out which structure is best for you.
Advantages and Disadvantages
A limited liability company is a type of business structure that offers personal liability protections and a few tax advantages to boot. The "LL" in LLC is what protects your personal assets in the event of a judgment against your company. Corporations offer limited liability as well, so we're going to focus on the structural and taxation differences in the chart below.



Advantages of an LLC
Advantages of a Corporation




 No limit on the number of owners
 May issue shares of stock to attract investors


 Profit and loss are passed through to the owners' individual tax returns
 Corporate income splitting may help lower overall tax liability


 No annual meeting or minute book requirements
 






Disadvantages of an LLC
Disadvantages of a Corporation




 Cannot engage in corporate income splitting to lower tax liability
 C corp tax structure requires double taxation of corporate profits (s corp's does not)


 Cannot issue stock
 Must hold annual meetings and record minutes


 
 S corporations have restrictions on the number of owners



LLC or Corporation: Which One Is Right for Me?
Business goals aren't one size fits all, and neither is incorporating. When deciding which kind of corporation fits your business strategy, consider some of the differences that each kind offers. And take a deeper dive with our comprehensive comparison chart.
Find out which corporation is right for your business with our business wizard!

Along with picking the right entity type for your business, it's important to consider which state to incorporate in.
For most small business owners, the choice is simple: they incorporate in the state where their company is physically located, known as 'home state incorporation.' However, there are good reasons to consider forming your corporation or LLC in certain other states, including tax advantages, streamlined judicial processes, and easier business filing requirements.
For example, many business owners choose to incorporate in Delaware, which is a favored business jurisdiction for the previously mentioned and other reasons.

Delaware is widely considered to be one of the nation's most business-friendly jurisdictions. There are a number of reasons to incorporate your small business in Delaware, including:

Well-established and flexible business laws
Low franchise tax on small businesses
No tax on capital stock or assets
No state sales tax
A special business court (Court of Chancery) that minimizes the time and cost of commercial litigation
No residency requirement for shareholders, directors, and officers of a corporation or members or managers of an LLC

Adelaar resort developer does an about-face

After saying as recently as March that it would build a resort even without a gambling license, the developer behind a proposed casino at the old Concord hotel has changed its tune.An executive for EPR Properties, which is teaming with Empire Resorts to try to build the $750 million Adelaar, now says development of the resort is "going to be dependent on the gaming license.""There are no plans at this time to build a resort without a gaming component," said EPR Vice President for Corporate Communications Brian Moriarty on Thursday.Moriarty said that after the CEO for a competing casino project — Mohegan Sun at the Concord — said the two projects at the old resort could complement one another, even if Adelaar didn't get a casino.At Wednesday night's presentation of his project, Mitchell Etess said that Mohegan Sun guests could use Adelaar's Monster golf course and proposed water park — both of which were featured prominently on a poster of the projects."They're going to build anyway," said Etess.He also said Mohegan Sun plans to revitalize the old Grossinger's hotel in Liberty, formerly owned by Etess' family and now owned by Mohegan Sun at the Concord partner Louis Cappelli.And it plans to develop a property in Monticello, also owned by Cappelli — near Albella's restaurant — and turn that into a retail space.In March, the president of EPR told some 250 people at the public debut of Adelaar that it would still build a resort, even if the state didn't select it as one of the maximum two Hudson Valley/Catskills casinos.(Adelaar) will still proceed "in some manner, but it won't be as compelling," said David Brain, noting his company had already invested hundreds of millions of dollars in the project. That echoed comments others with the project had long been saying.But after Wednesday's article about Mohegan Sun at the Concord, Moriarty sent the Times Herald-Record a letter backtracking from that vow."Mr. Etess's statement that a 'resort' would be built independent of Empire Resorts being granted a Class III gaming license is simply factually incorrect," it said. "To be clear, development of Adelaar's Water Park and redesign of the Monster Golf Course is contingent upon Empire Resorts obtaining a Class III license. Additionally these non-gaming amenities are an important part of fully delivering on the notion of a destination resort."When asked repeatedly to clarify the statement, Moriarty left a bit of wiggle room."It's going to be dependent on the gaming license," he said. "But we would have to assess the situation when it's fully defined."So why the change in EPR plans?The possibility of a more lucrative Orange County casino or two, which is why two casino contenders in Sullivan County have dropped out and both Mohegan Sun at the Concord and Adelaar have said their casino designs would be affected if an Orange casino were named."This whole Orange County situation has really changed the viability," Moriarity said.sisrael@th-record.com

WHEREAS,
the Indenture provides that under certain circumstances the
Guaranteeing Subsidiaries shall execute and deliver to the Trustee

WHEREAS,
pursuant to Section 9.01 of the Indenture, the Trustee is

The Guaranteeing Subsidiaries hereby agree as follows:
(a)
    
Subject
to Article 10 of the Indenture, the Guaranteeing Subsidiaries
hereby, jointly and severally with all other Guarantors,
unconditionally guarantee to each Holder of a Note authenticated
and delivered by the Trustee and to the Trustee and its successors
and assigns, irrespective of the validity and enforceability of the
Indenture, the Notes or the obligations of the Issuer hereunder or
thereunder, that:
(i)
    
the
principal of, and premium, if any, and interest on the Notes will
be promptly paid in full when due, whether at maturity, by
acceleration, redemption or otherwise, and interest on the overdue

(ii)
    
in
case of any extension of time of payment or renewal of any Notes or

full when due or performed in accordance with the terms of the
extension or renewal, whether at stated maturity, by acceleration
or otherwise.

 



 






 



 


Failing
payment when due of any amount so guaranteed or any performance so
guaranteed for whatever reason, the Guarantors shall be jointly and
severally obligated to pay the same immediately.
(b)
    
The
obligations hereunder shall be unconditional, irrespective of the
validity, regularity or enforceability of the Notes or the
Indenture, the absence of any action to enforce the same, any
waiver or consent by any Holder of the Notes with respect to any
provisions hereof or thereof, the recovery of any judgment against
the Issuer, any action to enforce the same or any other
circumstance which might otherwise constitute a legal or equitable
discharge or defense of a Guarantor, other than payment in full of
all Obligations under the Notes.
(c)
    
The
following is hereby waived: diligence, presentment, demand of
payment, filing of claims with a court in the event of insolvency
or bankruptcy of the Issuer, any right to require a proceeding
first against the Issuer, protest, notice and all demands
whatsoever.
(d)
    
This
Notes Guarantee shall not be discharged except by complete
performance of the obligations contained in the Notes and the
Indenture, and each Guaranteeing Subsidiary accepts all obligations
of a Guarantor under the Indenture.
(e)
    
If
any Holder or the Trustee is required by any court or otherwise to
return to the Issuer, the Guarantors, or any custodian, trustee,
liquidator or other similar official acting in relation to either
the Issuer or the Guarantors, any amount paid by either to the
Trustee or such Holder, this Notes Guarantee, to the extent
theretofore discharged, shall be reinstated in full force and
effect.
(f)
    
The
Guaranteeing Subsidiaries shall not be entitled to any right of
subrogation in relation to the Holders in respect of any
obligations guaranteed hereby until payment in full of all
obligations guaranteed hereby.
(g)
    
As
between the Guarantors, on the one hand, and the Holders and the
Trustee, on the other hand, (x) the maturity of the obligations
guaranteed hereby may be accelerated as provided in Article 6 of
the Indenture for the purposes of this Notes Guarantee,
notwithstanding any stay, injunction or other prohibition
preventing such acceleration in respect of the obligations
guaranteed hereby, and (y) in the event of any declaration of
acceleration of such obligations as provided in Article 6 of the
Indenture, such obligations (whether or not due and payable) shall
forthwith become due and payable by the Guarantors for the purpose
of this Notes Guarantee.
(h)
    
The
Guarantors shall have the right to seek contribution from any
nonpaying Guarantor so long as the exercise of such right does not
impair the rights of the Holders under this Notes
Guarantee.
(i)
    
In
accordance with Section 10.02 of the Indenture, after giving effect
to any maximum amount and all other contingent and fixed
liabilities that are relevant under any applicable Bankruptcy

You can think of these as two different company structures with very different tax requirements. Whichever way you choose to go, you're going to look more legit than the other guys. So just take a minute to consider your short-and long-term business goals to figure out which structure is best for you.
Advantages and Disadvantages
A limited liability company is a type of business structure that offers personal liability protections and a few tax advantages to boot. The "LL" in LLC is what protects your personal assets in the event of a judgment against your company. Corporations offer limited liability as well, so we're going to focus on the structural and taxation differences in the chart below.



Advantages of an LLC
Advantages of a Corporation




 No limit on the number of owners
 May issue shares of stock to attract investors


 Profit and loss are passed through to the owners' individual tax returns
 Corporate income splitting may help lower overall tax liability


 No annual meeting or minute book requirements
 






Disadvantages of an LLC
Disadvantages of a Corporation




 Cannot engage in corporate income splitting to lower tax liability
 C corp tax structure requires double taxation of corporate profits (s corp's does not)


 Cannot issue stock
 Must hold annual meetings and record minutes


 
 S corporations have restrictions on the number of owners



LLC or Corporation: Which One Is Right for Me?
Business goals aren't one size fits all, and neither is incorporating. When deciding which kind of corporation fits your business strategy, consider some of the differences that each kind offers. And take a deeper dive with our comprehensive comparison chart.
Find out which corporation is right for your business with our business wizard!

It's amazing what three letters can do.
Adding "Inc." or "LLC" to your business' name is more than a good look. It protects your personal assets, creates tax advantages, and much more.

Along with picking the right entity type for your business, it's important to consider which state to incorporate in.
For most small business owners, the choice is simple: they incorporate in the state where their company is physically located, known as 'home state incorporation.' However, there are good reasons to consider forming your corporation or LLC in certain other states, including tax advantages, streamlined judicial processes, and easier business filing requirements.
For example, many business owners choose to incorporate in Delaware, which is a favored business jurisdiction for the previously mentioned and other reasons.

Delaware is widely considered to be one of the nation's most business-friendly jurisdictions. There are a number of reasons to incorporate your small business in Delaware, including:

Well-established and flexible business laws
Low franchise tax on small businesses
No tax on capital stock or assets
No state sales tax
A special business court (Court of Chancery) that minimizes the time and cost of commercial litigation
No residency requirement for shareholders, directors, and officers of a corporation or members or managers of an LLC
