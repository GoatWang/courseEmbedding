CLOSED-END FUNDS

Further to a Scheme of Reconstruction which was approved by shareholders in September 2016,Ecofin Water & Power Opportunities plc (EWPO) ceased trading on 21 September 2016.  Its two successor companies are Ecofin Global Utilities and Infrastructure Trust plc (Ecofin Global) and EF Realisation Company Limited (EF Realisation). The ordinary shares of Ecofin Global and EF Realisation began trading on the London Stock Exchange on 26 September 2016.  Ecofin Global's investment objectives are to achieve a high, secure dividend yield on its investment portfolio and to realise long-term growth in the capital value of its portfolio for the benefit of shareholders, while taking care to preserve shareholders' capital.  The Company's assets are primarily invested in equity and equity-related securities of utility and infrastructure companies in developed countries although up to 10% of its assets may be comprised of investments in debt securities and a significant portion of the portfolio may also be comprised of holdings in cash or cash equivalents from time to time. For the purposes of investment, utility companies are those involved in the generation, transmission and distribution of electricity including the production of electricity from renewable sources; the transport, storage and distribution of gas; the abstraction, treatment and supply of water and the treatment of waste water; and the provision of environmental services such as recycling and waste management.  Infrastructure companies are those that own and operate assets which are essential to the functioning of developed economies and to economic development and growth, notably transportation-related assets such as roads, railways, ports and airports.Ecofin Global may make use of gearing to enable it to earn a high level of dividend income and to offer the Shareholders a geared return on their investment.  The Directors believe that the use of gearing is justified given the nature of most of the companies in which Ecofin Global will invest; that is, companies which provide essential services, operate in regulated markets and within stable regulatory frameworks, and pay dividends. The nature and term of any borrowings are the responsibility of the Directors. The Company will not have any structural gearing but will utilise a flexible gearing policy with the ability to borrow amounts up to 25% of the Company’s net assets.Ecofin Global’s accounts are maintained in sterling. Many of the Company’s investments are denominated and quoted in currencies other than sterling, and although the Company does not pursue a policy of hedging such investments back into sterling, it may do so from time to time, depending on market conditions.EF Realisation is a closed-ended investment company incorporated in Guernsey, established as a successor vehicle to EWPO to hold the illiquid assets formerly owned by EWPO.  EF Realisation’s investment objective is to conduct an orderly realisation of the assets of EF Realisation within two years from the date of EF Realisation’s admission to trading on the London Stock Exchange, to be effected in a manner that seeks to achieve a balance between returning cash to shareholders promptly and maximising the value of its portfolio.

                  Alt Turnover is calculated by taking either the total MV of new purchases or
                   the MV of securities sold, whichever is less,
                   divided by the total MV of the fund.

Hedging Strategies

Simple Short Exposure. This strategy effectively shorts the S&P 500 by
        buying shares in the S&P 500 Short ETF.
        Simple Hedging will assume that 100%
        of the backtest's invested principal is always in the backtest's long positions.

        For example, if you choose a 25% hedging rate, then for a $10,000 portfolio,
        you will be long $10,000 and have a $2,500 short on the S&P 500.
        The short position will adjust each rebalancing period to match 25% of the total portfolio.
        Any gains/losses from the short are added to the overall available capital for the long positions in the
        portfolio.
      

Moving Average Hedge.  With this strategy, your portfolio will be hedged
        by shorting the S&P 500 whenever your long portfolio's performance drops below the monthly moving average.
        So if you set a 25% hedge, 25% of your long portfolio will be sold and the funds reallocated to the short
        whenever the hedge is in effect.
        Once your long portfolio performance goes back over the moving average, the short hedge will be removed
        and the funds from the short will be reallocated to your long positions.
      

        When hedging strategies are being used, backtests can only go back as far as 2006.  This is the date
        the S&P 500 Short ETF first appeared.

Stock Sell Buffer

      You can optionally include a stock sell buffer in your backtesting model.
      It works by keeping a stock in your portfolio even when it would otherwise drop out
      during rebalancing as long as it remains within your sell buffer threshold.
      For example, you are backtesting with the top 20 stocks each quarter and set a sell buffer of 50.
      In the first quarter, AAPL is one of the top 20 stocks and is included in the portfolio.
      In quarter 2, AAPL drops down to number 25. Without the sell buffer, AAPL would drop out
      for that quarter, but since it is still within the sell buffer threshold of 50,
      it will remain in the portfolio.
      Your portfolio size remains the same. The stocks that would have fallen out stay in and the
      stocks that would otherwise have been added stay out. Using the sell buffer may
      help produce a lower turnover rate.
    

      Sell Buffer Size (must be greater than # of holdings in portfolio to work):
      
No sell buffer
10
25
35

Rebalancing Frequency

      By default backtester rebalances quarterly using new 13F filing data. You can
      adjust the rebalancing frequency using the dropdown below. Reasons for
      changing the frequency include lower turnover and possible tax advantages
      by keeping stocks at least one year before selling.
    


        Do not rebalance after each quarter

or rebalance:
        
Every quarter (default)
 Every other quarter
 Once a year

      By default backtester will test your strategy using all available dates going back to 2001 (for subscribers only).
