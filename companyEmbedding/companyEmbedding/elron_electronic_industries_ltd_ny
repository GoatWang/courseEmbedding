History[edit]
Early years[edit]
Elron was founded in 1962 by Uzia Galil, with the support of Dan Tolkowsky of the Discount Investment Corporation. Uzia Galil graduated from the Technion – Israel Institute of Technology in 1947, and in 1948 joined the Israel Navy as an officer responsible for maintaining its Radio systems. In 1952 Uzia was sent to study for a master's degree in Electrical Engineering at Purdue University in the United States. During his studies in the United States, he worked at Motorola's research lab and was part of a team that developed of one of the world's first colour televisions. But in 1954 he had to return to Israel to complete another 4 years of service in Navy, which financed his studies.[1]
Founding Elron[edit]
Uzia Galil short experience working for Motorola in the United States exposed him to the technology industry and he decided to establish Israel's first high tech Startup company. He started the company, while still serving in Navy, in a friend's (Benjamin Sandller) flat in Haifa, later joined by another friend (Gideon Kirshner), who was a teacher at the Haifa Technical High-School, and worked with them in his spare time. The company's first products were measurement instruments for medical and electronic applications. In 1958 Uzia left the Navy, however the company did not generate enough revenues and he got a job at the Physics laboratory of the Technion; while there Moshe Arens, who was Professor of Aeronautics at the time, introduced him to Dan Tolkowsky. Dan, who was fascinated by Uzia's ideas, managed to convince the board of Discount Investment Corporation to provide the capital required to properly fund the company. Elron was officially formed in 1962 with an initial capital of $US 160,000, and within 3 years generated annual revenues of $1 millions.[1]
First joint venture – Elbit Computers Ltd.[edit]
In 1966, Shimon Peres, who at the time was the deputy defence minister, visited Elron and Uzia convinced him to establish a new company that will develop Minicomputers for defence applications. The new company, initially called Elbit Computers, was a joint venture with the Israel's Ministry of Defence and Elron (each holding 50% of the company). The company launched its first product in 1967 the Elbit-100 Minicomputer. The company evolved through the years to become the multinational defence electronics company – Elbit Systems (NASDAQ: ELBT).[1]
Founding Elscint[edit]
In 1969, Uzia convinced a talented engineer, Avraham Suhami, who just completed his PhD at the Technion, to join him and start a new company that will focus on the development of medical and scientific solutions, a new company - Elscint, a contraction of the words "electronic" and "scientific", was established again with the support of Dan Tolkowsky. The company developed medical imaging equipment, such as MRI and CT scanners. In 1972 Elscint was the first Israeli company to have an initial public offering on NASDAQ. By 1996, Elscint's revenues reached $311 million.[2]
Growth during the 1980s and 1990s[edit]
In 1981 Elron was involved in the establishment of a company that will later become Orbotech (NASDAQ: ORBK) a manufacturer of equipment for the Printed Circuit Board (PCB), TFT& LCD Display assembly industries.[3]
In 1983 Uzia met by chance, while waiting for a flight in the lounge of Ben Gurion International Airport, Levy Gerzberg an academic from Stanford University, who in 1981 founded Zoran Corporation (Zoran stands for "silicon" in Hebrew), which develops digital signal processing solutions. At the time Levy Gerzberg was looking for additional funding, which Elron was able to provide. In 1995, Zoran had an initial public offering on NASDAQ (NASDAQ: ZRAN) and later was the leading provider of complete OEM solutions for consumer electronics products, such as DVD and digital cameras, with annual revenues of over $500 million in 2007.[4]
In 1996, Elbit spun off into three independent companies:[5]

Elbit Medical Imaging NASDAQ: EMITF - during 1999 and 2000 both Elscint and Elbit Medical Imaging sold their imaging activities to General Electric Medical Systems NYSE: GE and to Picker (now part of Philips Medical Systems, NYSE: PHG for approximately $600 million.
Elbit Systems – Created as the defence electronics arm of Elbit and had an Initial public offering on NASDAQ.
Elbit - which focused on communications activities and in 1999 led the consortium that founded Partner Communications Company Ltd., Israel's first GSM operator NASDAQ: PTNR. In 2002 Elbit was merged into Elron. Elron sold its shares in Partner during 2003-2006 for approximately $160 million.

In 1998, Given Imaging (NASDAQ: GIVN), a developer of a video capsule for medical diagnostics, was founded.
2000s[edit]
During the 2000s, Elron started operating less as holding company and moved to act more as a venture capital fund, jointly investing in numerous start-up companies and realizing the investment by selling the companies or conducting an initial public offering. Notable investments and investment exits include:

Elron Software - a provider of spam, email and web filtering solutions, sold to Zix Corp.[6]
Oren Semiconductor - a fabless integrated circuits manufacturer that designs and develops integrated circuits for the digital television and set-top box markets, sold to Zoran Corporation.[7]
Galil Medical - a developer of cryotherapy solutions.[8]
SELA Semiconductor Engineering Laboratories - a provider of automated sample preparation tools for semiconductor manufacturers, sold to Camtek Intelligent Imaging.[8]
3DV Systems - developers of the ZCam, a time-of-flight camera products for video applications, sold to Microsoft.[9]
Medingo - developer of a micro pump insulin delivery system consists of two parts: a semi-disposable insulin dispensing patch and a remote control, which allows for discreet personalised insulin delivery. The company was sold to Hoffmann-La Roche's subsidiary Roche Diagnostics for $160 million as well as up to $40 million in milestone payments.[10]
Safend - a leading provider of endpoint data protection solutions was sold to Wave Systems.[11]
Wavion - a provider of outdoor Wi-Fi applications for metro and rural areas, acquired by Alvarion.[12]

Current holdings[edit]
In 2012, Elron celebrated its 50th anniversary and announced that it is refocusing solely on Medical Devices investment. As of 2013, it has holding in 7 companies in this market, including:

Given Imaging - a developer of a video capsule for medical diagnostics
Brainsgate - a medical device company developing a novel treatment modality, electrical SPG stimulation

Early years[edit]
Elron was founded in 1962 by Uzia Galil, with the support of Dan Tolkowsky of the Discount Investment Corporation. Uzia Galil graduated from the Technion – Israel Institute of Technology in 1947, and in 1948 joined the Israel Navy as an officer responsible for maintaining its Radio systems. In 1952 Uzia was sent to study for a master's degree in Electrical Engineering at Purdue University in the United States. During his studies in the United States, he worked at Motorola's research lab and was part of a team that developed of one of the world's first colour televisions. But in 1954 he had to return to Israel to complete another 4 years of service in Navy, which financed his studies.[1]
Founding Elron[edit]
Uzia Galil short experience working for Motorola in the United States exposed him to the technology industry and he decided to establish Israel's first high tech Startup company. He started the company, while still serving in Navy, in a friend's (Benjamin Sandller) flat in Haifa, later joined by another friend (Gideon Kirshner), who was a teacher at the Haifa Technical High-School, and worked with them in his spare time. The company's first products were measurement instruments for medical and electronic applications. In 1958 Uzia left the Navy, however the company did not generate enough revenues and he got a job at the Physics laboratory of the Technion; while there Moshe Arens, who was Professor of Aeronautics at the time, introduced him to Dan Tolkowsky. Dan, who was fascinated by Uzia's ideas, managed to convince the board of Discount Investment Corporation to provide the capital required to properly fund the company. Elron was officially formed in 1962 with an initial capital of $US 160,000, and within 3 years generated annual revenues of $1 millions.[1]
First joint venture – Elbit Computers Ltd.[edit]
In 1966, Shimon Peres, who at the time was the deputy defence minister, visited Elron and Uzia convinced him to establish a new company that will develop Minicomputers for defence applications. The new company, initially called Elbit Computers, was a joint venture with the Israel's Ministry of Defence and Elron (each holding 50% of the company). The company launched its first product in 1967 the Elbit-100 Minicomputer. The company evolved through the years to become the multinational defence electronics company – Elbit Systems (NASDAQ: ELBT).[1]
Founding Elscint[edit]
In 1969, Uzia convinced a talented engineer, Avraham Suhami, who just completed his PhD at the Technion, to join him and start a new company that will focus on the development of medical and scientific solutions, a new company - Elscint, a contraction of the words "electronic" and "scientific", was established again with the support of Dan Tolkowsky. The company developed medical imaging equipment, such as MRI and CT scanners. In 1972 Elscint was the first Israeli company to have an initial public offering on NASDAQ. By 1996, Elscint's revenues reached $311 million.[2]
Growth during the 1980s and 1990s[edit]
In 1981 Elron was involved in the establishment of a company that will later become Orbotech (NASDAQ: ORBK) a manufacturer of equipment for the Printed Circuit Board (PCB), TFT& LCD Display assembly industries.[3]
In 1983 Uzia met by chance, while waiting for a flight in the lounge of Ben Gurion International Airport, Levy Gerzberg an academic from Stanford University, who in 1981 founded Zoran Corporation (Zoran stands for "silicon" in Hebrew), which develops digital signal processing solutions. At the time Levy Gerzberg was looking for additional funding, which Elron was able to provide. In 1995, Zoran had an initial public offering on NASDAQ (NASDAQ: ZRAN) and later was the leading provider of complete OEM solutions for consumer electronics products, such as DVD and digital cameras, with annual revenues of over $500 million in 2007.[4]
In 1996, Elbit spun off into three independent companies:[5]

Elbit Medical Imaging NASDAQ: EMITF - during 1999 and 2000 both Elscint and Elbit Medical Imaging sold their imaging activities to General Electric Medical Systems NYSE: GE and to Picker (now part of Philips Medical Systems, NYSE: PHG for approximately $600 million.
Elbit Systems – Created as the defence electronics arm of Elbit and had an Initial public offering on NASDAQ.
Elbit - which focused on communications activities and in 1999 led the consortium that founded Partner Communications Company Ltd., Israel's first GSM operator NASDAQ: PTNR. In 2002 Elbit was merged into Elron. Elron sold its shares in Partner during 2003-2006 for approximately $160 million.

In 1998, Given Imaging (NASDAQ: GIVN), a developer of a video capsule for medical diagnostics, was founded.
2000s[edit]
During the 2000s, Elron started operating less as holding company and moved to act more as a venture capital fund, jointly investing in numerous start-up companies and realizing the investment by selling the companies or conducting an initial public offering. Notable investments and investment exits include:

Elron Software - a provider of spam, email and web filtering solutions, sold to Zix Corp.[6]
Oren Semiconductor - a fabless integrated circuits manufacturer that designs and develops integrated circuits for the digital television and set-top box markets, sold to Zoran Corporation.[7]
Galil Medical - a developer of cryotherapy solutions.[8]
SELA Semiconductor Engineering Laboratories - a provider of automated sample preparation tools for semiconductor manufacturers, sold to Camtek Intelligent Imaging.[8]
3DV Systems - developers of the ZCam, a time-of-flight camera products for video applications, sold to Microsoft.[9]
Medingo - developer of a micro pump insulin delivery system consists of two parts: a semi-disposable insulin dispensing patch and a remote control, which allows for discreet personalised insulin delivery. The company was sold to Hoffmann-La Roche's subsidiary Roche Diagnostics for $160 million as well as up to $40 million in milestone payments.[10]
Safend - a leading provider of endpoint data protection solutions was sold to Wave Systems.[11]
Wavion - a provider of outdoor Wi-Fi applications for metro and rural areas, acquired by Alvarion.[12]

Current holdings[edit]
In 2012, Elron celebrated its 50th anniversary and announced that it is refocusing solely on Medical Devices investment. As of 2013, it has holding in 7 companies in this market, including:

Given Imaging - a developer of a video capsule for medical diagnostics
Brainsgate - a medical device company developing a novel treatment modality, electrical SPG stimulation
Pocared - a developer of a real-time, fully automated laboratory system for the microbiology market

At the time Levy Gerzberg was looking for additional funding, which Elron was able to provide. In 1995, Zoran had an initial public offering on NASDAQ (NASDAQ: ZRAN) and later was the leading provider of complete OEM solutions for consumer electronics products, such as DVD and digital cameras, with annual revenues of over $500 million in 2007.[4]
In 1996, Elbit spun off into three independent companies:[5]

Elbit Medical Imaging NASDAQ: EMITF - during 1999 and 2000 both Elscint and Elbit Medical Imaging sold their imaging activities to General Electric Medical Systems NYSE: GE and to Picker (now part of Philips Medical Systems, NYSE: PHG for approximately $600 million.
Elbit Systems – Created as the defence electronics arm of Elbit and had an Initial public offering on NASDAQ.
Elbit - which focused on communications activities and in 1999 led the consortium that founded Partner Communications Company Ltd., Israel's first GSM operator NASDAQ: PTNR. In 2002 Elbit was merged into Elron. Elron sold its shares in Partner during 2003-2006 for approximately $160 million.

In 1998, Given Imaging (NASDAQ: GIVN), a developer of a video capsule for medical diagnostics, was founded.
2000s[edit]
During the 2000s, Elron started operating less as holding company and moved to act more as a venture capital fund, jointly investing in numerous start-up companies and realizing the investment by selling the companies or conducting an initial public offering. Notable investments and investment exits include:

Elron Software - a provider of spam, email and web filtering solutions, sold to Zix Corp.[6]
Oren Semiconductor - a fabless integrated circuits manufacturer that designs and develops integrated circuits for the digital television and set-top box markets, sold to Zoran Corporation.[7]
Galil Medical - a developer of cryotherapy solutions.[8]
SELA Semiconductor Engineering Laboratories - a provider of automated sample preparation tools for semiconductor manufacturers, sold to Camtek Intelligent Imaging.[8]

Medingo - developer of a micro pump insulin delivery system consists of two parts: a semi-disposable insulin dispensing patch and a remote control, which allows for discreet personalised insulin delivery. The company was sold to Hoffmann-La Roche's subsidiary Roche Diagnostics for $160 million as well as up to $40 million in milestone payments.[10]
Safend - a leading provider of endpoint data protection solutions was sold to Wave Systems.[11]
Wavion - a provider of outdoor Wi-Fi applications for metro and rural areas, acquired by Alvarion.[12]

History[edit]
Early years[edit]
Elron was founded in 1962 by Uzia Galil, with the support of Dan Tolkowsky of the Discount Investment Corporation. Uzia Galil graduated from the Technion – Israel Institute of Technology in 1947, and in 1948 joined the Israel Navy as an officer responsible for maintaining its Radio systems. In 1952 Uzia was sent to study for a master's degree in Electrical Engineering at Purdue University in the United States. During his studies in the United States, he worked at Motorola's research lab and was part of a team that developed of one of the world's first colour televisions. But in 1954 he had to return to Israel to complete another 4 years of service in Navy, which financed his studies.[1]
Founding Elron[edit]
Uzia Galil short experience working for Motorola in the United States exposed him to the technology industry and he decided to establish Israel's first high tech Startup company. He started the company, while still serving in Navy, in a friend's (Benjamin Sandller) flat in Haifa, later joined by another friend (Gideon Kirshner), who was a teacher at the Haifa Technical High-School, and worked with them in his spare time. The company's first products were measurement instruments for medical and electronic applications. In 1958 Uzia left the Navy, however the company did not generate enough revenues and he got a job at the Physics laboratory of the Technion; while there Moshe Arens, who was Professor of Aeronautics at the time, introduced him to Dan Tolkowsky. Dan, who was fascinated by Uzia's ideas, managed to convince the board of Discount Investment Corporation to provide the capital required to properly fund the company. Elron was officially formed in 1962 with an initial capital of $US 160,000, and within 3 years generated annual revenues of $1 millions.[1]
First joint venture – Elbit Computers Ltd.[edit]
In 1966, Shimon Peres, who at the time was the deputy defence minister, visited Elron and Uzia convinced him to establish a new company that will develop Minicomputers for defence applications. The new company, initially called Elbit Computers, was a joint venture with the Israel's Ministry of Defence and Elron (each holding 50% of the company). The company launched its first product in 1967 the Elbit-100 Minicomputer. The company evolved through the years to become the multinational defence electronics company – Elbit Systems (NASDAQ: ELBT).[1]
Founding Elscint[edit]
In 1969, Uzia convinced a talented engineer, Avraham Suhami, who just completed his PhD at the Technion, to join him and start a new company that will focus on the development of medical and scientific solutions, a new company - Elscint, a contraction of the words "electronic" and "scientific", was established again with the support of Dan Tolkowsky. The company developed medical imaging equipment, such as MRI and CT scanners. In 1972 Elscint was the first Israeli company to have an initial public offering on NASDAQ. By 1996, Elscint's revenues reached $311 million.[2]
Growth during the 1980s and 1990s[edit]
In 1981 Elron was involved in the establishment of a company that will later become Orbotech (NASDAQ: ORBK) a manufacturer of equipment for the Printed Circuit Board (PCB), TFT& LCD Display assembly industries.[3]

Elron – COMMITTED TO TURNING PROMISING IDEAS INTO GLOBAL INDUSTRY LEADERS
















 



















                We partner with early stage ventures to build companies that transform lives and industries.                






About Us


                Since 1962, Elron has been at the forefront of Israeli innovation, as founders and early investors in companies such as Elbit Systems, Elscint, Zoran, Partner, Netvision and Given Imaging. 

Today we remain committed to our vision of identifying transformative technologies, nurturing gifted entrepreneurs, and building companies into technology leaders. 
Our team is dedicated to attracting and supporting imaginative and focused entrepreneurs and startups with never-been-done-before ideas. Group companies benefit from our combined technological, strategic, entrepreneurial & business expertise, broad networks, and wide attention span.  
A word from our founder 





Where We Invest





 Medical Devices


                        We invest in treatment-changing (rather than treatment-enhancing) medical device companies. We seek companies with billion-$ market potential. We usually invest in the idea/R&D stage.                    




 Cyber


                        We invest in exceptional ideas and technologies with the potential to transform or create new markets, and help make the world a more secure place to live in. We seek investment opportunities from seed to growth stages.                     







How We Invest



We aim high.
We invest primarily in early stage ventures with significant exit potential, in which we seek significant shareholder stakes, enabling us to provide hands-on support and contribute from our experience.


We become involved.
We play a defining role in the development of our group companies, by means of active involvement in all aspects of their business and day-to-day operations, to help them reach their long-term objectives.


We are committed.
As an operational holding company that invests its own capital in new and existing group companies, we have the flexibility to support the growth of our group companies over the long term, weather setbacks, and maximize exit events.

1960s
Pioneering Defense




Elron was founded in 1962 by Uzia Galil (Israel Prize recipient) as a result of his decisive commitment to bridge the gap between Israeli R&D and industry, and create “a knowledge-based industry” (later named hi-tech…). Uzia succeeded in raising initial funds of $160,000. By the end of the decade, Elron had 500 employees and 7 holdings in the fields of defense, computers, medtech & electronics, and was represented in over 80 cities in 6 continents.


1962: 
                                           

                                        Elron is established
1966: Elron founds Elbit, the first Israeli commercial venture in the computer field, with a primary focus on defense, medical & communications technologies
Today Elbit Systems (NASDAQ: ESLT) is the largest non-government-owned defense company in Israel.






1970s
Pioneering Medical Imaging




In 1969, Elbit spun-off Elscint, which grew to become a world leader in the development of medical imaging technologies, forging a new technology: Computer Tomography (CT). In just over 10 years, the company achieved major breakthroughs, overshadowing the competition by reducing the scanning operation to seconds. It also entered the realm of ultrasound.


1972: 
                                           

                                        Elscint goes public, becoming the first Israeli company to list on Nasdaq
1975: Elron follows suit, going public on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange
Before its sale in 1999, Elscint enjoyed a 10% world market share, had $300 million in revenues, and 3,000 employees.






1980s
Pioneering Semiconductors




By the 1980s, Elron had devised a strategy of nursing in-house projects to be later spun-off (in time to be known as an “incubator”…). During these years, Elron established Oprotech, which pioneered automated optical inspection of printed circuit boards, and was actively involved in the early stages of the establishment of Zoran, a pioneer in the development of digital signal processing (DSP) technology.


1981: 
                                           

                                        Elron invests in Zoran (merged with CSR in 2011, LSE: CSR)
1981: Elron establishes Oprotech (today Orbotech, NASDAQ: ORBK)
1983: Elron invests in Zoran (merged with CSR in 2011, LSE: CSR)
At the close of the decade, Elron had $420 million in aggregate annual sales.






1990s
Pioneering Communication




Driven by its commitment to “building on the successes of the past while anticipating future trends”, in the early 1990s, Elron was one of the internet pioneers in Israel, expanding into information technologies and communications by the end of the decade. Landmark companies founded by Elron during these years include Partner Communication, Israel’s first GSM operator, and NetVision, Israel’s first – and later largest – ISP.


1993: 
                                           

                                        Rafael Development Corporation (RDC) is established to commercialize Israeli MoD technologies in civilian markets
1994: Elron founds NetVision (merged with CellCom in 2011, NYSE: CEL)
1997: Elron founds Partner Communication (NASDAQ: PTNR)
By the mid-1990s Elron had $1.2 billion in aggregate annual sales.






2000s
Pioneering Medical Devices




Through RDC, a joint subsidiary of Elron and Rafael (Israel’s 2nd largest defense company after Elbit Systems) which has exclusive rights to commercialize Rafael’s technologies in civilian markets, Elron has incubated and developed several technology leaders, most notably in the field of medical devices. Given Imaging redefined gastrointestinal disease diagnosis by developing the PillCam ingestible video capsule. Another RDC success is Medingo, which developed a miniature, lightweight insulin pump.


2001: 
                                           

                                        Given Imaging goes public, and is the 1st company to list on the Nasdaq following 9/11
2005: Medingo, developer of an insulin micro-pump, is founded by RDC
In the 2000s, Elron added BrainsGate and Pocared to its portfolio, as part of its strategy of investing in transformative medtech startups.






2010s
Building tomorrow’s leaders




Today, we have significant holdings in a select number of start-up companies with disruptive potential. We are constantly and actively looking at new exciting ventures in order to continue and build tomorrow’s technology leaders. We continue to target investments in the medical devices field, and have also expanded our focus to the cyber space.


"Looking ahead, Elron should always understand that the ever evolving changes in the high tech industry will be exponential, and therefore, success will depend on choosing the right niches in the world market in which it can maintain and improve its relative advantage."  -Uzia Galil

A word from our founder 





Where We Invest





 Medical Devices


                        We invest in treatment-changing (rather than treatment-enhancing) medical device companies. We seek companies with billion-$ market potential. We usually invest in the idea/R&D stage.                    




 Cyber


                        We invest in exceptional ideas and technologies with the potential to transform or create new markets, and help make the world a more secure place to live in. We seek investment opportunities from seed to growth stages.                     







How We Invest



We aim high.
We invest primarily in early stage ventures with significant exit potential, in which we seek significant shareholder stakes, enabling us to provide hands-on support and contribute from our experience.


We become involved.
We play a defining role in the development of our group companies, by means of active involvement in all aspects of their business and day-to-day operations, to help them reach their long-term objectives.


We are committed.
As an operational holding company that invests its own capital in new and existing group companies, we have the flexibility to support the growth of our group companies over the long term, weather setbacks, and maximize exit events.

1960s
Pioneering Defense




Elron was founded in 1962 by Uzia Galil (Israel Prize recipient) as a result of his decisive commitment to bridge the gap between Israeli R&D and industry, and create “a knowledge-based industry” (later named hi-tech…). Uzia succeeded in raising initial funds of $160,000. By the end of the decade, Elron had 500 employees and 7 holdings in the fields of defense, computers, medtech & electronics, and was represented in over 80 cities in 6 continents.


1962: 
                                           

                                        Elron is established
1966: Elron founds Elbit, the first Israeli commercial venture in the computer field, with a primary focus on defense, medical & communications technologies
Today Elbit Systems (NASDAQ: ESLT) is the largest non-government-owned defense company in Israel.






1970s
Pioneering Medical Imaging




In 1969, Elbit spun-off Elscint, which grew to become a world leader in the development of medical imaging technologies, forging a new technology: Computer Tomography (CT). In just over 10 years, the company achieved major breakthroughs, overshadowing the competition by reducing the scanning operation to seconds. It also entered the realm of ultrasound.


1972: 
                                           

                                        Elscint goes public, becoming the first Israeli company to list on Nasdaq
1975: Elron follows suit, going public on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange
Before its sale in 1999, Elscint enjoyed a 10% world market share, had $300 million in revenues, and 3,000 employees.






1980s
Pioneering Semiconductors




By the 1980s, Elron had devised a strategy of nursing in-house projects to be later spun-off (in time to be known as an “incubator”…). During these years, Elron established Oprotech, which pioneered automated optical inspection of printed circuit boards, and was actively involved in the early stages of the establishment of Zoran, a pioneer in the development of digital signal processing (DSP) technology.


1981: 
                                           

                                        Elron invests in Zoran (merged with CSR in 2011, LSE: CSR)
1981: Elron establishes Oprotech (today Orbotech, NASDAQ: ORBK)
1983: Elron invests in Zoran (merged with CSR in 2011, LSE: CSR)
At the close of the decade, Elron had $420 million in aggregate annual sales.






1990s
Pioneering Communication




Driven by its commitment to “building on the successes of the past while anticipating future trends”, in the early 1990s, Elron was one of the internet pioneers in Israel, expanding into information technologies and communications by the end of the decade. Landmark companies founded by Elron during these years include Partner Communication, Israel’s first GSM operator, and NetVision, Israel’s first – and later largest – ISP.


1993: 
                                           

                                        Rafael Development Corporation (RDC) is established to commercialize Israeli MoD technologies in civilian markets
1994: Elron founds NetVision (merged with CellCom in 2011, NYSE: CEL)
1997: Elron founds Partner Communication (NASDAQ: PTNR)
By the mid-1990s Elron had $1.2 billion in aggregate annual sales.






2000s
Pioneering Medical Devices




Through RDC, a joint subsidiary of Elron and Rafael (Israel’s 2nd largest defense company after Elbit Systems) which has exclusive rights to commercialize Rafael’s technologies in civilian markets, Elron has incubated and developed several technology leaders, most notably in the field of medical devices. Given Imaging redefined gastrointestinal disease diagnosis by developing the PillCam ingestible video capsule. Another RDC success is Medingo, which developed a miniature, lightweight insulin pump.


2001: 
                                           

                                        Given Imaging goes public, and is the 1st company to list on the Nasdaq following 9/11
2005: Medingo, developer of an insulin micro-pump, is founded by RDC
In the 2000s, Elron added BrainsGate and Pocared to its portfolio, as part of its strategy of investing in transformative medtech startups.






2010s
Building tomorrow’s leaders




Today, we have significant holdings in a select number of start-up companies with disruptive potential. We are constantly and actively looking at new exciting ventures in order to continue and build tomorrow’s technology leaders. We continue to target investments in the medical devices field, and have also expanded our focus to the cyber space.


"Looking ahead, Elron should always understand that the ever evolving changes in the high tech industry will be exponential, and therefore, success will depend on choosing the right niches in the world market in which it can maintain and improve its relative advantage."  -Uzia Galil
