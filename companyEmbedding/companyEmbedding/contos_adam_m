RE/MAX Names Adam Contos Co-CEO

Co-Founder Dave Liniger to Share CEO Responsibilities




May 30, 2017, 4:01pm EDT














DENVER, May 30, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- RE/MAX Holdings, Inc. (the "Company") (NYSE: RMAX), announced today the appointment, effective immediately, of Chief Operating Officer (COO) Adam Contos to RE/MAX Co-Chief Executive Officer (Co-CEO), sharing responsibilities with Co-Founder and now Co-CEO Dave Liniger. The company is the parent company of RE/MAX, LLC, one of the world's leading franchisors of real estate brokerage services, and Motto Franchising, LLC, franchisor of the innovative Motto Mortgage network of mortgage brokerages. The appointment allows Liniger to focus on furthering the company's leadership position in the industry while driving special strategic initiatives.



"I'm proud to have Adam, who has successfully led many key functions in our business over the last 13 years, partner with me at the CEO position," said Liniger. "We have a talented and dedicated group of leaders at RE/MAX and I've been actively working with them to build our future. Under Adam's leadership, I know this dynamic team will further our position as the number one name in real estate."
RE/MAX has employed the Co-CEO structure in several of its CEO transitions. The approach ensures continuity in RE/MAX leadership, in its successful and unique business model, and in the overall company strategy.
"We're fortunate to have a deep and talented executive team at RE/MAX. They share the same drive and desire to succeed that I had when I created this company over 44 years ago," Liniger continued. "We're all strongly aligned around the core strategy, values, culture and mission that have made this company great. I'm confident that the strength of our management team supported by our exceptional agents, brokers, franchise owners and employees will continue to drive our future growth and success."
As COO, Contos managed RE/MAX daily operations including IT, HR, Business Development, Events, Brand Marketing, Communications, Media and Public Relations. 
"Dave's founding principles and culture of success along with the dedication of RE/MAX agents and owners have made RE/MAX the greatest real estate company in the world," said Contos. "I'm honored to drive RE/MAX forward on behalf of over 110,000 agents who represent this iconic brand by delivering exceptional service to their clients. We will continue to advance RE/MAX and the real estate industry by delivering the products and services that have made our franchisees and agents so successful for the last four decades."
Contos joined RE/MAX in 2004 working with offices in the Mountain States Region and was promoted to the Region's Vice President the following year. Between 2007 and 2013 he served as Region Vice President first for the California & Hawaii Region and later the RE/MAX Florida Region. He was promoted to Vice President, Region Development, in 2013 and then to Senior Vice President, Marketing, in February 2015. During his Marketing tenure, he and the business development team built a robust franchise sales process that fueled record growth. And in 2016, Contos was named Chief Operating Officer.
Serene Smith, Senior Vice President of Financial Planning and Business Analytics, succeeds Contos as Chief Operating Officer. Smith joined RE/MAX in 2006 as the Senior Manager of Internal Audit and was named Vice President, Financial Planning and Analysis, in 2014 and a Senior Vice President in January 2016. 
RE/MAX recently celebrated an impressive 2016, with the largest agent growth since the recession in early 2008 along with successfully launching Motto Mortgage, the first franchise mortgage concept in the United States. RE/MAX grew to over 110,000 agents last year and has a presence in 100 countries and territories, a global footprint unmatched by any other real estate brand.
RE/MAX Co-CEO Adam Contos BiographyAs a respected and tenured RE/MAX leader, Liniger and the RE/MAX Board of Directors hand-selected COO Adam Contos as Co-CEO. Contos not only has a passion and love for RE/MAX franchisees, agents and the Denver headquarters' staff, but he is especially driven to move RE/MAX and the entire industry forward through technology and innovation.
Like Liniger, Contos has military experience, having served in the US Marine Corps Reserve in the early 1990s until he was honorably discharged as a sergeant in 1996. After his service, Contos worked for the Douglas County Sheriff's Office in Colorado from 1993 to 2004 and first encountered RE/MAX when he introduced the S.A.F.E.R. (Safety Awareness for Every REALTOR) program to the company. He was then hired by the company as a Senior Franchise Development Consultant in Business Development, working his way up through a number of leadership positions until he was promoted to Chief Operating Officer in January 2016.
Under his leadership, Contos' teams have launched major initiatives like a redesigned remax.com, a new franchise brand, Motto Mortgage, successful agent recruiting and retention campaigns and the highly lauded 2016 and 2017 national advertising campaigns. 
About the RE/MAX NetworkRE/MAX was founded in 1973 by David and Gail Liniger, with an innovative, entrepreneurial culture affording its agents and franchisees the flexibility to operate their businesses with great independence. Over 110,000 agents provide RE/MAX a global reach of over 100 countries and territories. Nobody sells more real estate than RE/MAX as measured by total residential transaction sides.
RE/MAX, one of the world's leading franchisors of real estate brokerage services, and Motto Mortgage, an innovative mortgage brokerage franchise, are subsidiaries of RMCO, which is controlled and managed by RE/MAX Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: RMAX).

RE/MAX Appoints COO Adam Contos to Co-CEO Alongside Dave Liniger

 

 


Share This Post Now!




















RE/MAX has appointed chief operating officer Adam Contos to co-chief executive officer, effectively immediately, the company announced on Tuesday. Contos will share responsibilities with now Co-CEO Dave Liniger, co-founder of the company, who will “focus on furthering the company’s leadership position in the industry while driving special strategic initiatives,” according to a release on the announcement. Senior Vice President of Financial Planning Serene Smith will succeed Contos as COO.
“I’m proud to have Adam, who has successfully led many key functions in our business over the last 13 years, partner with me at the CEO position,” says Liniger. “We have a talented and dedicated group of leaders at RE/MAX and I’ve been actively working with them to build our future. Under Adam’s leadership, I know this dynamic team will further our position as the No. 1 name in real estate.”
“Dave’s founding principles and culture of success along with the dedication of RE/MAX agents and owners have made RE/MAX the greatest real estate company in the world,” says Contos. “I’m honored to drive RE/MAX forward on behalf of over 110,000 agents who represent this iconic brand by delivering exceptional service to their clients. We will continue to advance RE/MAX and the real estate industry by delivering the products and services that have made our franchisees and agents so successful for the last four decades.” 



Contos was named COO in 2016, responsible for managing the company’s daily operations, including in brand marketing, business development, communications, events, HR, IT and media and public relations. Contos previously served as senior vice president of Marketing for 14 years.
“The appointment of Adam Contos to co-CEO at RE/MAX by their legendary founder, Dave Liniger, and the board of directors, continues the organization’s movement to equip the worldwide real estate franchise system with the next generation of highly-skilled senior executive leadership,” says John Featherston, president, CEO and publisher of RISMedia. “RE/MAX is one of the biggest and best in the business, and this move sets the organization on-course to continued success, while providing the flexibility to adapt and thrive in the future. Contos has proven to be an extremely dynamic leader, and a widely-respected executive both within the RE/MAX organization as well as the entire real estate industry.”
“We’re fortunate to have a deep and talented executive team at RE/MAX,” Liniger says. “They share the same drive and desire to succeed that I had when I created this company over 44 years ago. We’re all strongly aligned around the core strategy, values, culture and mission that have made this company great. I’m confident that the strength of our management team supported by our exceptional agents, brokers, franchise owners and employees will continue to drive our future growth and success.”


RE/MAX, founded in 1973, is one of the preeminent forces in real estate, continually growing its global footprint of more than 110,000 agents in over 100 countries and territories. The company expanded into Barbados, Latvia and Trinidad and Tobago in the first quarter of 2017, and, in 2016, reached a total of 30,000 agents outside the U.S. and Canada.
RE/MAX Holdings, Inc., is the parent company of RE/MAX, LLC and Motto Mortgage, LLC.
