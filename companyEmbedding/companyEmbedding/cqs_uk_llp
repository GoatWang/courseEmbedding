CQS (Hedge Fund) - Wikipedia





















 






CQS (Hedge Fund)

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


					Jump to:					navigation, 					search

CQS is a London-based global multi-strategy credit asset management firm.[1] It focuses on the areas of convertibles, asset backed securities, credit, loans and equities.
In 2007 it was a founder member of the Hedge Fund Standards Board which sets a voluntary code of standards of best practice endorsed by its members.[2]
CQS was included in Institutional Investor's 2012[3] and 2013[4] lists of the Top single-manager hedge fund firms by assets under management and Barron's 2012[5] and 2013[6] lists of the "Best 100 Hedge Funds". Bloomberg ranked the CQS Directional Opportunities Fund #3 on its list of the top-performing large hedge funds in 2012.[7]
In May 2013, CQS was given three awards at the Financial News Awards for Excellence in Institutional Hedge Fund Management, Europe: Best Hedge Fund Manager Overall, Best Hedge Fund Manager in Credit, and Best Multi-Hedge Fund Manager.[8]
CQS is known for its successful bets in the US subprime mortgage market.[9]
In May 2012, CQS was reported to be on the opposite side of the infamous JPMorgan trade by Bruno Iskil, in which JPMorgan lost more than $2billion because of its massive position in U.S. credit derivatives.[10]
According to Dow Jones,[11] CQS’s asset-backed fund and Directional Opportunities fund have both posted double digit returns for the first half of 2012.
Adam Werritty reportedly once had a desk at the company’s London base.[12]

CQS (Hedge Fund)

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


					Jump to:					navigation, 					search

CQS is a London-based global multi-strategy credit asset management firm.[1] It focuses on the areas of convertibles, asset backed securities, credit, loans and equities.
In 2007 it was a founder member of the Hedge Fund Standards Board which sets a voluntary code of standards of best practice endorsed by its members.[2]
CQS was included in Institutional Investor's 2012[3] and 2013[4] lists of the Top single-manager hedge fund firms by assets under management and Barron's 2012[5] and 2013[6] lists of the "Best 100 Hedge Funds". Bloomberg ranked the CQS Directional Opportunities Fund #3 on its list of the top-performing large hedge funds in 2012.[7]
In May 2013, CQS was given three awards at the Financial News Awards for Excellence in Institutional Hedge Fund Management, Europe: Best Hedge Fund Manager Overall, Best Hedge Fund Manager in Credit, and Best Multi-Hedge Fund Manager.[8]
CQS is known for its successful bets in the US subprime mortgage market.[9]
In May 2012, CQS was reported to be on the opposite side of the infamous JPMorgan trade by Bruno Iskil, in which JPMorgan lost more than $2billion because of its massive position in U.S. credit derivatives.[10]
According to Dow Jones,[11] CQS’s asset-backed fund and Directional Opportunities fund have both posted double digit returns for the first half of 2012.
Adam Werritty reportedly once had a desk at the company’s London base.[12]
As of December 2015, the firm managed $12.6bn in assets.[13]
