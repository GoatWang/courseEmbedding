Ideal for use on roads and highways. Cool climates – flexible to 10°F.Sizes Available50 lb. box with two 25 lb. cubes per box.CoverageUse the following chart as a guideline for estimating material requirements (based upon pounds of material needed for 100 feet of cracks):Crack WidthDepth.lbs/100 ft.3/8″3/8″6.2 lbs.1/2″1/2″11.0 lbs.3/4″3/4″24.8 lbs.The above coverage rates are only a guideline. Actual material usage may vary due to width of application and thickness of material above pavement surfaces.DescriptionCrackMaster™ 5078 is a hot-pour crack and joint sealant for portland cement and asphaltic pavements. As an economical and effective preventative maintenance treatment, CrackMaster™ 5078 prolongs pavement life by sealing cracks and surface joints from water penetration. CrackMaster™ 5078 is a single component, specially formulated mixture of paving grade asphalt, vulcanized crumb rubber, plasticizers, and stabilizers. When melted and properly applied, it forms a resilient and adhesive compound for both cement and asphaltic pavements.UsesCrackMaster™ 5078 is recommended for sealing cracks and joints in portland cement, asphaltic pavements, and parking lots. It is designed to seal expansion and contraction joints, longitudinal and transverse cracks, joints between concrete and asphaltic shoulders, and random cracks.Mixing ProceduresUse material as supplied. Do not blend with other materials. After CrackMaster™ 5078 is melted it should be agitated or recirculated.ApplicationApply heated CrackMaster™ 5078 using either a pump and wand system or a pour pot. For best results the sealant depth to width ratio should not exceed 2 to 1 (i.e. 2-inches deep to 1-inch wide). The cooled sealant height should not exceed 1/8″ above surrounding pavement. Using a sealing shoe or squeegee, band the material 2 to 3 inches wide over the crack.ImportantProtective apparel is recommended with application of CrackMaster™ 5078. The extremely hot material will cause severe burns on contact with skin. OSHA Safety Regulations require workers to wear the following types of safety attire (see current OSHA/Safety Regulations for additional information): Hard hat with face shield; long sleeved shirt buttoned at the wrist; heat resistant gloves; long, cuffless pants; and safety toed work boots. Make certain all area around melter is clear of all debris and flammable materials. Avoid breathing vapors. Use with adequate ventilation.Clean UpWash tools in water before material dries.DownloadMSDS (PDF)Spec Sheet (PDF)CatalogUnit SizeUnit Weight50 lb Box50 lbs    SELECT YOUR AREA Sealcoating ContractorProperty ManagerRoad MaintenanceSport SurfacingArchitect/EngineerFranchise Opportunity LOCATIONS Locate InstallersContact a Location  FRANCHISE LOGINVIEW PARTS ONLINE PRODUCTS & SERVICES Pavement SealersSealer AdditivesCrack FillersPreparation & RepairTraffic PaintsConcrete ProductsDust SuppressantEquipmentTools & AccessoriesSport SurfacingParts RESOURCES Information LibraryProduct Technical Data (TDS)Engineering SpecsCertificatesMSDSCredit ApplicationSealcoat Material CalculatorTank Volume CalculatorBrochures & Catalogs MEDIA Video COMPANY Contact UsCareersNewsBlogFacebookTwitterInstagramYouTubeGoogle+LinkedInPrivacy Policy         Scroll to top

All drawers have strong, time-tested English or French dovetail construction, for years of problem-free use. Plywood drawer bottoms are attached to plywood drawer sides for strength and durability. Metal side guides or wood on wood guide systems operate smoothly. Finish Construction Hooker Furniture utilizes a multiple-step finish process of up to 16 finish steps. This results in an unsurpassed clarity, depth and color richness and durability to our finishes. Through hand-craftsmanship such as rubbing and padding, our finishes feel as good as they look, with a smoothness that is delightful to the touch. Frame Construction Hooker Furniture uses carefully chosen solid wood and select wood veneers over durable wood products in our furniture construction. Use of veneers enables more decorative looks unattainable with solid wood. Veneers are used over durable wood products such as medium density fiberboard (MDF) and particle board, made of renewable resources. MDF and particle board are used in quality furniture for areas that need to be stable, such as large surfaces. These durable wood products do not expand and contract with heat and cold and do not absorb moisture as much as solid wood, which results in stronger and longer-lasting furniture.
