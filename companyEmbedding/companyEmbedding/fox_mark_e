Product information
Includes download code for the remixes, plus 19 tracks from the Needwant: 5 Years digital release



Review
The lads and lasses behind the Needwant label are getting generous in their old age. This 12" sampler for their 5th anniversary compilation, for example, comes with a code to download not only the fresh remixes presented here, but also the 19-track collection itself. The material here is predictably strong, with Urulu's murky, spacious and stripped back take on Maxxi Soundsystem's "Make Or Break" vying for "top dog" honours with The Revenge's strobe-friendly, nu-disco-goes-vintage house revision of James Fox's "Holding On". Elsewhere, Mark E provides a typically woozy, deep and melodious rework of his own "We Could Love", while Nicholas turns Kim Ann Foxman's "Hypnotic Dance" into a "Good Life" style '89 house anthem.


Played by
KAT Djs, Nicholas, Urulu, 6th Borough Project
