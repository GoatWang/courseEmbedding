History[edit]
Calyon was created in May 2004 by the transfer of assets from Crédit Lyonnais' Corporate and Investment Banking division to Crédit Agricole Indosuez (CAI), which had been created in 1996 with the purchase of Banque Indosuez by Crédit Agricole.
The division was rebranded Credit Agricole Corporate & Investment Bank (CACIB) in Feb 2010.
The bank's commitments[edit]
CSR (Corporate Social Responsibility)[edit]
Crédit Agricole CIB is committed as far as Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) is concerned. One example is FReD,[3] a Crédit Agricole S.A program to enhance CSR: action plans cover environmental aspects (recycling, biodiversity…), employee-related projects (background and gender equality, handicap) and customer-related issues (fight against fraud, protection of personal data …). These plans are monitored by progress indicators.
Patronage[edit]
Since 2009 Crédit Agricole CIB has been a patron of the musée du quai Branly[4] and since 2010 of the Théâtre du Châtelet. For several years, Crédit Agricole CIB has participated in the Financial Community Telethon,[5] an event which takes place in December as part of the National Telethon.
Business Lines[edit]
Its activities are arranged into two major divisions, Capital Markets & Investment Banking Division and Financing Division.
Structured Finance[edit]
Air transportation and rail, shipping, real estate, natural resources, infrastructure and power, energy, acquisition finance, transactional commodity finance, tax based leases.
Investment Banking[edit]
In France and worldwide, Crédit Agricole CIB advises clients on top-half of the balance sheet transactions and specialised financing.
Fixed Income[edit]

Sales and trading activities on the primary and secondary markets (foreign exchange, credit, government rates, securitisation and treasury).
Debt Optimisation and Distribution strategy. An approach created in 2012 with the new Distribute-to-Originate model, Debt Optimisation and Distribution originates, structures and arranges syndicated and bilateral medium-term and long-term loans for corporates and financial institutions.
Won awards for primary issuance in the Euro-denominated bond markets. Ranked 5 in 2011 and ranked 4 in 2012 for Dealogic all-Euro bond issuance (across all asset classes).

Commercial Banking and Trade[edit]
Commercial banking services non-financial companies and financial institutions: non-structured financings, guarantees and sureties, export and trade finance, cash management and liability management.
Historical Lines[edit]
In 2011, Crédit Agricole CIB announced the closing of equity derivatives and commodities.
Notable Events[edit]
Trading Losses[edit]
In September 2007, a Crédit Agricole CIB New York trader lost the firm €250M (US$320M). He had taken unusual positions beyond authorization and delegation. He was fired, as well as five other salaried employees from the firm's New York branch.[6]
Financial Crisis (needs expansion)[edit]
Credit Agricole lost €857m ($1.1bn, £657m) in the fourth quarter of 2007, primarily as a result of the €3.3bn charge on losses attributed to the credit crisis. [7]
Rebranding[edit]
As of 6 February 2010, Calyon changed its name to Credit Agricole Corporate and Investment Bank (Crédit Agricole CIB).[8]

History[edit]
Calyon was created in May 2004 by the transfer of assets from Crédit Lyonnais' Corporate and Investment Banking division to Crédit Agricole Indosuez (CAI), which had been created in 1996 with the purchase of Banque Indosuez by Crédit Agricole.
The division was rebranded Credit Agricole Corporate & Investment Bank (CACIB) in Feb 2010.
The bank's commitments[edit]
CSR (Corporate Social Responsibility)[edit]
Crédit Agricole CIB is committed as far as Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) is concerned. One example is FReD,[3] a Crédit Agricole S.A program to enhance CSR: action plans cover environmental aspects (recycling, biodiversity…), employee-related projects (background and gender equality, handicap) and customer-related issues (fight against fraud, protection of personal data …). These plans are monitored by progress indicators.
Patronage[edit]
Since 2009 Crédit Agricole CIB has been a patron of the musée du quai Branly[4] and since 2010 of the Théâtre du Châtelet. For several years, Crédit Agricole CIB has participated in the Financial Community Telethon,[5] an event which takes place in December as part of the National Telethon.
Business Lines[edit]
Its activities are arranged into two major divisions, Capital Markets & Investment Banking Division and Financing Division.
Structured Finance[edit]
Air transportation and rail, shipping, real estate, natural resources, infrastructure and power, energy, acquisition finance, transactional commodity finance, tax based leases.
Investment Banking[edit]
In France and worldwide, Crédit Agricole CIB advises clients on top-half of the balance sheet transactions and specialised financing.
Fixed Income[edit]

Sales and trading activities on the primary and secondary markets (foreign exchange, credit, government rates, securitisation and treasury).
Debt Optimisation and Distribution strategy. An approach created in 2012 with the new Distribute-to-Originate model, Debt Optimisation and Distribution originates, structures and arranges syndicated and bilateral medium-term and long-term loans for corporates and financial institutions.
Won awards for primary issuance in the Euro-denominated bond markets. Ranked 5 in 2011 and ranked 4 in 2012 for Dealogic all-Euro bond issuance (across all asset classes).

Commercial Banking and Trade[edit]
Commercial banking services non-financial companies and financial institutions: non-structured financings, guarantees and sureties, export and trade finance, cash management and liability management.
Historical Lines[edit]
In 2011, Crédit Agricole CIB announced the closing of equity derivatives and commodities.
Notable Events[edit]
Trading Losses[edit]
In September 2007, a Crédit Agricole CIB New York trader lost the firm €250M (US$320M). He had taken unusual positions beyond authorization and delegation. He was fired, as well as five other salaried employees from the firm's New York branch.[6]
Financial Crisis (needs expansion)[edit]
Credit Agricole lost €857m ($1.1bn, £657m) in the fourth quarter of 2007, primarily as a result of the €3.3bn charge on losses attributed to the credit crisis. [7]
Rebranding[edit]
As of 6 February 2010, Calyon changed its name to Credit Agricole Corporate and Investment Bank (Crédit Agricole CIB).[8]
