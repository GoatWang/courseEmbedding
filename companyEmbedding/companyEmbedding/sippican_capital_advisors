Client Services



Investment Strategy and 
Management


Sippican Capital Advisors works with its clients to develop an individualized, dynamic portfolio that meets the clients’ financial objectives and respects their risk tolerance. The clients and the Advisor complete this process of strategic planning before active investment management begins. Once this process is completed, Sippican Capital Advisors will create a unique portfolio of individual securities in line with the investment strategy.




Trusteeship


The principals of Sippican Capital Advisors are trustees to many clients’ trusts. The principals acting in their capacity as trustees are given legal discretion over the trust property to manage the assets held in the trust, carry out the terms of the instrument and advise on a wide range of personal financial considerations.




Estate Planning and 
Settlement


Sippican Capital Advisors works with clients to help manage the transition of their assets to future generations while considering the tax consequences of such transfers. In this regard, the advisor can work with the client’s attorney or accountant or can refer the client to a law firm for this purpose. Going through this process prior to involving a law firm will generally result in lower legal fees.
 
Sippican Capital Advisors can also assist in the settlement of clients' estates.




Custody and 
Record Keeping


Sippican Capital Advisors does not provide custody services or brokerage services. Clients may select a custodian bank or brokerage firm to hold their securities. Fidelity Institutional Wealth Services acts as custodian for the vast majority of the advisor’s clients but Sippican Capital Advisors manages assets for clients that are held at banks or other brokerage firms. The advisor can assist in helping with these arrangements.
 
Sippican Capital Advisors produces a variety of management reports including asset holdings and measures of performance that are delivered to clients independent of those provided by the custodian. Clients generally receive quarterly reports; however, they may choose to receive them monthly.




Ancillary Services


In an effort to support all aspects of our client’s financial responsibilities, Sippican Capital Advisors assists in the following areas: 
 
Bill payment 
Estimated tax payments
Residential mortgages 
Household and personal insurance 
Referrals for professional services




Tax Preparation


Sippican Capital Advisors can provide for the preparation of a client’s personal tax return as well as a fiduciary return for a client’s trust. The Advisor also works with outside accountants to facilitate the preparation of clients' tax returns.




Philanthropic Strategies


Sippican Capital Advisors can work with clients to incorporate philantropic strategies into their comprehensive estate management and planning.

Investment Management



Client Goals


Sippican Capital Advisors develops a precise understanding of a client’s financial situation before it creates and implements an appropriate investment plan. This assessment includes both near and long-term investment goals and a consideration of the individual’s non-financial assets such as real estate, business assets and possible inheritance. In addition, the Advisor contemplates the client’s risk tolerance, income needs, investment horizons, tax requirements and generational issues.
 
Sippican Capital Advisors develops close productive relationships with their clients. These relationships enable the Advisor to understand clearly the client’s personal and generational goals and align them effectively with the client's investment strategies. We strongly encourage our clients' involvement in the investment process and work to keep them informed and engaged through regular communication and personal meetings.




Investment Philosophy


Portfolios are constructed primarily based on the proper asset allocation consistent with the client’s investment goals. The Advisor pays specific attention to requirements for income, liquidity, capital appreciation, tax efficiency and risk tolerance. For the most part, portfolios comprise individual stocks or bonds and mutual funds and ETFs. Mutual funds and ETFs are used to augment the portfolio where individual holdings – such as international stocks or high-yield bonds – present a higher level of risk. The client may also impose investment restrictions, and this consideration is also part of the process of suitable asset allocation.

What are analysts saying about Abbott Laboratories stock?

Here are some recent quotes from research analysts about Abbott Laboratories stock: 
1. According to Zacks Investment Research, "For the majority of last one month, Abbott is trading above the broader Medical Products industry. We are optimistic about the company’s strong and consistent EPD and Medical Devices performance in the last reported first quarter. Overall, the company stands to benefit from the ongoing integration and synergy achievement of St. Jude. We are also looking forward to the company’s plans to focus on selling portfolio in core therapeutic areas. Recently, Abbott received CE mark for its TactiCath Sensor and Confirm Rx ICM products which is quite encouraging. The company also launched science-based nutrition drinks for better recovery from surgeries. On the flip side, Abbott’s sluggish pediatric business in China continues to hamper growth. Management is also concerned about the on-going economic problem in Venezuela that is expected to remain unresolved in the coming quarters." (6/21/2017)
2. Jefferies Group LLC analysts commented, "Investment summary: We are reiterating our Overweight rating for CORI and we are raising our PT by $2 to $12 following the positive donepezil patch bioequivalence results. Progress in the development of a proprietary pipeline is key, in our opinion, to the performance of the shares. Successful development of patch formulations of donepezil (Aricept) and/or memantine (Namenda) should position the company well to more-effectively monetize the transdermal drug delivery platform, in our opinion. Retention of meaningful commercialization rights could enable the company to turn the corner and pursue other opportunities more broadly, in our opinion. Corplex donepezil pilot study shows bioequivalence. Management reported that the Corplex donepezil pilot study met the FDA statistical criteria for bioequivalence. We note, too, that the patch was well-tolerated, with good skin and GI tolerability." (5/12/2017)

Analyst Ratings
Consensus Ratings for Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) (How are Consensus Ratings Calculated?) MarketBeat calculates consensus ratings using the most recent rating from each brokerage that has rated a stock within the last twelve months. Since brokers often use different ratings systems, each rating is normalized to a standardized rating score of 1 (sell), 2 (hold), 3 (buy) or 4 (strong buy). Consensus ratings scores are calculated using the mean average of the number of normalized sell, hold, buy and strong buy ratings. Each stock's consensus rating is derived from its calculated consensus ratings score (0-1.5 = Sell, 1.5-2.5 = Hold, 2.5-3.5 = Buy, >3.5 = Strong Buy). MarketBeat's consensus price targets are a mean average of the most recent available price targets set by each analyst that has set a price target for the stock in the last twelve months.MarketBeat will no longer include ratings and price target data in its consensus calculation if a broker drops coverage and MarketBeat has received a report that coverage was dropped. Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.Ratings Breakdown: 3 Hold Ratings, 11 Buy RatingsConsensus Rating:Buy (Score: 2.79)Consensus Price Target: $52.77 (5.31% upside)
