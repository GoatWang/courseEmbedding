The assays come from five new stepout holes - three at South Ayawilca, and one at West Ayawilca




 

Tinka Resources' project is in Peru..








Tinka Resources Ltd (CVE:TK) told investors about further encouraging drill results at its Ayawilca project in central Peru, which continues to expand the South Ayawilca area.

	The assays come from five new stepout holes - three at South Ayawilca, and one at West Ayawilca (A17-074).

	Meanwhile, another hole - A17-073 -  was drilled at Zone 3, the first hole into this new target, where sulphide mineralization was encountered, mostly pyrite with minor sphalerite, over a 15-metre interval, the firm said.

	At West Ayawilca, 2.2 metres at 31 % zinc, 0.1 % lead and 138 g/t (grams per ton) silver from 71.4 metres depth were enocuntered.

	At South Ayawilca, a highlight was 20.8 metres at 5% zinc, 11 g/t silver an 44 g/t indium from 359 metres depth.

	"We are very pleased with these new drill results. The zinc discovery at South Ayawilca continues to expand southward, and remains open in several directions," said Dr Graham Carman, Tinka's president and chief executive.

	He added that a high-grade silver (zinc-lead) discovery in one hole was also exciting as it opens potential for additional bonanza-grade mineralization along the South Ayawilca Fault, which is largely untested.

	Dr Carman added: "We are continuing to test zinc targets at the project and expand the drilling effort.

	"Step-out holes are taking place at West and South Ayawilca, with new targets being drilled at Zone 3 and Chaucha.

	"The drilling at Zone 3 is progressing well. Indications are that a significant zinc sulphide system could be nearby. Zone 3 is a large target area covering more than 1 km2, and several holes will be needed to evaluate the full potential of that area."

	Shares eased 2.94% to $0.66 each.
