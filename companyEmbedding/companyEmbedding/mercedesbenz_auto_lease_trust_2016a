For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

ESTABLISHMENT OF CONTROL OVER THE 2016-A

of the 2016-A Exchange Note Collection Account .  The

Agreement and the Indenture, treat the Assignee-Secured Party as
entitled to exercise the rights that comprise any Financial Asset
credited to the 2016-A Exchange Note Collection Account,
(iv) all property delivered to the Securities Intermediary by

in blank or credited to another securities account maintained in

Account be registered in the name of the Initial Secured Party,
payable to the order of the Initial Secured Party or specially
endorsed to the Initial Secured Party except to the extent the
foregoing have been specially endorsed to the Securities
Intermediary or in blank.


 


Section 2.02.  Grant of
Security Interest .  The Initial Secured Party Grants to
the Indenture Trustee on the 2016-A Closing Date, as Indenture
Trustee for the benefit of the 2016-A Secured Parties, all of the
Initial Secured Party’s right, title and interest in, to and
under, whether now owned or existing or hereafter acquired or
arising in, the 2016-A Exchange Note Collection Account.  The
Grant of the 2016-A Exchange Note Collection Account includes all
rights, powers and options (but none of the obligations) of the
Initial Secured Party as holder of the 2016-A Exchange Note
Collection Account, including the immediate and continuing right to
claim for, collect, receive and give receipt for all monies
included in the 2016-A Exchange Note Collection Account, to give
and receive notices and other communications, to make waivers or
other agreements, to exercise all rights and options, to bring
Proceedings in the name of the Initial Secured Party or otherwise,
and generally to do and receive anything that any Initial Secured
Party is or may be entitled to do or receive under the 2016-A
Exchange Note Collection Account or with respect to the 2016-A
Exchange Note Collection Account.


 


The foregoing Grant is made in trust
to secure (i) the payment of principal of and interest on, and
any other amounts owing in respect of, the 2016-A Exchange Note as
provided in the 2016-A Exchange Note Supplement and
(ii) compliance by the Initial Secured Party with the
provisions of the 2016-A Exchange Note Supplement for the benefit
of the 2016-A Secured Parties.


 


The Indenture Trustee acknowledges
such Grant, accepts the trusts under this Agreement and agrees to
perform the duties required in this Agreement and the 2016-A
Exchange Note Supplement.


 



3






The Initial Secured Party hereby
authorizes the Indenture Trustee to file a Record or Records (as
such term is defined in the applicable UCC), including financing
statements or continuation statements, and amendments thereto, in
all jurisdictions and with all filing offices as are necessary or
advisable to perfect, and continue the perfection of, the security
interest Granted to the Indenture Trustee; provided, that the
Indenture Trustee will have no obligation to make any such
filings.  Such financing statements may describe the 2016-A
Exchange Note Collection Account in any manner as the Indenture
Trustee may determine is necessary, advisable or prudent to ensure
the perfection of the security interest Granted to the Indenture
Trustee under this Agreement; provided, that the Indenture Trustee
will have no obligation to make any such determination.


 


Section 2.03. 
“Financial Assets” Election .  The
Securities Intermediary hereby agrees that each item of property
(whether investment property, financial asset, security, instrument
or cash) credited to the 2016-A Exchange Note Collection Account
shall be treated as a “Financial Asset” set forth in
Section 8-102(a)(9) of the UCC.


 


Section 2.04.  Entitlement
Orders .  If at any time the Securities Intermediary shall
receive any Entitlement Order from the Assignee-Secured Party with
respect to the 2016-A Exchange Note Collection Account, the
Securities Intermediary shall comply with such Entitlement Order
without further consent by the Initial Secured Party or any other
Person.  If at any time the Assignee-Secured Party notifies
the Securities Intermediary in writing that the Lien of the
Indenture has been released and the 2016-A Exchange Note has been
paid in full, the Securities Intermediary shall thereafter comply
with Entitlement Orders with respect to the 2016-A Exchange Note
Collection Account from the Initial Secured Party without further
consent by any other Person.  Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained herein, if at any time the Securities
Intermediary receives conflicting orders or instructions from the
Assignee-Secured Party and the Initial Secured Party, the
Securities Intermediary will follow the orders or instructions of
the Assignee-Secured Party and not the Initial Secured
Party.


 


Section 2.05.  Subordination
of Lien; Waiver of Set-Off .  In the event that the
Securities Intermediary has or subsequently obtains by agreement,
operation of law or otherwise a security interest in the 2016-A
Exchange Note Collection Account or any Security Entitlement
credited thereto, the Securities Intermediary hereby agrees that
such security interest shall be subordinate to the security
interests of the Assignee-Secured Party and the Initial Secured
Party.  The Financial Assets and other items deposited to the
2016-A Exchange Note Collection Account will not be subject to
deduction, set-off, banker’s lien or any other right in favor
of any Person or entity other than the Assignee-Secured Party and,
subject to the provisions hereof, the Initial Secured Party. 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Securities Intermediary may set
off against amounts on deposit in the 2016-A Exchange Note
Collection Account (i) all amounts due to it in respect of its
customary fees and expenses for the routine maintenance and
operation of the 2016-A Exchange Note Collection Account, and
(ii) the face amount of any checks which have been credited to
the 2016-A Exchange Note Collection Account but are subsequently
returned unpaid because of uncollected or insufficient
funds.


 


Section 2.06.  Notice of
Adverse Claims .  Except for the claims and interests of
the Initial Secured Party and the Assignee-Secured Party in the
2016-A Exchange Note Collection Account, the Securities
Intermediary does not know of any claim to, or interest in, the
2016-A

Car Rental Deals


Renting a car offers several unique advantages when compared to taking your own vehicle on a potentially distant journey. First, you will not place additional miles on your car; a concern if it is still under warranty or if you are hoping to avoid additional wear and tear.  Most rental services provide truly state-of-the-art choices. From heated leather seats of GPS technology and everything in between, you will be truly enjoying the lap of luxury during your journey. There is also a wide spectrum of vehicles to rent on a daily basis.  Whether you are travelling solo or you have to accommodate the needs of up to seven companions, the chances are high that there is a vehicle suited for your discrete requirements. Let's look at some top tips and tricks to keep in mind during the rental process.
How to Find the Best Deal
You might already be aware that there are literally hundreds of different car rental firms throughout the United States. Much like any other business, not all are created equally. There are even some which you should avoid entirely. To keep things simple, we will now list a handful of questions that should be asked before committing to any type of contract. These are:

What is the price of the rental car per day?
Is any type of insurance covered within this price and if not, can it be purchased separately?
What types of vehicles are offered?
Is there a mileage limit during your rental agreement?
How can you contact customer service in the event of an emergency?
Will you be required to fill up the tank with petrol before the vehicle is returned to the lot?

It is also wise to point out that the largest firms tend to provide the best service options. Some brand names to consider are Hertz, Enterprise, Budget, Sixt and Avis. Be sure to speak with a representative to make sure that any questions are thoroughly answered beforehand.

Choosing a Vehicle
The type of vehicle will depend upon several factors. These include:

How many passengers will be travelling with you.
The expected weather conditions.
The distance needed to be travelled.
City driving versus cross-country treks.

The range of cars can vary between miniature and compact cars to full-sized vans and sport utility vehicles. For example, a luxury sedan may be the best option if a small family is going on a trip over the weekend. Compact cars are better when navigating city traffic. An SUV or a van is ideal for those who may be attending a business seminar with a group of colleagues.
Another obvious concern is the price. Luxury vehicles such as a Cadillac will naturally cost more. This should then be combined with the fuel efficiency of the unit in question. Compact cars tend to boast a higher mileage while large units such as sport utility vehicles can require a significant amount of petrol.  This could very well eat into a limited budget.
Booking in Advance?
Advanced booking is the best way to save a significant amount of money.  Most of the larger firms allow you to make a reservation online weeks in advance.  Not only is this more economical, but the chances are high that you will be presented with a larger number of vehicles and “extras”.  A final benefit here is that this type of reservation is often associated with additional discounts of between ten and fifteen per cent.
Picking Up and Returning the Car
Always ask the rules and regulations associated with picking up and dropping off the car.  Some companies will require you to fill up the tank of petrol in order to avoid additional surcharges.  Also, ask if you are able to drop the car off at satellite locations or they instead require you to return it to the original rental destination.  Some firms ask that you clean the interior of the vehicle while others offer this as a complimentary service within the contract.
This is a comprehensive guide meant to streamline the entire car rental process.  It is still advisable to speak with multiple providers in order to secure the best deal possible.  In this manner, you can be assured that any upcoming trip will be pleasant and free from any unexpected surprises.

"Oh Lord, won't you buy me a Mercedes-Benz?" That's the opening line of "Mercedes-Benz," a song most famously recorded by singer Janis Joplin in the early 1970s. The tune gently poked fun at materialism and our desire for the finer things in life. It's fitting that the renowned German marque figures prominently in the lyric. Mercedes-Benz has long been known for crafting vehicles that emphasize luxury and refinement. For many, its vehicles are sleek symbols of status, success and good taste.
In January of 1886, Karl Benz unveiled the world's first automobile, a three-wheeled vehicle dubbed the Benz Patent Motor Car. A few months later, Gottlieb Daimler and his chief engineer Wilhelm Maybach rolled out a four-wheeled vehicle powered by his Daimler engine. The first Mercedes was crafted in 1901, shortly after Daimler's death. Built by Maybach, the car was commissioned by Emil Jellinek, one of Daimler's primary distributors, and was ultimately named after Jellinek's daughter, Mercedes.
In 1926, the companies founded by Daimler and Benz merged to form Daimler-Benz AG, and the Mercedes-Benz brand was born. The company's insignia was a three-pointed star wreathed in a laurel; the star was dreamed up by Daimler years earlier, and its three points signified the fact that his engines were used in vehicles that traveled land, air and sea.
Right from the start, the Mercedes-Benz name was synonymous with automotive excellence. One of the automaker's earliest vehicles, the 1931 Mercedes-Benz 170, distinguished itself as the world's first production car to offer a technology that was nothing short of extraordinary for the day: four-wheel independent suspension. The '30s and '40s saw Mercedes establishing itself as the brand of choice for car buyers seeking the ultimate in luxury, thanks to coveted cruisers like the 380 and 540K.
The 1950s witnessed the introduction of the Mercedes-Benz 300 SL "Gullwing," a sports car that has been described as being the world's first supercar. With its dramatic styling and race-bred technology, the 300 SL reigns today as a classic coveted by collectors worldwide. The decade also saw Daimler-Benz making strides in the area of safety technology. The company's Mercedes-Benz 220 sedans were the first vehicles to incorporate its patented "crumple zone" body design, created to absorb impact in the event of a crash.
In 1963, the company cemented its reputation as the home of automotive luxury with the launch of the Mercedes-Benz 600. The elegant, luxurious sedan was also available as a limousine and featured an ahead-of-its-time air suspension system and a V8 engine that boasted 300 horsepower. The decade also saw the launch of the Mercedes-Benz 300 SEL 6.3. This full-size sedan went from zero to 60 in under seven seconds, distinguishing itself as the quickest luxury car is its day.
The 1970s saw the birth of the brand's storied S-Class line of vehicles, opulent sedans and coupes that coddled passengers with powerful engines and a long list of luxury features. The decade also saw Mercedes continuing on the cutting edge of safety technology, by being the first to offer antilock brakes in its vehicles.
Daimler-Benz's safety advancements continued in the 1980s. Its cars were the first to offer airbags and traction control. The manufacturer also raised the bar in terms of ride comfort and handling when it introduced multilink rear suspension. The technology debuted on the compact Mercedes-Benz 190 E, and it remains a vital component of the company's chassis engineering to this day.
Mercedes-Benz vehicles got an extra dose of power and performance in the 1990s, thanks to the manufacturer's partnership with AMG, a performance and tuning shop that was eventually purchased by the company to help produce ultra-high-performance versions of some of its vehicles. The first AMG model offered in the U.S. was the sporty C36 AMG in 1995; since then, Mercedes has gone on to offer an AMG-tuned version of almost all of its vehicles.
The company's current lineup is the most comprehensive in its history. With a variety of sedans, coupes, SUVs and roadsters filling Mercedes showrooms, it seems like the only thing missing is a pickup truck. Surely, the fact that Janis Joplin's song holds as much relevance today as it did four decades ago is a strong indicator that the brand's premier status is still very much intact.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
