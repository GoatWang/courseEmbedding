Very flat firm, so you are able to make an impact if you so desire.ConsVery laid back culture, so everyone doesn't work as hard as they could. Pay is very formulaic, and doesn't vary enough between top and bottom performers on the tech side.Advice to ManagementBe ok with delegating more responsibility. The people at the top can't make all the decisions around implementation. I think we'd be better off as a firm if you could spend more time strategizing about the future, hammering home that vision to everyone, and putting the right people in the right places to make that happen.Share on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on WhatsAppShare via EmailCopy LinkLink Copied!Flag as InappropriateFlag as InappropriateHelpful (0) Belvedere Trading Response seconds agoEdit • Delete Belvedere Trading 2017-05-29 11:01 PDT Join the Belvedere Trading team See Our Latest Jobs May 4, 2017"Great Foundation"StarStarStarStarStarWork/Life BalanceCulture & ValuesCareer OpportunitiesComp & BenefitsSenior ManagementCurrent Employee - Derivatives Trader in Chicago, ILCurrent Employee - Derivatives Trader in Chicago, ILRecommendsNeutral OutlookApproves of CEOI have been working at Belvedere Trading full-time (More than 5 years)ProsGreat team environment that allows for traders of all seniorities work alongside one another with one common goal. Very thorough training program that is second to none and provides a solid foundation of skills.ConsTotal compensations are capped and there are set "ranges" where you will be paid. You do not get a piece of the desk's PNL until you are more of a senior trader (4-5+ years) even if you make a large impact and have only been there for a few years.Advice to ManagementFocus on one goal at a time. It seems that there are sometimes a lot of jumbled ideas that struggle to keep attention.Share on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on WhatsAppShare via EmailCopy LinkLink Copied!Flag as InappropriateFlag as InappropriateHelpful (0) Belvedere Trading Response seconds agoEdit • Delete Belvedere Trading 2017-05-04 15:32 PDT Mar 1, 2017"Belvedere rewards its employees"StarStarStarStarStarWork/Life BalanceCulture & ValuesCareer OpportunitiesComp & BenefitsSenior ManagementCurrent Employee - Anonymous Employee in Chicago, ILCurrent Employee - Anonymous Employee in Chicago, ILRecommendsPositive OutlookApproves of CEOI have been working at Belvedere Trading full-time (More than a year)ProsThe company is serious about compensating performers, without the need for meaningless job titles or phantom promotions. There is a reason people choose this industry and Belvedere doesn't shy away from that. Belvedere largely hires well, and people are passionate and engaged.ConsThe culture is great for those that can adapt to it, but the expectations, the frequent feedback, and the pace are not for everybody. The office itself is due for an overhaul.Advice to ManagementContinue to keep employees in engaged in future plans and ideas for growth.Share on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on WhatsAppShare via EmailCopy LinkLink Copied!Flag as InappropriateFlag as InappropriateHelpful (0) Belvedere Trading Response seconds agoEdit • Delete Belvedere Trading 2017-03-01 19:45 PST Aug 8, 2016"Relaxed culture, great benefits"StarStarStarStarStarWork/Life BalanceCulture & ValuesCareer OpportunitiesComp & BenefitsSenior ManagementCurrent Employee - Senior Software EngineerCurrent Employee - Senior Software EngineerRecommendsPositive OutlookApproves of CEOI have been working at Belvedere Trading full-time (More than 3 years)ProsWorking at Belvedere is awesome if you're a hard-working individual looking to make solid contributions to a company on the forefront of technical innovation. Between the lax time-off policy, flat structure, and encouraged innovation, it's hard to think of a much better work environment.ConsI'm not sure I'd call it a downside personally, but Belvedere expects a very high level of performance out of each employee. If you're not passionate about what you do, or you're looking for a job where you can put in the minimum and collect a check, Belvedere is not it.Advice to ManagementKeep doing what you're doing. Make sure that the highest performers continue to be challenged and compensate them appropriately, and the firm will continue to do well.Share on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on WhatsAppShare via EmailCopy LinkLink Copied!Flag as InappropriateFlag as InappropriateHelpful (0) Belvedere Trading Response seconds agoEdit • Delete Belvedere Trading 2016-08-08 09:59 PDT Aug 5, 2016"Challenging, but incredibly fun place to work"StarStarStarStarStarWork/Life BalanceCulture & ValuesCareer OpportunitiesComp & BenefitsSenior ManagementCurrent Employee - Software Engineer in Chicago, ILCurrent Employee - Software Engineer in Chicago, ILRecommendsPositive OutlookApproves of CEOProsFlat structure, challenging, yet fun work environment. Unlimited time off policy as long as you are getting your work done. They value good ideas and critical thinking skills over how many hours you spend in the office. Excellent education and training program. Frequent and comprehensive review process. Get to work with cutting edge technology in a very fast-paced work environment. Senior management is very accessible and relatable.ConsIt's a very fast paced work environment so if you aren't constantly learning new things, you will fall behind. It's also a very social work atmosphere, if you don't enjoy talking and working with other people throughout the day and going out with coworkers after work, you may feel like you don't fit in that well. It's a smaller company, so there are less opportunities to move laterally to another role or another location than with a larger corporation, though management is very open to requests to shift your job roleAdvice to ManagementKeep fostering the unique, fun company culture. It promotes unity amongst employees and makes employees want to contribute more to the overall success of the companyShare on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on WhatsAppShare via EmailCopy LinkLink Copied!Flag as InappropriateFlag as InappropriateHelpful (0) Belvedere Trading Response seconds agoEdit • Delete Belvedere Trading 2016-08-05 16:28 PDT Mar 28, 2016 Helpful (2)"Project Manager"StarStarStarStarStarWork/Life BalanceCulture & ValuesCareer OpportunitiesComp & BenefitsSenior ManagementCurrent Employee - Project Manager in Chicago, ILCurrent Employee - Project Manager in Chicago, ILRecommendsPositive OutlookApproves of CEOI have been working at Belvedere Trading full-time (More than 3 years)ProsVery focused on meritocracy.

Management is receptive to the desires of its employees (if you want to work on a different project, they will listen to your requests seriously). This is a very rare, and selfless attitude that I, and many others, have realized. The hours are very reasonable, but if you do put in more time or participate in extracurriculars, your effort does not go unnoticed. A very fun workplace as well. I know I will definitely not take working for BT for granted.ConsSometimes the trading hours will require someone to log on at an off hour to handle high priority issues. It is the nature of the industry.Share on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on WhatsAppShare via EmailCopy LinkLink Copied!Flag as InappropriateFlag as InappropriateHelpful (0) Belvedere Trading Response seconds agoEdit • Delete Belvedere Trading 2016-03-28 11:54 PDT Mar 28, 2016"Good place to start a career"StarStarStarStarStarCurrent Employee - Anonymous EmployeeCurrent Employee - Anonymous EmployeeRecommendsPositive OutlookApproves of CEOProsCasual, fun work environmentGreat peopleRotational programs help you get experience to different aspects of the jobBelvedere is a smaller company, and comes with all the usual prosTraining programs are also great.ConsOptions trading is hard and requires a lot of on the job training.
