    Estate of John T. Walton and its affiliates have significant
    control over us and their interests may conflict with or differ
    from interests of other stockholder.

 

    Our current majority stockholder, the Estate of John T. Walton
    and its affiliates, including JCL Holdings, LLC, owned 40.6% of
    our outstanding common stock at December 27, 2008. As a
    result, the Estate of John T. Walton and its affiliates have
    substantial influence over all matters requiring stockholder
    approval, including the election of our directors and the
    approval of significant corporate transactions such as mergers,
    tender offers and the sale of all or substantially all of our
    assets. In addition, our amended and restated certificate of
    incorporation and by-laws provide that unless and until the
    Estate of John T. Walton, JCL Holdings, LLC, John T.
    Waltons surviving spouse, descendants, any entity
    (including a trust) that is for the benefit of John T.
    Waltons surviving spouse or descendants or any entity
    (including a trust) over which any of John T. Waltons
    surviving spouse, descendants or siblings has voting or
    dispositive power (collectively, the Estate)
    collectively owns less than 40% of our common stock then
    outstanding, stockholders holding 40% or more of our common
    stock then outstanding may call a special meeting of the
    stockholders, at which our stockholders could replace our board
    of directors. In addition, unless and until the Estate
    collectively owns less than 40% of our common stock then
    outstanding, stockholder action may be taken by written consent.
    The interests of the Estate could conflict with or differ from
    interests of other stockholders. For example, the concentration
    of ownership held by the Estate could delay, defer or prevent a
    change of control of our company or impede a merger, takeover or
    other business combination which a majority of stockholders may
    view favorably.
