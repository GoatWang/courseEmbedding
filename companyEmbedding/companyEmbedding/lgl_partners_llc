Capital One® Secured Mastercard®


                                            I never had played in credit before, and someone suggested this card to me to build credit for the first time. I've been really satisfied for the most part. They report quickly and accurately, remind me when my bill is due, and the customer service has been kind and thorough....show more

Stage Stores Credit Card


                                            I was charged fees then late fees then fees. So $28.22 balance appeared out of thin air without any purchase. I moved while opening the credit card account so I did not receive statements on time (or maybe they did not send it to me). Called and got $17 back. As for the rest, I...show more

Amazon.com Store Card


                                            IF I COULD GIVE IT A ZERO I WOULD! Amazon/Synchrony Bank will cut your limit out of no where, even when making monthly payments. I've spent almost a year trying to pay off a card THEY maxed out and now they have sent to collections AS IM PAYING IT! DO NOT APPLY FOR THIS CARD!

 Educational Background



 


University of Saint Joseph

                  University of Saint Joseph is a Roman Catholic comprehensive institution of higher education and an undergraduate women's college with a coeducational graduate program. It is located in West Hartford, Connecticut, United States and was founded in 1932 by the Sisters of Mercy of Connecticut.                




Bachelor of Science Degree in Finance, Minor in Psychology 


Saint Joseph's University

                  For 160 years, Saint Joseph’s University has advanced the professional and personal ambitions of men and women by providing a rigorous Jesuit education – one that demands high achievement, expands knowledge, deepens understanding, stresses effective reasoning and communication, develops moral and spiritual character, and imparts enduring pride.

A Saint Joseph’s education encompasses all aspects of personal growth and development, reflecting the Ignatian credo of cura personalis. Guided by a faculty committed to both teaching and scholarship, students develop intellectually through an intense liberal arts curriculum and advanced study in a chosen discipline. Students mature socially by participating in Saint Joseph’s campus life, noted for its rich variety of activities and infectious enthusiasm. Students grow ethically and spiritually by living their own values in the larger society beyond campus.

Located on the edge of metropolitan Philadelphia, Saint Joseph’s University provides ready access to the vast career opportunities and cultural resources of America’s fifth-largest city, while affording students a cohesive and intimate campus experience.
