About Nuance Investments








Nuance Investments is a classic value investment firm headquartered in Kansas City. Nuance was formed on the belief that the ability to outperform the broad stock market is predicated on a consistent and disciplined value investing approach. The Nuance investment team’s sole focus is generating investment returns for clients by diligently reviewing one company at a time on its own investment merits.



Nuance Mid Cap Value

Nuance Mid Cap Value seeks long-term capital appreciation primarily through investments in equity securities of companies organized in the United States that the investment team believes are high quality, though temporarily out of favor.  The strategy typically invests in a portfolio of 50 to 90 companies 

with market capitalization typically
between the range of the smallest and largest members of the Russell Mid Cap
Index (defined using a trailing 12 month average of the smallest and largest
members on a month to month basis).



  The primary benchmark for the strategy is the Russell Midcap Value Index.  Clients may also be interested in comparing the strategy to the S&P MidCap 400 Value Index and the S&P 500 Index.


Nuance Concentrated Value
Nuance Concentrated Value seeks long-term capital appreciation primarily through companies organized in the United States that the investment team believes are high quality, though temporarily out of favor. The strategy typically invests in a portfolio of 15 to 35 companies of various market capitalizations and is considered an all-cap strategy.  The primary benchmark for the strategy is the Russell 3000 Value Index.  Clients may also be interested in comparing the strategy to the S&P 500 Index.

Nuance Mutual Funds








Nuance Investments has been managing portfolios for individuals and institutions using the same classic value investment process since first registering as an investment advisor in 2008. The Nuance Concentrated Value Fund opened May 31st, 2011. The Nuance Mid Cap Value Fund opened December 31st, 2013. The Nuance Concentrated Value Long-Short Fund opened December 31st, 2015.

Nuance Concentrated Value Fund

The Nuance Concentrated Value Fund invests primarily in equity securities of companies organized in the United States that the Adviser believes are high quality, though temporarily out of favor.  The Fund typically invests in a portfolio of 15 to 35 companies of various market capitalizations and is considered an all-cap strategy.  Although the Fund will invest primarily in the equity securities of U.S. companies, the Fund may invest up to 25% of its assets in equity securities of foreign companies in countries classified as “developed” by MSCI.  The primary benchmark for the Fund is the Russell 3000 Value Index. Investors may also be interested in comparing the Fund to the S&P 500 Index.

Nuance Mid Cap Value Fund

The Nuance Mid Cap Value Fund seeks long-term capital appreciation primarily through investments in equity securities of companies organized in the United States that the investment team believes are high quality, though temporarily out of favor. The strategy typically invests in a portfolio of 50 to 90 companies with market capitalizations typically between the smallest and largest members of the Russell Mid Cap Index (defined using a trailing 12 month average of the smallest and largest members on a month to month basis). Although the strategy will invest primarily in the equity securities of U.S. companies, the strategy may invest up to 15% of its assets in equity securities of foreign companies in countries classified as “developed” by MSCI.  The primary benchmark for the strategy is the Russell Midcap Value Index. Investors may also be interested in comparing to the S&P 500 Index.

Nuance Concentrated Value Long-Short Fund

The Nuance Concentrated Value Long-Short Fund will typically invest in 15-35 long equity securities that the investment team believes are high quality, though temporarily out of favor. In addition, the Fund will invest in 0-50 short equity securities that the investment team believes have average to below average competitive positions and unattractive risk reward profiles. Benchmarked against the S&P 500 Index, the Fund will seek a greater total return and lower standard deviation. Although the Fund will invest primarily in the common stocks of U.S. companies, the Fund may invest up to 25% of its long assets in common stocks of foreign companies in countries classified as “developed” by MSCI.

You should consider the fund’s investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses carefully before investing. For a statutory or summary prospectus, that contains this and other information about the Funds, call 1-855-NUANCE3 (855-682-6233). Please read the prospectus carefully before investing.

Mutual fund investing involves risk. Principal loss is possible. Investments in small and mid-capitalization companies involve additional risk such as limited liquidity and greater volatility than larger capitalization companies. Investments in foreign securities involve greater volatility and political, economic and currency risks and differences in accounting methods. The Nuance Concentrated Value Fund and Nuance Concentrated Value Long-Short Fund are non-diversified, meaning it may concentrate its assets in fewer individual holdings than a diversified fund. Therefore, the Fund is more exposed to individual stock volatility than a diversified fund. Short sale of securities involves unlimited risk including the possibility that losses may exceed the original amount invested. However, a mutual fund investor’s risk is limited to one’s amount of investment in a mutual fund. The Fund is new with no operating history and there can be no assurance that the Fund will grow to or maintain an economically viable size, in which case the Trust’s Board of Trustees (“Board of Trustees”) may determine to liquidate the Fund. The Primary Benchmark for the Nuance Concentrated Value Fund is the Russell 3000 Value Index. The Russell 3000® Value Index measures the performance of the 3,000 largest U.S. domiciled companies with lower price-to-book ratios and lower forecasted growth values. The secondary benchmark is the S&P 500 Index.  The Primary Benchmark for the Nuance Concentrated Value Long/Short Fund is the S&P 500 Index. The S&P 500 Index is a market-value weighted index representing the performance of 500 widely held publicly traded large-capitalization stocks.  The Primary Benchmark for the Nuance Mid Cap Value Fund is the Russell Midcap Value Index.  The Russell Midcap Value Index measures the performance of the mid-cap value segment of the U.S. equity universe. It includes those Russell Midcap Index companies with lower price-to-book ratios and lower forecasted growth values. The secondary benchmark is the S&P 500 Index. The S&P 500 Index is a market-value weighted index representing the performance of 500 widely held publicly traded large-capitalization stocks. Individuals cannot invest directly in any index. The Russell Midcap Index is a market capitalization weighted index representing the smallest
800 companies in the Russell 1000 Index. These indices are used for comparison purposes only and are not meant to be indicative of a portfolio’s performance, asset composition, or volatility. The performance of the Fund may differ markedly from that of compared indices due to varying degrees of diversification and/or other facts. Nuance utilizes MSCI to classify its international holdings. The country classification of a company is generally determined by the company’s country of incorporation and the primary listing of its securities. MSCI will classify a company in the country of incorporation if its securities have a primary listing in this country. In such cases where a company’s securities have a primary listing outside of the country of incorporation, an additional analysis is performed to determine the company’s country classification. 
Nuance Investments, LLC is majority owned by Montage Investments, LLC.
Nuance Investments is the advisor to the Nuance Mid Cap Value Fund, the Nuance Concentrated Value Fund and the Nuance Concentrated Value Long-Short fund which are distributed by Quasar Distributors, LLC.

What Differentiates Nuance Mid Cap Value?


The investment team selects securities for the strategy’s investment portfolio by using an extensive quantitative screening and fundamental research process that identifies leading businesses selling at a discount to fair value and that have the potential to generate above-average rates of returns over time. The investment team seeks to identify companies across a range of industries and market sectors that have leading and sustainable market share positions, above-average financial strength, and are trading at a discount to its internal view of intrinsic value. The investment team may sell an investment when it believes it has surpassed its intrinsic value by applying the screening process described above, for purposes of portfolio construction or risk management, or when a more attractive investment opportunity becomes available.
At the discretion of the investment team, the strategy may invest up to 10% of its assets in cash, cash equivalents, and high-quality, short-term debt securities and money market instruments for temporary defensive purposes in response to adverse market, economic or political conditions.        


Please note: Nuance utilizes MSCI to classify its international holdings. The country classification of a company is generally determined by the company’s country of incorporation and the primary listing of its securities. MSCI will classify a company in the country of incorporation if its securities have a primary listing in this country. In such cases where a company’s securities have a primary listing outside of the country of incorporation, an additional analysis is performed to determine the company’s country classification.  As of June 2016, the following countries were classified as “developed” by MSCI: Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Portugal, Singapore, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, UK, and the United States.

Our Short Selling Investment Process 




    Nuance TV viewers should not consider any of the material to be a recommendation that they invest with Nuance. A decision to invest should be made carefully after consultation with your investment advisor. The decision should occur after an evaluation of the particular investment’s objectives in light of your personal situation, including your objectives, investment time horizon, and risk tolerance. Investments are subject to market and other risks. The amount realized from the sale of an investment may be less than the amount initially invested. Investing in securities involves a risk of loss that investors should be prepared to bear. Nuance defines risk in terms of the amount a stock can go down in value based on our internal analysis. Our team also reviews the overall portfolios risk levels over time by monitoring the standard deviation of the portfolios versus their peers and benchmarks and by looking at the risk-adjust return (as measured by Sharpe Ratio) of the portfolio versus peers and benchmarks. Nuance defines outperforming the market as measuring the Nuance product’s total returns versus the total returns of the product’s primary and secondary benchmarks. The Primary benchmark for the Nuance Concentrated Value Composite is the Russell 3000 Value Index. The secondary benchmark is the S&P 500 Index. The primary benchmark for the Nuance Mid Cap Value Composite is the Russell Midcap Value Index. The secondary benchmarks are the S&P MidCap 400 Value Index and the S&P 500 Index. Please see the fact sheets for more information regarding the products’ performance returns versus the stated benchmarks and disclosures. Past performance is not a guarantee of future results. For additional information about Nuance including fees, services provided, or to receive a copy of our Form ADV, please contact Client Services at client.services@nuanceinvestments.com Please read the disclosure statement carefully before you invest or send money.

What are analysts saying about Emerson Electric Company stock?

Here are some recent quotes from research analysts about Emerson Electric Company stock: 
1. According to Zacks Investment Research, "Emerson’s second-quarter fiscal 2017 adjusted earnings were in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate, and inched up 2% from the year-ago tally on the back of an improving macro environment, restructuring benefits and lower expenses. Going forward, the company’s aggressive restructuring actions and strategic divestures are expected to boost performance. Emerson seems well positioned to benefit from global infrastructure growth, as its core businesses hold dominant positions in markets tied to energy efficiency and infrastructure spending. However, on the flip side, prolonged softness in the oil and gas markets has affected both capital spending and operational expenditure of clients, thereby hurting Emerson’s order rates in power generating alternators and electrical distribution businesses. In light of these issues, the stock has underperformed the Zacks classified Machinery-Electrical industry average over the past year." (5/5/2017)
2. Cowen and Company analysts commented, "Automation & CRS trends improved again, & EMR raised the F17 organic sales/." (5/2/2017)

Analyst Ratings
Consensus Ratings for NTS (NYSEMKT:NTS) (How are Consensus Ratings Calculated?) MarketBeat calculates consensus ratings using the most recent rating from each brokerage that has rated a stock within the last twelve months. Since brokers often use different ratings systems, each rating is normalized to a standardized rating score of 1 (sell), 2 (hold), 3 (buy) or 4 (strong buy). Consensus ratings scores are calculated using the mean average of the number of normalized sell, hold, buy and strong buy ratings. Each stock's consensus rating is derived from its calculated consensus ratings score (0-1.5 = Sell, 1.5-2.5 = Hold, 2.5-3.5 = Buy, >3.5 = Strong Buy). MarketBeat's consensus price targets are a mean average of the most recent available price targets set by each analyst that has set a price target for the stock in the last twelve months.MarketBeat will no longer include ratings and price target data in its consensus calculation if a broker drops coverage and MarketBeat has received a report that coverage was dropped. Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.Ratings Breakdown: No ratings tracked in the last 12 months.Consensus Rating:N/A (Score: NaN)Consensus Price Target: N/A
