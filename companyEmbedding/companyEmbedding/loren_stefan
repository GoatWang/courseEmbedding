Skin Biology products are designed by   Dr. Loren Pickart who discovered the rejuvenating actions of small Copper Peptides and the magical human copper-binding peptide GHK (Gly-His-Lys).
The Story Of My Life 
When I was young, there were 21 Protestant ministers in the family, mostly in the Evangelical United Brethren Church (EUB) in small farm towns in Minnesota. The most distinguished, in a worldly sense, was Reuben Mueller, who moved the EUB into the Methodist Church to form the United Methodist Church. Reuben was also the President of the National Council of Churches during the worst days of the Vietnam War and gave many talks on ending the war. Two Pickart men, of a total of 400 living in the USA at that time, died fighting there. He also talked and wrote about improving race relations in the USA (he emphasized that  everyone needed the following: a nice home, a good neighborhood, a good job). The overall message from the family was that each person should have a mission in life.

      My mission in life was to find molecules, such as GHK, that would improve people's well being and health.

Now at  age 78, my goal is to get these ideas out to the world before the Forces of Evil can bury the GHK work.

 
Background
After High School, Pickart was drafted into the U.S. Army. He enlisted for an extra year to obtain training in Navigation Electronics, then worked with scientists and engineers at Fort Huachuca in Arizona on DECCA, the system that evolved the Global Positioning System or GPS.
 After this, he received a BA degree in Chemistry and Mathematics from the University of Minnesota, then a PhD in Biochemistry at the University of California at San Francisco. The work focused on why young human blood was better than blood from older persons on supporting cells and tissues. During this endeavor, he discovered the actions of Copper Peptides while working at research centers in Minneapolis, Santa Barbara, San Francisco, and Seattle. To accelerate this work, he set up a biotech company called ProCyte in 1985, which was later sold. Skin Biology was founded on the principles of Copper Peptides. Today our research focuses on possible methods to reset human genes in a diseased state to a healthier condition.

    Dr. Pickart carefully selects only the purest and most potent compounds that have been proven to improve the appearance of aging and blemished skin. His extensive and very successful research experience will help you to look and feel younger and healthier. 
Skin Biology is against approaches that slowly poison or damage your skin with alien chemicals as they promise immediate rejuvenation. This is why we design products that work slowly in harmony with the skin's own repair system and mimic the biology of young skin to bring forward its natural radiance and beauty. 
If you want to have this special glowing appearance that comes with the skin's good health; if you want your wrinkles to fade away and your complexion to blossom; if you want to diminish the visible skin blemishes that mar your beauty - you don't have to pay the price by accelerating your skin's aging or damaging your skin's repair system. You are entitled to cosmetics designed with your skin's health in mind. 
Our basic cosmetic products have been tested by independent laboratories and been classified as non-irritants, non-allergens, non-carcinogenic, and non-poisonous. Skin Biology's water/oil creams contain no detergents and are always close to breaking up into a water phase and oil phase. They do not open and damage the skin barrier.

Dr. Pickart is a member of the Wound Healing Society, the American Academy of Anti-Aging Medicine, the American Chemical Society, and the American Association for the Advancement of Science. 
His recent presentations include the Wound Healing Society (2008, 2009, 2011) and publications in Biomaterials (2008), the American Academy of Anti-Aging Medicine Therapeutics Book (2009), the SOFW Journal 2010, Peelings (in Russian) (2010), Kosmetik International (in Russian) (2010); the Reverse Skin Aging (book) 2nd Edition 2011, the Journal of Aging Research & Clinical Practice (2012), Oxidative Medicine and Cellular Longevity (2012), BioMed Research International (2014), SOFW Journal 2015, Cosmetics Magazine (2015), BioMed Research International (2015), and Brain Sciences Journal (2017).
You can trust our ingredients – you can trust our approach – you can trust the result.

Dr. Pickart's Approach to Making Skin Products 
 
You know that if you take care of your body, it will take care of you.
You want younger-looking skin, vibrant hair and strong, healthy-looking nails. You don't have time for cosmetic fluff and trickery. You believe that an effective cosmetic product should not be damaging to your skin. You want a cosmetic line that can finally produce results.
Our products have been tested by independent laboratories and have been classified as non-irritants, non-allergens, non-carcinogenic, and non-poisonous. Skin Biology's specialized water/oil creams do not contain any detergents. For this reason they are always close to returning to a water phase and oil phase. These creams are formulated to avoid opening and damaging your skin barrier.


We avoid the following:
 1 Formulations and moisturizers that are designed to push water into the skin, wet the outer skin proteins, and "puff up" the skin to make wrinkles and creases less obvious. The problem with such products is that they loosen and wet the skin,  damage the skin barrier and permit easier access by bacteria, viruses, and allergens. Chronic wetness also inhibits the signals that tell the skin to send more keratinocytes to the surface.
2 "New chemical entities", that is, synthetic molecules that the human body has never been previously exposed to in our history. It requires decades to determine the safety of such molecules such as in the case of PCBs and DDT. 
3 Plant extracts with the exception of a few ingredients such as vitamins that are used in the human body, and substances such as aloe vera that have exceptionally good records of non-allergic actions on skin. Most plant extracts are alien to human skin and, in time, may cause rashes and allergic reactions. Many plant extracts are substances excreted to stop animals from eating them, such as poisons and carcinogens.

 4 Types of collagen-inducing peptides that act like Transforming Factor Beta 1 (TGF-beta-1), a protein named because it caused normal cells to grow like cancer cells. Concerns have been raised that such types of molecules may speed the spread of cancers and play a role in kidney failure. 
5 Hyaluronic acid (hyaluronan) because it plays a critical role in the spread of cancer cells. 
6 Ingredients used as nerve inhibitors to relax muscles to reduce wrinkles. Long term cosmetic use of such ingredients may inhibit nerve function in the brain and other areas of the body. 
7 Dyes and coloring agents.
