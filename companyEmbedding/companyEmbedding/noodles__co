Fair warning: if you're highly allergic or intolerant to gluten, check with your doctor before dining here. We're a noodle restaurant, after all. We simply have too much wheat and gluten present to be able to eliminate the cross contamination on our equipment and food prep areas. But if you're gluten-sensitive or choose to avoid it for another reason, we have plenty of options to safely satisfy your appetite for global flavor.

I did not expect much of this place, from the reviews. I was pleasantly surprised.

The woman who took my order was helpful. Everything is made to order, and she took the time to explain how I might customize my order to fit my needs. When I asked about alcoholic beverages, she listed them for me and let me know what is most commonly ordered.

It was not immediately clear to me where to go for silverware and soft drinks after we ordered. The store itself is very clean. There are lots of booths and tables, some tucked away in the back for more privacy. 

We ordered the small pad thai and an order of chicken dumplings. I was surprised at the quantity of pad thai offered for an $8 dish. The best part for me was the dumplings, though. They were really good, and the sauce they were served with was perfect. I'm not usually a fan of restaurants that think they know what I will like in a dipping sauce, but this one was good, with just a hint of spice. My husband and I split the noodles and dumplings between us and left satisfied.

I will go back. There are several more noodle dishes I want to try, and I also want some more of those dumplings.







There's better places to eat in this plaza. $20 for pastas that you can make better at home. Got the Penne Rosa with chicken breasts, without the chicken probably wouldn't have finished it. 

Generous portions though.







The pasta was alright. Definitely not coming back. The portion sizes were extremely small. The large looked like it could've been a small. For two large bowls and drinks it was $21 which was not worth it. 

I waited in line a few minutes until the guy in the front finally turned his back around to take our order. 

It wasn't too busy when we got there. There was one customer there and then about four more after we showed up. 

I got the pasta that was featured on the cardboard sign on the counter. It was a little too oily for me.







First time here so thought I'd give it a try since they offered a variety. Had the spicy Korean noodles. It was over-sauced and on the salty side. I poured out the extra sauce and there was still plenty left in the bowl. Couldn't finish even the small bowl because it was too salty. Kids mac and
cheese meal was a good option for my son but I wouldn't come back here. 2 stars for offering variety; otherwise, it would have been 1 star.







My hubby and my daughter superliked in here. We loved trying all their offers and varieties of food. We loved noodles, feeling like we've travelled the world by eating different kind and taste Hahahaha.. Not so authentic but still ok. Hopefully they can offer laksa from malaysia amd singapore the soonest. Thank you for making us full today! Will definitely coming back soon.







Noodles, noodles, & more noodles!

If you and your friends are in the mood for noodles but not sure specifically what type, this is the spot. This was my first time to a Noodles & Company and I really liked the variety. From Penne Rosa (tomato-based cream sauce) to Pad Thai to Steak Stroganoff, there is something on the menu for anyone's taste. 

During my first visit, I tried the Penne Rosa with Parmesan-crusted Chicken Breast per staff recommendation. It was prepared in under 5 minutes. Almost took me longer to go fill my cup up with Root Beer. The food was tasty and filled me up perfectly before returning back to work. 

If I'm in the mood for noodles, but unsure what type initially...I'll stop back at Noodles & Company.







I had Japanese noodle and Korean noodle. The Japanese noodle was tasty, but the only think I don't like was they put too much sauce in Korean noodle, that was why it made the noodle salty. 
 
Overall, good noodle and nice place. Will definitely come back!







My husband and I both had the Japanese Pan Noodles with steak (an extra).   The noodle texture and caramelized sauce were good but the serving contained very little other than noodles (i.e. very few vegetables).     High calorie counts, high sodium, with little nutritional value.







Started being disappointed when we couldn't place an on-line order.  Once we arrived at the location we were overwhelmed at the choices.  We chose a few options and waited for our to go order.  Some of the dishes, Pad Thai and mac n cheese, were just okay.  Our other dishes were pretty good.  The price was good compared to amount of food we got.  They have options for everyone.  We will be going back.







Came in for lunch the other day. I had the penne rosa with a side salad and soup... it was delicious! The place was well managed and clean. The helpful cashier Joseph also let me know they have Noodles rewards! I'll be back for sure! #Points







Their portion has always been inconsistent.  One day my "small Japanese noodle" order can feed 2 adults while another day it was barely enough for a toddler.  There's nothing "authentic-tasting" about any of the dishes since it tastes nothing like the foods from that particular country.  That's like claiming Taco Bell is authentic Mexican food and Panda Express is authentic Chinese food.  Dishes that I've had here:

Japanese noodle - edible
Korean noodle - spicy and that's about all I can say about the dish
Mac & Cheese - offensive
Beef Stroganoff - passable
Chicken Adobo - waste of money

On the bright side, the staff are friendly and helpful.







We are currently addicted to this place!!!! A picture says a thousand words right!? I'll attach one from last nights feast!! 

The meatballs... omg yum!!
Tomato soup is delicious...
Korean spicy noodles are killer!
Burger mac and cheese was so good.... 

Trust us... check this place out!







Decided on this place by doing the ole "eenie meenie mienie moe" method in the new plaza.  We ordered potstickers, spicy Korean noodles and the Japanese pan noodles.  Very tasty.  Definitely coming here again.  Especially since my 12 yr old keeps telling me "oh I like this.  This is good".  Clean, friendly, new, and so he so tasty.  Great job!







I thought I'd try this place since it's new and different.  I looked at the menu and asked the cashier what was popular.  She suggested the top row so I opted for the Japanese Pan Noodles and chose the small bowl.  She asked what meat I wanted with it and immediately offered the steak goes well with it, so I agreed.  I also ordered for my son the kid's meal of spaghetti meatballs with two side options of apples and Kids Crispy, which is a small block of Rice Krispies treat.

When she rang it all up I was surprised that it was about $14, which includes both our meals and a milk.  I thought, ok, not bad as far as price.  So we went to sit down, and as looked at the receipt, I was charged $2.99 for the steak.  You know, it would have been nice to have been told there was an extra charge for the meat since I wasn't aware there was.  

When we received our meals I thought how small the serving was but then I did order a small, right?  And I didn't think there was enough meat to justify the $2.99.

I would have to say my noodles were okay, the flavor was fine but I thought the udon was chewy and it really wasn't that warm.  My son's spaghetti wasn't that warm either but he ate some of it.

Okay, I'll come back and try it again since I did fill out the on-line survey (which I shared in part the same here on Yelp) and received a validation code to redeem, but for what it, it wasn't specified.







Overall a good experience. Everyone enjoyed their dishes and we had several with 6 of us. Most notable was a Small Spicy Penne Rosa /w Parm Chicken ($7.58).

Less notable was the Pad Thai which was good but flavor was quite light in my opinion. Also we had one Small and one Regular ordered and bows were different sizes but content looked very close to same. I will bring a scale when I return to this place to validate their sizes have some significance to justify the $1.40 price difference. 

Also notable was the side of Thai Curry Vegetables $1.50, which was very good /w the Japanese Pan Noodles. I think it would pair a small Pad Thai well and to the overall flavor.







I really don't like to leave poor reviews...

I'm a vegetarian and I'm always so excited when a business offers options such as, "no meat" or even tofu! Today I ordered the Korean noodles with no meat online. When I came to pick up my order a really nice man was bagging my order and noticed there was meat in it, without me saying anything. He apologized, and I watched as he asked the cook to make a fresh one, he even gave me a coupon for a free bowl. I was really impressed with his service. 

When I got home I noticed that the cook did not actually remake the order, they just took most of the beef out. I still had multiple chunks of beef. That was really disappointing. I stayed and waited around while they made me a "fresh" bowl... which wasn't fresh at all. The gentleman that helped me today was awesome, but I hope this can be a teaching moment for the cooks. I'm not sure if I would go back.







I'm sorry I'm in love with noodles and company. I'm from Minnesota and it's a much more popular chain there. I was thrilled when I found out there was a noodles close to me, but then it shut down, I think due to inconsistent experiences at that location. So that was a bummer. I've been to this location twice now with no issues! Yay! And it always hits the spot. I get the penne rosa with feta, a spicy delicious sauce with penne pasta. My boyfriend gets the Wisconsin mac n cheese which is different from most places where they oversaturate everything with too much cheese.







We came here the other day with the family to give it a try, everybody was very happy to find something on the menu that they liked and to give it a try. We placed our orders I was within about 5 to 10 minutes are orders were at our table. Refillable drinks, and very big bowls. They have good stuff on the menu, so it will be hard to choose. The only complaint we have, is finding tables to sit and have an enjoyable meal.







Not much to say besides it was very lackluster. Had the Spicy Korean Noodles and the Japanese Pan Noodles. The spicy Korean noodles had some flavor and a good amount of spice. The Japanese Pan Noodles were flavorless. There were bits of broccoli in the dish but they were pretty much raw and didn't go at all with the cooked noodles.  The highlight of the meal were the Korean meatballs.

Nothing horrible about this place. Just wasn't impressed. Also for the cost I could have made 10 times as much food at home.







Clean place and friendly workers.  Our favorites are the spaghetti meatballs and Japanese pan noodles.  Chicken noodle soup is really good but it says it's seasonal now ...

My husband and I both had the Japanese Pan Noodles with steak (an extra).   The noodle texture and caramelized sauce were good but the serving contained very little other than noodles (i.e. very few vegetables).     High calorie counts, high sodium, with little nutritional value.

Started being disappointed when we couldn't place an on-line order.  Once we arrived at the location we were overwhelmed at the choices.  We chose a few options and waited for our to go order.  Some of the dishes, Pad Thai and mac n cheese, were just okay.  Our other dishes were pretty good.  The price was good compared to amount of food we got.  They have options for everyone.  We will be going back.

Came in for lunch the other day. I had the penne rosa with a side salad and soup... it was delicious! The place was well managed and clean. The helpful cashier Joseph also let me know they have Noodles rewards! I'll be back for sure! #Points

Their portion has always been inconsistent.  One day my "small Japanese noodle" order can feed 2 adults while another day it was barely enough for a toddler.  There's nothing "authentic-tasting" about any of the dishes since it tastes nothing like the foods from that particular country.  That's like claiming Taco Bell is authentic Mexican food and Panda Express is authentic Chinese food.  Dishes that I've had here:Japanese noodle - edibleKorean noodle - spicy and that's about all I can say about the dishMac & Cheese - offensiveBeef Stroganoff - passableChicken Adobo - waste of moneyOn the bright side, the staff are friendly and helpful.

Decided on this place by doing the ole "eenie meenie mienie moe" method in the new plaza.  We ordered potstickers, spicy Korean noodles and the Japanese pan noodles.  Very tasty.  Definitely coming here again.  Especially since my 12 yr old keeps telling me "oh I like this.  This is good".  Clean, friendly, new, and so he so tasty.  Great job!








Potstickers.  Perfectly cooked.

I thought I'd try this place since it's new and different.  I looked at the menu and asked the cashier what was popular.  She suggested the top row so I opted for the Japanese Pan Noodles and chose the small bowl.  She asked what meat I wanted with it and immediately offered the steak goes well with it, so I agreed.  I also ordered for my son the kid's meal of spaghetti meatballs with two side options of apples and Kids Crispy, which is a small block of Rice Krispies treat.When she rang it all up I was surprised that it was about $14, which includes both our meals and a milk.  I thought, ok, not bad as far as price.  So we went to sit down, and as looked at the receipt, I was charged $2.99 for the steak.  You know, it would have been nice to have been told there was an extra charge for the meat since I wasn't aware there was.  When we received our meals I thought how small the serving was but then I did order a small, right?  And I didn't think there was enough meat to justify the $2.99.I would have to say my noodles were okay, the flavor was fine but I thought the udon was chewy and it really wasn't that warm.  My son's spaghetti wasn't that warm either but he ate some of it.Okay, I'll come back and try it again since I did fill out the on-line survey (which I shared in part the same here on Yelp) and received a validation code to redeem, but for what it, it wasn't specified.

Overall a good experience. Everyone enjoyed their dishes and we had several with 6 of us. Most notable was a Small Spicy Penne Rosa /w Parm Chicken ($7.58).Less notable was the Pad Thai which was good but flavor was quite light in my opinion. Also we had one Small and one Regular ordered and bows were different sizes but content looked very close to same. I will bring a scale when I return to this place to validate their sizes have some significance to justify the $1.40 price difference. Also notable was the side of Thai Curry Vegetables $1.50, which was very good /w the Japanese Pan Noodles. I think it would pair a small Pad Thai well and to the overall flavor.

I really don't like to leave poor reviews...I'm a vegetarian and I'm always so excited when a business offers options such as, "no meat" or even tofu! Today I ordered the Korean noodles with no meat online. When I came to pick up my order a really nice man was bagging my order and noticed there was meat in it, without me saying anything. He apologized, and I watched as he asked the cook to make a fresh one, he even gave me a coupon for a free bowl. I was really impressed with his service. When I got home I noticed that the cook did not actually remake the order, they just took most of the beef out. I still had multiple chunks of beef. That was really disappointing. I stayed and waited around while they made me a "fresh" bowl... which wasn't fresh at all. The gentleman that helped me today was awesome, but I hope this can be a teaching moment for the cooks. I'm not sure if I would go back.

I'm sorry I'm in love with noodles and company. I'm from Minnesota and it's a much more popular chain there. I was thrilled when I found out there was a noodles close to me, but then it shut down, I think due to inconsistent experiences at that location. So that was a bummer. I've been to this location twice now with no issues! Yay! And it always hits the spot. I get the penne rosa with feta, a spicy delicious sauce with penne pasta. My boyfriend gets the Wisconsin mac n cheese which is different from most places where they oversaturate everything with too much cheese.

We came here the other day with the family to give it a try, everybody was very happy to find something on the menu that they liked and to give it a try. We placed our orders I was within about 5 to 10 minutes are orders were at our table. Refillable drinks, and very big bowls. They have good stuff on the menu, so it will be hard to choose. The only complaint we have, is finding tables to sit and have an enjoyable meal.

Not much to say besides it was very lackluster. Had the Spicy Korean Noodles and the Japanese Pan Noodles. The spicy Korean noodles had some flavor and a good amount of spice. The Japanese Pan Noodles were flavorless. There were bits of broccoli in the dish but they were pretty much raw and didn't go at all with the cooked noodles.  The highlight of the meal were the Korean meatballs.Nothing horrible about this place. Just wasn't impressed. Also for the cost I could have made 10 times as much food at home.

Fair warning: if you're highly allergic or intolerant to gluten, check with your doctor before dining here. We're a noodle restaurant, after all. We simply have too much wheat and gluten present to be able to eliminate the cross contamination on our equipment and food prep areas.

Founding and early years[edit]
See also: Momofuku Ando and Chicken Ramen
It was established in Japan on September 4, 1948, by Momofuku Ando[2] as Nissin Food Products Co., Ltd. of Japan (日清食品株式会社, Nisshin Shokuhin Kabushiki-gaisha) and ten years later introduced the first instant ramen noodle product, Chikin Ramen (Chicken Ramen). They established a US subsidiary Nissin Foods in 1970 and sold instant ramen noodle products under the name Top Ramen. Instant noodles (1958) and cup noodles (1971) were both invented by Momofuku Ando.[3][4] Nissin Foods has its headquarters in Yodogawa-ku, Osaka.[5][6]
Recent years and expansion[edit]
The company moved to its current headquarters in 1977, when the construction of the building was completed.[7]
Nissin Foods are also Purveyors to the Imperial House of Japan.[citation needed]
In 2007, Myojo Foods Co., Ltd. became a wholly owned subsidiary of Nissin Foods.[8]

History[edit]
Origins[edit]
The idea for Noodles & Company was conceived by former Pepsi marketing executive Aaron Kennedy, after eating at Mamie's Asian Noodle Shop[5] in Greenwich Village, New York.[6] He felt there were not enough restaurants that served noodle dishes, which are a staple for many international foods.[6][7] Kennedy started developing recipes out of his mother-in-law's kitchen with the future COO, Joe Serafin, and head chef, Ross Kamens, in 1994.[8]
Kennedy raised $73,000 ($118 thousand in 2016 dollars) in personal funds and $200,000 ($323 thousand in 2016 dollars) in investments from 24 friends and family members.[9][10] The first Noodles & Company was opened in October 1995, in the Cherry Creek neighborhood of Denver, Colorado.[5][10][11][12] Kennedy was joined by partner and real estate developer Tom Weigand, whom he had met at Augustana College.[10][13] They opened a second location in Madison, Wisconsin, the following March.[5][10][14]
Early history[edit]
In the first three months, Noodles & Company lost $42,000.[7]($64.1 thousand in 2016 dollars), and almost went out of business in 1996 after a reporter with the Wisconsin State Journal published a negative review.[15] He said Noodles & Company was "a killer idea"[16] but "criticized nearly every dish he'd tried."[17] The Denver Post[18] and other newspapers[19] had published similar reviews. In response, Kennedy started a "Redefine Noodles & Company" campaign "to redefine and refine nearly every aspect of the operation."[15][17]
In mid-1996, the management team went to Chicago to observe other noodle restaurants[17][6] and, the night of their return, the basement flooded at the Madison location.[20] The next day, Kennedy made a list of 15 areas for improvement.[15] Rocky Mountain News said "the team completely revamped the Noodles concept, overhauling the menu, the prices, the decor and more. It worked."[7] The restaurant implemented a warmer color scheme. Steam tables to keep food warm were replaced with saute lines to cook each dish as it is ordered.[6][17] Two new managers were hired and an executive chef re-worked the menu.[17] According to Inc. Magazine, within sixty days "the food had improved dramatically."[15]
Growth[edit]

From 1996–2000, Noodles & Company's revenues grew from $330,000 ($504 thousand in 2016 dollars) to $13 million ($18.1 million in 2016 dollars).[21] Local food critics in many cities began naming Noodles & Company as the best fast-food restaurant in the city and it was frequently listed as a "company to watch."[5] It won a Hot Concept! award from Nation's Restaurant News.[22] $1 million ($1.47 million in 2016 dollars) in stock was sold in 1998, which was followed by a $2.5 million ($3.67 million in 2016 dollars) round of funding and a $5 million round in 2000.[7] ($6.95 million in 2016 dollars)
The restaurant had 37 locations in 2002,[8] 65 in 2003, and 142 by 2007. The company started franchising in 2003 and by 2007, 22 of its stores were franchises.[8][23][24] The restaurants were redesigned in 2004 with lighter colors, new packaging, a greater emphasis on carryout orders and a floorplan that emphasized an open kitchen, where the saute line was visible to customers.[25]
According to Rocky Mountain News, the company was growing "so fast that it has had to move every two years."[26] In 2006, its headquarters were moved from Boulder to Broomfield, Colorado.[27][28] The company's founder, Aaron Kennedy, stepped down from his position as CEO that same year and was replaced by Kevin Reddy.[29] The number of Noodles & Company locations grew threefold from the beginning of the financial crisis of 2007–08 to 2013, reaching 339 locations.[30]
Recent history[edit]
In 2010, a majority interest in Noodles & Company was acquired by an investment group led by Catterton Partners.[27][31][32] In January 2013, bankers told the Financial Times that Noodles & Company was scouting for underwriters for an initial public offering (IPO).[33][34] Two months later, the intent for a public offering was confirmed with a filing with the Securities Exchange Commission for $75 million in stock. Around this time, the company had reached 339 locations, 51 of which were franchises, and $300.4 million in revenues.[1] Within a day following Noodles & Company's IPO on June 27, the stock price doubled. Fast Company and The Daily Beast called it "the hottest IPO of the year" and compared it to Chipotle's IPO.[35][36]
On November 16, 2015, Noodles & Company announced that it had pulled out of Central Texas, closing all five of its locations in the Austin area. Restaurants in a handful of other cities had closed or were planned to close within the coming weeks, including locations in Lubbock and the Washington, D.C. area, according to published reports.[37] Ultimately, 16 locations were closed by the end of the year.[38]
On July 25, 2016 in Alexandria, Virginia, two Noodles & Company employees refused to serve a uniformed police officer. The officer left the restaurant and reported the incident, which gained regional news coverage. The company issued an apology and terminated the employees involved in the incident.[39]
In 2017, the company planned to close 55 underperforming restaurants, but also planned to open 14 to 17 new locations.[40]
Menu and restaurants[edit]

Noodles & Company offers international and American noodle dishes, as well as soups, salads, and pasta.[41] Most pasta entrees come vegetarian, but have optional protein toppings such as tofu, chicken, beef or shrimp.[5] It also sells flat bread and desserts like Rice Krispies Treats.[9][22]
Customers order at the counter and are served at their table,[10] usually within five to seven minutes.[42] The average check is approximately $8 per person.[43] The restaurants use soft lighting, furniture made from recycled bamboo and have bench seating and community tables.[44] Orders can be made online, to dine-in, or to-go.[41]
Seasonal items were first introduced to supplement the menu in 2002.[8] Two years later, noodle-less entrees were added in response to the trend for low-carb diets.[45][46] The following year it introduced a whole-grain Tuscan fettuccine.[47][48] Naturally raised pork was added as a meat option in 2012.[49] Three seasonal items and a gluten-free fusilli were added in April 2013.[50][51]
In 2015, Noodles & Company debuted customizable kids’ meals.[52]
Sometime between July 2016[53] and October 2016,[54] sandwiches were quietly removed from the Noodles website, with the last web snapshot that recorded the inclusion of sandwiches on the menu having occurred at the end of that July.[53]
Advertising[edit]
From 1997 to 2002, Noodles & Company sponsored outdoor and print ads. By 2002 it had a $1.3 million advertising budget and began airing ads on major television networks. One was of a "snake charmer" using a flute to charm noodles and the other was a noodles dish as a landing UFO, from which noodles emerged. Both ads carried the slogan "We're going to get you."[55] Afterwards, in the early 2000s, the company reduced its advertising resources, before a rebranding effort that started in 2008.[56]
The slogan "Your World Kitchen" was introduced in 2013. The largest component of Noodles & Company's advertising is in outdoor ads like billboards, but it also invests in radio, digital media and news sites. The billboards emphasize the global cuisine. One points to a parking lot and says "Recipes imported from more countries than these cars."[57][58]
Operations and franchises[edit]




Location in Sheboygan, Wisconsin


Most Noodles & Company restaurants are owned and operated by Noodles & Company Incorporated, but some are operated in a franchise model. Franchise locations are operated by an independent franchisee that is trained by Noodles & Company and uses the same menu, pricing and branding as corporate-owned stores.[23] As of 2010, the average Noodles & Company store generated more than $1 million in annual revenue, with a profit of 21 percent.[59] Takeout orders account for approximately 25 percent of revenues.[10] According to Inc. Magazine, Noodles & Company is more selective in franchise partners than other franchise-based restaurants, and has a higher ratio of corporate-owned stores than most franchising restaurants.[60]
Nutrition[edit]
Nutrition facts are posted on the company's website. As with most pasta-based dishes, the company's noodles dishes are high in carbohydrates, with regular-sized dishes containing 80–150 grams of carbohydrates per serving (the company's salads and sandwiches tend to be lower in carbohydrates). Many of the regular-sized pasta dishes exceed 1,000 calories, but smaller portions with under 500 calories are available for some dishes. Noodles and Company offers dishes made with gluten-free and vegan ingredients, but warns that cross-contamination may occur.[61]

History[edit]
Origins[edit]
The idea for Noodles & Company was conceived by former Pepsi marketing executive Aaron Kennedy, after eating at Mamie's Asian Noodle Shop[5] in Greenwich Village, New York.[6] He felt there were not enough restaurants that served noodle dishes, which are a staple for many international foods.[6][7] Kennedy started developing recipes out of his mother-in-law's kitchen with the future COO, Joe Serafin, and head chef, Ross Kamens, in 1994.[8]
Kennedy raised $73,000 ($118 thousand in 2016 dollars) in personal funds and $200,000 ($323 thousand in 2016 dollars) in investments from 24 friends and family members.[9][10] The first Noodles & Company was opened in October 1995, in the Cherry Creek neighborhood of Denver, Colorado.[5][10][11][12] Kennedy was joined by partner and real estate developer Tom Weigand, whom he had met at Augustana College.[10][13] They opened a second location in Madison, Wisconsin, the following March.[5][10][14]
Early history[edit]
In the first three months, Noodles & Company lost $42,000.[7]($64.1 thousand in 2016 dollars), and almost went out of business in 1996 after a reporter with the Wisconsin State Journal published a negative review.[15] He said Noodles & Company was "a killer idea"[16] but "criticized nearly every dish he'd tried."[17] The Denver Post[18] and other newspapers[19] had published similar reviews. In response, Kennedy started a "Redefine Noodles & Company" campaign "to redefine and refine nearly every aspect of the operation."[15][17]
In mid-1996, the management team went to Chicago to observe other noodle restaurants[17][6] and, the night of their return, the basement flooded at the Madison location.[20] The next day, Kennedy made a list of 15 areas for improvement.[15] Rocky Mountain News said "the team completely revamped the Noodles concept, overhauling the menu, the prices, the decor and more. It worked."[7] The restaurant implemented a warmer color scheme. Steam tables to keep food warm were replaced with saute lines to cook each dish as it is ordered.[6][17] Two new managers were hired and an executive chef re-worked the menu.[17] According to Inc. Magazine, within sixty days "the food had improved dramatically."[15]
Growth[edit]

From 1996–2000, Noodles & Company's revenues grew from $330,000 ($504 thousand in 2016 dollars) to $13 million ($18.1 million in 2016 dollars).[21] Local food critics in many cities began naming Noodles & Company as the best fast-food restaurant in the city and it was frequently listed as a "company to watch."[5] It won a Hot Concept! award from Nation's Restaurant News.[22] $1 million ($1.47 million in 2016 dollars) in stock was sold in 1998, which was followed by a $2.5 million ($3.67 million in 2016 dollars) round of funding and a $5 million round in 2000.[7] ($6.95 million in 2016 dollars)
The restaurant had 37 locations in 2002,[8] 65 in 2003, and 142 by 2007. The company started franchising in 2003 and by 2007, 22 of its stores were franchises.[8][23][24] The restaurants were redesigned in 2004 with lighter colors, new packaging, a greater emphasis on carryout orders and a floorplan that emphasized an open kitchen, where the saute line was visible to customers.[25]
According to Rocky Mountain News, the company was growing "so fast that it has had to move every two years."[26] In 2006, its headquarters were moved from Boulder to Broomfield, Colorado.[27][28] The company's founder, Aaron Kennedy, stepped down from his position as CEO that same year and was replaced by Kevin Reddy.[29] The number of Noodles & Company locations grew threefold from the beginning of the financial crisis of 2007–08 to 2013, reaching 339 locations.[30]
Recent history[edit]
In 2010, a majority interest in Noodles & Company was acquired by an investment group led by Catterton Partners.[27][31][32] In January 2013, bankers told the Financial Times that Noodles & Company was scouting for underwriters for an initial public offering (IPO).[33][34] Two months later, the intent for a public offering was confirmed with a filing with the Securities Exchange Commission for $75 million in stock. Around this time, the company had reached 339 locations, 51 of which were franchises, and $300.4 million in revenues.[1] Within a day following Noodles & Company's IPO on June 27, the stock price doubled. Fast Company and The Daily Beast called it "the hottest IPO of the year" and compared it to Chipotle's IPO.[35][36]
On November 16, 2015, Noodles & Company announced that it had pulled out of Central Texas, closing all five of its locations in the Austin area. Restaurants in a handful of other cities had closed or were planned to close within the coming weeks, including locations in Lubbock and the Washington, D.C. area, according to published reports.[37] Ultimately, 16 locations were closed by the end of the year.[38]
On July 25, 2016 in Alexandria, Virginia, two Noodles & Company employees refused to serve a uniformed police officer. The officer left the restaurant and reported the incident, which gained regional news coverage. The company issued an apology and terminated the employees involved in the incident.[39]
In 2017, the company planned to close 55 underperforming restaurants, but also planned to open 14 to 17 new locations.[40]
Menu and restaurants[edit]

Noodles & Company offers international and American noodle dishes, as well as soups, salads, and pasta.[41] Most pasta entrees come vegetarian, but have optional protein toppings such as tofu, chicken, beef or shrimp.[5] It also sells flat bread and desserts like Rice Krispies Treats.[9][22]
Customers order at the counter and are served at their table,[10] usually within five to seven minutes.[42] The average check is approximately $8 per person.[43] The restaurants use soft lighting, furniture made from recycled bamboo and have bench seating and community tables.[44] Orders can be made online, to dine-in, or to-go.[41]
Seasonal items were first introduced to supplement the menu in 2002.[8] Two years later, noodle-less entrees were added in response to the trend for low-carb diets.[45][46] The following year it introduced a whole-grain Tuscan fettuccine.[47][48] Naturally raised pork was added as a meat option in 2012.[49] Three seasonal items and a gluten-free fusilli were added in April 2013.[50][51]
In 2015, Noodles & Company debuted customizable kids’ meals.[52]
Sometime between July 2016[53] and October 2016,[54] sandwiches were quietly removed from the Noodles website, with the last web snapshot that recorded the inclusion of sandwiches on the menu having occurred at the end of that July.[53]
Advertising[edit]
From 1997 to 2002, Noodles & Company sponsored outdoor and print ads. By 2002 it had a $1.3 million advertising budget and began airing ads on major television networks. One was of a "snake charmer" using a flute to charm noodles and the other was a noodles dish as a landing UFO, from which noodles emerged. Both ads carried the slogan "We're going to get you."[55] Afterwards, in the early 2000s, the company reduced its advertising resources, before a rebranding effort that started in 2008.[56]
The slogan "Your World Kitchen" was introduced in 2013. The largest component of Noodles & Company's advertising is in outdoor ads like billboards, but it also invests in radio, digital media and news sites. The billboards emphasize the global cuisine. One points to a parking lot and says "Recipes imported from more countries than these cars."[57][58]
Operations and franchises[edit]




Location in Sheboygan, Wisconsin


Most Noodles & Company restaurants are owned and operated by Noodles & Company Incorporated, but some are operated in a franchise model. Franchise locations are operated by an independent franchisee that is trained by Noodles & Company and uses the same menu, pricing and branding as corporate-owned stores.[23] As of 2010, the average Noodles & Company store generated more than $1 million in annual revenue, with a profit of 21 percent.[59] Takeout orders account for approximately 25 percent of revenues.[10] According to Inc. Magazine, Noodles & Company is more selective in franchise partners than other franchise-based restaurants, and has a higher ratio of corporate-owned stores than most franchising restaurants.[60]
Nutrition[edit]
Nutrition facts are posted on the company's website. As with most pasta-based dishes, the company's noodles dishes are high in carbohydrates, with regular-sized dishes containing 80–150 grams of carbohydrates per serving (the company's salads and sandwiches tend to be lower in carbohydrates). Many of the regular-sized pasta dishes exceed 1,000 calories, but smaller portions with under 500 calories are available for some dishes. Noodles and Company offers dishes made with gluten-free and vegan ingredients, but warns that cross-contamination may occur.[61]

History[edit]
Origins[edit]
The idea for Noodles & Company was conceived by former Pepsi marketing executive Aaron Kennedy, after eating at Mamie's Asian Noodle Shop[5] in Greenwich Village, New York.[6] He felt there were not enough restaurants that served noodle dishes, which are a staple for many international foods.[6][7] Kennedy started developing recipes out of his mother-in-law's kitchen with the future COO, Joe Serafin, and head chef, Ross Kamens, in 1994.[8]
Kennedy raised $73,000 ($118 thousand in 2016 dollars) in personal funds and $200,000 ($323 thousand in 2016 dollars) in investments from 24 friends and family members.[9][10] The first Noodles & Company was opened in October 1995, in the Cherry Creek neighborhood of Denver, Colorado.[5][10][11][12] Kennedy was joined by partner and real estate developer Tom Weigand, whom he had met at Augustana College.[10][13] They opened a second location in Madison, Wisconsin, the following March.[5][10][14]
Early history[edit]
In the first three months, Noodles & Company lost $42,000.[7]($64.1 thousand in 2016 dollars), and almost went out of business in 1996 after a reporter with the Wisconsin State Journal published a negative review.[15] He said Noodles & Company was "a killer idea"[16] but "criticized nearly every dish he'd tried."[17] The Denver Post[18] and other newspapers[19] had published similar reviews. In response, Kennedy started a "Redefine Noodles & Company" campaign "to redefine and refine nearly every aspect of the operation."[15][17]
In mid-1996, the management team went to Chicago to observe other noodle restaurants[17][6] and, the night of their return, the basement flooded at the Madison location.[20] The next day, Kennedy made a list of 15 areas for improvement.[15] Rocky Mountain News said "the team completely revamped the Noodles concept, overhauling the menu, the prices, the decor and more. It worked."[7] The restaurant implemented a warmer color scheme. Steam tables to keep food warm were replaced with saute lines to cook each dish as it is ordered.[6][17] Two new managers were hired and an executive chef re-worked the menu.[17] According to Inc. Magazine, within sixty days "the food had improved dramatically."[15]
Growth[edit]

From 1996–2000, Noodles & Company's revenues grew from $330,000 ($504 thousand in 2016 dollars) to $13 million ($18.1 million in 2016 dollars).[21] Local food critics in many cities began naming Noodles & Company as the best fast-food restaurant in the city and it was frequently listed as a "company to watch."[5] It won a Hot Concept! award from Nation's Restaurant News.[22] $1 million ($1.47 million in 2016 dollars) in stock was sold in 1998, which was followed by a $2.5 million ($3.67 million in 2016 dollars) round of funding and a $5 million round in 2000.[7] ($6.95 million in 2016 dollars)
The restaurant had 37 locations in 2002,[8] 65 in 2003, and 142 by 2007. The company started franchising in 2003 and by 2007, 22 of its stores were franchises.[8][23][24] The restaurants were redesigned in 2004 with lighter colors, new packaging, a greater emphasis on carryout orders and a floorplan that emphasized an open kitchen, where the saute line was visible to customers.[25]
According to Rocky Mountain News, the company was growing "so fast that it has had to move every two years."[26] In 2006, its headquarters were moved from Boulder to Broomfield, Colorado.[27][28] The company's founder, Aaron Kennedy, stepped down from his position as CEO that same year and was replaced by Kevin Reddy.[29] The number of Noodles & Company locations grew threefold from the beginning of the financial crisis of 2007–08 to 2013, reaching 339 locations.[30]
Recent history[edit]
In 2010, a majority interest in Noodles & Company was acquired by an investment group led by Catterton Partners.[27][31][32] In January 2013, bankers told the Financial Times that Noodles & Company was scouting for underwriters for an initial public offering (IPO).[33][34] Two months later, the intent for a public offering was confirmed with a filing with the Securities Exchange Commission for $75 million in stock. Around this time, the company had reached 339 locations, 51 of which were franchises, and $300.4 million in revenues.[1] Within a day following Noodles & Company's IPO on June 27, the stock price doubled. Fast Company and The Daily Beast called it "the hottest IPO of the year" and compared it to Chipotle's IPO.[35][36]
On November 16, 2015, Noodles & Company announced that it had pulled out of Central Texas, closing all five of its locations in the Austin area. Restaurants in a handful of other cities had closed or were planned to close within the coming weeks, including locations in Lubbock and the Washington, D.C. area, according to published reports.[37] Ultimately, 16 locations were closed by the end of the year.[38]
On July 25, 2016 in Alexandria, Virginia, two Noodles & Company employees refused to serve a uniformed police officer. The officer left the restaurant and reported the incident, which gained regional news coverage. The company issued an apology and terminated the employees involved in the incident.[39]
In 2017, the company planned to close 55 underperforming restaurants, but also planned to open 14 to 17 new locations.[40]
Menu and restaurants[edit]

Noodles & Company offers international and American noodle dishes, as well as soups, salads, and pasta.[41] Most pasta entrees come vegetarian, but have optional protein toppings such as tofu, chicken, beef or shrimp.[5] It also sells flat bread and desserts like Rice Krispies Treats.[9][22]
Customers order at the counter and are served at their table,[10] usually within five to seven minutes.[42] The average check is approximately $8 per person.[43] The restaurants use soft lighting, furniture made from recycled bamboo and have bench seating and community tables.[44] Orders can be made online, to dine-in, or to-go.[41]
Seasonal items were first introduced to supplement the menu in 2002.[8] Two years later, noodle-less entrees were added in response to the trend for low-carb diets.[45][46] The following year it introduced a whole-grain Tuscan fettuccine.[47][48] Naturally raised pork was added as a meat option in 2012.[49] Three seasonal items and a gluten-free fusilli were added in April 2013.[50][51]
In 2015, Noodles & Company debuted customizable kids’ meals.[52]
Sometime between July 2016[53] and October 2016,[54] sandwiches were quietly removed from the Noodles website, with the last web snapshot that recorded the inclusion of sandwiches on the menu having occurred at the end of that July.[53]
Advertising[edit]
From 1997 to 2002, Noodles & Company sponsored outdoor and print ads. By 2002 it had a $1.3 million advertising budget and began airing ads on major television networks. One was of a "snake charmer" using a flute to charm noodles and the other was a noodles dish as a landing UFO, from which noodles emerged. Both ads carried the slogan "We're going to get you."[55] Afterwards, in the early 2000s, the company reduced its advertising resources, before a rebranding effort that started in 2008.[56]
The slogan "Your World Kitchen" was introduced in 2013. The largest component of Noodles & Company's advertising is in outdoor ads like billboards, but it also invests in radio, digital media and news sites. The billboards emphasize the global cuisine. One points to a parking lot and says "Recipes imported from more countries than these cars."[57][58]
Operations and franchises[edit]




Location in Sheboygan, Wisconsin


Most Noodles & Company restaurants are owned and operated by Noodles & Company Incorporated, but some are operated in a franchise model. Franchise locations are operated by an independent franchisee that is trained by Noodles & Company and uses the same menu, pricing and branding as corporate-owned stores.[23] As of 2010, the average Noodles & Company store generated more than $1 million in annual revenue, with a profit of 21 percent.[59] Takeout orders account for approximately 25 percent of revenues.[10] According to Inc. Magazine, Noodles & Company is more selective in franchise partners than other franchise-based restaurants, and has a higher ratio of corporate-owned stores than most franchising restaurants.[60]
Nutrition[edit]
Nutrition facts are posted on the company's website. As with most pasta-based dishes, the company's noodles dishes are high in carbohydrates, with regular-sized dishes containing 80–150 grams of carbohydrates per serving (the company's salads and sandwiches tend to be lower in carbohydrates). Many of the regular-sized pasta dishes exceed 1,000 calories, but smaller portions with under 500 calories are available for some dishes. Noodles and Company offers dishes made with gluten-free and vegan ingredients, but warns that cross-contamination may occur.[61]

History[edit]
Origins[edit]
The idea for Noodles & Company was conceived by former Pepsi marketing executive Aaron Kennedy, after eating at Mamie's Asian Noodle Shop[5] in Greenwich Village, New York.[6] He felt there were not enough restaurants that served noodle dishes, which are a staple for many international foods.[6][7] Kennedy started developing recipes out of his mother-in-law's kitchen with the future COO, Joe Serafin, and head chef, Ross Kamens, in 1994.[8]
Kennedy raised $73,000 ($118 thousand in 2016 dollars) in personal funds and $200,000 ($323 thousand in 2016 dollars) in investments from 24 friends and family members.[9][10] The first Noodles & Company was opened in October 1995, in the Cherry Creek neighborhood of Denver, Colorado.[5][10][11][12] Kennedy was joined by partner and real estate developer Tom Weigand, whom he had met at Augustana College.[10][13] They opened a second location in Madison, Wisconsin, the following March.[5][10][14]
Early history[edit]
In the first three months, Noodles & Company lost $42,000.[7]($64.1 thousand in 2016 dollars), and almost went out of business in 1996 after a reporter with the Wisconsin State Journal published a negative review.[15] He said Noodles & Company was "a killer idea"[16] but "criticized nearly every dish he'd tried."[17] The Denver Post[18] and other newspapers[19] had published similar reviews. In response, Kennedy started a "Redefine Noodles & Company" campaign "to redefine and refine nearly every aspect of the operation."[15][17]
In mid-1996, the management team went to Chicago to observe other noodle restaurants[17][6] and, the night of their return, the basement flooded at the Madison location.[20] The next day, Kennedy made a list of 15 areas for improvement.[15] Rocky Mountain News said "the team completely revamped the Noodles concept, overhauling the menu, the prices, the decor and more. It worked."[7] The restaurant implemented a warmer color scheme. Steam tables to keep food warm were replaced with saute lines to cook each dish as it is ordered.[6][17] Two new managers were hired and an executive chef re-worked the menu.[17] According to Inc. Magazine, within sixty days "the food had improved dramatically."[15]
Growth[edit]

From 1996–2000, Noodles & Company's revenues grew from $330,000 ($504 thousand in 2016 dollars) to $13 million ($18.1 million in 2016 dollars).[21] Local food critics in many cities began naming Noodles & Company as the best fast-food restaurant in the city and it was frequently listed as a "company to watch."[5] It won a Hot Concept! award from Nation's Restaurant News.[22] $1 million ($1.47 million in 2016 dollars) in stock was sold in 1998, which was followed by a $2.5 million ($3.67 million in 2016 dollars) round of funding and a $5 million round in 2000.[7] ($6.95 million in 2016 dollars)
The restaurant had 37 locations in 2002,[8] 65 in 2003, and 142 by 2007. The company started franchising in 2003 and by 2007, 22 of its stores were franchises.[8][23][24] The restaurants were redesigned in 2004 with lighter colors, new packaging, a greater emphasis on carryout orders and a floorplan that emphasized an open kitchen, where the saute line was visible to customers.[25]
According to Rocky Mountain News, the company was growing "so fast that it has had to move every two years."[26] In 2006, its headquarters were moved from Boulder to Broomfield, Colorado.[27][28] The company's founder, Aaron Kennedy, stepped down from his position as CEO that same year and was replaced by Kevin Reddy.[29] The number of Noodles & Company locations grew threefold from the beginning of the financial crisis of 2007–08 to 2013, reaching 339 locations.[30]
Recent history[edit]
In 2010, a majority interest in Noodles & Company was acquired by an investment group led by Catterton Partners.[27][31][32] In January 2013, bankers told the Financial Times that Noodles & Company was scouting for underwriters for an initial public offering (IPO).[33][34] Two months later, the intent for a public offering was confirmed with a filing with the Securities Exchange Commission for $75 million in stock. Around this time, the company had reached 339 locations, 51 of which were franchises, and $300.4 million in revenues.[1] Within a day following Noodles & Company's IPO on June 27, the stock price doubled. Fast Company and The Daily Beast called it "the hottest IPO of the year" and compared it to Chipotle's IPO.[35][36]
On November 16, 2015, Noodles & Company announced that it had pulled out of Central Texas, closing all five of its locations in the Austin area. Restaurants in a handful of other cities had closed or were planned to close within the coming weeks, including locations in Lubbock and the Washington, D.C. area, according to published reports.[37] Ultimately, 16 locations were closed by the end of the year.[38]
On July 25, 2016 in Alexandria, Virginia, two Noodles & Company employees refused to serve a uniformed police officer. The officer left the restaurant and reported the incident, which gained regional news coverage. The company issued an apology and terminated the employees involved in the incident.[39]
In 2017, the company planned to close 55 underperforming restaurants, but also planned to open 14 to 17 new locations.[40]
Menu and restaurants[edit]

Noodles & Company offers international and American noodle dishes, as well as soups, salads, and pasta.[41] Most pasta entrees come vegetarian, but have optional protein toppings such as tofu, chicken, beef or shrimp.[5] It also sells flat bread and desserts like Rice Krispies Treats.[9][22]
Customers order at the counter and are served at their table,[10] usually within five to seven minutes.[42] The average check is approximately $8 per person.[43] The restaurants use soft lighting, furniture made from recycled bamboo and have bench seating and community tables.[44] Orders can be made online, to dine-in, or to-go.[41]
Seasonal items were first introduced to supplement the menu in 2002.[8] Two years later, noodle-less entrees were added in response to the trend for low-carb diets.[45][46] The following year it introduced a whole-grain Tuscan fettuccine.[47][48] Naturally raised pork was added as a meat option in 2012.[49] Three seasonal items and a gluten-free fusilli were added in April 2013.[50][51]
In 2015, Noodles & Company debuted customizable kids’ meals.[52]
Sometime between July 2016[53] and October 2016,[54] sandwiches were quietly removed from the Noodles website, with the last web snapshot that recorded the inclusion of sandwiches on the menu having occurred at the end of that July.[53]
Advertising[edit]
From 1997 to 2002, Noodles & Company sponsored outdoor and print ads. By 2002 it had a $1.3 million advertising budget and began airing ads on major television networks. One was of a "snake charmer" using a flute to charm noodles and the other was a noodles dish as a landing UFO, from which noodles emerged. Both ads carried the slogan "We're going to get you."[55] Afterwards, in the early 2000s, the company reduced its advertising resources, before a rebranding effort that started in 2008.[56]
The slogan "Your World Kitchen" was introduced in 2013. The largest component of Noodles & Company's advertising is in outdoor ads like billboards, but it also invests in radio, digital media and news sites. The billboards emphasize the global cuisine. One points to a parking lot and says "Recipes imported from more countries than these cars."[57][58]
Operations and franchises[edit]




Location in Sheboygan, Wisconsin


Most Noodles & Company restaurants are owned and operated by Noodles & Company Incorporated, but some are operated in a franchise model. Franchise locations are operated by an independent franchisee that is trained by Noodles & Company and uses the same menu, pricing and branding as corporate-owned stores.[23] As of 2010, the average Noodles & Company store generated more than $1 million in annual revenue, with a profit of 21 percent.[59] Takeout orders account for approximately 25 percent of revenues.[10] According to Inc. Magazine, Noodles & Company is more selective in franchise partners than other franchise-based restaurants, and has a higher ratio of corporate-owned stores than most franchising restaurants.[60]
Nutrition[edit]
Nutrition facts are posted on the company's website. As with most pasta-based dishes, the company's noodles dishes are high in carbohydrates, with regular-sized dishes containing 80–150 grams of carbohydrates per serving (the company's salads and sandwiches tend to be lower in carbohydrates). Many of the regular-sized pasta dishes exceed 1,000 calories, but smaller portions with under 500 calories are available for some dishes. Noodles and Company offers dishes made with gluten-free and vegan ingredients, but warns that cross-contamination may occur.[61]

History[edit]
Origins[edit]
The idea for Noodles & Company was conceived by former Pepsi marketing executive Aaron Kennedy, after eating at Mamie's Asian Noodle Shop[5] in Greenwich Village, New York.[6] He felt there were not enough restaurants that served noodle dishes, which are a staple for many international foods.[6][7] Kennedy started developing recipes out of his mother-in-law's kitchen with the future COO, Joe Serafin, and head chef, Ross Kamens, in 1994.[8]
Kennedy raised $73,000 ($118 thousand in 2016 dollars) in personal funds and $200,000 ($323 thousand in 2016 dollars) in investments from 24 friends and family members.[9][10] The first Noodles & Company was opened in October 1995, in the Cherry Creek neighborhood of Denver, Colorado.[5][10][11][12] Kennedy was joined by partner and real estate developer Tom Weigand, whom he had met at Augustana College.[10][13] They opened a second location in Madison, Wisconsin, the following March.[5][10][14]
Early history[edit]
In the first three months, Noodles & Company lost $42,000.[7]($64.1 thousand in 2016 dollars), and almost went out of business in 1996 after a reporter with the Wisconsin State Journal published a negative review.[15] He said Noodles & Company was "a killer idea"[16] but "criticized nearly every dish he'd tried."[17] The Denver Post[18] and other newspapers[19] had published similar reviews. In response, Kennedy started a "Redefine Noodles & Company" campaign "to redefine and refine nearly every aspect of the operation."[15][17]
In mid-1996, the management team went to Chicago to observe other noodle restaurants[17][6] and, the night of their return, the basement flooded at the Madison location.[20] The next day, Kennedy made a list of 15 areas for improvement.[15] Rocky Mountain News said "the team completely revamped the Noodles concept, overhauling the menu, the prices, the decor and more. It worked."[7] The restaurant implemented a warmer color scheme. Steam tables to keep food warm were replaced with saute lines to cook each dish as it is ordered.[6][17] Two new managers were hired and an executive chef re-worked the menu.[17] According to Inc. Magazine, within sixty days "the food had improved dramatically."[15]
Growth[edit]

From 1996–2000, Noodles & Company's revenues grew from $330,000 ($504 thousand in 2016 dollars) to $13 million ($18.1 million in 2016 dollars).[21] Local food critics in many cities began naming Noodles & Company as the best fast-food restaurant in the city and it was frequently listed as a "company to watch."[5] It won a Hot Concept! award from Nation's Restaurant News.[22] $1 million ($1.47 million in 2016 dollars) in stock was sold in 1998, which was followed by a $2.5 million ($3.67 million in 2016 dollars) round of funding and a $5 million round in 2000.[7] ($6.95 million in 2016 dollars)
The restaurant had 37 locations in 2002,[8] 65 in 2003, and 142 by 2007. The company started franchising in 2003 and by 2007, 22 of its stores were franchises.[8][23][24] The restaurants were redesigned in 2004 with lighter colors, new packaging, a greater emphasis on carryout orders and a floorplan that emphasized an open kitchen, where the saute line was visible to customers.[25]
According to Rocky Mountain News, the company was growing "so fast that it has had to move every two years."[26] In 2006, its headquarters were moved from Boulder to Broomfield, Colorado.[27][28] The company's founder, Aaron Kennedy, stepped down from his position as CEO that same year and was replaced by Kevin Reddy.[29] The number of Noodles & Company locations grew threefold from the beginning of the financial crisis of 2007–08 to 2013, reaching 339 locations.[30]
Recent history[edit]
In 2010, a majority interest in Noodles & Company was acquired by an investment group led by Catterton Partners.[27][31][32] In January 2013, bankers told the Financial Times that Noodles & Company was scouting for underwriters for an initial public offering (IPO).[33][34] Two months later, the intent for a public offering was confirmed with a filing with the Securities Exchange Commission for $75 million in stock. Around this time, the company had reached 339 locations, 51 of which were franchises, and $300.4 million in revenues.[1] Within a day following Noodles & Company's IPO on June 27, the stock price doubled. Fast Company and The Daily Beast called it "the hottest IPO of the year" and compared it to Chipotle's IPO.[35][36]
On November 16, 2015, Noodles & Company announced that it had pulled out of Central Texas, closing all five of its locations in the Austin area. Restaurants in a handful of other cities had closed or were planned to close within the coming weeks, including locations in Lubbock and the Washington, D.C. area, according to published reports.[37] Ultimately, 16 locations were closed by the end of the year.[38]
On July 25, 2016 in Alexandria, Virginia, two Noodles & Company employees refused to serve a uniformed police officer. The officer left the restaurant and reported the incident, which gained regional news coverage. The company issued an apology and terminated the employees involved in the incident.[39]
In 2017, the company planned to close 55 underperforming restaurants, but also planned to open 14 to 17 new locations.[40]
Menu and restaurants[edit]

Noodles & Company offers international and American noodle dishes, as well as soups, salads, and pasta.[41] Most pasta entrees come vegetarian, but have optional protein toppings such as tofu, chicken, beef or shrimp.[5] It also sells flat bread and desserts like Rice Krispies Treats.[9][22]
Customers order at the counter and are served at their table,[10] usually within five to seven minutes.[42] The average check is approximately $8 per person.[43] The restaurants use soft lighting, furniture made from recycled bamboo and have bench seating and community tables.[44] Orders can be made online, to dine-in, or to-go.[41]
Seasonal items were first introduced to supplement the menu in 2002.[8] Two years later, noodle-less entrees were added in response to the trend for low-carb diets.[45][46] The following year it introduced a whole-grain Tuscan fettuccine.[47][48] Naturally raised pork was added as a meat option in 2012.[49] Three seasonal items and a gluten-free fusilli were added in April 2013.[50][51]
In 2015, Noodles & Company debuted customizable kids’ meals.[52]
Sometime between July 2016[53] and October 2016,[54] sandwiches were quietly removed from the Noodles website, with the last web snapshot that recorded the inclusion of sandwiches on the menu having occurred at the end of that July.[53]
Advertising[edit]
From 1997 to 2002, Noodles & Company sponsored outdoor and print ads. By 2002 it had a $1.3 million advertising budget and began airing ads on major television networks. One was of a "snake charmer" using a flute to charm noodles and the other was a noodles dish as a landing UFO, from which noodles emerged. Both ads carried the slogan "We're going to get you."[55] Afterwards, in the early 2000s, the company reduced its advertising resources, before a rebranding effort that started in 2008.[56]
The slogan "Your World Kitchen" was introduced in 2013. The largest component of Noodles & Company's advertising is in outdoor ads like billboards, but it also invests in radio, digital media and news sites. The billboards emphasize the global cuisine. One points to a parking lot and says "Recipes imported from more countries than these cars."[57][58]
Operations and franchises[edit]




Location in Sheboygan, Wisconsin


Most Noodles & Company restaurants are owned and operated by Noodles & Company Incorporated, but some are operated in a franchise model. Franchise locations are operated by an independent franchisee that is trained by Noodles & Company and uses the same menu, pricing and branding as corporate-owned stores.[23] As of 2010, the average Noodles & Company store generated more than $1 million in annual revenue, with a profit of 21 percent.[59] Takeout orders account for approximately 25 percent of revenues.[10] According to Inc. Magazine, Noodles & Company is more selective in franchise partners than other franchise-based restaurants, and has a higher ratio of corporate-owned stores than most franchising restaurants.[60]
Nutrition[edit]
Nutrition facts are posted on the company's website. As with most pasta-based dishes, the company's noodles dishes are high in carbohydrates, with regular-sized dishes containing 80–150 grams of carbohydrates per serving (the company's salads and sandwiches tend to be lower in carbohydrates). Many of the regular-sized pasta dishes exceed 1,000 calories, but smaller portions with under 500 calories are available for some dishes. Noodles and Company offers dishes made with gluten-free and vegan ingredients, but warns that cross-contamination may occur.[61]

At Walmart, we have a wide selection of savory snacks so the entire family can find something to munch on. From potato chips and cheese puffed snacks for those who want to keep it simple to wheat and multigrain snacks for those looking for a healthier alternative, there s a salty snack for anyone. Shop for party mix packs if you want to keep an entire group happy or for individual bags for a quiet night in. Find the perfect dip for your tortilla chips from options that include mild and hot salsa or more sophisticated mixes such as salsa with corn and black beans or Pico de Gallo salsa. Our selection of crackers is ideal for those moments you're looking for a versatile kind of snack that goes well as part of a snack mix or with a platter of assorted sliced cheese. Have some pretzels in your cupboard to go with your beer or with a refreshing cider that you can welcome houseguests with. For a healthier alternative that's still incredibly tasty, look for crisps made from whole grain corn wheat that are available in multiple mouth-watering flavors. Nuts and other healthy snacks If you re looking for a nutritious yet delicious snack that s also packed with energy, nuts are healthy nibbles that you can enjoy at home, at the office, on a commute or even in the outdoors. Our large range of peanuts, cashews, almonds, pistachios, pecans and more makes it possible for you to discover your favorite kind of nuts to enjoy no matter the occasion. Make your own trail mix by combining our delicious raw, nuts with dried cherries, raising, dried cranberries, banana chips and chocolate chips for a customized snack that suits your preferences. Choose your favorite from salted, unsalted or seasoned nuts with flavors such as chili, lime, honey and more. You can opt for dry roasted, honey roasted or smoked peanuts as well. Granola bars are an ideal breakfast for those busy mornings or an energy-packed afternoon snack. Mixing toasted rolled oats with dried fruits, nuts and chocolate chips, granola bars are low in calories yet high in protein. Put your feet up and enjoy a bowl of salted or butter popcorn that only took a couple of minutes to prepare in the microwave. Sunflower seeds are nutritious snacks packed with fibers, and you can enjoy them as salted kernels or covered in flavored coatings.

Fair warning: if you're highly allergic or intolerant to gluten, check with your doctor before dining here. We're a noodle restaurant, after all. We simply have too much wheat and gluten present to be able to eliminate the cross contamination on our equipment and food prep areas. But if you're gluten-sensitive or choose to avoid it for another reason, we have plenty of options to safely satisfy your appetite for global flavor.
