1Estimated current return (ECR) is based on the estimated annual income as a percentage of the current price of the units. Estimated long-term return (ELTR) is calculated using a formula which (1) takes into consideration and determines and factors in the relative weightings of the market values, yields (which takes into account the amortization of premiums and the accretion of discounts) and estimated retirement of all the bonds in the trust and (2) takes into account the expenses and sales charge associated with each trust unit. There can be no assurance that either the estimated current return or ELTR will be realized in the future and an investor's units, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost.

1Estimated current return (ECR) is based on the estimated annual income as a percentage of the current price of the units. Estimated long-term return (ELTR) is calculated using a formula which (1) takes into consideration and determines and factors in the relative weightings of the market values, yields (which takes into account the amortization of premiums and the accretion of discounts) and estimated retirement of all the bonds in the trust and (2) takes into account the expenses and sales charge associated with each trust unit. There can be no assurance that either the estimated current return or ELTR will be realized in the future and an investor's units, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost.
2The ELTR life represents the estimated life of the bonds in a Trust's portfolio determined for the purposes of calculating Estimated Long-Term Return.
3Estimated Annual Income Per Unit is as of close the most recent business day and is based on the estimated cash flows per unit. This amount will vary with changes in expenses, interest rates and the maturity, call or sale of bonds.
4Estimated Daily Rate of Accrual represents the annual interest from the securities within the portfolio divided by the number of days on which interest is calculated annually.
5Represents the principal amount of the underlying bonds per unit. Bonds may be sold to meet redemptions, to pay expenses, and in other limited circumstances. The sale of bonds will affect the principal amount of bonds included in the trust and as a result the principal amount of bonds per unit. There can be no assurance that a unitholder will receive this par value per unit in the future.


For Fixed-Income trusts, "S.F." indicates a sinking fund is established with respect to an issue of bonds.The trust portfolio is provided for informational purposes only and should not be deemed as a recommendation to buy or sell the individual securities shown above.



 Important Information About Benchmarks





About risk



There is no assurance that a unit investment trust will achieve its investment objective. An investment in this unit trust is subject to market risk, which is the possibility that the market values of securities owned by the trust will decline and that the value of trust units may therefore be less than what you paid for them. This trust is unmanaged. Accordingly, you can lose money investing in this trust.
An investment in the trust should be made with an understanding of the risks associated therewith, such as the inability of the issuer or an insurer to pay the principal of or interest on a bond when due, volatile interest rates, early call provisions and changes to the tax status of the bonds. As interest rates rise, bond prices fall.
Investments in this trust may be subject to interest rate risk. If interest rates rise, the value of the bonds in a trust may decline and if interest rates decline the value of the bonds may increase. Also, the longer the period to maturity, the greater the sensitivity to interest rate changes tends to be.
This trust is concentrated in bonds of issuers in the health care sector. The ability of health care issuers, such as hospitals and hospital systems, to make payments on bonds depends on factors such as facility occupancy levels, government regulation, cost of malpractice insurance and claims, and government financial assistance (such as Medicare and Medicaid).
A bond issuer may cease to be rated or its ratings may be downgraded. Such action may adversely effect the value of the bond in the trust and the value of the units.
Please see the information supplement for a discussion of situations in which the trust may designate previously distributed interest income during the year as taxable net capital gain in order to satisfy certain of the annual distribution requirements for regulated investment companies.
Invesco and its representatives do not provide tax advice. Individuals should consult their personal tax advisors before making any tax-related investment decisions.
A credit rating is an assessment provided by a nationally recognized statistical rating organization (NRSRO) of the creditworthiness of an issuer with respect to debt obligations, including specifi c securities, money market instruments or other debts. Ratings are measured on a scale that generally ranges from AAA/Aaa (highest) to D/C (lowest); ratings are subject to change without notice. For more information on Standard and Poor’s rating methodology, please visit www.standardandpoors.com and select “Understanding Ratings” under Rating Resources on the homepage or Moody’s at www.moodys.com and select “Rating Methodologies” under Research and Ratings on the homepage.

1The S&P and Moody's ratings apply to the bonds held by the trust, and not the trust itself.   A Standard & Poor's credit rating is a current opinion of the creditworthiness of an obligor with respect to a specific debt obligation. This opinion of creditworthiness may take into consideration the creditworthiness of guarantors, insurers or other forms of credit enhancement on the obligation.  Moody's municipal ratings are opinions of the investment quality of the issues and issues in the US municipal and tax-exempt markets. As such, these ratings incorporate Moody's assessment of the default probability and loss severity of these issuers and issues.

About risk



There is no assurance that a unit investment trust will achieve its investment objective. An investment in this unit trust is subject to market risk, which is the possibility that the market values of securities owned by the trust will decline and that the value of trust units may therefore be less than what you paid for them. This trust is unmanaged. Accordingly, you can lose money investing in this trust.
An investment in the trust should be made with an understanding of the risks associated therewith, such as the inability of the issuer or an insurer to pay the principal of or interest on a bond when due, volatile interest rates, early call provisions and changes to the tax status of the bonds. As interest rates rise, bond prices fall.
Investments in this trust may be subject to interest rate risk. If interest rates rise, the value of the bonds in a trust may decline and if interest rates decline the value of the bonds may increase. Also, the longer the period to maturity, the greater the sensitivity to interest rate changes tends to be.
This trust is concentrated in bonds of issuers in the health care sector. The ability of health care issuers, such as hospitals and hospital systems, to make payments on bonds depends on factors such as facility occupancy levels, government regulation, cost of malpractice insurance and claims, and government financial assistance (such as Medicare and Medicaid).
A bond issuer may cease to be rated or its ratings may be downgraded. Such action may adversely effect the value of the bond in the trust and the value of the units.
Please see the information supplement for a discussion of situations in which the trust may designate previously distributed interest income during the year as taxable net capital gain in order to satisfy certain of the annual distribution requirements for regulated investment companies.
Invesco and its representatives do not provide tax advice. Individuals should consult their personal tax advisors before making any tax-related investment decisions.
A credit rating is an assessment provided by a nationally recognized statistical rating organization (NRSRO) of the creditworthiness of an issuer with respect to debt obligations, including specifi c securities, money market instruments or other debts. Ratings are measured on a scale that generally ranges from AAA/Aaa (highest) to D/C (lowest); ratings are subject to change without notice.

5Represents the principal amount of the underlying bonds per unit. Bonds may be sold to meet redemptions, to pay expenses, and in other limited circumstances. The sale of bonds will affect the principal amount of bonds included in the trust and as a result the principal amount of bonds per unit. There can be no assurance that a unitholder will receive this par value per unit in the future.

Unit Trusts
Unit Trusts provide a simple, convenient way to gain exposure to an asset class, market sector or investment discipline. Like a traditional mutual fund, unit trusts hold a pool of securities (such as stocks, bonds or alternative investments) chosen by a professional investment manager and are available with a wide range of objectives and risk levels.

1Estimated current return (ECR) is based on the estimated annual income as a percentage of the current price of the units. Estimated long-term return (ELTR) is calculated using a formula which (1) takes into consideration and determines and factors in the relative weightings of the market values, yields (which takes into account the amortization of premiums and the accretion of discounts) and estimated retirement of all the bonds in the trust and (2) takes into account the expenses and sales charge associated with each trust unit. There can be no assurance that either the estimated current return or ELTR will be realized in the future and an investor's units, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost.
2The ELTR life represents the estimated life of the bonds in a Trust's portfolio determined for the purposes of calculating Estimated Long-Term Return.
3Estimated Annual Income Per Unit is as of close the most recent business day and is based on the estimated cash flows per unit. This amount will vary with changes in expenses, interest rates and the maturity, call or sale of bonds.
4Estimated Daily Rate of Accrual represents the annual interest from the securities within the portfolio divided by the number of days on which interest is calculated annually.
5Represents the principal amount of the underlying bonds per unit. Bonds may be sold to meet redemptions, to pay expenses, and in other limited circumstances. The sale of bonds will affect the principal amount of bonds included in the trust and as a result the principal amount of bonds per unit. There can be no assurance that a unitholder will receive this par value per unit in the future.


For Fixed-Income trusts, "S.F." indicates a sinking fund is established with respect to an issue of bonds.The trust portfolio is provided for informational purposes only and should not be deemed as a recommendation to buy or sell the individual securities shown above.



 Important Information About Benchmarks





About risk



There is no assurance that a unit investment trust will achieve its investment objective. An investment in this unit trust is subject to market risk, which is the possibility that the market values of securities owned by the trust will decline and that the value of trust units may therefore be less than what you paid for them. This trust is unmanaged. Accordingly, you can lose money investing in this trust.
An investment in the trust should be made with an understanding of the risks associated therewith, such as the inability of the issuer or an insurer to pay the principal of or interest on a bond when due, volatile interest rates, early call provisions and changes to the tax status of the bonds. As interest rates rise, bond prices fall.
Investments in this trust may be subject to interest rate risk. If interest rates rise, the value of the bonds in a trust may decline and if interest rates decline the value of the bonds may increase. Also, the longer the period to maturity, the greater the sensitivity to interest rate changes tends to be.
The trust is concentrated in bonds of issuers in the health care sector. The ability of health care issuers, such as hospitals and hospital systems, to make payments on bonds depends on factors such as facility occupancy levels, government regulation, cost of malpractice insurance claims, and government financial assistance (such as Medicare and Medicaid).
A bond issuer may cease to be rated or its ratings may be downgraded. Such action may adversely effect the value of the bond in the trust and the value of the units.
Please see the information supplement for a discussion of situations in which the trust may designate previously distributed interest income during the year as taxable net capital gain in order to satisfy certain of the annual distribution requirements for regulated investment companies.
Invesco and its representatives do not provide tax advice. Individuals should consult their personal tax advisors before making any tax-related investment decisions.
A credit rating is an assessment provided by a nationally recognized statistical rating organization (NRSRO) of the creditworthiness of an issuer with respect to debt obligations, including specifi c securities, money market instruments or other debts. Ratings are measured on a scale that generally ranges from AAA/Aaa (highest) to D/C (lowest); ratings are subject to change without notice. For more information on Standard and Poor’s rating methodology, please visit www.standardandpoors.com and select “Understanding Ratings” under Rating Resources on the homepage or Moody’s at www.moodys.com and select “Rating Methodologies” under Research and Ratings on the homepage.

As such, these ratings incorporate Moody's assessment of the default probability and loss severity of these issuers and issues.

The performance data quoted for the individual series of a trust that has not terminated or has an open termination date is from the deposit date through the current date quoted. For individual series that have terminated, performance data quoted is from the deposit date through the termination date.Performance data quoted represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results. Investment returns and principal value will fluctuate and units, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost.
Returns are cumulative total returns (not annualized) unless labeled as average annual total returns. All returns reflect trust expenses as incurred and assume reinvestment of income and principal distributions, except for trusts that do not offer the option of reinvesting distributions into additional trust units. Please see the related trust prospectus for additional information. Returns do not reflect taxes.
A trust's performance, especially for short time periods, should not be the sole factor in making your investment decision. Please keep in mind that high, double-digit returns are highly unusual and cannot be sustained. Investors should also be aware that these returns were primarily achieved during favorable market conditions.
Returns With Sales Charge reflect the maximum sales charge that would be payable by an investor upon sale or redemption of units at the end of the applicable period(s). The sales charge includes any initial or deferred sales charges other than creation and development fee. These returns do not reflect any creation and development fee prior to collection (generally the close of the initial offering period). Any creation and development fee is reflected in the returns as of the time of payment. by a trust. These returns reflect any contingent deferred sales charges only if the charges would be payable upon a unit sale or redemption at or prior to the end of the applicable performance period(s). Certain trusts are no longer offered for sale to the public and, as a result, do not publish an offer price or have a sales charge. In these cases, returns will not reflect a sales charge if a trust was not actually offered for sale to the public on the first day of the applicable period because units of the trust could not have been purchased by an investor at that time. These returns will show 'N/A' for With Sales Charge data
Returns Without Sales Charge do not reflect any sales charge and do not reflect any creation and development fee prior to collection (generally the close of the initial offering period). Any creation and development fee is reflected in the returns as of the time of payment by a trust.
There is no assurance the trust will achieve its investment objective. An investment in this unit investment trust is subject to market risk, which is the possibility that the market values of securities owned by the trust will decline and that the value of trust units may therefore be less than what you paid for them. Accordingly, you can lose money investing in this trust. Certain trusts are unmanaged and their portfolios are not intended to change during the trusts' lives except in limited circumstances. Certain trusts are passively managed and seek to track their target index during the trust's life. For a more complete discussion of the risks of investing in this trust, click on the Fact Card.

1Estimated current return (ECR) is based on the estimated annual income as a percentage of the current price of the units. Estimated long-term return (ELTR) is calculated using a formula which (1) takes into consideration and determines and factors in the relative weightings of the market values, yields (which takes into account the amortization of premiums and the accretion of discounts) and estimated retirement of all the bonds in the trust and (2) takes into account the expenses and sales charge associated with each trust unit. There can be no assurance that either the estimated current return or ELTR will be realized in the future and an investor's units, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost.
2The ELTR life represents the estimated life of the bonds in a Trust's portfolio determined for the purposes of calculating Estimated Long-Term Return.
3Estimated Annual Income Per Unit is as of close the most recent business day and is based on the estimated cash flows per unit. This amount will vary with changes in expenses, interest rates and the maturity, call or sale of bonds.
4Estimated Daily Rate of Accrual represents the annual interest from the securities within the portfolio divided by the number of days on which interest is calculated annually.
5Represents the principal amount of the underlying bonds per unit. Bonds may be sold to meet redemptions, to pay expenses, and in other limited circumstances. The sale of bonds will affect the principal amount of bonds included in the trust and as a result the principal amount of bonds per unit. There can be no assurance that a unitholder will receive this par value per unit in the future.

There is no assurance that a unit investment trust will achieve its investment objective. An investment in this unit trust is subject to market risk, which is the possibility that the market values of securities owned by the trust will decline and that the value of trust units may therefore be less than what you paid for them. This trust is unmanaged. Accordingly, you can lose money investing in this trust.
An investment in the trust should be made with an understanding of the risks associated therewith, such as the inability of the issuer or an insurer to pay the principal of or interest on a bond when due, volatile interest rates, early call provisions and changes to the tax status of the bonds. As interest rates rise, bond prices fall.
Investments in this trust may be subject to interest rate risk. If interest rates rise, the value of the bonds in a trust may decline and if interest rates decline the value of the bonds may increase. Also, the longer the period to maturity, the greater the sensitivity to interest rate changes tends to be.
The trust is concentrated in bonds of issuers in the health care sector. The ability of health care issuers, such as hospitals and hospital systems, to make payments on bonds depends on factors such as facility occupancy levels, government regulation, cost of malpractice insurance claims, and government financial assistance (such as Medicare and Medicaid).
A bond issuer may cease to be rated or its ratings may be downgraded. Such action may adversely effect the value of the bond in the trust and the value of the units.
Please see the information supplement for a discussion of situations in which the trust may designate previously distributed interest income during the year as taxable net capital gain in order to satisfy certain of the annual distribution requirements for regulated investment companies.
Invesco and its representatives do not provide tax advice. Individuals should consult their personal tax advisors before making any tax-related investment decisions.
A credit rating is an assessment provided by a nationally recognized statistical rating organization (NRSRO) of the creditworthiness of an issuer with respect to debt obligations, including specifi c securities, money market instruments or other debts. Ratings are measured on a scale that generally ranges from AAA/Aaa (highest) to D/C (lowest); ratings are subject to change without notice. For more information on Standard and Poor’s rating methodology, please visit www.standardandpoors.com and select “Understanding Ratings” under Rating Resources on the homepage or Moody’s at www.moodys.com and select “Rating Methodologies” under Research and Ratings on the homepage.

Unit Trusts
Unit Trusts provide a simple, convenient way to gain exposure to an asset class, market sector or investment discipline. Like a traditional mutual fund, unit trusts hold a pool of securities (such as stocks, bonds or alternative investments) chosen by a professional investment manager and are available with a wide range of objectives and risk levels.

Quality Municipal Income Trust, 10-20 Year (QMLM0083)
	
		





Objective
Quality Municipal Income Trust, 10-20 Year Series,  invests in a portfolio of tax-exempt municipal bonds. The trust seeks to provide federal tax-exempt income1 and to preserve capital. 

You can help build a better America with an investment in municipal bonds (bonds issued by municipalities to finance projects such as schools, roads and hospitals). Through one convenient investment in a unit investment trust, you can own a defined, diversified basket of municipal bonds.

Take advantage of federal tax-exempt investments through a convenient and efficient way of purchasing a professionally selected and diversified portfolio of quality municipal bonds. The trust seeks to offer tax-exempt federal income with the potential for higher yield than a portfolio holding insured municipal bonds. The bonds in the portfolio are generally not insured, and are rated at least A- by Standard & Poor's or rated at least A3 by Moody's as of the deposit date.2
1 A portion of your interest income may be subject to state or local taxes.
2 Due to the nature of municipal bonds, there is a risk that a bond may be called before maturity, potentially below the par value of the bond, and investors may be unable to reinvest their principal at the same rate of return

Diversification does not ensure a profit or eliminate the risk of loss.

1Estimated current return (ECR) is based on the estimated annual income as a percentage of the current price of the units. Estimated long-term return (ELTR) is calculated using a formula which (1) takes into consideration and determines and factors in the relative weightings of the market values, yields (which takes into account the amortization of premiums and the accretion of discounts) and estimated retirement of all the bonds in the trust and (2) takes into account the expenses and sales charge associated with each trust unit. There can be no assurance that either the estimated current return or ELTR will be realized in the future and an investor's units, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost.
2The ELTR life represents the estimated life of the bonds in a Trust's portfolio determined for the purposes of calculating Estimated Long-Term Return.
3Estimated Annual Income Per Unit is as of close the most recent business day and is based on the estimated cash flows per unit. This amount will vary with changes in expenses, interest rates and the maturity, call or sale of bonds.
4Estimated Daily Rate of Accrual represents the annual interest from the securities within the portfolio divided by the number of days on which interest is calculated annually.
5Represents the principal amount of the underlying bonds per unit. Bonds may be sold to meet redemptions, to pay expenses, and in other limited circumstances. The sale of bonds will affect the principal amount of bonds included in the trust and as a result the principal amount of bonds per unit. There can be no assurance that a unitholder will receive this par value per unit in the future.


For Fixed-Income trusts, "S.F." indicates a sinking fund is established with respect to an issue of bonds.The trust portfolio is provided for informational purposes only and should not be deemed as a recommendation to buy or sell the individual securities shown above.



 Important Information About Benchmarks





About risk



There is no assurance that a unit investment trust will achieve its investment objective. An investment in this unit trust is subject to market risk, which is the possibility that the market values of securities owned by the trust will decline and that the value of trust units may therefore be less than what you paid for them. This trust is unmanaged. Accordingly, you can lose money investing in this trust.
An investment in a trust should be made with an understanding of the risks associated therewith, such as the inability of the issuer or an insurer to pay the principal of or interest on a bond when due, volatile interest rates, early call provisions and changes to the tax status of the bonds. As interest rates rise, bond prices fall. The trust may realize gains when a municipal bond is sold, is called or matures and unitholders may incur a tax liability from time to time.
Investments in a trust may be subject to interest rate risk. If interest rates rise, the value of the bonds in a trust may decline and if interest rates decline the value of the bonds may increase. Also, the longer the period to maturity, the greater the sensitivity to interest rate changes tends to be.
The trust is concentrated in higher education bonds, which are obligations of issuers that operate universities and colleges. These issuers derive revenues from tuition, dormitories, grants and endowments. Higher education bond issuers face problems related to declines in the number of college-age individuals, possible inability to raise tuitions and fees, uncertainty of continued federal grants, state funding or donations, and government legislation or regulation.
Invesco and its representatives do not provide tax advice. Individuals should consult their personal tax advisors before making any tax-related investment decisions.
A credit rating is an assessment provided by a nationally recognized statistical rating organization (NRSRO) of the creditworthiness of an issuer with respect to debt obligations, including specifi c securities, money market instruments or other debts. Ratings are measured on a scale that generally ranges from AAA/Aaa (highest) to D/C (lowest); ratings are subject to change without notice. For more information on Standard and Poor's rating methodology, please visit www.standardandpoors.com and select "Understanding Ratings" under Rating Resources on the homepage or Moody's at www.moodys.com and select "Rating Methodologies" under Research and Ratings on the homepage.

1The S&P and Moody's ratings apply to the bonds held by the trust, and not the trust itself.   A Standard & Poor's credit rating is a current opinion of the creditworthiness of an obligor with respect to a specific debt obligation. This opinion of creditworthiness may take into consideration the creditworthiness of guarantors, insurers or other forms of credit enhancement on the obligation.  Moody's municipal ratings are opinions of the investment quality of the issues and issues in the US municipal and tax-exempt markets. As such, these ratings incorporate Moody's assessment of the default probability and loss severity of these issuers and issues.

About risk



There is no assurance that a unit investment trust will achieve its investment objective. An investment in this unit trust is subject to market risk, which is the possibility that the market values of securities owned by the trust will decline and that the value of trust units may therefore be less than what you paid for them. This trust is unmanaged. Accordingly, you can lose money investing in this trust.
An investment in a trust should be made with an understanding of the risks associated therewith, such as the inability of the issuer or an insurer to pay the principal of or interest on a bond when due, volatile interest rates, early call provisions and changes to the tax status of the bonds. As interest rates rise, bond prices fall. The trust may realize gains when a municipal bond is sold, is called or matures and unitholders may incur a tax liability from time to time.
Investments in a trust may be subject to interest rate risk. If interest rates rise, the value of the bonds in a trust may decline and if interest rates decline the value of the bonds may increase. Also, the longer the period to maturity, the greater the sensitivity to interest rate changes tends to be.
The trust is concentrated in higher education bonds, which are obligations of issuers that operate universities and colleges. These issuers derive revenues from tuition, dormitories, grants and endowments. Higher education bond issuers face problems related to declines in the number of college-age individuals, possible inability to raise tuitions and fees, uncertainty of continued federal grants, state funding or donations, and government legislation or regulation.
Invesco and its representatives do not provide tax advice. Individuals should consult their personal tax advisors before making any tax-related investment decisions.
A credit rating is an assessment provided by a nationally recognized statistical rating organization (NRSRO) of the creditworthiness of an issuer with respect to debt obligations, including specifi c securities, money market instruments or other debts. Ratings are measured on a scale that generally ranges from AAA/Aaa (highest) to D/C (lowest); ratings are subject to change without notice.

LIQUIDATION PRICE  Represents the value per unit that a unitholder would receive if the unitholder redeemed or sold units. This price is equal to the net asset value per unit plus any remaining organization costs and creation and development fee. This price reflects any remaining deferred sales charges payable in connection with a liquidation of units.
OFFER PRICE Represents the net asset value per unit plus any applicable organization costs and sales charges. This is the regular public offering price per unit paid to purchase units. This price is often subject to certain sales charge discounts described in a trust prospectus.
NET ASSET VALUE (NAV) Represents the value per unit of a trust's portfolio securities and other assets reduced by trust expenses and other liabilities, including remaining organization costs, deferred sales charges and creation and the development fee.This page contains historical pricing or historical income distributions information for the unit trust listed above. It should not be used for federal or state tax purposes. Please contact your financial advisor for tax information.This information does not constitute an offer to sell, or a solicitation of an offer to buy securities in any state, or other jurisdiction to any person to whom it is not lawful to make such an offer. A trust that contains a state name in the trust name is generally available for sale only to investors in that state. The information shown may relate to a trust that is no longer offered to the public. In such a case, this information does not constitute an offer to sell, or a solicitation of an offer to buy units of the trust. 





1Estimated current return (ECR) is based on the estimated annual income as a percentage of the current price of the units. Estimated long-term return (ELTR) is calculated using a formula which (1) takes into consideration and determines and factors in the relative weightings of the market values, yields (which takes into account the amortization of premiums and the accretion of discounts) and estimated retirement of all the bonds in the trust and (2) takes into account the expenses and sales charge associated with each trust unit. There can be no assurance that either the estimated current return or ELTR will be realized in the future and an investor's units, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost.
2The ELTR life represents the estimated life of the bonds in a Trust's portfolio determined for the purposes of calculating Estimated Long-Term Return.
3Estimated Annual Income Per Unit is as of close the most recent business day and is based on the estimated cash flows per unit. This amount will vary with changes in expenses, interest rates and the maturity, call or sale of bonds.
4Estimated Daily Rate of Accrual represents the annual interest from the securities within the portfolio divided by the number of days on which interest is calculated annually.
5Represents the principal amount of the underlying bonds per unit. Bonds may be sold to meet redemptions, to pay expenses, and in other limited circumstances. The sale of bonds will affect the principal amount of bonds included in the trust and as a result the principal amount of bonds per unit. There can be no assurance that a unitholder will receive this par value per unit in the future.

The performance data quoted for the individual series of a trust that has not terminated or has an open termination date is from the deposit date through the current date quoted. For individual series that have terminated, performance data quoted is from the deposit date through the termination date.Performance data quoted represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results. Investment returns and principal value will fluctuate and units, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost.
Returns are cumulative total returns (not annualized) unless labeled as average annual total returns. All returns reflect trust expenses as incurred and assume reinvestment of income and principal distributions, except for trusts that do not offer the option of reinvesting distributions into additional trust units. Please see the related trust prospectus for additional information. Returns do not reflect taxes.
A trust's performance, especially for short time periods, should not be the sole factor in making your investment decision. Please keep in mind that high, double-digit returns are highly unusual and cannot be sustained. Investors should also be aware that these returns were primarily achieved during favorable market conditions.
Returns With Sales Charge reflect the maximum sales charge that would be payable by an investor upon sale or redemption of units at the end of the applicable period(s). The sales charge includes any initial or deferred sales charges other than creation and development fee. These returns do not reflect any creation and development fee prior to collection (generally the close of the initial offering period). Any creation and development fee is reflected in the returns as of the time of payment. by a trust. These returns reflect any contingent deferred sales charges only if the charges would be payable upon a unit sale or redemption at or prior to the end of the applicable performance period(s). Certain trusts are no longer offered for sale to the public and, as a result, do not publish an offer price or have a sales charge. In these cases, returns will not reflect a sales charge if a trust was not actually offered for sale to the public on the first day of the applicable period because units of the trust could not have been purchased by an investor at that time. These returns will show 'N/A' for With Sales Charge data
Returns Without Sales Charge do not reflect any sales charge and do not reflect any creation and development fee prior to collection (generally the close of the initial offering period). Any creation and development fee is reflected in the returns as of the time of payment by a trust.

1Estimated current return (ECR) is based on the estimated annual income as a percentage of the current price of the units. Estimated long-term return (ELTR) is calculated using a formula which (1) takes into consideration and determines and factors in the relative weightings of the market values, yields (which takes into account the amortization of premiums and the accretion of discounts) and estimated retirement of all the bonds in the trust and (2) takes into account the expenses and sales charge associated with each trust unit. There can be no assurance that either the estimated current return or ELTR will be realized in the future and an investor's units, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost.
2The ELTR life represents the estimated life of the bonds in a Trust's portfolio determined for the purposes of calculating Estimated Long-Term Return.
3Estimated Annual Income Per Unit is as of close the most recent business day and is based on the estimated cash flows per unit. This amount will vary with changes in expenses, interest rates and the maturity, call or sale of bonds.
4Estimated Daily Rate of Accrual represents the annual interest from the securities within the portfolio divided by the number of days on which interest is calculated annually.
5Represents the principal amount of the underlying bonds per unit. Bonds may be sold to meet redemptions, to pay expenses, and in other limited circumstances. The sale of bonds will affect the principal amount of bonds included in the trust and as a result the principal amount of bonds per unit. There can be no assurance that a unitholder will receive this par value per unit in the future.

There is no assurance that a unit investment trust will achieve its investment objective. An investment in this unit trust is subject to market risk, which is the possibility that the market values of securities owned by the trust will decline and that the value of trust units may therefore be less than what you paid for them. This trust is unmanaged. Accordingly, you can lose money investing in this trust.
An investment in a trust should be made with an understanding of the risks associated therewith, such as the inability of the issuer or an insurer to pay the principal of or interest on a bond when due, volatile interest rates, early call provisions and changes to the tax status of the bonds. As interest rates rise, bond prices fall. The trust may realize gains when a municipal bond is sold, is called or matures and unitholders may incur a tax liability from time to time.
Investments in a trust may be subject to interest rate risk. If interest rates rise, the value of the bonds in a trust may decline and if interest rates decline the value of the bonds may increase. Also, the longer the period to maturity, the greater the sensitivity to interest rate changes tends to be.
The trust is concentrated in higher education bonds, which are obligations of issuers that operate universities and colleges. These issuers derive revenues from tuition, dormitories, grants and endowments. Higher education bond issuers face problems related to declines in the number of college-age individuals, possible inability to raise tuitions and fees, uncertainty of continued federal grants, state funding or donations, and government legislation or regulation.
Invesco and its representatives do not provide tax advice. Individuals should consult their personal tax advisors before making any tax-related investment decisions.
A credit rating is an assessment provided by a nationally recognized statistical rating organization (NRSRO) of the creditworthiness of an issuer with respect to debt obligations, including specifi c securities, money market instruments or other debts.

As interest rates rise, bond prices fall. The trust may realize gains when a municipal bond is sold, is called or matures and unitholders may incur a tax liability from time to time.
Investments in a trust may be subject to interest rate risk. If interest rates rise, the value of the bonds in a trust may decline and if interest rates decline the value of the bonds may increase. Also, the longer the period to maturity, the greater the sensitivity to interest rate changes tends to be.
The trust is concentrated in higher education bonds, which are obligations of issuers that operate universities and colleges. These issuers derive revenues from tuition, dormitories, grants and endowments. Higher education bond issuers face problems related to declines in the number of college-age individuals, possible inability to raise tuitions and fees, uncertainty of continued federal grants, state funding or donations, and government legislation or regulation.
Invesco and its representatives do not provide tax advice. Individuals should consult their personal tax advisors before making any tax-related investment decisions.
A credit rating is an assessment provided by a nationally recognized statistical rating organization (NRSRO) of the creditworthiness of an issuer with respect to debt obligations, including specifi c securities, money market instruments or other debts. Ratings are measured on a scale that generally ranges from AAA/Aaa (highest) to D/C (lowest); ratings are subject to change without notice. For more information on Standard and Poor's rating methodology, please visit www.standardandpoors.com and select "Understanding Ratings" under Rating Resources on the homepage or Moody's at www.moodys.com and select "Rating Methodologies" under Research and Ratings on the homepage.

The unit investment trusts named above (the "Portfolios"), included in
Invesco Unit Trusts, Series 1293, each invest in a portfolio of stocks. Of
course, we cannot guarantee that a Portfolio will achieve its objective.

EAFE Select 20 Portfolio



Investment Objective. The Portfolio seeks above-average total return.


Principal Investment Strategy. The Portfolio seeks to achieve its objective
by investing in a portfolio of stocks. The Portfolio follows a simple
investment strategy: Begin with the stocks in the Morgan Stanley Capital
International Europe, Australasia and Far East Index as detailed below, one of
the most widely-used benchmarks for international investing. Eliminate stocks
traded in Singapore to help limit exposure to uncertain political and economic
conditions. Screen the remaining stocks to include only those companies with
positive one- and three-year sales and earnings growth and three years of
positive dividend growth. Rank the remaining stocks from the previous step by
market capitalization and select the top 75%. From the stocks that remain from
the previous step, buy the twenty highest dividend-yielding stocks and hold
them for about one year. In the event that a stock in the initial portfolio
would result in you and the Portfolio being direct or indirect shareholders of
any passive foreign investment companies ("PFICs"), such stock will be replaced
with the next highest dividend-yielding stock. Invesco Capital Markets, Inc.,
the Sponsor, implemented the strategy using information available as of the
close of business on December 19, 2012. When the Portfolio terminates, you can
elect to follow the strategy by redeeming your Units and reinvesting the
proceeds in a new portfolio, if available.


Many consider the MSCI EAFE[SM] Index to be the premier equity benchmark for
global investing. The index represents more than 909 stocks across 22 developed
countries. These countries include Australia, Austria, Belgium, Denmark,
Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hong Kong, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, the
Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Portugal, Singapore, Spain, Sweden,
Switzerland and the United Kingdom. The final step of the strategy replaces
PFICs because of the negative tax treatment which could result from such
ownership. A small percentage of the MSCI EAFE[SM] Index includes stocks that
may be classified as PFICs and from time to time the stocks used to calculate
hypothetical performance may include a limited number of stocks that are PFICs.


The Portfolio is designed as part of a long-term investment strategy. The
Sponsor may offer a subsequent series of the portfolio when the current
Portfolio terminates. As a result, you may achieve more consistent overall
results by following the strategy over several years if subsequent series are
available. For more information see "Rights of Unitholders--Rollover".


Principal Risks. As with all investments, you can lose money by investing in
this Portfolio. The Portfolio also might not perform as well as you expect.
This can happen for reasons such as these:


o    Security prices will fluctuate. The value of your investment may fall
over time.


o    An issuer may be unwilling or unable to declare dividends in the
future, or may reduce the level of dividends declared. This may result
in a reduction in the value of your Units.


o    The financial condition of an issuer may worsen or its credit ratings
may drop, resulting in a reduction in the value of your Units. This
may occur at any point in time, including during the initial offering
period.


o    The Portfolio's performance might not sufficiently correspond to
published hypothetical performance of the Portfolio's investment
strategy. This can happen for reasons such as an inability to exactly
replicate the weightings of stocks in the strategy or be fully
invested, timing of the Portfolio offering or timing of your
investment, and Portfolio expenses.


o    Stocks of foreign companies in the Portfolio present risks beyond
those of U.S. issuers. These risks may include market and political
factors related to the company's foreign market, international trade
conditions, less regulation, smaller or less liquid markets, increased
volatility, differing accounting practices and changes in the value of
foreign currencies.


o    The Portfolio is concentrated in securities issued by companies
domiciled in the United Kingdom. As a result, political, economic or
social developments in the United Kingdom may have a significant
impact on the securities included in the Portfolio.


o    The Portfolio is concentrated in securities issued by companies in
the consumer staples sector. Negative developments in this sector will
affect the value of your investment more than would be the case in a
more diversified investment.


o    We do not actively manage the Portfolio. Except in limited
circumstances, the Portfolio will hold, and continue to buy, shares of
the same securities even if their market value declines.





Fee Table



The amounts below are estimates of the direct and indirect expenses that

                                     =========  =========









Example



This example helps you compare the cost of the Portfolio with other unit
trusts and mutual funds. In the example we assume that the expenses do not
change and that the Portfolio's annual return is 5%. Your actual returns and
expenses will vary. This example also assumes that you continue to follow the
Portfolio strategy and roll your investment, including all distributions, into
a new trust each year subject to a reduced rollover sales charge of 1.95%.
Based on these assumptions, you would pay the following expenses for every
$10,000 you invest in the Portfolio:








1 year    $    361
3 years        895
5 years      1,455
10 years     2,967

------------------








*    The estimated annual expenses are based upon the estimated trust size for
the Portfolio determined as of the initial date of deposit. Because certain
of the operating expenses are fixed amounts, if the trust does not reach
that estimated size, the amount of the estimated annual expenses per 100
units may exceed the amounts reflected. On the business day following the
end of the initial offering period, the Sponsor and/or the Supervisor will
waive their respective fees, and/or the Sponsor will reimburse the
Portfolio operating expenses, in an amount so that the total estimated
annual expenses calculated on that date do not exceed $5.000 per 100 units.
However, subsequent to that date the value of the Portfolio as well as the
number of outstanding units may decline, and/or the actual amount of the
operating expenses may exceed the estimated amounts, any of which could
result in the actual amount of the total annual expenses exceeding $5.000
per 100 units.


The maximum sales charge is 2.95% of the Public Offering Price per Unit.
The initial sales charge is the difference between the total sales charge
(maximum of 2.95% of the Public Offering Price) and the sum of the remaining
deferred sales charge and the total creation and development fee. The deferred
sales charge is fixed at $0.145 per Unit and accrues daily from April 10, 2013
through September 9, 2013. Your Portfolio pays a proportionate amount of this
charge on the 10th day of each month beginning in the accrual period until paid
in full. The combination of the initial and deferred sales charges comprises
the "transactional sales charge". The creation and development fee is fixed at
$0.05 per Unit and is paid at the earlier of the end of the initial offering
period (anticipated to be three months) or six months following the Initial
Date of Deposit.

1    As of close of business day prior to Initial Date of Deposit. The actual
distributions you receive will vary from the estimated amount due to
changes in the Portfolio's fees and expenses, in actual income received by
the Portfolio, currency fluctuations and with changes in the Portfolio such
as the acquisition or liquidation of securities. See "Rights of
Unitholders--Estimated Distributions."


2    The Trustee will make distributions of income and capital on each monthly
Distribution Date to Unitholders of record on the preceding Record Date,
provided that the total cash held for distribution equals at least 0.1% of
the Portfolio's net asset value. Undistributed income and capital will be
distributed in the next month in which the total cash held for distribution
equals at least 0.1% of the Portfolio's net asset value. Based on the
foregoing, it is currently estimated that the initial distribution will
occur in April 2013.



Hypothetical Strategy Performance



The table below compares the hypothetical total return of stocks selected
using the Portfolio's investment strategy (the "Hypothetical Strategy Stocks")
with the stocks in the MSCI EAFE[SM] Index. Hypothetical total return includes
any dividends paid on the stocks together with any increase or decrease in the
value of the stocks. The table illustrates a hypothetical investment in the
Hypothetical Strategy Stocks at the beginning of each year -- similar to buying
Units of the Portfolio, redeeming them after one year and reinvesting the
proceeds in a new portfolio each year.


These hypothetical returns are not actual past performance of the Portfolio
or prior series but do reflect the sales charge or expenses you will pay. Of
course, these hypothetical returns are not guarantees of future results and the
value of your Units will fluctuate. You should note that the returns shown
below are hypothetical annual returns based on a calendar year investment. The
performance of the Portfolio may differ because the Portfolio has a 15 month
life that is not based on a calendar year investment cycle and may be subject
to investment exclusions and restrictions. For more information about the
hypothetical total return calculations, see "Notes to Hypothetical Performance
Tables".

The Dow Jones Select Dividend Index Strategy Portfolio



Investment Objective. The Portfolio seeks above-average total return.


Principal Investment Strategy. The Portfolio seeks to achieve its objective
by investing in a portfolio of stocks. The Portfolio follows a simple investment
strategy created and implemented by Horizon Investment Services, LLC using its
Quadrix stock rating system. Beginning with the stocks in the Dow Jones Select
Dividend Index, the strategy ranks each company from highest to lowest based on
One-Year Change in Tangible Book Value, Five-Year Expected Profit Growth,
Three-Year Dividend Growth and Price to Book Value. The strategy assigns each
company a rank score from 1 to 100 for each of these four categories. A rank
score of 100 is given to the stock with the best rank in each category (highest
rank for One-Year Change in Tangible Book Value, Five-Year Expected Profit
Growth, Three-Year Dividend Growth and the lowest rank for Price to Book Value),
and a rank score of 1 is given to the stock with the worst rank in a particular
category. The highest possible total rank score is 400 and the lowest possible
total rank score is 4. The strategy then ranks the stocks by total rank score
and selects the top 20 stocks, provided that no more than 12 stocks are selected
from any single industry sector (as furnished by Dow Jones Indexes) and provided
that the stock of any affiliate of Invesco Capital Markets, Inc., the Sponsor,
will be excluded. In the event that more than 12 stocks in the initial portfolio
are from a single industry sector, each such additional stock will be replaced
with the stock with the next highest total rank score that is not in that same
sector. A stock also will be excluded and such stock will be replaced with the
stock with the next highest total rank score if, based on publicly available
information as of the selection date, the company is the target of an announced
business acquisition which the Sponsor expects will close within six months of
the date of this prospectus. In addition, if two stocks are assigned the same
total rank score, the stock with the lower Price to Book Value is ranked higher.
When the Portfolio terminates, you can elect to follow the strategy by redeeming
your Units and reinvesting the proceeds in a new portfolio, if available. The
strategy was implemented as of the close of business on December 19, 2012.


The four categories used by the Portfolio strategy are defined as follows:


o    One-Year Change in Tangible Book Value-- The percentage change in the
net asset value of a company, calculated by total assets minus
intangible assets (such as patents and goodwill) and liabilities.


o    Five-Year Expected Profit Growth--Calculated by using the I/B/E/S
5-year average growth estimate. I/B/E/S is a database of security
recommendations and estimates from many different contributing firms
that translates the data into a uniform consensus average
recommendations and estimates from the contributing firms.


o    Three-Year Dividend Growth--The average growth rate of a company's
paid dividends over the previous three years.


o    Price to Book Value--A ratio calculated by dividing the current stock
price per share by the current book value per share.


The Dow Jones Select Dividend Index is pre-screened subset of stocks
selected from all dividend-paying companies in the Dow Jones U.S. Index that
have a non-negative historical five-year dividend-per-share growth rate, a
five-year average dividend to earnings per share ratio of less than or equal to
60%, and a three-month average daily trading volume of at least 200,000 shares.
The Dow Jones U.S. Index is a rules-governed, broad-market benchmark that
represents approximately 95% of U.S. market capitalization.


The Portfolio is designed as part of a long-term investment strategy. The
Sponsor may offer a subsequent series of the portfolio when the current
Portfolio terminates. As a result, you may achieve more consistent overall
results by following the strategy over several years if subsequent series are
available. For more information see "Rights of Unitholders--Rollover".


Principal Risks. As with all investments, you can lose money by investing in
this Portfolio. The Portfolio also might not perform as well as you expect.
This can happen for reasons such as these:


o    Security prices will fluctuate. The value of your investment may fall
over time.


o    An issuer may be unwilling or unable to declare dividends in the
future, or may reduce the level of dividends declared. This may result
in a reduction in the value of your Units.


o    The financial condition of an issuer may worsen or its credit ratings
may drop, resulting in a reduction in the value of your Units. This
may occur at any point in time, including during the initial offering
period.


o    The Portfolio's performance might not sufficiently correspond to
published hypothetical performance of the Portfolio's investment
strategy. This can happen for reasons such as an inability to exactly
replicate the weightings of stocks in the strategy or be fully
invested, timing of the Portfolio offering or timing of your
investment, and Portfolio expenses.


o    The Portfolio is concentrated in securities issued by companies in
both the financials sector and the utilities sector. Negative
developments in either of these sectors will affect the value of your
investment more than would be the case in a more diversified
investment.


o    We do not actively manage the Portfolio. Except in limited
circumstances, the Portfolio will hold, and continue to buy, shares of
the same securities even if their market value declines.

Example



This example helps you compare the cost of the Portfolio with other unit
trusts and mutual funds. In the example we assume that the expenses do not
change and that the Portfolio's annual return is 5%. Your actual returns and
expenses will vary. This example also assumes that you continue to follow the
Portfolio strategy and roll your investment, including all distributions, into
a new trust each year subject to a reduced rollover sales charge of 1.95%.
Based on these assumptions, you would pay the following expenses for every
$10,000 you invest in the Portfolio:








1 year    $    380
3 years        952
5 years      1,548
10 years     3,147


------------------








*    The estimated annual expenses are based upon the estimated trust size for
the Portfolio determined as of the initial date of deposit. Because certain
of the operating expenses are fixed amounts, if the Portfolio does not
reach the estimated size, or if the value of the Portfolio or number of
outstanding units decline over the life of the trust, or if the actual
amount of the operating expenses exceeds the estimated amounts, the actual
amount of the operating expenses per 100 units would exceed the estimated
amounts. In some cases, the actual amount of operating expenses may
substantially differ from the amounts reflected above.


The maximum sales charge is 2.95% of the Public Offering Price per Unit.
The initial sales charge is the difference between the total sales charge
(maximum of 2.95% of the Public Offering Price) and the sum of the remaining
deferred sales charge and the total creation and development fee. The deferred
sales charge is fixed at $0.145 per Unit and accrues daily from April 10, 2013
through September 9, 2013. Your Portfolio pays a proportionate amount of this
charge on the 10th day of each month beginning in the accrual period until paid
in full. The combination of the initial and deferred sales charges comprises
the "transactional sales charge". The creation and development fee is fixed at
$0.05 per Unit and is paid at the earlier of the end of the initial offering
period (anticipated to be three months) or six months following the Initial
Date of Deposit.

1    As of close of business day prior to Initial Date of Deposit. The actual
distributions you receive will vary from the estimated amount due to
changes in the Portfolio's fees and expenses, in actual income received by
the Portfolio, currency fluctuations and with changes in the Portfolio such
as the acquisition or liquidation of securities. See "Rights of
Unitholders--Estimated Distributions."


2    The Trustee will make distributions of income and capital on each monthly
Distribution Date to Unitholders of record on the preceding Record Date,
provided that the total cash held for distribution equals at least 0.1% of
the Portfolio's net asset value. Undistributed income and capital will be
distributed in the next month in which the total cash held for distribution
equals at least 0.1% of the Portfolio's net asset value. Based on the
foregoing, it is currently estimated that the initial distribution will
occur in March 2013.



Hypothetical Strategy Performance



The table below compares the hypothetical total return of stocks selected
using the Portfolio's investment strategy (the "Hypothetical Strategy Stocks")
with the stocks in the Dow Jones Select Dividend Index ("The Dow Index[SM]") and
the S&P 500 Index. Hypothetical total return includes any dividends paid on the
stocks together with any increase or decrease in the value of the stocks. The
table illustrates a hypothetical investment in the Hypothetical Strategy Stocks
at the beginning of each year --similar to buying Units of the Portfolio,
redeeming them after one year and reinvesting the proceeds in a new portfolio
each year.


These hypothetical returns are not actual past performance of the Portfolio
or prior series but do reflect the sales charge or expenses you will pay. Of
course, these hypothetical returns are not guarantees of future results and the
value of your Units will fluctuate. You should note that the returns shown
below are hypothetical annual returns based on a calendar year investment. The
performance of the Portfolio may differ because the Portfolio has a 15 month
life that is not based on a calendar year investment cycle. For more
information about the hypothetical total return calculations, see "Notes to
Hypothetical Performance Tables".

Select 5 Industrial Portfolio



Investment Objective. The Portfolio seeks above-average total return.


Principal Investment Strategy. The Portfolio seeks to achieve its objective
by investing in a portfolio of stocks. The Portfolio follows a simple
investment strategy: Select the ten highest dividend-yielding stocks in the Dow
Jones Industrial Average and then buy the five stocks with the lowest share
price and hold them for approximately one year. Invesco Capital Markets, Inc.,
the Sponsor, implemented the strategy using information available as of the
close of business on December 19, 2012. When the Portfolio terminates, you can
elect to follow the strategy by redeeming your Units and reinvesting the
proceeds in a new portfolio, if available.


The Portfolio is designed as part of a long-term investment strategy. The
Sponsor may offer a subsequent series of the portfolio when the current
Portfolio terminates. As a result, you may achieve more consistent overall
results by following the strategy over several years if subsequent series are
available. For more information see "Rights of Unitholders--Rollover".


Principal Risks. As with all investments, you can lose money by investing in
this Portfolio. The Portfolio also might not perform as well as you expect.
This can happen for reasons such as these:


o    Security prices will fluctuate. The value of your investment may fall
over time.


o    An issuer may be unwilling or unable to declare dividends in the
future, or may reduce the level of dividends declared. This may result
in a reduction in the value of your Units.


o    The financial condition of an issuer may worsen or its credit ratings
may drop, resulting in a reduction in the value of your Units. This
may occur at any point in time, including during the initial offering
period.


o    The Portfolio's performance might not sufficiently correspond to
published hypothetical performance of the Portfolio's investment
strategy. This can happen for reasons such as an inability to exactly
replicate the weightings of stocks in the strategy or be fully
invested, timing of the Portfolio offering or timing of your
investment, and Portfolio expenses.


o    The Portfolio holds a relatively small number of stocks. You may
encounter more price volatility than would occur in an investment
diversified among a greater number of stocks.


o    The Portfolio is concentrated in securities issued by companies in
the information technology sector. Negative developments in this
sector will affect the value of your investment more than would be the
case in a more diversified investment.


o    We do not actively manage the Portfolio. Except in limited
circumstances, the Portfolio will hold, and continue to buy, shares of
the same securities even if their market value declines.

Example



This example helps you compare the cost of the Portfolio with other unit
trusts and mutual funds. In the example we assume that the expenses do not
change and that the Portfolio's annual return is 5%. Your actual returns and
expenses will vary. This example also assumes that you continue to follow the
Portfolio strategy and roll your investment, including all distributions, into
a new trust each year subject to a reduced rollover sales charge of 1.95%.
Based on these assumptions, you would pay the following expenses for every
$10,000 you invest in the Portfolio:








1 year    $    370
3 years        922
5 years      1,498
10 years     3,050


------------------








*    The estimated annual expenses are based upon the estimated trust size for
the Portfolio determined as of the initial date of deposit. Because certain
of the operating expenses are fixed amounts, if the trust does not reach
that estimated size, the amount of the estimated annual expenses per 100
units may exceed the amounts reflected. On the business day following the
end of the initial offering period, the Sponsor and/or the Supervisor will
waive their respective fees, and/or the Sponsor will reimburse the
Portfolio operating expenses, in an amount so that the total estimated
annual expenses calculated on that date do not exceed $3.500 per 100 units.
However, subsequent to that date the value of the Portfolio as well as the
number of outstanding units may decline, and/or the actual amount of the
operating expenses may exceed the estimated amounts, any of which could
result in the actual amount of the total annual expenses exceeding $3.500
per 100 units.


The maximum sales charge is 2.95% of the Public Offering Price per Unit.
The initial sales charge is the difference between the total sales charge
(maximum of 2.95% of the Public Offering Price) and the sum of the remaining
deferred sales charge and the total creation and development fee. The deferred
sales charge is fixed at $0.145 per Unit and accrues daily from April 10, 2013
through September 9, 2013. Your Portfolio pays a proportionate amount of this
charge on the 10th day of each month beginning in the accrual period until paid
in full. The combination of the initial and deferred sales charges comprises
the "transactional sales charge". The creation and development fee is fixed at
$0.05 per Unit and is paid at the earlier of the end of the initial offering
period (anticipated to be three months) or six months following the Initial
Date of Deposit.

1    As of close of business day prior to Initial Date of Deposit. The actual
distributions you receive will vary from the estimated amount due to
changes in the Portfolio's fees and expenses, in actual income received by
the Portfolio, currency fluctuations and with changes in the Portfolio such
as the acquisition or liquidation of securities. See "Rights of
Unitholders--Estimated Distributions."


2    The Trustee will make distributions of income and capital on each monthly
Distribution Date to Unitholders of record on the preceding Record Date,
provided that the total cash held for distribution equals at least 0.1% of
the Portfolio's net asset value. Undistributed income and capital will be
distributed in the next month in which the total cash held for distribution
equals at least 0.1% of the Portfolio's net asset value. Based on the
foregoing, it is currently estimated that the initial distribution will
occur in February 2013.



Hypothetical Strategy Performance



The table below compares the hypothetical total return of stocks selected
using the Portfolio's investment strategy (the "Hypothetical Strategy Stocks")
with the stocks in the Dow Jones Industrial Average ("The Dow 30[SM]").
Hypothetical total return includes any dividends paid on the stocks together
with any increase or decrease in the value of the stocks. The table illustrates
a hypothetical investment in the Hypothetical Strategy Stocks at the beginning
of each year -- similar to buying Units of the Portfolio, redeeming them after
one year and reinvesting the proceeds in a new portfolio each year.


These hypothetical returns are not actual past performance of the Portfolio
or prior series but do reflect the sales charge or expenses you will pay. Of
course, these hypothetical returns are not guarantees of future results and the
value of your Units will fluctuate. You should note that the returns shown
below are hypothetical annual returns based on a calendar year investment. The
performance of the Portfolio may differ because the Portfolio has a 15 month
life that is not based on a calendar year investment cycle. For more
information about the hypothetical total return calculations, see "Notes to
Hypothetical Performance Tables".

Select S&P Industrial Portfolio



Investment Objective. The Portfolio seeks above-average total return.


Principal Investment Strategy. The Portfolio seeks to achieve its objective
by investing in a portfolio of stocks. The Portfolio follows a simple
investment strategy designed by Standard & Poor's Investment Advisory Services
LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of the McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc. (the
"Portfolio Consultant"). Beginning with the S&P 500 Industrials Index, select
only those stocks ranked either A or A+ by S&P Capital IQ's Earnings and
Dividend Rankings for Common Stock and then remove all stocks in the Dow Jones
Industrial Average. Rank the remaining stocks by market capitalization and
select the top 75%. Select the fifteen highest dividend-yielding stocks from
the previous step and hold them for approximately one year. In addition, a
stock will be excluded and such stock will be replaced with the stock with the
next highest dividend-yielding stock if, based on publicly available
information as of the selection date, the company is the target of an announced
business acquisition which Invesco Capital Markets, Inc., the Sponsor, expects
will close within six months of the date of this prospectus. When the Portfolio
terminates, you can elect to follow the strategy by redeeming your Units and
reinvesting the proceeds in a new portfolio, if available. The strategy was
implemented as of the close of business on December 19, 2012.


S&P Capital IQ determines its Earnings and Dividend Rankings for Common
Stock primarily on the growth and stability of per-share earnings and
dividends. It assigns a symbol to each stock, which ranges from A+ for the
highest ranked stocks to D for those stocks in reorganization. These rankings
are not intended to predict price movements. The market capitalization screen
seeks to avoid smaller, less liquid issues.


The S&P 500 Industrials Index is a capitalization-weighted index of stocks
designed to measure the performance of the industrial sector of the S&P 500
Index.


The Portfolio is designed as part of a long-term investment strategy. The
Sponsor may offer a subsequent series of the portfolio when the current
Portfolio terminates. As a result, you may achieve more consistent overall
results by following the strategy over several years if subsequent series are
available. For more information see "Rights of Unitholders--Rollover".


Principal Risks. As with all investments, you can lose money by investing in
this Portfolio. The Portfolio also might not perform as well as you expect.
This can happen for reasons such as these:


o    Security prices will fluctuate. The value of your investment may fall
over time.


o    An issuer may be unwilling or unable to declare dividends in the
future, or may reduce the level of dividends declared. This may result
in a reduction in the value of your Units.


o    The financial condition of an issuer may worsen or its credit ratings
may drop, resulting in a reduction in the value of your Units. This
may occur at any point in time, including during the initial offering
period.


o    The Portfolio's performance might not sufficiently correspond to
published hypothetical performance of the Portfolio's investment
strategy. This can happen for reasons such as an inability to exactly
replicate the weightings of stocks in the strategy or be fully
invested, timing of the Portfolio offering or timing of your
investment, and Portfolio expenses.


o    The Portfolio is concentrated in securities issued by companies in
both the consumer staples sector and the industrials sector. Negative
developments in either of these sectors will affect the value of your
investment more than would be the case in a more diversified
investment.


o    We do not actively manage the Portfolio. Except in limited
circumstances, the Portfolio will hold, and continue to buy, shares of
the same securities even if their market value declines.

Example



This example helps you compare the cost of the Portfolio with other unit
trusts and mutual funds. In the example we assume that the expenses do not
change and that the Portfolio's annual return is 5%. Your actual returns and
expenses will vary. This example also assumes that you continue to follow the
Portfolio strategy and roll your investment, including all distributions, into
a new trust each year subject to a reduced rollover sales charge of 1.95%.
Based on these assumptions, you would pay the following expenses for every
$10,000 you invest in the Portfolio:








1 year    $    357
3 years        883
5 years      1,435
10 years     2,928


------------------








*    The estimated annual expenses are based upon the estimated trust size for
the Portfolio determined as of the initial date of deposit. Because certain
of the operating expenses are fixed amounts, if the trust does not reach
that estimated size, the amount of the estimated annual expenses per 100
units may exceed the amounts reflected. On the business day following the
end of the initial offering period, the Sponsor and/or the Supervisor will
waive their respective fees, and/or the Sponsor will reimburse the
Portfolio operating expenses, in an amount so that the total estimated
annual expenses calculated on that date do not exceed $3.500 per 100 units.
However, subsequent to that date the value of the Portfolio as well as the
number of outstanding units may decline, and/or the actual amount of the
operating expenses may exceed the estimated amounts, any of which could
result in the actual amount of the total annual expenses exceeding $3.500
per 100 units.


The maximum sales charge is 2.95% of the Public Offering Price per Unit.
The initial sales charge is the difference between the total sales charge
(maximum of 2.95% of the Public Offering Price) and the sum of the remaining
deferred sales charge and the total creation and development fee. The deferred
sales charge is fixed at $0.145 per Unit and accrues daily from April 10, 2013
through September 9, 2013. Your Portfolio pays a proportionate amount of this
charge on the 10th day of each month beginning in the accrual period until paid
in full. The combination of the initial and deferred sales charges comprises
the "transactional sales charge". The creation and development fee is fixed at
$0.05 per Unit and is paid at the earlier of the end of the initial offering
period (anticipated to be three months) or six months following the Initial
Date of Deposit.

1    As of close of business day prior to Initial Date of Deposit. The actual
distributions you receive will vary from the estimated amount due to
changes in the Portfolio's fees and expenses, in actual income received by
the Portfolio, currency fluctuations and with changes in the Portfolio such
as the acquisition or liquidation of securities. See "Rights of
Unitholders--Estimated Distributions."


2    The Trustee will make distributions of income and capital on each monthly
Distribution Date to Unitholders of record on the preceding Record Date,
provided that the total cash held for distribution equals at least 0.1% of
the Portfolio's net asset value. Undistributed income and capital will be
distributed in the next month in which the total cash held for distribution
equals at least 0.1% of the Portfolio's net asset value. Based on the
foregoing, it is currently estimated that the initial distribution will
occur in March 2013.



Hypothetical Strategy Performance



The table below compares the hypothetical total return of stocks selected
using the Portfolio's investment strategy (the "Hypothetical Strategy Stocks")
with the stocks in the S&P 500 Index. Hypothetical total return includes any
dividends paid on the stocks together with any increase or decrease in the
value of the stocks. The table illustrates a hypothetical investment in the
Hypothetical Strategy Stocks at the beginning of each year -- similar to buying
Units of the Portfolio, redeeming them after one year and reinvesting the
proceeds in a new portfolio each year.


These hypothetical returns are not actual past performance of the Portfolio
or prior series but do reflect the sales charge or expenses you will pay. Of
course, these hypothetical returns are not guarantees of future results and the
value of your Units will fluctuate. You should note that the returns shown
below are hypothetical annual returns based on a calendar year investment. The
performance of the Portfolio may differ because the Portfolio has a 15 month
life that is not based on a calendar year investment cycle. For more
information about the hypothetical total return calculations, see "Notes to
Hypothetical Performance Tables".

Select S&P Core Portfolio



Investment Objective. The Portfolio seeks above-average total return.


Principal Investment Strategy. The Portfolio seeks to achieve its objective
by investing in a portfolio of stocks. The Portfolio follows a simple
investment strategy developed and designed by Standard & Poor's Investment
Advisory Services LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of the McGraw-Hill Companies,
Inc. (the "Portfolio Consultant"). Beginning with the S&P 500 Index, rank the
stocks by gross profit margin and select the 50 stocks with the highest gross
margin. Eliminate any stock from the previous step not ranked either "4" or "5"
by S&P Capital IQ's STock Appreciation Ranking System ("STARS"). Finally, rank
the remaining stocks by price to sales ratio and select up to twenty stocks
with the lowest price to sales ratios and hold them for approximately one year,
provided that the stock of any affiliate of Invesco Capital Markets, Inc., the
Sponsor, will be excluded. In addition, a stock will be excluded and such stock
will be replaced with the stock with the next lowest price to sales ratio if,
based on publicly available information as of the selection date, the company
is the target of an announced business acquisition which the Sponsor expects
will close within six months of the date of this prospectus. There is a
possibility that the strategy could produce a portfolio of less than twenty
stocks in the current Portfolio or a future trust, if available, due to a
shortfall of stocks which meet all the strategy criteria. When the Portfolio
terminates, you can elect to follow the strategy by redeeming your Units and
reinvesting the proceeds in a new portfolio, if available. The strategy was
implemented as of the close of business on December 19, 2012.


Gross profit margin is defined as a company's total revenue minus cost of
goods sold divided by total revenue. S&P Capital IQ introduced STARS on December
31, 1986. The STARS ranking reflects the opinion of S&P Capital IQ's equity
analysts on the total return potential of approximately 1,600 global equities
compared to the total return potential of a relevant benchmark over the coming
12 months. These rankings are not intended to predict price movements. The price
to sales ratio is defined as a company's stock price divided by the company's
reported sales per share from the previous year. The price to sales ratio screen
seeks to prevent selecting overvalued stocks.


The Portfolio is designed as part of a long-term investment strategy. The
Sponsor may offer a subsequent series of the portfolio when the current
Portfolio terminates. As a result, you may achieve more consistent overall
results by following the strategy over several years if subsequent series are
available. For more information see "Rights of Unitholders--Rollover".


Principal Risks. As with all investments, you can lose money by investing in
this Portfolio. The Portfolio also might not perform as well as you expect.
This can happen for reasons such as these:


o    Security prices will fluctuate. The value of your investment may fall
over time.


o    An issuer may be unwilling or unable to declare dividends in the
future, or may reduce the level of dividends declared. This may result
in a reduction in the value of your Units.


o    The financial condition of an issuer may worsen or its credit ratings
may drop, resulting in a reduction in the value of your Units. This
may occur at any point in time, including during the initial offering
period.


o    The Portfolio's performance might not sufficiently correspond to
published hypothetical performance of the Portfolio's investment
strategy. This can happen for reasons such as an inability to exactly
replicate the weightings of stocks in the strategy or be fully
invested, timing of the Portfolio offering or timing of your
investment, and Portfolio expenses.


o    The Portfolio is concentrated in securities issued by companies in
both the financials sector and the health care sector. Negative
developments in either of these sectors will affect the value of your
investment more than would be the case in a more diversified
investment.


o    We do not actively manage the Portfolio. Except in limited
circumstances, the Portfolio will hold, and continue to buy, shares of
the same securities even if their market value declines.

Example



This example helps you compare the cost of the Portfolio with other unit
trusts and mutual funds. In the example we assume that the expenses do not
change and that the Portfolio's annual return is 5%. Your actual returns and
expenses will vary. This example also assumes that you continue to follow the
Portfolio strategy and roll your investment, including all distributions, into
a new trust each year subject to a reduced rollover sales charge of 1.95%.
Based on these assumptions, you would pay the following expenses for every
$10,000 you invest in the Portfolio:








1 year    $    378
3 years        946
5 years      1,538
10 years     3,127


------------------








*    The estimated annual expenses are based upon the estimated trust size for
the Portfolio determined as of the initial date of deposit. Because certain
of the operating expenses are fixed amounts, if the trust does not reach
that estimated size, the amount of the estimated annual expenses per 100
units may exceed the amounts reflected. On the business day following the
end of the initial offering period, the Sponsor and/or the Supervisor will
waive their respective fees, and/or the Sponsor will reimburse the
Portfolio operating expenses, in an amount so that the total estimated
annual expenses calculated on that date do not exceed $3.500 per 100 units.
However, subsequent to that date the value of the Portfolio as well as the
number of outstanding units may decline, and/or the actual amount of the
operating expenses may exceed the estimated amounts, any of which could
result in the actual amount of the total annual expenses exceeding $3.500
per 100 units.


The maximum sales charge is 2.95% of the Public Offering Price per Unit.
The initial sales charge is the difference between the total sales charge
(maximum of 2.95% of the Public Offering Price) and the sum of the remaining
deferred sales charge and the total creation and development fee. The deferred
sales charge is fixed at $0.145 per Unit and accrues daily from April 10, 2013
through September 9, 2013. Your Portfolio pays a proportionate amount of this
charge on the 10th day of each month beginning in the accrual period until paid
in full. The combination of the initial and deferred sales charges comprises
the "transactional sales charge". The creation and development fee is fixed at
$0.05 per Unit and is paid at the earlier of the end of the initial offering
period (anticipated to be three months) or six months following the Initial
Date of Deposit.

distributions you receive will vary from the estimated amount due to
changes in the Portfolio's fees and expenses, in actual income received by
the Portfolio, currency fluctuations and with changes in the Portfolio such
as the acquisition or liquidation of securities. See "Rights of
Unitholders--Estimated Distributions."


2    The Trustee will make distributions of income and capital on each monthly
Distribution Date to Unitholders of record on the preceding Record Date,
provided that the total cash held for distribution equals at least 0.1% of
the Portfolio's net asset value. Undistributed income and capital will be
distributed in the next month in which the total cash held for distribution
equals at least 0.1% of the Portfolio's net asset value. Based on the
foregoing, it is currently estimated that the initial distribution will
occur in April 2013.



Hypothetical Strategy Performance



The table below compares the hypothetical total return of stocks selected
using the Portfolio's investment strategy (the "Hypothetical Strategy Stocks")
with the stocks in the S&P 500 Index. Hypothetical total return includes any
dividends paid on the stocks together with any increase or decrease in the
value of the stocks. The table illustrates a hypothetical investment in the
Hypothetical Strategy Stocks at the beginning of each year -- similar to buying
Units of the Portfolio, redeeming them after one year and reinvesting the
proceeds in a new portfolio each year. The Portfolio's strategy only resulted
in 19 Hypothetical Strategy Stocks in 1988 and 15 Hypothetical Strategy Stocks
in 2005 due to shortfall of stocks that met all the strategy criteria. The
strategy resulted in 20 stocks in all other years.


These hypothetical returns are not actual past performance of the Portfolio
or prior series but do reflect the sales charge or expenses you will pay. Of
course, these hypothetical returns are not guarantees of future results and the
value of your Units will fluctuate. You should note that the returns shown
below are hypothetical annual returns based on a calendar year investment. The
performance of the Portfolio may differ because the Portfolio has a 15 month
life that is not based on a calendar year investment cycle. For more
information about the hypothetical total return calculations, see "Notes to
Hypothetical Performance Tables".

Global 45 Dividend Strategy Portfolio



Investment Objective. The Portfolio seeks above-average total return.


Principal Investment Strategy. The Portfolio seeks to achieve its objective
by investing in a portfolio of stocks. The Portfolio invests in stocks of
foreign and domestic companies selected by applying separate uniquely
specialized strategies. Invesco Capital Markets, Inc. is the Sponsor of the
Portfolio. The Portfolio combines three simple investment strategies: the
Select 10 Industrial Strategy, the Select S&P Industrial Strategy, and the EAFE
Select 20 Strategy.


The Select 10 Industrial Strategy selects the ten highest dividend-yielding
stocks in the Dow Jones Industrial Average for the Portfolio. This portion of
the Portfolio strategy was implemented as of the close of business on December
19, 2012.


The Select S&P Industrial Strategy follows a strategy designed by Standard &
Poor's Investment Advisory Services LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of the
McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc. (the "Portfolio Consultant"). Beginning with the
S&P Industrials Index, the strategy selects only those stocks ranked either A
or A+ by S&P Capital IQ's Earnings and Dividend Rankings for Common Stock and
then removes all stocks in the Dow Jones Industrial Average. The remaining
stocks are ranked by market capitalization and the top 75% are retained. The
strategy selects the fifteen highest dividend-yielding stocks for the
Portfolio. In addition, a stock will be excluded and such stock will be
replaced with the stock with the next highest dividend-yielding stock if, based
on publicly available information as of the selection date, the company is the
target of an announced business acquisition which the Sponsor expects will
close within six months of the date of this prospectus. This portion of the
Portfolio strategy was implemented as of the close of business on December 19,
2012.


The EAFE Select 20 Strategy begins with the stocks in the Morgan Stanley
Capital International Europe, Australasia and Far East Index, one of the most
widely-used benchmarks for international investing. Stocks traded in Singapore
are eliminated from the strategy to help limit exposure to uncertain political
and economic conditions. The stocks are screened to include only those companies
with positive one- and three-year sales and earnings growth and three years of
positive dividend growth. The remaining stocks are ranked by market
capitalization and the top 75% are retained. The strategy selects the twenty
highest dividend-yielding stocks for the Portfolio. Any stock from the previous
step which is a passive foreign investment companies is replaced with the next
highest dividend-yielding stock. This portion of the Portfolio strategy was
implemented as of the close of business on December 19, 2012.


Each strategy makes up approximately one-third of the initial Portfolio.
When the Portfolio terminates, you can elect to follow the Global 45 Dividend
Strategy by redeeming your Units and reinvesting the proceeds in a new
portfolio, if available. The Portfolio is designed as part of a long-term
investment strategy. The Sponsor may offer a subsequent series of the portfolio
when the current Portfolio terminates. As a result, you may achieve more
consistent overall results by following the strategy over several years if
subsequent series are available. For more information see "Rights of
Unitholders--Rollover".


Principal Risks. As with all investments, you can lose money by investing in
this Portfolio. The Portfolio also might not perform as well as you expect.
This can happen for reasons such as these:


o    Security prices will fluctuate. The value of your investment may fall
over time.


o    An issuer may be unwilling or unable to declare dividends in the
future, or may reduce the level of dividends declared. This may result
in a reduction in the value of your Units.


o    The financial condition of an issuer may worsen or its credit ratings
may drop, resulting in a reduction in the value of your Units. This
may occur at any point in time, including during the initial offering
period.


o    The Portfolio's performance might not sufficiently correspond to
published hypothetical performance of the Portfolio's investment
strategy. This can happen for reasons such as an inability to exactly
replicate the weightings of stocks in the strategy or be fully
invested, timing of the Portfolio offering or timing of your
investment, and Portfolio expenses.


o    Stocks of foreign companies in the Portfolio present risks beyond
those of U.S. issuers. These risks may include market and political
factors related to the company's foreign market, international trade
conditions, less regulation, smaller or less liquid markets, increased
volatility, differing accounting practices and changes in the value of
foreign currencies.


o    The Portfolio is concentrated in securities issued by companies in
the consumer staples sector. Negative developments in this sector will
affect the value of your investment more than would be the case in a
more diversified investment.


o    We do not actively manage the Portfolio. Except in limited
circumstances, the Portfolio will hold, and continue to buy, shares of
the same securities even if their market value declines.

Example



This example helps you compare the cost of the Portfolio with other unit
trusts and mutual funds. In the example we assume that the expenses do not
change and that the Portfolio's annual return is 5%. Your actual returns and
expenses will vary. This example also assumes that you continue to follow the
Portfolio strategy and roll your investment, including all distributions, into
a new trust each year subject to a reduced rollover sales charge of 1.95%.
Based on these assumptions, you would pay the following expenses for every
$10,000 you invest in the Portfolio:








1 year    $    348
3 years        856
5 years      1,390
10 years     2,840


------------------








*    The estimated annual expenses are based upon the estimated trust size for
the Portfolio determined as of the initial date of deposit. Because certain
of the operating expenses are fixed amounts, if the trust does not reach
that estimated size, the amount of the estimated annual expenses per 100
units may exceed the amounts reflected. On the business day following the
end of the initial offering period, the Sponsor and/or the Supervisor will
waive their respective fees, and/or the Sponsor will reimburse the
Portfolio operating expenses, in an amount so that the total estimated
annual expenses calculated on that date do not exceed $5.000 per 100 units.
However, subsequent to that date the value of the Portfolio as well as the
number of outstanding units may decline, and/or the actual amount of the
operating expenses may exceed the estimated amounts, any of which could
result in the actual amount of the total annual expenses exceeding $5.000
per 100 units.


The maximum sales charge is 2.95% of the Public Offering Price per Unit.
The initial sales charge is the difference between the total sales charge
(maximum of 2.95% of the Public Offering Price) and the sum of the remaining
deferred sales charge and the total creation and development fee. The deferred
sales charge is fixed at $0.145 per Unit and accrues daily from April 10, 2013
through September 9, 2013. Your Portfolio pays a proportionate amount of this
charge on the 10th day of each month beginning in the accrual period until paid
in full. The combination of the initial and deferred sales charges comprises
the "transactional sales charge". The creation and development fee is fixed at
$0.05 per Unit and is paid at the earlier of the end of the initial offering
period (anticipated to be three months) or six months following the Initial
Date of Deposit.

1    As of close of business day prior to Initial Date of Deposit. The actual
distributions you receive will vary from the estimated amount due to
changes in the Portfolio's fees and expenses, in actual income received by
the Portfolio, currency fluctuations and with changes in the Portfolio such
as the acquisition or liquidation of securities. See "Rights of
Unitholders--Estimated Distributions."



Hypothetical Strategy Performance



The table below compares the hypothetical total return of stocks selected
using the Portfolio's investment strategy (the "Hypothetical Strategy Stocks")
with the stocks in the S&P 500 Index. Hypothetical total return includes any
dividends paid on the stocks together with any increase or decrease in the
value of the stocks. The table illustrates a hypothetical investment in the
Hypothetical Strategy Stocks at the beginning of each year -- similar to buying
Units of the Portfolio, redeeming them after one year and reinvesting the
proceeds in a new portfolio each year.


These hypothetical returns are not actual past performance of the Portfolio
or prior series but do reflect the sales charge or expenses you will pay. Of
course, these hypothetical returns are not guarantees of future results and the
value of your Units will fluctuate. You should note that the returns shown
below are hypothetical annual returns based on a calendar year investment. The
performance of the Portfolio may differ because the Portfolio has a 15 month
life that is not based on a calendar year investment cycle. For more
information about the hypothetical total return calculations, see "Notes to
Hypothetical Performance Tables".

Select 10 Industrial Portfolio



Investment Objective. The Portfolio seeks above average total return.


Principal Investment Strategy. The Portfolio seeks above-average total
return by investing in a portfolio of stocks. The Portfolio follows a simple
investment strategy: Buy the ten highest dividend-yielding stocks in the Dow
Jones Industrial Average and hold them for approximately one year. Invesco
Capital Markets, Inc., the Sponsor, implemented the strategy using information
available as of the close of business on December 19, 2012. When the Portfolio
terminates, you can elect to follow the strategy by redeeming your Units and
reinvesting the proceeds in a new portfolio, if available.


The Portfolio is designed as part of a long-term investment strategy. The
Sponsor may offer a subsequent series of the portfolio when the current
Portfolio terminates. As a result, you may achieve more consistent overall
results by following the strategy over several years if subsequent series are
available. For more information see "Rights of Unitholders--Rollover".


Principal Risks. As with all investments, you can lose money by investing in
this Portfolio. The Portfolio also might not perform as well as you expect.
This can happen for reasons such as these:


o    Security prices will fluctuate. The value of your investment may fall
over time.


o    An issuer may be unwilling or unable to declare dividends in the
future, or may reduce the level of dividends declared. This may result
in a reduction in the value of your Units.


o    The financial condition of an issuer may worsen or its credit ratings
may drop, resulting in a reduction in the value of your Units. This
may occur at any point in time, including during the initial offering
period.


o    The Portfolio's performance might not sufficiently correspond to
published hypothetical performance of the Portfolio's investment
strategy. This can happen for reasons such as an inability to exactly
replicate the composition and/or weightings of stocks in the strategy
or be fully invested, the timing of the Portfolio offering or timing
of your investment, regulatory restrictions and Portfolio expenses.


o    The Portfolio is concentrated in securities issued by companies in
the health care sector. Negative developments in this sector will
affect the value of your investment more than would be the case in a
more diversified investment.


o    The Portfolio holds a relatively small number of stocks. You may
encounter more price volatility than would occur in an investment
diversified among a greater number of stocks.


o    We do not actively manage the Portfolio. Except in limited
circumstances, the Portfolio will hold, and continue to buy, shares of
the same securities even if their market value declines.

Example



This example helps you compare the cost of the Portfolio with other unit
trusts and mutual funds. In the example we assume that the expenses do not
change and that the Portfolio's annual return is 5%. Your actual returns and
expenses will vary. This example also assumes that you continue to follow the
Portfolio strategy and roll your investment, including all distributions, into
a new trust each year subject to a reduced rollover sales charge of 1.95%.
Based on these assumptions, you would pay the following expenses for every
$10,000 you invest in the Portfolio:








1 year    $    328
3 years        798
5 years      1,292
10 years     2,645


------------------








*    The estimated annual expenses are based upon the estimated trust size for
the Portfolio determined as of the initial date of deposit. Because certain
of the operating expenses are fixed amounts, if the trust does not reach
that estimated size, the amount of the estimated annual expenses per 100
units may exceed the amounts reflected. On the business day following the
end of the initial offering period, the Sponsor and/or the Supervisor will
waive their respective fees, and/or the Sponsor will reimburse the
Portfolio operating expenses, in an amount so that the total estimated
annual expenses calculated on that date do not exceed $3.500 per 100 units.
However, subsequent to that date the value of the Portfolio as well as the
number of outstanding units may decline, and/or the actual amount of the
operating expenses may exceed the estimated amounts, any of which could
result in the actual amount of the total annual expenses exceeding $3.500
per 100 units.


The maximum sales charge is 2.95% of the Public Offering Price per Unit.
The initial sales charge is the difference between the total sales charge
(maximum of 2.95% of the Public Offering Price) and the sum of the remaining
deferred sales charge and the total creation and development fee. The deferred
sales charge is fixed at $0.145 per Unit and accrues daily from March 10, 2013
through August 9, 2013. Your Portfolio pays a proportionate amount of this
charge on the 10th day of each month beginning in the accrual period until paid
in full. The combination of the initial and deferred sales charges comprises
the "transactional sales charge". The creation and development fee is fixed at
$0.05 per Unit and is paid at the earlier of the end of the initial offering
period (anticipated to be two months) or six months following the Initial Date
of Deposit.

1    As of close of business day prior to Initial Date of Deposit. The actual
distributions you receive will vary from the estimated amount due to
changes in the Portfolio's fees and expenses, in actual income received by
the Portfolio, currency fluctuations and with changes in the Portfolio such
as the acquisition or liquidation of securities. See "Rights of
Unitholders--Estimated Distributions."


2    The Trustee will make distributions of income and capital on each monthly
Distribution Date to Unitholders of record on the preceding Record Date,
provided that the total cash held for distribution equals at least 0.1% of
the Portfolio's net asset value. Undistributed income and capital will be
distributed in the next month in which the total cash held for distribution
equals at least 0.1% of the Portfolio's net asset value. Based on the
foregoing, it is currently estimated that the initial distribution will
occur in February 2013.



Hypothetical Strategy Performance



The table below compares the hypothetical total return of stocks selected
using the Portfolio's investment strategy (the "Hypothetical Strategy Stocks")
with the stocks in the Dow Jones Industrial Average ("The Dow 30[SM]").
Hypothetical total return includes any dividends paid on the stocks together
with any increase or decrease in the value of the stocks. The table illustrates
a hypothetical investment in the Hypothetical Strategy Stocks at the beginning
of each year -- similar to buying Units of the Portfolio, redeeming them after
one year and reinvesting the proceeds in a new portfolio each year.


These hypothetical returns are not actual past performance of the Portfolio
or prior series but do reflect the sales charge or expenses you will pay. Of
course, these hypothetical returns are not guarantees of future results and the
value of your Units will fluctuate. You should note that the returns shown
below are hypothetical annual returns based on a calendar year investment. The
performance of the Portfolio may differ because the Portfolio has a 14 month
life that is not based on a calendar year investment cycle. For more

Notes to Hypothetical Performance Tables



Hypothetical total return for each period was calculated by (1) subtracting
the closing sale price of the stocks on the last trading day of the prior
period from the closing sale price of the stocks on the last trading day of the
period, (2) adding dividends paid during that period and (3) dividing the
result by the closing sale price of the stocks on the last trading day of the
prior period and reducing this amount by typical Portfolio expenses and sales
charges. Average annual total return reflects annualized change while total
return reflects aggregate change and is not annualized. The sales charge used
for the hypothetical total returns is 2.95% for the first year and 1.95% for
subsequent years, which reflects the Portfolios' reduced sales charge for
"rollover" investments. Adjustments were made to reflect events such as stock
splits and corporate spin-offs. Hypothetical total return does not take into
consideration commissions or taxes. With respect to foreign securities, all
values are converted into U.S. dollars using the applicable currency exchange
rate.


These tables represent hypothetical past performance of the Portfolio
strategies (not the Portfolios) and are not guarantees or indications of future
performance of any Portfolio. The hypothetical performance is the retroactive
application of the strategy designed with the full benefit of hindsight.
Unitholders will not necessarily realize as high a total return as the
hypothetical returns in the tables for several reasons including, among others:

the total return figures in the tables do not reflect commissions paid by a
Portfolio on the purchase of Securities or taxes incurred by Unitholders; the
Portfolios are established at different times of the year; a Portfolio may not
be able to invest equally in the Securities according to the strategy
weightings and may not be fully invested at all times; a Portfolio may be
subject to specific investment exclusions or restrictions; the Securities are
often purchased or sold at prices different from the closing prices used in
buying and selling Units; the stock prices on the strategy implementation date
may be different from prices on the Initial Date of Deposit; extraordinary
market events that are not expected to be repeated and may have affected
performance; and currency exchange rates will be different. In addition, both
stock prices (which may appreciate or depreciate) and dividends (which may be
increased, reduced or eliminated) will affect actual returns. There can be no
assurance that any Portfolio will outperform the comparison stock index(es)
over its life or future rollover periods, if available. The Sponsor uses data
furnished by Bloomberg L.P., Horizon Investment Services, FactSet, Compustat,
Morgan Stanley Capital International, Standard & Poor's and Dow Jones Indexes,
a CME Group company to implement the strategy and to generate the information
contained in the table. These data sources are applied in a consistent manner
without the use of discretion. The Sponsor has not independently verified the
data obtained from these sources but has no reason to believe that this data is
incorrect in any material respect.


The S&P 500 Index consists of 500 stocks chosen by Standard & Poor's to be
representative of the leaders of various industries.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average is a price-weighted index that is
calculated as a simple average. The Dow Jones Industrial Average includes 30
large-cap, blue-chip U.S. stocks, excluding utility and transportation
companies.


The MSCI EAFE[SM] Index, Dow Jones Select Dividend Index, S&P 500 Index and
The Dow Jones Industrial Average are unmanaged, are not subject to fees and are
not available for direct investment.



Notes to Portfolios



(1)  The Securities are initially represented by "regular way" contracts for
the performance of which an irrevocable letter of credit has been deposited
with the Trustee. Contracts to acquire Securities were entered into on
December 28, 2012 and December 31, 2012 and have settlement dates ranging
from January 3, 2013 through January 8, 2013 (see "The Portfolios").


(2)  The value of each Security is determined on the bases set forth under
"Public Offering--Unit Price" as of the close of the New York Stock
Exchange on the business day before the Initial Date of Deposit. In
accordance with FASB Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC"), ASC 820,
Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, the Portfolio's investments are
classified as Level 1, which refers to security prices determined using
quoted prices in active markets for identical securities. Other information
regarding the Securities, as of the Initial Date of Deposit, is as follows:

"+"  indicates that the stock was issued by a foreign company.


(3)  Current Dividend Yield for each Security is based on the estimated annual
dividends per share and the Security's value as of the most recent close of
trading on the New York Stock Exchange on the business day before the
Initial Date of Deposit. Generally, estimated annual dividends per share
are calculated by annualizing the most recently declared regular dividends
or by adding the most recent regular interim and final dividends declared
and reflect any foreign withholding taxes. In certain cases, this
calculation may consider several recently declared dividends in order for
the Current Dividend Yield to be more reflective of recent historical
dividend rates. When determining the highest dividend- yielding securities
for certain of the Portfolios, publicly available information concerning
reductions in future dividend payments to be made by an eligible stock may
be taken into account.



REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM




To the Unitholders of Invesco Unit Trusts, Series 1293:



We have audited the accompanying statements of condition including the
related portfolios of EAFE Select 20 Portfolio 2013-1, The Dow Jones Select
Dividend Index Strategy Portfolio 2013-1, Select 5 Industrial Portfolio 2013-1,
Select S&P Industrial Portfolio 2013-1, Select S&P Core Portfolio 2013-1,
Global 45 Dividend Strategy Portfolio 2013-1 and Select 10 Industrial Portfolio
2013-1 (included in Invesco Unit Trusts, Series 1293) as of January 2, 2013.
The statements of condition are the responsibility of the Sponsor. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on such statements of condition based
on our audits.


We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require
that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether the statements of condition are free of material misstatement. The
trusts are not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform an audit of
their internal control over financial reporting. Our audits included
consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for
designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not
for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the trusts'
internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such
opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the statements of condition, assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by the Sponsor, as
well as evaluating the overall statements of condition presentation. Our
procedures included confirmation with The Bank of New York Mellon, Trustee, of
cash or an irrevocable letter of credit deposited for the purchase of
Securities as shown in the statements of condition as of January 2, 2013. We
believe that our audits of the statements of condition provide a reasonable
basis for our opinion.


In our opinion, the statements of condition referred to above present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of EAFE Select 20
Portfolio 2013-1, The Dow Jones Select Dividend Index Strategy Portfolio
2013-1, Select 5 Industrial Portfolio 2013-1, Select S&P Industrial Portfolio
2013-1, Select S&P Core Portfolio 2013-1, Global 45 Dividend Strategy Portfolio
2013-1 and Select 10 Industrial Portfolio 2013-1 (included in Invesco Unit
Trusts, Series 1293) as of January 2, 2013, in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

(1)  The value of the Securities is determined by the Trustee on the bases set
forth under "Public Offering--Unit Price". The contracts to purchase
Securities are collateralized by separate irrevocable letters of credit
which have been deposited with the Trustee.


(2)  A portion of the Public Offering Price represents an amount sufficient to
pay for all or a portion of the costs incurred in establishing a Portfolio.
The amount of these costs are set forth in the "Fee Table". A distribution
will be made as of the earlier of the close of the initial offering period
(approximately two or three months, as applicable) or six months following
the Initial Date of Deposit to an account maintained by the Trustee from
which the organization expense obligation of the investors will be
satisfied. To the extent that actual organization costs of a Portfolio are
greater than the estimated amount, only the estimated organization costs
added to the Public Offering Price will be reimbursed to the Sponsor and
deducted from the assets of the Portfolio.


(3)  Represents the amount of mandatory distributions from a Portfolio on the
bases set forth under "Public Offering".


(4)  The creation and development fee is payable by a Portfolio on behalf of
Unitholders out of the assets of the Portfolio as of the close of the
initial offering period. If Units are redeemed prior to the close of the
initial public offering period, the fee will not be deducted from the
proceeds.


(5)  The aggregate public offering price and the aggregate sales charge are

(1)  The value of the Securities is determined by the Trustee on the bases set
forth under "Public Offering--Unit Price". The contracts to purchase
Securities are collateralized by separate irrevocable letters of credit
which have been deposited with the Trustee.


(2)  A portion of the Public Offering Price represents an amount sufficient to
pay for all or a portion of the costs incurred in establishing a Portfolio.
The amount of these costs are set forth in the "Fee Table". A distribution
will be made as of the earlier of the close of the initial offering period
(approximately two or three months, as applicable) or six months following
the Initial Date of Deposit to an account maintained by the Trustee from
which the organization expense obligation of the investors will be
satisfied. To the extent that actual organization costs of a Portfolio are
greater than the estimated amount, only the estimated organization costs
added to the Public Offering Price will be reimbursed to the Sponsor and
deducted from the assets of the Portfolio.


(3)  Represents the amount of mandatory distributions from a Portfolio on the
bases set forth under "Public Offering".


(4)  The creation and development fee is payable by a Portfolio on behalf of
Unitholders out of the assets of the Portfolio as of the close of the
initial offering period. If Units are redeemed prior to the close of the
initial public offering period, the fee will not be deducted from the
proceeds.


(5)  The aggregate public offering price and the aggregate sales charge are
computed on the bases set forth under "Public Offering".


(6)  Assumes the maximum sales charge.



THE PORTFOLIOS





The Portfolios were created under the laws of the State of New York pursuant
to a Trust Indenture and Trust Agreement (the "Trust Agreement"), dated the
date of this prospectus (the "Initial Date of Deposit"), among Invesco Capital
Markets, Inc. (formerly Van Kampen Funds Inc.), as Sponsor, Invesco Investment
Advisers LLC, as Supervisor, and The Bank of New York Mellon, as Trustee.


The Portfolios offer investors the opportunity to purchase Units
representing proportionate interests in portfolios of equity securities which
are components of major stock market indexes. A Portfolio may be an appropriate
medium for investors who desire to participate in a portfolio of stocks with
greater diversification than they might be able to acquire individually and who
are seeking to achieve a better performance than the related index.


On the Initial Date of Deposit, the Sponsor deposited delivery statements
relating to contracts for the purchase of the Securities and an irrevocable
letter of credit in the amount required for these purchases with the Trustee.
In exchange for these contracts the Trustee delivered to the Sponsor
documentation evidencing the ownership of Units of the Portfolios. Unless
otherwise terminated as provided in the Trust Agreement, the Portfolios will
terminate on the Mandatory Termination Date and any remaining Securities will
be liquidated or distributed by the Trustee within a reasonable time. As used
in this prospectus the term "Securities" means the securities (including
contracts to purchase these securities) listed in each "Portfolio" and any
additional securities deposited into each Portfolio.


Additional Units of a Portfolio may be issued at any time by depositing in
the Portfolio (i) additional Securities, (ii) contracts to purchase Securities
together with cash or irrevocable letters of credit or (iii) cash (or a letter
of credit or the equivalent) with instructions to purchase additional
Securities. As additional Units are issued by a Portfolio, the aggregate value
of the Securities will be increased and the fractional undivided interest
represented by each Unit may be decreased. The Sponsor may continue to make
additional deposits into a Portfolio following the Initial Date of Deposit
provided that the additional deposits will be in amounts which will maintain,
as nearly as practicable, the same percentage relationship among the number of
shares of each Security in the Portfolio that existed immediately prior to the
subsequent deposit. Investors may experience a dilution of their investments
and a reduction in their anticipated income because of fluctuations in the
prices of the Securities between the time of the deposit and the purchase of
the Securities and because the Portfolios will pay the associated brokerage or
acquisition fees. Due to round lot requirements in certain foreign securities
markets and market value fluctuations, certain Portfolios may not be able to
invest in each Security on any subsequent date of deposit in the same
proportion as existed on the Initial Date of Deposit or immediately prior to
the subsequent deposit of Securities. This could increase the potential for
dilution of investments and variances in anticipated income. In addition,
during the initial offering of Units it may not be possible to buy a particular
Security due to regulatory or trading restrictions, or corporate actions. While
such limitations are in effect, additional Units would be created by purchasing
each of the Securities in your Portfolio that are not subject to those
limitations. This would also result in the dilution of the investment in any
such Security not purchased and potential variances in anticipated income.
Purchases and sales of Securities by your Portfolio may impact the value of the
Securities. This may especially be the case during the initial offering of
Units, upon Portfolio termination and in the course of satisfying large Unit
redemptions.


Each Unit of your Portfolio initially offered represents an undivided
interest in the Portfolio. At the close of the New York Stock Exchange on the
Initial Date of Deposit, the number of Units may be adjusted so that the Public
Offering Price per Unit equals $10. The number of Units, fractional interest of
each Unit in your Portfolio and the estimated distributions per Unit will
increase or decrease to the extent of any adjustment. To the extent that any
Units are redeemed by the Trustee or additional Units are issued as a result of
additional Securities being deposited by the Sponsor, the fractional undivided
interest in your Portfolio represented by each unredeemed Unit will increase or
decrease accordingly, although the actual interest in your Portfolio will
remain unchanged. Units will remain outstanding until redeemed upon tender to
the Trustee by Unitholders, which may include the Sponsor, or until the
termination of the Trust Agreement.


Each Portfolio consists of (a) the Securities (including contracts for the
purchase thereof) listed under the applicable "Portfolio" as may continue to be
held from time to time in the Portfolio, (b) any additional Securities acquired
and held by the Portfolio pursuant to the provisions of the Trust Agreement and

(c) any cash held in the related Income and Capital Accounts. Neither the
Sponsor nor the Trustee shall be liable in any way for any failure in any
contract of the Securities.



OBJECTIVES AND SECURITIES SELECTION





The objective and investment strategy of each Portfolio is described in the
individual Portfolio sections. There is no assurance that a Portfolio will
achieve its objective.


The Portfolios offer the potential to achieve better performance than the
related indexes through index-based investment strategies. Certain strategies
may also offer the potential for less volatility or potential for higher
dividend income when compared to the related index. The investment strategies
are designed to be implemented on an annual basis. Investors who hold Units
through Portfolio termination may have investment results that differ
significantly from a Unit investment that is reinvested into a new trust every
twelve months.


Except as described herein, publishers of the indexes have not participated
in any way in the creation of the Portfolios or in the selection of stocks
included in the Portfolios and have not approved any information herein
relating thereto. The publishers of these indexes are not affiliated with the
Sponsor.

The Portfolio Consultant of the Select S&P Industrial Portfolio, Select S&P
Core Portfolio and the Global 45 Dividend Strategy Portfolio is not an
affiliate of the Sponsor. The Portfolio Consultant may use the list of
Securities in its independent capacity as an investment adviser and distributes
this information to various individuals and entities. The Portfolio Consultant
may recommend or effect transactions in the Securities. This may have an
adverse effect on the prices of the Securities. This also may have an impact on
the price a Portfolio pays for the Securities and the price received upon Unit
redemptions or Portfolio termination. The Portfolio Consultant may act as agent
or principal in connection with the purchase and sale of equity securities,
including the Securities, and may act as a market maker in the Securities. The
Portfolio Consultant also issues reports and makes recommendations on the
Securities. The Portfolio Consultant's research department may receive
compensation based on commissions generated by research and/or sales of Units.


Neither the Portfolio Consultant nor the Sponsor manage the Portfolios. You
should note that the Portfolio Consultant or Sponsor applied the selection
criteria to the Securities for inclusion in the Portfolios as of the applicable
selection time. After this time, the Securities may no longer meet the
selection criteria. Should a Security no longer meet the selection criteria, we
will generally not remove the Security from its Portfolio. In offering the
Units to the public, neither the Sponsor nor any broker-dealers are
recommending any of the individual Securities but rather the entire pool of
Securities in a Portfolio, taken as a whole, which are represented by the
Units.



RISK FACTORS





All investments involve risk. This section describes the main risks that can
impact the value of the securities in your Portfolio. You should understand
these risks before you invest. If the value of the securities falls, the value
of your Units will also fall. We cannot guarantee that your Portfolio will
achieve its objective or that your investment return will be positive over any
period.


Market Risk. Market risk is the risk that the value of the securities in
your Portfolio will fluctuate. This could cause the value of your Units to fall
below your original purchase price. Market value fluctuates in response to
various factors. These can include changes in interest rates, inflation, the
financial condition of a security's issuer, perceptions of the issuer, or
ratings on a security of the issuer. Even though your Portfolio is supervised,
you should remember that we do not manage your Portfolio. Your Portfolio will
not sell a security solely because the market value falls as is possible in a
managed fund. In addition, because some Portfolios hold relatively small number
of stocks, you may encounter more price volatility than would occur in an
investment diversified among a greater number of stocks.


Dividend Payment Risk. Dividend payment risk is the risk that an issuer of a
security is unwilling or unable to pay dividends on a security. Stocks
represent ownership interests in the issuers and are not obligations of the
issuers. Common stockholders have a right to receive dividends only after the
company has provided for payment of its creditors, bondholders and preferred
stockholders. Common stocks do not assure dividend payments. Dividends are paid
only when declared by an issuer's board of directors and the amount of any
dividend may vary over time. If dividends received by your Portfolio are
insufficient to cover expenses, redemptions or other Portfolio costs, it may be
necessary for your Portfolio to sell Securities to cover such expenses,
redemptions or other costs. Any such sales may result in capital gains or
losses to you. See "Taxation".


Strategy Correlation. Each Portfolio involves the risk that its performance
will not sufficiently correspond with the hypothetical performance of the
Portfolio's investment strategy. This can happen for reasons such as:


o    the impracticability of owning each of the strategy stocks with the
exact weightings at a given time, especially as a result of round-lot
trading requirements applicable to certain foreign issuers,


o    strategy performance is based on a calendar year strategy while the
Portfolios are created at various times during the year and have 14 or
15 month terms,


o    a Portfolio may not be fully invested at all times, and


o    fees and expenses of a Portfolio.


In addition, the stock selection strategy of a Portfolio may not be
successful in identifying stocks that appreciate in value or pay significant
dividends. A Portfolio may not achieve its objective if this happens.


Industry Risks. Your Portfolio may invest significantly in certain
industries. Any negative impact on the related industry will have a greater
impact on the value of Units than on a portfolio diversified over several
industries. You should understand the risks of these industries before you
invest.


Consumer Discretionary and Consumer Staples Issuers. The EAFE Select 20
Portfolio, Select S&P Industrial Portfolio, Dow Jones Select Dividend Index
Strategy Portfolio and Global 45 Dividend Strategy Portfolio invest
significantly in companies that manufacture or sell various consumer products.
General risks of these companies include the overall state of the economy,
intense competition and consumer spending trends. A decline in the economy
which results in a reduction of consumers' disposable income can negatively
impact spending habits. Global factors including political developments,
imposition of import controls, fluctuations in oil prices, and changes in
exchange rates may adversely affect issuers of consumer products and services.


Competitiveness in the retail industry may require large capital outlays for
the installation of automated checkout equipment to control inventory, track
the sale of items and gauge the success of sales campaigns. Retailers who sell
their products over the Internet have the potential to access more consumers,
but may require sophisticated technology to remain competitive. Changes in
demographics and consumer tastes can also affect the demand for, and the
success of, consumer products and services in the marketplace. Consumer
products and services companies may be subject to government regulation
affecting their products and operations which may negatively impact
performance. Tobacco companies may be adversely affected by new laws,
regulations and litigation.


Financial Services Issuers. The Dow Jones Select Dividend Index Strategy
Portfolio and Select S&P Core Portfolio invest significantly in banks and other
financial services companies. In general, financial services issuers are
substantially affected by changes in economic and market conditions, including:

the liquidity and volatility levels in the global financial markets; interest
rates, as well as currency and commodities prices; investor sentiment;
inflation and unemployment; the availability and cost of capital and credit;
exposure to various geographic markets or in commercial and residential real
estate; competition from new entrants in their fields of business; and the
overall health of the U.S. and international economies.


The financial services sector continues to be adversely affected by global
developments over the last few years including recessionary conditions,
deterioration in the credit markets and recurring concerns over sovereign debt.
A substantial amount of assets have been written down by financial
institutions, with the impact of these losses forcing a number of large
traditional banks, investment banks, broker/dealers and insurers into either
liquidation or combination. This also has drastically increasing the credit
risk, and possibility of default, of bonds issued by such institutions faced
with these problems. Many of the institutions may continue to experience
difficulty in accessing credit markets to finance their operations and in
maintaining appropriate levels of equity capital. While the U.S. and foreign
governments, and their respective government agencies, have taken steps to
address problems in the financial markets and with financial institutions,
there can be no assurance that the risks associated with investment in
financial services issuers will decrease as a result of these steps.


Such economic and political conditions and increased public scrutiny during
the past few years have led to new legislation and increased regulation in the
U.S. and abroad, creating additional challenges for financial institutions.
Regulatory initiatives and requirements that are being proposed around the
world may be inconsistent or may conflict with regulations to which financial
services issuers are currently subject, thereby resulting in higher compliance
and legal costs, as well as the potential for higher operational, capital and
liquidity costs. These laws and regulations may affect the manner in which a
particular financial institution does business and the products and services it
may provide. Increased regulation may restrict a company's ability to compete
in its current businesses or to enter into or acquire new businesses. New
regulations may reduce or limit a company's revenue or impose additional fees,
assessments or taxes on those companies and intensify regulatory supervision,
adversely affecting business operations or leading to other negative
consequences.


Among the most prominent pieces of legislation following the financial
crisis has been the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act
(the "Dodd-Frank Act"), enacted into federal law on July 21, 2010. The
Dodd-Frank Act includes reforms and refinements to modernize existing laws to
address emerging risks and issues in the nation's evolving financial system. It
also establishes entirely new regulatory regimes, including in areas such as
systemic risk regulation, over-the-counter derivatives market oversight, and
federal consumer protection. The Dodd-Frank Act is intended to cover virtually
all participants in the financial services industry for years to come,
including banks, thrifts, depository institution holding companies, mortgage
lenders, insurance companies, industrial loan companies, broker-dealers and
other securities and investment advisory firms, private equity and hedge funds,
consumers, numerous federal agencies and the federal regulatory structure.
These regulatory changes may have adverse effects on certain issuers in your
Portfolio, and could lead to decreases in such issuers' profits or revenues. In
many cases the full impact of the Dodd-Frank Act on a financial institution's
business remains uncertain because of the extensive rule-making still to be
completed. The Sponsor is unable to predict the ultimate impact of the
Dodd-Frank Act, and any resulting regulation, on the securities in your
Portfolio or on the financial services industry in general.


Developments in the Eurozone sovereign debt crisis, including the potential
for further downgrades of sovereign credit ratings, as well as downgrades to
the ratings of the U.S. government's sovereign credit rating, could adversely
affect financial services issuers. In addition, the departure of any Eurozone
country from use of the Euro could lead to serious disruptions to foreign
exchanges, operations and settlements, which may have an adverse effect on
financial services issuers.


The financial condition of customers, clients and counterparties, including
other financial institutions, could adversely affect financial services
issuers. Financial services issuers are interrelated as a result of
market-making, trading, clearing or other counterparty relationships. Many of
these transactions expose financial services issuers to credit risk as a result
of the actions of, or deterioration in, the commercial soundness of other
counterparty financial institutions. Economic and market conditions may
increase credit exposures due to the increased risk of customer, client or
counterparty default. Downgrades to the credit ratings of financial services
issuers could have a negative effect on liquidity, cash flows, competitive
position, financial condition and results of operations by significantly
limiting access to funding or capital markets, increasing borrowing costs or
triggering increased collateral requirements. Financial services issuers face
significant legal risk, both from regulatory investigations and proceedings, as
well as private actions. Profit margins of these companies continue to shrink
due to the commoditization of traditional businesses, new competitors, capital
expenditures on new technology and the pressure to compete globally.


Banks face competition from nontraditional lending sources as regulatory
changes have permitted new entrants to offer various financial products.
Technological advances allow these nontraditional lending sources to cut
overhead and permit the more efficient use of customer data. Banks continue to
face tremendous pressure from mutual funds, brokerage firms and other financial
service providers in the competition to furnish services that were
traditionally offered by banks. Bank profitability is largely dependent on the
availability and cost of capital funds, and can fluctuate significantly when
interest rates change or due to increased competition. Further, economic
conditions in the real estate market may have a particularly strong effect on
certain banks and savings associations.


Companies engaged in investment management and broker-dealer activities are
subject to volatility in their earnings and share prices that often exceed the
volatility of the equity market in general. Adverse changes in the direction of
the stock market, investor confidence, equity transaction volume, the level and
direction of interest rates and the outlook of emerging markets could adversely
affect the financial stability, as well as the stock prices, of these
companies.


Companies involved in the insurance, reinsurance and risk management
industry underwrite, sell or distribute property, casualty and business
insurance. Many factors affect insurance, reinsurance and risk management
company profits, including interest rate movements, the imposition of premium
rate caps, a misapprehension of the risks involved in given underwritings,
competition and pressure to compete globally, terrorism, weather catastrophes
or other disasters and the effects of client mergers. Individual companies may
be exposed to risks including reserve inadequacy and the inability to collect
from reinsurance carriers. Life and health insurance companies may be affected
by mortality and morbidity rates, including the effect of epidemics. Insurance
companies are subject to extensive governmental regulation, including the
imposition of maximum rate levels, which may not be adequate for some lines of
business. Proposed or potential tax law changes may also adversely affect
insurance companies' policy sales, tax obligations and profitability.


Health Care Issuers. The Select 5 Industrial Portfolio, Select 10 Industrial
Portfolio and Select S&P Core Portfolio invest significantly in health care
companies. These issuers include companies involved in advanced medical devices
and instruments, drugs and biotechnology, managed care, hospital
management/health services and medical supplies. These companies face
substantial government regulation and approval procedures.


On March 30, 2010, the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010
(incorporating the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, collectively the
"Act") was enacted into law. The Act continues to have a significant impact on
the health care sector through the implementation of a number of reforms in a
complex and ongoing process, with varying effective dates. Significant
provisions of the Act include the introduction of required health care coverage
for most Americans, significant expansion in the number of Americans eligible
for Medicaid, modification of taxes and tax credits in the health care sector,
and subsidized insurance for low to middle income families. The Act also
provides for more thorough regulation of private health insurance providers,
including a prohibition on the denial of coverage due to pre-existing
conditions. Although the entirety of the Act will not come into effect until
2018, in the interim, health care companies will face continuing and
significant changes that may cause a decrease in profitability due to increased
costs and changes in the health care market. The Sponsor is unable to predict
the full impact of the Act on the Securities in your Portfolio.


As illustrated by the Act, Congress may from time to time propose
legislative action that will impact the health care sector. The proposals may
span a wide range of topics, including cost and price controls (which may
include a freeze on the prices of prescription drugs), incentives for
competition in the provision of health care services, promotion of pre-paid
health care plans and additional tax incentives and penalties aimed at the
health care sector. The government could also reduce funding for health care
related research.


Drug and medical products companies also face the risk of increasing
competition from new products or services, generic drug sales, product
obsolescence, termination of patent protection for drug or medical supply
products and the risk that a product will never come to market. The research
and development costs of bringing a new drug or medical product to market are
substantial. This process involves lengthy government review with no guarantee
of approval. These companies may have losses and may not offer proposed
products for several years, if at all. The failure to gain approval for a new
drug or product can have a substantial negative effect on a company and its
stock. The goods and services of health care issuers are also subject to risks
of malpractice claims, product liability claims or other litigation.


Health care facility operators face risks related to demand for services,
the ability of the facility to provide required services, an increased emphasis
on outpatient services, confidence in the facility, management capabilities,
competitive forces that may result in price discounting, efforts by insurers
and government agencies to limit rates, expenses, the cost and possible
unavailability of malpractice insurance, and termination or restriction of
government financial assistance (such as Medicare, Medicaid or similar
programs).


Industrials Issuers. The Select 5 Industrial Portfolio and Select S&P
Industrial Portfolio invest significantly in industrials companies. General
risks of industrials companies include the general state of the economy,
intense competition, imposition of import controls, volatility in commodity
prices, currency exchange rate fluctuation, consolidation, labor relations,
domestic and international politics, excess capacity and consumer spending
trends. Companies in the industrials sector may be adversely affected by
liability for environmental damage and product liability claims. Capital goods
companies may also be significantly affected by overall capital spending and
leverage levels, economic cycles, technical obsolescence, delays in
modernization, limitations on supply of key materials, depletion of resources,
government regulations, government contracts and e-commerce initiatives.


Industrials companies may also be affected by factors more specific to their
individual industries. Industrial machinery manufacturers may be subject to
declines in commercial and consumer demand and the need for modernization.
Aerospace and defense companies may be influenced by decreased demand for new
equipment, aircraft order cancellations, disputes over or ability to obtain or
retain government contracts, changes in government budget priorities, changes
in aircraft-leasing contracts and cutbacks in profitable business travel. The
number of housing starts, levels of public and non-residential construction
including weakening demand for new office and retail space, and overall
construction spending may adversely affect construction materials and equipment
manufacturers. Stocks of transportation companies are cyclical and can be
significantly affected by economic changes, fuel prices and insurance costs.
Transportation companies in certain countries may also be subject to
significant government regulation and oversight, which may negatively impact
their businesses.


Telecommunications Issuers. The Select 5 Industrial Portfolio and Select 10
Industrial Portfolio invest significantly in telecommunications companies. This
sector is primarily characterized by extensive government regulation and
intense competition.


Companies in the telecommunications industry allocate significant resources
in efforts to comply with applicable government regulations. Telecommunications
companies operating in the U.S. must comply with applicable state and federal
regulations, including those of the Federal Communications Commission. The
costs of complying with governmental regulations, delays or failure to receive
required regulatory approvals or the enactment of new adverse regulatory
requirements may negatively affect the business of telecommunications
companies. Recent industry consolidation trends may lead to increased
regulation in primary markets. Internationally, telecommunications companies
may face regulatory challenges such as securing pre-marketing clearance of
products and prices, which may be arbitrary and unpredictable. U.S. federal and
state governments regulate permitted rates of return and the kinds of services
that a company may offer. U.S. federal legislation governing the
telecommunications industry may become subject to judicial review and
additional interpretation, which may adversely affect certain
telecommunications issuers.


The competitive landscape in the telecommunications sector is intense and
constantly evolving. The products and services of these companies may become
outdated very rapidly. A company's performance can be hurt if the company fails
to keep pace with technological advances. At the same time, demand for some
telecommunications services remains weak, as several key markets are
oversaturated and many customers can choose between several service providers
and technology platforms. To meet increasing competition, companies may have to
commit substantial capital, particularly in the formulation of new products and
services using new technologies. As a result, many companies have been
compelled to cut costs by reducing their workforce, outsourcing, consolidating
and/or closing existing facilities and divesting low selling product lines.
Certain telecommunications companies may be engaged in fierce competition for a
share of the market of their products and may have higher costs, including
liabilities associated with the medical, pension and postretirement expenses of
their workforce, than their competitors. As a result, competitive pressures are
intense and the stocks are subject to rapid price volatility. Moreover,
continued consolidation in this industry could create integration expenses and
delay, and consequent management diversion of attention away from ongoing
operations and related risks, among other factors, could result in the failure
of these companies to realize expected cost savings or synergies.


Several high-profile bankruptcies of large telecommunications companies in
the past have illustrated the potentially unstable condition of the
telecommunications industry. High debt loads that were accumulated during the
industry growth spurt of the 1990s caught up to the industry, causing debt and
stock prices to trade at distressed levels for many telecommunications
companies and increasing the cost of capital for needed additional investment.
Furthermore, certain companies involved in the industry have also faced
scrutiny for alleged accounting irregularities that may have led to the
overstatement of their financial results, and other companies in the industry
may face similar scrutiny. Moreover, some companies have begun the process of
emerging from bankruptcy and may have reduced levels of debt and other
competitive advantages over other telecommunications companies. Due to these
and other factors, the risk level of owning the securities of
telecommunications companies remains substantial and may continue to rise.


Information Technology Issuers. The Select 5 Industrial Portfolio and Select
10 Industrial Portfolio invest significantly in information technology
companies. These companies include companies that are involved in computer and
business services, enterprise software/technical software, Internet and
computer software, Internet-related services, networking and telecommunications
equipment, telecommunications services, electronics products, server hardware,
computer hardware and peripherals, semiconductor capital equipment and
semiconductors. These companies face risks related to rapidly changing
technology, rapid product obsolescence, cyclical market patterns, evolving
industry standards and frequent new product introductions. An unexpected change
in technology can have a significant negative impact on a company. The failure
of a company to introduce new products or technologies or keep pace with
rapidly changing technology, can have a negative impact on the company's
results. Information technology stocks tend to experience substantial price
volatility and speculative trading. Announcements about new products,
technologies, operating results or marketing alliances can cause stock prices
to fluctuate dramatically. At times, however, extreme price and volume
fluctuations are unrelated to the operating performance of a company. This can
impact your ability to redeem your Units at a price equal to or greater than
what you paid.


Utility Issuers. The Dow Jones Select Dividend Index Strategy Portfolio and
EAFE Select 20 Portfolio invest significantly in utility companies or in
companies related to the utility or energy industries. Many utility companies,
especially electric and gas and other energy related utility companies, are
subject to various uncertainties, including:


o    Risks of increases in fuel and other operating costs;


o    Restrictions on operations and increased costs and delays as a result
of environmental, nuclear safety and other regulations;


o    Regulatory restrictions on the ability to pass increasing wholesale
costs along to the retail and business customer;


o    Coping with the general effects of energy conservation;


o    Technological innovations which may render existing plants, equipment
or products obsolete;


o    The effects of unusual, unexpected or abnormal local weather


o    Maturing markets and difficulty in expanding to new markets due to
regulatory and other factors;


o    The potential impact of natural or manmade disasters;


o    Difficulty obtaining adequate returns on invested capital, even if
frequent rate increases are approved by public service commissions;


o    The high cost of obtaining financing during periods of inflation;


o    Difficulties of the capital markets in absorbing utility debt and
equity securities;


o    Increased competition; and


o    International politics.


Any of these factors, or a combination of these factors, could affect the
supply of or demand for energy, such as electricity or natural gas, or water,
or the ability of the issuers to pay for such energy or water which could
adversely affect the profitability of the issuers of the Securities and the
performance of the Portfolio.


Utility companies are subject to extensive regulation at the federal level
in the United States, and many are regulated at the state level as well. The
value of utility company stocks may decline because governmental regulation
affecting the utilities industry can change. This regulation may prevent or
delay the utility company from passing along cost increases to its customers,
which could hinder the utility company's ability to meet its obligations to its
suppliers and could lead to the taking of measures, including the acceleration
of obligations or the institution of involuntary bankruptcy proceedings, by its
creditors against such utility company. Furthermore, regulatory authorities,
which may be subject to political and other pressures, may not grant future
rate increases, or may impose accounting or operational policies, any of which
could adversely affect a company's profitability and its stock price.


Certain utility companies have experienced full or partial deregulation in
recent years. These utility companies are frequently more similar to industrial
companies in that they are subject to greater competition and have been
permitted by regulators to diversify outside of their original geographic
regions and their traditional lines of business. These opportunities may permit
certain utility companies to earn more than their traditional regulated rates
of return. Some companies, however, may be forced to defend their core business
and may be less profitable. While regulated providers tend to have regulated
returns, non-regulated providers' returns are not regulated and generally are
more volatile. These developments have reduced stability of cash flows in those
states with non-regulated providers and could impact the short-term earnings
potential of some in this industry. These trends have also made shares of some
utility companies less sensitive to interest rate changes but more sensitive to
changes in revenue and earnings and caused them to reduce the ratio of their
earnings they pay out as dividends.


Certain utilities companies face risks associated with the operation of
nuclear facilities for electric generation, including, among other
considerations, litigation, the problems associated with the use of radioactive
materials and the effects of natural or man-made disasters. In general, certain
utility companies may face additional regulation and litigation regarding their
power plant operations, increased costs from new or greater regulation of these
operations, and expenses related to the purchase of emissions control
equipment.


Foreign Stocks. Because the EAFE Select 20 Portfolio invests exclusively and
the Global 45 Dividend Strategy Portfolio invests significantly in foreign
stocks, these Portfolios involve additional risks that differ from an
investment in domestic stocks. These risks include the risk of losses due to
future political and economic developments, international trade conditions,
foreign withholding taxes and restrictions on foreign investments or exchange
of securities, foreign currency fluctuations or restriction on exchange or
repatriation of currencies.


The political, economic and social structures of some foreign countries may
be less stable and more volatile than those in the U.S. Investments in these
countries may be subject to the risks of internal and external conflicts,
currency devaluations, foreign ownership limitations and tax increases. It is
possible that a government may take over the assets or operations of a company
or impose restrictions on the exchange or export of currency or other assets.
Some countries also may have different legal systems that may make it difficult
for a Portfolio to vote proxies, exercise investor rights, and pursue legal
remedies with respect to its foreign investments. Diplomatic and political
developments, including rapid and adverse political changes, social
instability, regional conflicts, terrorism and war, could affect the economies,
industries, and securities and currency markets, and the value of a Portfolio's
investments, in non-U.S. countries. No one can predict the impact that these
factors could have on a Portfolio's securities.


Certain stocks may be held in the form of American Depositary Receipts
("ADRs"), Global Depositary Receipts ("GDRs"), or other similar receipts. ADRs
and GDRs represent receipts for foreign common stock deposited with a custodian
(which may include the Trustee). The ADRs in your Portfolio, if any, trade in
the U.S. in U.S. dollars and are registered with the SEC. GDRs are receipts,
issued by foreign banks or trust companies, or foreign branches of U.S. banks,
that represent an interest in shares of either a foreign or U.S. corporation.
These instruments may not necessarily be denominated in the same currency as
the securities into which they may be converted. ADRs and GDRs generally
involve the same types of risks as foreign common stock held directly. Some
ADRs and GDRs may experience less liquidity than the underlying common stocks
traded in their home market. The Portfolios may invest in sponsored or
unsponsored ADRs. Unlike a sponsored ADR where the depositary has an exclusive
relationship with the foreign issuer, an unsponsored ADR may be created by a
depositary institution independently and without the cooperation of the foreign
issuer. Consequently, information concerning the foreign issuer may be less
current or reliable for an unsponsored ADR and the price of an unsponsored ADR
may be more volatile than if it was a sponsored ADR. Depositaries of
unsponsored ADRs are not required to distribute shareholder communications
received from the foreign issuer or to pass through voting rights to its
holders. The holders of unsponsored ADRs generally bear all the costs
associated with establishing the unsponsored ADR, whereas the foreign issuers
typically bear certain costs in a sponsored ADR.


The purchase and sale of the foreign securities may occur in foreign
securities markets. Certain of the factors stated above may make it impossible
to buy or sell them in a timely manner or may adversely affect the value
received on a sale of securities. Custody of certain of the securities in a
Portfolio may be maintained by a global custody and clearing institution which
has entered into a sub-custodian relationship with the Trustee. In addition,
round lot trading requirements exist in certain foreign securities markets.
These round lot trading requirements could cause the proportional composition
and diversification of a Portfolio's securities to vary when the Portfolio
purchases additional securities or sells securities to satisfy expenses or Unit
redemptions. This could have a material impact on investment performance and
portfolio composition. Brokerage commissions and other fees generally are
higher for foreign securities. Government supervision and regulation of foreign
securities markets, currency markets, trading systems and brokers may be less
than in the U.S. The procedures and rules governing foreign transactions and
custody (holding of the Portfolios' assets) also may involve delays in payment,
delivery or recovery of money or investments.


Foreign companies may not be subject to the same disclosure, accounting,
auditing and financial reporting standards and practices as U.S. companies.
Thus, there may be less information publicly available about foreign companies
than about most U.S. companies.


Certain foreign securities may be less liquid (harder to sell) and more
volatile than many U.S. securities. This means a Portfolio may at times be
unable to sell foreign securities in a timely manner or at favorable prices.


Because securities of foreign issuers not listed on a U.S. securities
exchange generally pay dividends and trade in foreign currencies, the U.S.
dollar value of these securities and dividends will vary with fluctuations in
foreign exchange rates. Most foreign currencies have fluctuated widely in value
against the U.S. dollar for various economic and political reasons. To
determine the value of foreign securities or their dividends, the Trustee will
estimate current exchange rates for the relevant currencies based on activity
in the various currency exchange markets. However, these markets can be quite
volatile depending on the activity of the large international commercial banks,
various central banks, large multi-national corporations, speculators and other
buyers and sellers of foreign currencies. Since actual foreign currency
transactions may not be instantly reported, the exchange rates estimated by the
Trustee may not reflect the amount a Portfolio would receive in U.S. dollars,
had the Trustee sold any particular currency in the market. The value of the
Securities in terms of U.S. dollars, and therefore the value of your Units,
will decline if the U.S. dollar decreases in value relative to the value of the
currencies in which the Securities trade.


A Portfolio may be subject to negative federal income tax consequences if it
invests in PFIC stock which it is not able to dispose of, or in non-PFIC stock
which later becomes PFIC stock due to a change in the percentage of the
issuer's passive-type income or assets. As a result of holding PFIC stock, a
Portfolio could be subject to federal income tax (including interest charges)
on certain distributions or dispositions with respect to those investments
which cannot be eliminated by making distributions to shareholders. Elections
may be available to such Portfolio to mitigate the effect of this tax provided
that the PFIC complies with certain reporting requirements, but such elections
generally accelerate the recognition of income without the receipt of cash.
Holding PFIC stock could cause a Portfolio to currently recognize income it has
not yet received, which could impact the distribution requirements applicable
to any Portfolio which is a regulated investment company for tax purposes.


United Kingdom. The EAFE Select 20 Portfolio invests significantly in stocks
issued by companies located in the United Kingdom ("U.K."). As a result, this
Portfolio may be affected unfavorably by political developments, social
instability, changes in government policies and other political and economic
developments in the U.K. The U.K. is a member state of the European Union
("EU"), the establishment of which has had the effect of eliminating most
remaining trade barriers between member nations and has created one of the
largest common markets in the world. Unlike the majority of EU members, the
U.K. has not adopted the common EU currency of the euro. Adoption of the euro
has presented strategic challenges to all companies with significant markets or
operations in countries utilizing the euro. The Sponsor cannot predict when or
if the U.K. will convert to the euro, or what impact, if any, the adoption of
the euro by the U.K. would have on any of the securities issued by U.K.
companies in your Portfolio.


Legislation/Litigation. From time to time, various legislative initiatives
are proposed in the United States and abroad which may have a negative impact
on certain of the companies represented in the Portfolios, or on the tax
treatment of your Portfolio or of your investment in a Portfolio. In addition,
litigation regarding any of the issuers of the Securities, or of the industries
represented by these issuers may negatively impact the share prices of these
Securities. No one can predict what impact any pending or threatened litigation
will have on the share prices of the Securities.


No FDIC Guarantee. An investment in your Portfolio is not a deposit of any
bank and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation or any other government agency.



PUBLIC OFFERING





General. Units are offered at the Public Offering Price which consists of
the net asset value per Unit plus organization costs plus the sales charge. The
net asset value per Unit is the value of the securities, cash and other assets
in your Portfolio reduced by the liabilities of the Portfolio divided by the
total Units outstanding. The maximum sales charge equals 2.95% of the Public
Offering Price per Unit (3.04% of the aggregate offering price of the
Securities) at the time of purchase.


You pay the initial sales charge at the time you buy Units. The initial
sales charge is the difference between the total sales charge percentage
(maximum of 2.95% of the Public Offering Price per Unit) and the sum of the
remaining fixed dollar deferred sales charge and the total fixed dollar
creation and development fee. The initial sales charge will be approximately
1.00% of the Public Offering Price per Unit depending on the Public Offering
Price per Unit. The deferred sales charge is fixed at $0.145 per Unit. Your
Portfolio pays the deferred sales charge in installments as described in the
"Fee Table." If any deferred sales charge payment date is not a business day,
we will charge the payment on the next business day. If you purchase Units
after the initial deferred sales charge payment, you will only pay that portion
of the payments not yet collected. If you redeem or sell your Units prior to
collection of the total deferred sales charge, you will pay any remaining
deferred sales charge upon redemption or sale of your Units. The initial and
deferred sales charges are referred to as the "transactional sales charge." The
transactional sales charge does not include the creation and development fee
which compensates the Sponsor for creating and developing your Portfolio and is
described under "Expenses." The creation and development fee is fixed at $0.05
per Unit. Your Portfolio pays the creation and development fee as of the close
of the initial offering period as described in the "Fee Table." If you redeem
or sell your Units prior to collection of the creation and development fee, you
will not pay the creation and development fee upon redemption or sale of your
Units. Because the deferred sales charge and creation and development fee are
fixed dollar amounts per Unit, the actual charges will exceed the percentages
shown in the "Fee Table" if the Public Offering Price per Unit falls below $10
and will be less than the percentages shown in the "Fee Table" if the Public
Offering Price per Unit exceeds $10. In no event will the maximum total sales
charge exceed 2.95% of the Public Offering Price per Unit.


Since the deferred sales charge and creation and development fee are fixed
dollar amounts per Unit, your Portfolio must charge these amounts per Unit
regardless of any decrease in net asset value. However, if the Public Offering
Price per Unit falls to the extent that the maximum sales charge percentage
results in a dollar amount that is less than the combined fixed dollar amounts
of the deferred sales charge and creation and development fee, your initial
sales charge will be a credit equal to the amount by which these fixed dollar
charges exceed your sales charge at the time you buy Units. In such a
situation, the value of securities per Unit would exceed the Public Offering
Price per Unit by the amount of the initial sales charge credit and the value
of those securities will fluctuate, which could result in a benefit or
detriment to Unitholders that purchase Units at that price. The initial sales
charge credit is paid by the Sponsor and is not paid by the Portfolio. The "Fee
Table" shows the sales charge calculation at a $10 Public Offering Price per
Unit and the following examples illustrate the sales charge at prices below and
above $10. If the Public Offering Price per Unit fell to $6, the maximum sales
charge would be $0.1770 (2.95% of the Public Offering Price per Unit), which
consists of an initial sales charge of -$0.0180, a deferred sales charge of
$0.145 and a creation and development fee of $0.05. If the Public Offering
Price per Unit rose to $14, the maximum sales charge would be $0.4130 (2.95% of
the Public Offering Price per Unit), consisting of an initial sales charge of
$0.2180, a deferred sales charge of $0.145 and the creation and development fee
of $0.05.


The actual sales charge that may be paid by an investor may differ slightly
from the sales charges shown herein due to rounding that occurs in the
calculation of the Public Offering Price and in the number of Units purchased.


The minimum purchase is 100 Units (25 Units for retirement accounts) but may
vary by selling firm. Certain broker-dealers or selling firms may charge an
order handling fee for processing Unit purchases.


Reducing Your Sales Charge. The Sponsor offers a variety of ways for you to
reduce the sales charge that you pay. It is your financial professional's
responsibility to alert the Sponsor of any discount when you purchase Units.
Before you purchase Units you must also inform your financial professional of
your qualification for any discount or of any combined purchases to be eligible
for a reduced sales charge. You may not combine discounts. Since the deferred
sales charges and creation and development fee are fixed dollar amounts per
Unit, your Portfolio must charge these amounts per Unit regardless of any
discounts. However, if you are eligible to receive a discount such that your
total sales charge is less than the fixed dollar amounts of the deferred sales
charges and creation and development fee, you will receive a credit equal to
the difference between your total sales charge and these fixed dollar charges
at the time you buy Units.


Large Quantity Purchases. You can reduce your sales charge by increasing the
size of your investment. If you purchase the amount of Units shown in the table
below during the initial offering period, the sales charge will be as follows:








      Transaction
        Amount      Sales Charge
--------------------------------
Less than $50,000        2.95%
$50,000 - $99,999        2.70
$100,000 - $249,999      2.45
$250,000 - $499,999      2.10
$500,000 - $999,999      1.85
$1,000,000 or more       1.20








Except as described below, these quantity discount levels apply only to
purchases of a single Portfolio made by the same person on a single day from a
single broker-dealer. We apply these sales charges as a percent of the Public
Offering Price per Unit at the time of purchase. The breakpoints will be
adjusted to take into consideration purchase orders stated in dollars which
cannot be completely fulfilled due to the requirement that only whole Units
will be issued.


For purposes of achieving these levels you may combine purchases of Units of
a Portfolio offered in this prospectus with purchases of units of any other
Invesco-sponsored unit investment trust in the initial offering period which
are not already subject to a reduced sales charge (including other Portfolios
offered in this prospectus). In addition, Units purchased in the name of your
spouse or children under 21 living in the same household as you will be deemed
to be additional purchases by you for the purposes of calculating the
applicable quantity discount level. The reduced sales charge levels will also
be applicable to a trustee or other fiduciary purchasing Units for a single
trust, estate (including multiple trusts created under a single estate) or
fiduciary account. To be eligible for aggregation as described in this
paragraph, all purchases must be made on the same day through a single
broker-dealer or selling agent. You must inform your broker-dealer of any
combined purchases before your purchase to be eligible for a reduced sales
charge.


Fee Accounts. Investors may purchase Units through registered investment
advisers, certified financial planners and registered broker-dealers who in
each case either charge periodic fees for brokerage services, financial
planning, investment advisory or asset management services, or provide such
services in connection with the establishment of an investment account for
which a comprehensive "wrap fee" charge ("Wrap Fee") is imposed ("Fee
Accounts"). If Units of a Portfolio are purchased for a Fee Account and the
Portfolio is subject to a Wrap Fee (i.e., the Portfolio is "Wrap Fee
Eligible"), then the purchase will not be subject to the transactional sales
charge but will be subject to the creation and development fee that is retained
by the Sponsor. Please refer to the section called "Fee Accounts" for
additional information on these purchases. The Sponsor reserves the right to
limit or deny purchases of Units described in this paragraph by investors or
selling firms whose frequent trading activity is determined to be detrimental
to a Portfolio.


Rollovers and Exchanges. During the initial offering period of the
Portfolios offered in this prospectus, unitholders of any Invesco-sponsored
unit investment trusts and unitholders of unaffiliated unit investment trusts
may utilize their redemption or termination proceeds from such a trust to
purchase Units of the Portfolios offered in this prospectus at the Public
Offering Price per Unit less 1.00%. In order to be eligible for the sales
charge discounts applicable to Unit purchases made with redemption or
termination proceeds from other unit investment trusts, the termination or
redemption proceeds used to purchase Units of the Portfolio must be derived
from a transaction that occurred within 30 days of your Unit purchase. In
addition, the discounts will only be available for investors that utilize the
same broker-dealer (or a different broker-dealer with appropriate notification)
for both the Unit purchase and the transaction resulting in the receipt of the
termination or redemption proceeds used for the Unit purchase. You may be
required to provide appropriate documentation or other information to your
broker-dealer to evidence your eligibility for these reduced sales charge
discounts. An exchange does not avoid a taxable event on the redemption or
termination of an interest in a trust.


Employees. Employees, officers and directors (including their spouses and
children under 21 living in the same household, and trustees, custodians or
fiduciaries for the benefit of such persons) of Invesco Capital Markets, Inc.
and its affiliates, and dealers and their affiliates may purchase Units at the
Public Offering Price less the applicable dealer concession. All employee
discounts are subject to the policies of the related selling firm. Only
employees, officers and directors of companies that allow their employees to
participate in this employee discount program are eligible for the discounts.


Distribution Reinvestments. We do not charge any sales charge when you
reinvest distributions from your Portfolio into additional Units of your
Portfolio. Since the deferred sales charges and creation and development fee
are fixed dollar amounts per unit, your Portfolio must charge these amounts per
unit regardless of this discount. If you elect to reinvest distributions, the
Sponsor will credit you with additional Units with a dollar value sufficient to
cover the amount of any remaining deferred sales charge and creation and
development fee that will be collected on such Units at the time of
reinvestment. The dollar value of these Units will fluctuate over time.


Unit Price. The Public Offering Price of Units will vary from the amounts
stated under "Essential Information" in accordance with fluctuations in the
prices of the underlying Securities in the Portfolios. The initial price of the
Securities upon deposit by the Sponsor was determined by the Trustee. The
Trustee will generally determine the value of the Securities as of the
Evaluation Time on each business day and will adjust the Public Offering Price
of Units accordingly. The Evaluation Time is the close of the New York Stock
Exchange on each business day. The term "business day", as used herein and
under "Rights of Unitholders--Redemption of Units", means any day on which the
New York Stock Exchange is open for regular trading. The Public Offering Price
per Unit will be effective for all orders received prior to the Evaluation Time
on each business day. Orders received by the Sponsor prior to the Evaluation
Time and orders received by authorized financial professionals prior to the
Evaluation Time that are properly transmitted to the Sponsor by the time
designated by the Sponsor, are priced based on the date of receipt. Orders
received by the Sponsor after the Evaluation Time, and orders received by
authorized financial professionals after the Evaluation Time or orders received
by such persons that are not transmitted to the Sponsor until after the time
designated by the Sponsor, are priced based on the date of the next determined
Public Offering Price per Unit provided they are received timely by the Sponsor
on such date. It is the responsibility of authorized financial professionals to
transmit orders received by them to the Sponsor so they will be received in a
timely manner.


The value of portfolio securities is based on the securities' market price
when available. When a market price is not readily available, including
circumstances under which the Trustee determines that a security's market price
is not accurate, a portfolio security is valued at its fair value, as
determined under procedures established by the Trustee or an independent
pricing service used by the Trustee. In these cases, a Portfolio's net asset
value will reflect certain portfolio securities' fair value rather than their
market price. With respect to securities that are primarily listed on foreign
exchanges, the value of the portfolio securities may change on days when you
will not be able to purchase or sell Units. The value of any foreign securities
is based on the applicable currency exchange rate as of the Evaluation Time.
The Sponsor will provide price dissemination and oversight services to the
Portfolios.


During the initial offering period, part of the Public Offering Price
represents an amount that will pay the costs incurred in establishing your
Portfolio. These costs include the costs of preparing documents relating to
your Portfolio (such as the registration statement, prospectus, trust agreement
and legal documents), federal and state registration fees, fees paid to any
Portfolio Consultant for assisting the Sponsor in the selection of securities,
the initial fees and expenses of the Trustee and the initial audit. Your
Portfolio will sell securities to reimburse us for these costs at the end of
the initial offering period or after six months, if earlier. The value of your
Units will decline when your Portfolio pays these costs.


Unit Distribution. Units will be distributed to the public by the Sponsor,
broker-dealers and others at the Public Offering Price. Units repurchased in
the secondary market, if any, may be offered by this prospectus at the
secondary market Public Offering Price in the manner described above.


The Sponsor intends to qualify Units for sale in a number of states.
Brokers, dealers and others will be allowed a regular concession or agency
commission in connection with the distribution of Units during the initial
offering period as described in the following table:








                    Concession
      Transaction    or Agency
        Amount*     Commission
------------------------------
Less than $50,000       2.25%
$50,000 - $99,999       2.00
$100,000 - $249,999     1.75
$250,000 - $499,999     1.45
$500,000 - $999,999     1.20
$1,000,000 or more      0.65

--------------------








*    The breakpoints will be adjusted to take into consideration purchase
orders stated in dollars which cannot be completely fulfilled due to the
requirement that only whole Units will be issued.


For transactions involving unitholders of other unit investment trusts who
use their redemption or termination proceeds to purchase Units of the
Portfolios, the regular concession or agency commission will amount to 1.20%
per Unit.


In addition to the regular concession or agency commission set forth in the
table above, all broker-dealers and other selling firms will be eligible to
receive additional compensation based on total initial offering period sales of
all eligible Invesco unit investment trusts during a Quarterly Period as set
forth in the following table:








Initial Offering Period                 Volume
Sales During Quarterly Period         Concession
------------------------------------------------
$2 million but less than $5 million      0.025%
$5 million but less than $10 million     0.050
$10 million but less than $50 million    0.075
$50 million or more                      0.100








"Quarterly Period" means the following periods: January -- March; April --
June; July -- September; and October -- December. Broker-dealers and other
selling firms will not receive these additional volume concessions on the sale
of units which are not subject to the transactional sales charge, however, such
sales will be included in determining whether a firm has met the sales level
breakpoints set forth in the table above. Secondary market sales of all unit
investment trusts are excluded for purposes of these volume concessions.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Wells Fargo Advisors will receive the maximum
volume concession set forth in the table above for all eligible unit sales. The
Sponsor will pay these amounts out of the transactional sales charge received
on units within a reasonable time following each Quarterly Period. For a trust
to be eligible for this additional compensation for Quarterly Period sales, the
trust's prospectus must include disclosure related to this additional
compensation; a trust is not eligible for this additional compensation if the
prospectus for such trust does not include disclosure related to this
additional compensation.


In addition to the regular concession and additional volume concessions set
forth in the tables above, Preferred Distributors will receive a reallowance of
0.10% of the Public Offering Price per Unit of all Units of a Portfolio sold
during a Quarterly Period. This additional compensation will be paid to
Preferred Distributors as an additional broker-dealer concession at the time
Units are purchased unless the Preferred Distributor notifies the Sponsor that
it elects to receive a separate payment following each applicable Quarterly
Period. The "Preferred Distributors" include (1) the following firms and their
affiliates: Edward D. Jones & Co., L.P., Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith
Incorporated, Morgan Stanley Smith Barney LLC, UBS Financial Services Inc. and
Wells Fargo Advisors and (2) any selling firm that has achieved aggregate sales
of Invesco unit investment trusts of either $30 million in the three-month
period preceding the related Quarterly Period or $100 million in the
twelve-month period preceding the related Quarterly Period. Preferred
Distributors will not receive this additional compensation on the sale of Units
which are not subject to the transactional sales charge, however, such sales
will be included in determining whether a firm has met the sales levels
described in the preceding sentence for purposes of qualifying as a Preferred
Distributor. Secondary market sales of Units are excluded for purposes of this
Preferred Distributor compensation.


Except as provided in this section, any sales charge discount provided to
investors will be borne by the selling broker-dealer or agent. For all
secondary market transactions the total concession or agency commission will
amount to 80% of the sales charge. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
herein, in no case shall the total of any concessions, agency commissions and
any additional compensation allowed or paid to any broker, dealer or other
distributor of Units with respect to any individual transaction exceed the
total sales charge applicable to such transaction. The Sponsor reserves the
right to reject, in whole or in part, any order for the purchase of Units and
to change the amount of the concession or agency commission to dealers and
others from time to time.


We may provide, at our own expense and out of our own profits, additional
compensation and benefits to broker-dealers who sell Units of the Portfolios
and our other products. This compensation is intended to result in additional
sales of our products and/or compensate broker-dealers and financial advisors
for past sales. We may make these payments for marketing, promotional or
related expenses, including, but not limited to, expenses of entertaining
retail customers and financial advisors, advertising, sponsorship of events or
seminars, obtaining shelf space in broker-dealer firms and similar activities
designed to promote the sale of the Portfolio(s) and our other products. Fees
may include payment for travel expenses, including lodging, incurred in
connection with trips taken by invited registered representatives for meetings
or seminars of a business nature. These arrangements will not change the price
you pay for your Units.


Sponsor Compensation. The Sponsor will receive the total sales charge
applicable to each transaction. Except as provided under "Unit Distribution"
above, any sales charge discount provided to investors will be borne by the
selling broker-dealer or agent. In addition, the Sponsor will realize a profit
or loss as a result of the difference between the price paid for the Securities
by the Sponsor and the cost of the Securities to each Portfolio on the Initial
Date of Deposit as well as on subsequent deposits. See "Notes to Portfolios".
The Sponsor has not participated as sole underwriter or as manager or as a
member of the underwriting syndicates or as an agent in a private placement for
any of the Securities. The Sponsor may realize profit or loss as a result of
the possible fluctuations in the market value of Units held by the Sponsor for
sale to the public. In maintaining a secondary market, the Sponsor will realize
profits or losses in the amount of any difference between the price at which
Units are purchased and the price at which Units are resold (which price
includes the applicable sales charge) or from a redemption of repurchased Units
at a price above or below the purchase price. Cash, if any, made available to
the Sponsor prior to the date of settlement for the purchase of Units may be
used in the Sponsor's business and may be deemed to be a benefit to the
Sponsor, subject to the limitations of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.


The Sponsor or an affiliate may have participated in a public offering of
one or more of the Securities. The Sponsor, an affiliate or their employees may
have a long or short position in these Securities or related securities. An
affiliate may act as a specialist or market maker for these Securities. An
officer, director or employee of the Sponsor or an affiliate may be an officer
or director for issuers of the Securities.


Market for Units. Although it is not obligated to do so, the Sponsor may
maintain a market for Units and to purchase Units at the secondary market
repurchase price (which is described under "Right of Unitholders--Redemption of
Units"). The Sponsor may discontinue purchases of Units or discontinue
purchases at this price at any time. In the event that a secondary market is
not maintained, a Unitholder will be able to dispose of Units by tendering them
to the Trustee for redemption at the Redemption Price. See "Rights of
Unitholders--Redemption of Units". Unitholders should contact their broker to
determine the best price for Units in the secondary market. Units sold prior to
the time the entire deferred sales charge has been collected will be assessed
the amount of any remaining deferred sales charge at the time of sale. The
Trustee will notify the Sponsor of any Units tendered for redemption. If the
Sponsor's bid in the secondary market equals or exceeds the Redemption Price
per Unit, it may purchase the Units not later than the day on which Units would
have been redeemed by the Trustee. The Sponsor may sell repurchased Units at
the secondary market Public Offering Price per Unit.



RETIREMENT ACCOUNTS





Units are available for purchase in connection with certain types of
tax-sheltered retirement plans, including Individual Retirement Accounts for
individuals, Simplified Employee Pension Plans for employees, qualified plans
for self-employed individuals, and qualified corporate pension and profit
sharing plans for employees. The minimum purchase for these accounts is reduced
to 25 Units but may vary by selling firm. The purchase of Units may be limited
by the plans' provisions and does not itself establish such plans.





FEE ACCOUNTS





As described above, Units may be available for purchase by investors in Fee
Accounts where a Portfolio is Wrap Fee Eligible. You should consult your
financial professional to determine whether you can benefit from these
accounts. This table illustrates the sales charge you will pay if a Portfolio
is Wrap Fee Eligible as a percentage of the initial Public Offering Price per
Unit on the Initial Date of Deposit (the percentage will vary thereafter).






Initial sales charge             0.00%
Deferred sales charge            0.00
                                 -----
      Transactional sales charge 0.00%
                                 -----
Creation and development fee     0.50%
                                 -----
      Total sales charge         0.50%
                                 -----








You should consult the "Public Offering--Reducing Your Sales Charge" section
for specific information on this and other sales charge discounts. That section
governs the calculation of all sales charge discounts. The Sponsor reserves the
right to limit or deny purchases of Units in Fee Accounts by investors or
selling firms whose frequent trading activity is determined to be detrimental
to a Portfolio. To purchase Units in these Fee Accounts, your financial
professional must purchase Units designated with one of the Wrap Fee CUSIP
numbers set forth under "Essential Information," either Wrap Fee Cash for cash
distributions or Wrap Fee Reinvest for the reinvestment of distributions in
additional Units, if available. See "Rights of Unitholders--Reinvestment
Option."



RIGHTS OF UNITHOLDERS





Distributions. With respect to the Global 45 Dividend Strategy Portfolio,
dividends and interest, and any net proceeds from the sale of Securities
received by your Portfolio will generally be distributed to Unitholders on each
Distribution Date to Unitholders of record on the preceding Record Date. With
respect to all other Portfolios, the Trustee will generally distribute the cash
held in the Income and Capital Accounts of your Portfolio, net of expenses, on
each Distribution Date to Unitholders of record on the preceding Record Date,
provided that the total cash held for distribution equals at least 0.1% of your
Portfolio's net asset value. These dates appear under "Essential Information".
In addition, the Global 45 Dividend Strategy Portfolio will generally make
required distributions at the end of each year because each is structured as a
"regulated investment company" for federal tax purposes. Unitholders will also
receive a final distribution of dividends when their Portfolio terminates. A
person becomes a Unitholder of record on the date of settlement (generally
three business days after Units are ordered). Unitholders may elect to receive
distributions in cash or to have distributions reinvested into additional
Units. See "Rights of Unitholders--Reinvestment Option".


Dividends and interest received by a Portfolio are credited to the Income
Account of the Portfolio. Other receipts (e.g., capital gains, proceeds from
the sale of Securities, etc.) are credited to the Capital Account. Proceeds
received on the sale of any Securities, to the extent not used to meet
redemptions of Units or pay deferred sales charges, fees or expenses, will be
distributed to Unitholders. Proceeds received from the disposition of any
Securities after a Record Date and prior to the following Distribution Date
will be held in the Capital Account and not distributed until the next
Distribution Date. Any distribution to Unitholders consists of each
Unitholder's pro rata share of the available cash in the Income and Capital
Accounts as of the related Record Date.


Estimated Distributions. The estimated initial distribution and estimated
net annual income per Unit may be shown under "Essential Information."
Generally, the estimate of the income a Portfolio may receive is based on the
most recent ordinary quarterly dividends declared by an issuer, the most recent
interim and final dividends declared for certain foreign issuers, or scheduled
income payments (in all cases accounting for any applicable foreign withholding
taxes). In certain cases, estimated net annual income may also be based upon
several recently declared dividends of an issuer. However, common stocks do not
assure dividend payments and therefore the amount of future dividend income to
your Portfolio is uncertain. The actual net annual distributions may decrease
over time because a portion of the Securities included in a Portfolio will be
sold to pay for the organization costs, deferred sales charge and creation and
development fee. Securities may also be sold to pay regular fees and expenses
during a Portfolio's life. Dividend and income conventions for certain
companies and/or certain countries differ from those typically used in the
United States and in certain instances, dividends/income paid or declared over
several years or other periods may be used to estimate annual distributions.
The actual net annual income distributions you receive will vary from the
estimated amount due to changes in a Portfolio's fees and expenses, in actual
income received by a Portfolio, currency fluctuations and with changes in a
Portfolio such as the acquisition, call, maturity or sale of Securities. Due to
these and various other factors, actual income received by a Portfolio will
most likely differ from the most recent dividends or scheduled income
payments.


Reinvestment Option. Unitholders may have distributions automatically
reinvested in additional Units without a sales charge (to the extent Units may
be lawfully offered for sale in the state in which the Unitholder resides). The
CUSIP numbers for either "Cash" distributions or "Reinvest" for the
reinvestment of distributions are set forth under "Essential Information".
Brokers and dealers can use the Dividend Reinvestment Service through
Depository Trust Company ("DTC") or purchase a Reinvest (or Wrap Fee Reinvest
in the case of Wrap Fee Eligible Units held in Fee Accounts) CUSIP, if
available. To participate in this reinvestment option, a Unitholder must file
with the Trustee a written notice of election, together with any other
documentation that the Trustee may then require, at least five days prior to
the related Record Date. A Unitholder's election will apply to all Units owned
by the Unitholder and will remain in effect until changed by the Unitholder.
The reinvestment option is not offered during the 30 days prior to termination.
If Units are unavailable for reinvestment or this reinvestment option is no
longer available, distributions will be paid in cash. Distributions will be
taxable to Unitholders if paid in cash or automatically reinvested in
additional Units. See "Taxation".


A participant may elect to terminate his or her reinvestment plan and
receive future distributions in cash by notifying the Trustee in writing no
later than five days before a Distribution Date. The Sponsor shall have the
right to suspend or terminate the reinvestment plan at any time. The
reinvestment plan is subject to availability or limitation by each
broker-dealer or selling firm. Broker-dealers may suspend or terminate the
offering of a reinvestment plan at any time. Please contact your financial
professional for additional information.


Redemption of Units. All or a portion of your Units may be tendered to The
Bank of New York Mellon, the Trustee, for redemption at Unit Investment Trust
Division, 111 Sanders Creek Parkway, East Syracuse, New York 13057, on any day
the New York Stock Exchange is open. No redemption fee will be charged by the
Sponsor or the Trustee, but you are responsible for applicable governmental
charges, if any. Units redeemed by the Trustee will be canceled. You may redeem
all or a portion of your Units by sending a request for redemption to your bank
or broker-dealer through which you hold your Units. No later than three
business days following satisfactory tender, the Unitholder will be entitled to
receive in cash an amount for each Unit equal to the Redemption Price per Unit
next computed on the date of tender. The "date of tender" is deemed to be the
date on which Units are received by the Trustee, except that with respect to
Units received by the Trustee after the Evaluation Time or on a day which is
not a business day, the date of tender is deemed to be the next business day.
Redemption requests received by the Trustee after the Evaluation Time, and
redemption requests received by authorized financial professionals after the
Evaluation Time or redemption requests received by such persons that are not
transmitted to the Trustee until after the time designated by the Trustee, are
priced based on the date of the next determined redemption price provided they
are received timely by the Trustee on such date. It is the responsibility of
authorized financial professionals to transmit redemption requests received by
them to the Trustee so they will be received in a timely manner. Certain
broker-dealers or selling firms may charge an order handling fee for processing
redemption requests. Units redeemed directly through the Trustee are not
subject to such fees.


Unitholders tendering 1,000 or more Units of The Dow Jones Select Dividend
Index Strategy Portfolio, Select 5 Industrial Portfolio, Select S&P Industrial
Portfolio or Select S&P Core Portfolio (or such higher amount as may be
required by your broker-dealer or selling agent) for redemption may request an
in kind distribution of Securities equal to the Redemption Price per Unit on
the date of tender. The EAFE Select 20 Portfolio and Global 45 Dividend
Strategy Portfolio generally will not offer in kind distributions. Unitholders
may not request an in kind distribution during the initial offering period or
within thirty days of a Portfolio's termination. The Portfolios generally will
not offer in kind distributions of portfolio securities that are held in
foreign markets. An in kind distribution will be made by the Trustee through
the distribution of each of the Securities in book-entry form to the account of
the Unitholder's broker-dealer at DTC. Amounts representing fractional shares
will be distributed in cash. The Trustee may adjust the number of shares of any
Security included in a Unitholder's in kind distribution to facilitate the
distribution of whole shares. The in kind distribution option may be modified
or discontinued at any time without notice. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if
the Unitholder requesting an in kind distribution is the Sponsor or an
affiliated person of the Portfolio, the Trustee may make an in kind
distribution to such Unitholder provided that no one with a pecuniary incentive
to influence the in kind distribution may influence selection of the
distributed securities, the distribution must consist of a pro rata
distribution of all portfolio securities (with limited exceptions) and the in
kind distribution may not favor such affiliated person to the detriment of any
other Unitholder.


The Trustee may sell Securities to satisfy Unit redemptions. To the extent
that Securities are redeemed in kind or sold, the size of a Portfolio will be,
and the diversity of a Portfolio may be, reduced. Sales may be required at a
time when Securities would not otherwise be sold and may result in lower prices
than might otherwise be realized. The price received upon redemption may be
more or less than the amount paid by the Unitholder depending on the value of
the Securities at the time of redemption. Special federal income tax
consequences will result if a Unitholder requests an in kind distribution. See
"Taxation".


The Redemption Price per Unit and the secondary market repurchase price per
Unit are equal to the pro rata share of each Unit in each Portfolio determined
on the basis of (i) the cash on hand in the Portfolio, (ii) the value of the
Securities in the Portfolio and (iii) dividends or other income distributions
receivable on the Securities in the Portfolio trading ex-dividend as of the
date of computation, less (a) amounts representing taxes or other governmental
charges payable out of the Portfolio, (b) the accrued expenses of the Portfolio
(including costs associated with liquidating securities after the end of the
initial offering period) and (c) any unpaid deferred sales charge payments.
During the initial offering period, the redemption price and the secondary
market repurchase price are not reduced by the estimated organization costs or
the creation and development fee. For these purposes, the Trustee will
determine the value of the Securities as described under "Public Offering--Unit
Price".


The right of redemption may be suspended and payment postponed for any
period during which the New York Stock Exchange is closed, other than for
customary weekend and holiday closings, or any period during which the SEC
determines that trading on that Exchange is restricted or an emergency exists,
as a result of which disposal or evaluation of the Securities is not reasonably
practicable, or for other periods as the SEC may permit.


Exchange Option. When you redeem Units of your Portfolio or when your
Portfolio terminates, you may be able to exchange your Units for units of other
Invesco unit trusts at a reduced sales charge. You should contact your
financial professional for more information about trusts currently available
for exchanges. Before you exchange Units, you should read the prospectus of the
new trust carefully and understand the risks and fees. You should then discuss
this option with your financial professional to determine whether your
investment goals have changed, whether current trusts suit you and to discuss
tax consequences. An exchange is a taxable event to you. We may discontinue
this option at any time.


Rollover. We may offer a subsequent series of each Portfolio for a Rollover
when the Portfolios terminate.


On the Mandatory Termination Date you will have the option to (1)
participate in a Rollover and have your Units reinvested into a subsequent
trust series or (2) receive a cash distribution.


If you elect to participate in a cash Rollover, your Units will be redeemed
on the Mandatory Termination Date. As the redemption proceeds become available,
the proceeds (including dividends) will be invested in a new trust series at
the public offering price for the new trust. The Trustee will attempt to sell
Securities to satisfy the redemption as quickly as practicable on the Mandatory
Termination Date. We do not anticipate that the sale period will be longer than
one day, however, certain factors could affect the ability to sell the
Securities and could impact the length of the sale period. The liquidity of any
Security depends on the daily trading volume of the Security and the amount
available for redemption and reinvestment on any day.


We may make subsequent trust series available for sale at various times
during the year. Of course, we cannot guarantee that a subsequent trust or
sufficient units will be available or that any subsequent trusts will offer the
same investment strategies or objectives as the current Portfolios. We cannot
guarantee that a Rollover will avoid any negative market price consequences
resulting from trading large volumes of securities. Market price trends may
make it advantageous to sell or buy securities more quickly or more slowly than
permitted by the Portfolio procedures. We may, in our sole discretion, modify a
Rollover or stop creating units of a trust at any time regardless of whether
all proceeds of Unitholders have been reinvested in a Rollover. If we decide
not to offer a subsequent series, Unitholders will be notified prior to the
Mandatory Termination Date. Cash which has not been reinvested in a Rollover
will be distributed to Unitholders shortly after the Mandatory Termination
Date. Rollover participants may receive taxable dividends or realize taxable
capital gains which are reinvested in connection with a Rollover but may not be
entitled to a deduction for capital losses due to the "wash sale" tax rules.
Due to the reinvestment in a subsequent trust, no cash will be distributed to
pay any taxes. See "Taxation".


Units. Ownership of Units is evidenced in book-entry form only and will not
be evidenced by certificates. Units purchased or held through your bank or
broker-dealer will be recorded in book-entry form and credited to the account
of your bank or broker-dealer at DTC. Units are transferable by contacting your
bank or broker-dealer through which you hold your Units. Transfer, and the
requirements therefore, will be governed by the applicable procedures of DTC
and your agreement with the DTC participant in whose name your Units are
registered on the transfer records of DTC.


Reports Provided. Unitholders will receive a statement of dividends and
other amounts received by a Portfolio for each distribution. Within a
reasonable time after the end of each year, each person who was a Unitholder
during that year will receive a statement describing dividends and capital
received, actual Portfolio distributions, Portfolio expenses, a list of the
Securities and other Portfolio information. Unitholders may obtain evaluations
of the Securities upon request to the Trustee. If you have questions regarding
your account or your Portfolio, please contact your financial advisor or the
Trustee. The Sponsor does not have access to individual account information.



PORTFOLIO ADMINISTRATION





Portfolio Administration. The Portfolios are not managed funds and, except
as provided in the Trust Agreement, Securities generally will not be sold or
replaced. The Sponsor may, however, direct that Securities be sold in certain
limited circumstances to protect a Portfolio based on advice from the
Supervisor. These situations may include events such as the issuer having
defaulted on payment of any of its outstanding obligations or the price of a
Security has declined to such an extent or other credit factors exist so that
in the opinion of the Supervisor retention of the Security would be detrimental
to a Portfolio. If a public tender offer has been made for a Security or a
merger or acquisition has been announced affecting a Security, the Trustee may
either sell the Security or accept an offer if the Supervisor determines that
the sale or exchange is in the best interest of Unitholders (only offers for
cash if a Portfolio has not elected to be treated as a regulated investment
company for tax purposes). The Trustee will distribute any cash proceeds to
Unitholders. In addition, the Trustee may sell Securities to redeem Units or
pay Portfolio expenses or deferred sales charges. With respect to a Portfolio
structured as a grantor trust for federal tax purposes, the Trustee must reject
any offer for securities or property other than cash in exchange for the
Securities. If securities or property are nonetheless acquired by a Portfolio,
the Sponsor may direct the Trustee to sell the securities or property and
distribute the proceeds to Unitholders or to accept the securities or property
for deposit in the Portfolio. Should any contract for the purchase of any of
the Securities fail, the Sponsor will (unless substantially all of the moneys
held in the Portfolio to cover the purchase are reinvested in substitute
Securities in accordance with the Trust Agreement) refund the cash and sales
charge attributable to the failed contract to all Unitholders on or before the
next Distribution Date.


With respect to the Global 45 Dividend Strategy Portfolio, the Sponsor may
direct the reinvestment of proceeds of the sale of Securities if the sale is
the direct result of serious adverse credit factors which, in the opinion of
the Sponsor, would make retention of the Securities detrimental to your
Portfolio. In such a case, the Sponsor may, but is not obligated to, direct the
reinvestment of sale proceeds in any other securities that meet the criteria
for inclusion in your Portfolio on the Initial Date of Deposit. The Sponsor may
also instruct the Trustee to take action necessary to ensure that the Global 45
Dividend Strategy Portfolio continues to satisfy the qualifications of a
regulated investment company and to avoid imposition of tax on undistributed
income of the Portfolios.


When your Portfolio sells Securities, the composition and diversity of the
Securities in the Portfolio may be altered. In order to obtain the best price
for a Portfolio, it may be necessary for the Supervisor to specify minimum
amounts (generally 100 shares) in which blocks of Securities are to be sold. In
effecting purchases and sales of Portfolio securities, the Sponsor may direct
that orders be placed with and brokerage commissions be paid to brokers,
including brokers which may be affiliated with the Portfolios, the Sponsor or
dealers participating in the offering of Units.


Pursuant to an exemptive order, your Portfolio may be permitted to sell
Securities to a new trust when it terminates if those Securities are included
in the new trust. The exemption may enable your Portfolio to eliminate
commission costs on these transactions. The price for those securities will be
the closing sale price on the sale date on the exchange where the Securities
are principally traded, as certified by the Sponsor.


Amendment of the Trust Agreement. The Trustee and the Sponsor may amend the
Trust Agreement without the consent of Unitholders to correct any provision
which may be defective or to make other provisions that will not materially
adversely affect Unitholders (as determined in good faith by the Sponsor and
the Trustee). The Trust Agreement may not be amended to increase the number of
Units or permit acquisition of securities in addition to or substitution for
the Securities (except as provided in the Trust Agreement). The Trustee will
notify Unitholders of any amendment.


Termination. Each Portfolio will terminate on the Mandatory Termination Date
specified under "Essential Information" or upon the sale or other disposition
of the last Security held in the Portfolio. A Portfolio may be terminated at
any time with consent of Unitholders representing two-thirds of the outstanding
Units or by the Trustee when the value of the Portfolio is less than $500,000
($3,000,000 if the value of the Portfolio has exceeded $15,000,000) (the
"Minimum Termination Value"). A Portfolio will be liquidated by the Trustee in
the event that a sufficient number of Units of the Portfolio not yet sold are
tendered for redemption by the Sponsor, so that the net worth of the Portfolio
would be reduced to less than 40% of the value of the Securities at the time
they were deposited in the Portfolio. If a Portfolio is liquidated because of
the redemption of unsold Units by the Sponsor, the Sponsor will refund to each
purchaser of Units the entire sales charge paid by such purchaser. The Trustee
may begin to sell Securities in connection with a Portfolio termination nine
business days before, and no later than, the Mandatory Termination Date.
Qualified Unitholders may elect an in kind distribution of Securities, provided
that Unitholders may not request an in kind distribution of Securities within
thirty days of a Portfolio's termination. Any in kind distribution of
Securities will be made in the manner and subject to the restrictions described
under "Rights of Unitholders--Redemption of Units", provided that, in
connection with an in kind distribution election more than 30 days prior to
termination, Unitholders tendering 1,000 or more Units of a Portfolio (or such
higher amount as may be required by your broker-dealer or selling agent) may
request an in kind distribution of Securities equal to the Redemption Price per
Unit on the date of tender. Unitholders will receive a final cash distribution
within a reasonable time after the Mandatory Termination Date. All
distributions will be net of a Portfolio's expenses and costs. Unitholders will
receive a final distribution statement following termination. The Information
Supplement contains further information regarding termination of a Portfolio.
See "Additional Information".


Limitations on Liabilities. The Sponsor, Supervisor and Trustee are under no
liability for taking any action or for refraining from taking any action in
good faith pursuant to the Trust Agreement, or for errors in judgment, but
shall be liable only for their own willful misfeasance, bad faith or gross
negligence (negligence in the case of the Trustee) in the performance of their
duties or by reason of their reckless disregard of their obligations and duties
hereunder. The Trustee is not liable for depreciation or loss incurred by
reason of the sale by the Trustee of any of the Securities. In the event of the
failure of the Sponsor to act under the Trust Agreement, the Trustee may act
thereunder and is not liable for any action taken by it in good faith under the
Trust Agreement. The Trustee is not liable for any taxes or other governmental
charges imposed on the Securities, on it as Trustee under the Trust Agreement
or on a Portfolio which the Trustee may be required to pay under any present or
future law of the United States of America or of any other taxing authority
having jurisdiction. In addition, the Trust Agreement contains other customary
provisions limiting the liability of the Trustee. The Sponsor and Supervisor
may rely on any evaluation furnished by the Trustee and have no responsibility
for the accuracy thereof. Determinations by the Trustee shall be made in good
faith upon the basis of the best information available to it.

TAXATION -- GLOBAL 45 DIVIDEND STRATEGY PORTFOLIO





This section summarizes some of the principal U.S. federal income tax
consequences of owning Units of the Portfolios as of the date of this
prospectus. Tax laws and interpretations change frequently, possibly with
retroactive effect, and these summaries do not describe all of the tax
consequences to all taxpayers. For example, these summaries generally do not
describe your situation if you are a corporation, a non-U.S. person, a
broker/dealer, a tax-exempt entity or other investor with special
circumstances. In addition, this section does not describe your state, local or
foreign tax consequences.


This federal income tax summary is based in part on the advice of counsel to
the Sponsor. The Internal Revenue Service could disagree with any conclusions
set forth in this section. In addition, our counsel was not asked to review the
federal income tax treatment of the assets to be deposited in your Portfolio.


Additional information related to taxes is contained in the Information
Supplement. As with any investment, you should seek advice based on your
individual circumstances from your own tax advisor.


Portfolio Status. Your Portfolio intends to elect and to qualify annually as
a "regulated investment company" under the federal tax laws. If your Portfolio
qualifies as a regulated investment company and distributes its income as
required by the tax law, the Portfolio generally will not pay federal income
taxes.


Distributions. Portfolio distributions are generally taxable. After the end
of each year, you will receive a tax statement reporting your Portfolio's
distributions, including the amounts of ordinary income distributions and
capital gains dividends. Ordinary income distributions are generally taxed at
your tax rate for ordinary income, however, as further discussed below, certain
ordinary income distributions received from your Portfolio may be taxed, under
current law, at the capital gains tax rates for taxable years beginning before
January 1, 2013. Certain ordinary income dividends on Units that are
attributable to qualifying dividends received by your Portfolio from certain
corporations may be reported by the Portfolio as being eligible for the
dividends received deduction for corporate Unitholders provided certain holding
period requirements are met. Under the "Health Care and Education
Reconciliation Act of 2010," income from the Portfolio may also be subject to a
new 3.8% "Medicare tax" imposed for taxable years beginning after 2012. This
tax will generally apply to your net investment income if your adjusted gross
income exceeds certain threshold amounts, which are $250,000 in the case of
married couples filing joint returns and $200,000 in the case of single
individuals. In addition, your Portfolio may make distributions that represent
a return of capital for tax purposes to the extent of the Unitholder's basis in
the Units, and any additional amounts in excess of basis would be taxed as a
capital gain. Generally, you will treat all capital gains dividends as
long-term capital gains regardless of how long you have owned your Units. The
tax status of your distributions from your Portfolio is not affected by whether
you reinvest your distributions in additional Units or receive them in cash.
The income from your Portfolio that you must take into account for federal
income tax purposes is not reduced by amounts used to pay a deferred sales
charge, if any. The tax laws may require you to treat distributions made to you
in January as if you had received them on December 31 of the previous year.


A distribution paid by your Portfolio reduces the Portfolio's net asset
value per Unit on the date paid by the amount of the distribution. Accordingly,
a distribution paid shortly after a purchase of Units by a Unitholder would
represent, in substance, a partial return of capital, even though it would be
subject to income taxes.


Sale or Redemption of Units. If you sell or redeem your Units, you will
generally recognize a taxable gain or loss. To determine the amount of this
gain or loss, you must subtract your adjusted tax basis in your Units from the
amount you receive in the transaction. Your initial tax basis in your Units is
generally equal to the cost of your Units, generally including sales charges.
In some cases, however, you may have to adjust your tax basis after you
purchase your Units.


Capital Gains and Losses and Certain Ordinary Income Dividends. If you are
an individual, the maximum marginal federal tax rate for net capital gain under
current law is generally 15% (zero for certain taxpayers in the 10% and 15% tax
brackets). These capital gains rates are generally effective for taxable years
beginning before January 1, 2013. For later periods, as of the date of this
prospectus, the maximum marginal federal tax rate for net capital gains for
individuals is scheduled to be 20% (10% for certain taxpayers in the 10% and
15% tax brackets). If the gain is earned on property with a holding period of
more than five years the long-term capital gain rate of 20% currently is
scheduled to be reduced to 18% and the 10% rate reduced to 8%.


Net capital gain equals net long-term capital gain minus net short-term
capital loss for the taxable year. Capital gain or loss is long-term if the
holding period for the asset is more than one year and is short-term if the
holding period for the asset is one year or less. You must exclude the date you
purchase your Units to determine your holding period. However, if you receive a
capital gain dividend from your Portfolio and sell your Units at a loss after
holding it for six months or less, the loss will be recharacterized as
long-term capital loss to the extent of the capital gain dividend received. The
tax rates for capital gains realized from assets held for one year or less are
generally the same as for ordinary income. The Internal Revenue Code of 1986,
as amended (the "Code") treats certain capital gains as ordinary income in
special situations.


In certain circumstances, ordinary income dividends received by an
individual Unitholder from a regulated investment company such as your
Portfolio may be taxed at the same rates that apply to net capital gain (as
discussed above), provided certain holding period requirements are satisfied
and provided the dividends are attributable to qualified dividend income
received by the Portfolio itself. These special rules relating to the taxation
of qualified dividend income from regulated investment companies generally
apply to taxable years beginning before January 1, 2013. Your Portfolio will
provide notice to its Unitholders of the amount of any distribution which may
be taken into account as qualified dividend income which is eligible for the
new capital gains tax rates.


In Kind Distributions. Under certain circumstances, as described in this
prospectus, you may receive an in kind distribution of Portfolio securities
when you redeem your Units. In general, this distribution will be treated as a
sale for federal income tax purposes and you will recognize gain or loss, based
on the value at that time of the securities and the amount of cash received.
The Internal Revenue Service could however assert that a loss could not be
currently deducted.


Rollovers and Exchanges. If you elect to have your proceeds from your
Portfolio rolled over into a future trust, it is considered a sale for federal
income tax purposes and any gain on the sale will be treated as a capital gain,
and, in general, any loss will be treated as a capital loss. However, any loss
realized on a sale or exchange will be disallowed to the extent that Units
disposed of are replaced (including through reinvestment of dividends) within a
period of 61 days beginning 30 days before and ending 30 days after disposition
of Units or to the extent that the Unitholder, during such period, acquires or
enters into an option or contract to acquire, substantially identical stock or
securities. In such a case, the basis of the Units acquired will be adjusted to
reflect the disallowed loss.


Deductibility of Portfolio Expenses. Generally, expenses incurred by your
Portfolio will be deducted from the gross income received by your Portfolio and
only your share of your Portfolio's net income will be paid to you and reported
as taxable income to you. However, if the Units of your Portfolio are held by
fewer than 500 Unitholders at any time during a taxable year, your Portfolio
will generally not be able to deduct certain expenses from income, thus
resulting in your reported share of your Portfolio's taxable income being
increased by your share of those expenses, even though you do not receive a
corresponding cash distribution. In this case you may be able to take a
deduction for these expenses; however, certain miscellaneous itemized
deductions, such as investment expenses, may be deducted by individuals only to
the extent that all of these deductions exceed 2% of the individual's adjusted
gross income.


Foreign Investors. If you are a foreign investor (i.e., an investor other
than a U.S. citizen or resident or a U.S. corporation, partnership, estate or
trust), generally, subject to applicable tax treaties, distributions to you
from your Portfolio will be characterized as dividends for federal income tax
purposes (other than dividends which a Portfolio reports as capital gain
dividends) and will be subject to U.S. income taxes, including withholding
taxes, subject to certain exceptions described below. You may be eligible
undder certain income tax treaties for a reduction in withholding rates.
However distributions received by a foreign investor from a Portfolio that are
properly reported by the trust as capital gain dividends may not be subject to
U.S. federal income taxes, including withholding taxes, provided that your
Portfolio makes certain elections and certain other conditions are met.


Foreign Tax Credit. If your Portfolio invests in any foreign securities, the
tax statement that you receive may include an item showing foreign taxes your
Portfolio paid to other countries. In this case, dividends taxed to you will
include your share of the taxes your Portfolio paid to other countries. You may
be able to deduct or receive a tax credit for your share of these taxes if your
Portfolio meets certain requirements for passing through such deductions or
credits to you.


Backup Withholding. By law, your Portfolio must withhold as backup
withholding a percentage of your taxable distributions and redemption proceeds
if you do not provide your correct social security or taxpayer identification
number and certify that you are not subject to backup withholding, or if the
IRS instructs your Portfolio to do so.


Investors should consult their tax advisors concerning the federal, state,
local and foreign tax consequences of investing in a Portfolio.



TAXATION -- ALL OTHER PORTFOLIOS





This section summarizes some of the principal U.S. federal income tax
consequences of owning Units of a Portfolio as of the date of this prospectus.
Tax laws and interpretations change frequently, possibly with retroactive
effect, and these summaries do not describe all of the tax consequences to all
taxpayers. For example, these summaries generally do not describe your
situation if you are a corporation, a non-U.S. person, a broker/dealer, a
tax-exempt entity, or other investor with special circumstances. In addition,
this section does not describe your state, local or foreign tax consequences.


This federal income tax summary is based in part on the advice of counsel to
the Sponsor. The Internal Revenue Service could disagree with any conclusions
set forth in this section. In addition, our counsel was not asked to review the
federal income tax treatment of the assets to be deposited in your Portfolio.


As with any investment, you should seek advice based on your individual
circumstances from your own tax advisor.


Assets of the Portfolio. Each Portfolio is expected to hold shares of stock
in corporations (the "Stocks") that are treated as equity for federal income
tax purposes. Certain Portfolios may also hold shares of stock in corporations
that qualify as real estate investment trusts for federal income tax purposes
("REIT Shares").


It is possible that a Portfolio will also hold other assets, including
assets that are treated differently for federal income tax purposes from those
described above, in which case you will have federal income tax consequences
different from or in addition to those described in this section. We refer to
the assets held by your Portfolio as "Portfolio Assets".


Portfolio Status. If a Portfolio is at all times operated in accordance with
the documents establishing the Portfolio and certain requirements of federal
income tax law are met, the Portfolio will not be taxed as a corporation for
federal income tax purposes. As a Unit owner, you will be treated as the owner
of a pro rata portion of each of the Portfolio Assets, and as such you will be
considered to have received a pro rata share of income (e.g., dividends and
capital gains), if any from each Portfolio Asset when such income would be
considered to be received by you if you directly owned the Portfolio Assets.
This tax treatment applies even if you elect to have your distributions
reinvested into additional Units. In addition, the income from Portfolio Assets
that you must take into account for federal income tax purposes is not reduced
by amounts used to pay sales charges or Portfolio expenses.


Your Tax Basis and Income or Loss Upon Disposition. If you dispose of your
Units or redeem your Units for cash, you will generally recognize gain or loss.
To determine the amount of this gain or loss, you must subtract your adjusted
tax basis in your Units disposed of from your proceeds received in the
transaction. You also generally will recognize taxable gain or loss if your
Portfolio disposes of Portfolio Assets. Your initial tax basis in each
Portfolio Asset is determined by apportioning the cost of your Units, including
sales charges, among the Portfolio Assets ratably according to their values on
the date you acquire your Units. In certain circumstances, however, your tax
basis in certain Portfolio Assets must be adjusted after you acquire your
Units.


If you are an individual, the maximum marginal federal tax rate for net
capital gain currently is generally 15% (zero for certain taxpayers in the 10%
and 15% tax brackets). These capital gains rates are generally effective for
taxable years beginning before January 1, 2013. For later periods, as of the
date of this prospectus, the maximum marginal federal tax rate for net capital
gains for individuals is scheduled to be 20% (10% for certain taxpayers in the
10% and 15% tax brackets). If the gain is earned on property with a holding
period of more than five years the long-term capital gain rate of 20% currently
is scheduled to be reduced to 18% and the 10% rate reduced to 8%.


Net capital gain equals net long-term capital gain minus net short-term
capital loss for the taxable year. Capital gain or loss is long-term if the
holding period for the asset is more than one year and is short-term if the
holding period for the asset is one year or less. You must exclude the date you
purchase your Units to determine your holding period. The tax rates for capital
gains realized from assets held for one year or less are generally the same as
for ordinary income. The Code, however, treats certain capital gains as
ordinary income in special situations. The deductibility of capital losses is
subject to limitations under the Code, including generally a maximum deduction
against ordinary income of $3,000 per year.


Dividends from Stocks. Under current law, certain dividends received with
respect to the Stocks may qualify to be taxed at the same rates that apply to
net capital gain (as discussed above), provided certain holding period
requirements are satisfied. These are generally referred to as qualified
dividends. These special rules relating to the taxation of dividends at capital
gains rates generally apply to taxable years beginning before January 1, 2013.


Dividends from REIT Shares. Some dividends on the REIT Shares may be
designated as "capital gain dividends," generally taxable to you as long-term
capital gains. If you hold a Unit for six months or less or if your Portfolio
holds a REIT Share for six months or less, any loss incurred by you related to
the disposition of such REIT Share will be treated as a long-term capital loss
to the extent of any long-term capital gain distributions received (or deemed
to have been received) with respect to such REIT Share. Distributions of income
or capital gains declared on the REIT Shares in October, November or December
will be deemed to have been paid to you on December 31 of the year they are
declared, even when paid by the REIT during the following January. Other
dividends on the REIT Shares will generally be taxable to you as ordinary
income.


Dividends Received Deduction. Generally, a domestic corporation owning Units
in a Portfolio may be eligible for the dividends received deduction with
respect to such Unitholder's pro rata portion of certain types of dividends
received by the Portfolio. However, a corporation generally will not be
entitled to the dividends received deduction with respect to dividends from
most foreign corporations.


Cash Distributions, Rollovers and Exchanges. If you receive cash when you
redeem your Units or at your Portfolio's termination or if you elect to direct
that the cash proceeds you are deemed to receive when you redeem your Units or
at your Portfolio's termination be rolled into a future trust, it is considered
a sale for federal income tax purposes, and any gain on the sale will be
treated as a capital gain, and, in general, any loss will be treated as a
capital loss. However, any loss you incur in connection with the receipt or
deemed receipt of cash, or in connection with the exchange of your Units of the
Portfolio for units of another trust (deemed sale and subsequent deemed
repurchase), will generally be disallowed to the extent you acquire units of a
subsequent trust and such subsequent trust has substantially identical assets
under the wash sale provisions of the Code.


In Kind Distributions. Under certain circumstances as described in this
prospectus, you may request an in kind distribution of Portfolio Assets when
you redeem your Units. By electing to receive an in kind distribution, you will
receive Portfolio Assets plus, possibly, cash. You generally will not recognize
gain or loss if you only receive whole Portfolio Assets in exchange for the
identical amount of your pro rata portion of the same Portfolio Assets held by
your Portfolio. However, if you also receive cash in exchange for a Portfolio
Asset or a fractional portion of a Portfolio Asset, you will generally
recognize gain or loss based on the difference between the amount of cash you
receive and your tax basis in such Portfolio Asset or fractional portion.


Limitations on the Deductibility of Portfolio Expenses. Generally, for
federal income tax purposes, you must take into account your full pro rata
share of your Portfolio's income, even if some of that income is used to pay
Portfolio expenses. You may deduct your pro rata share of each expense paid by
your Portfolio to the same extent as if you directly paid the expense. You may
be required to treat some or all of the expenses of your Portfolio as
miscellaneous itemized deductions. Individuals may only deduct certain
miscellaneous itemized deductions to the extent they exceed 2% of adjusted
gross income.


Foreign Investors. If you are a foreign investor (i.e., an investor other
than a U.S. citizen or resident or a U.S. corporation, partnership, estate or
trust), you may not be subject to U.S. federal income taxes, including
withholding taxes, on some of the income from your Portfolio or on any gain
from the sale or redemption of your Units, provided that certain conditions are
met. In the case of Units held by nonresident alien individuals, foreign
corporations or other non-U.S. persons, distributions by your Portfolio that
are treated as U.S. source income (e.g., dividends received on Stocks of
domestic corporations) will generally be subject to U.S. income taxation and
withholding, subject to any applicable treaty. You should consult your tax
advisor with respect to the conditions you must meet in order to be exempt for
U.S. tax purposes. You should also consult your tax advisor with respect to
other U.S. tax withholding and reporting requirements.


Foreign Taxes. Some distributions by your Portfolio may be subject to
foreign withholding taxes. Any income withheld will still be treated as income
to you. Under the grantor trust rules, you are considered to have paid directly
your share of any foreign taxes that are paid. Therefore, for U.S. tax
purposes, you may be entitled to a foreign tax credit or deduction for those
foreign taxes.


Backup Withholding. By law, your Portfolio must withhold as backup
withholding a percentage of your taxable distributions and redemption proceeds
if you do not provide your correct social security or taxpayer identification
number and certify that you are not subject to backup withholding, or if the
IRS instructs your Portfolio to do so.


New York Tax Status. Under the existing income tax laws of the State and
City of New York, your Portfolio will not be taxed as a corporation subject to
the New York State franchise tax and the New York City general corporation tax.
You should consult your tax advisor regarding potential federal, foreign, state
or local taxation with respect to your Units based on your individual
circumstances.



PORTFOLIO OPERATING EXPENSES





General. The fees and expenses of your Portfolio will generally accrue on a
daily basis. Portfolio operating fees and expenses are generally paid out of
the Income Account to the extent funds are available, and then from the Capital
Account. The deferred sales charge, creation and development fee and
organization costs are generally paid out of the Capital Account of your
Portfolio. It is expected that Securities will be sold to pay these amounts
which will result in capital gains or losses to Unitholders. See "Taxation".
These sales will reduce future income distributions. The Sponsor's,
Supervisor's and Trustee's fees may be increased without approval of the
Unitholders by amounts not exceeding proportionate increases under the category
"Services Less Rent of Shelter" in the Consumer Price Index for All Urban
Consumers or, if this category is not published, in a comparable category.


Organization Costs. You and the other Unitholders will bear all or a portion
of the organization costs and charges incurred in connection with the
establishment of your Portfolio. These costs and charges will include the cost
of the preparation, printing and execution of the trust agreement, registration
statement and other documents relating to your Portfolio, federal and state
registration fees and costs, fees paid to any Portfolio Consultant for
assisting the Sponsor in the selection of securities, the initial fees and
expenses of the Trustee, and legal and auditing expenses. The Public Offering
Price of Units includes the estimated amount of these costs. The Trustee will
deduct these expenses from your Portfolio's assets at the end of the initial
offering period.


Creation and Development Fee. The Sponsor will receive a fee from your
Portfolio for creating and developing the Portfolio, including determining the
Portfolio's objectives, policies, composition and size, selecting service
providers and information services and for providing other similar
administrative and ministerial functions. The creation and development fee is a
charge of $0.05 per Unit. The Trustee will deduct this amount from your
Portfolio's assets as of the close of the initial offering period. No portion
of this fee is applied to the payment of distribution expenses or as
compensation for sales efforts. This fee will not be deducted from proceeds
received upon a repurchase, redemption or exchange of Units before the close of
the initial public offering period.


Trustee's Fee. For its services the Trustee will receive the fee from your
Portfolio set forth in the "Fee Table" (which includes the estimated amount of
miscellaneous Portfolio expenses). The Trustee benefits to the extent there are
funds in the Capital and Income Accounts since these Accounts are non-interest
bearing to Unitholders and the amounts earned by the Trustee are retained by
the Trustee. Part of the Trustee's compensation for its services to your
Portfolio is expected to result from the use of these funds.


Compensation of Sponsor and Supervisor. The Sponsor and the Supervisor,
which is an affiliate of the Sponsor, will receive the annual fee for providing
bookkeeping and administrative services and portfolio supervisory services set
forth in the "Fee Table". These fees may exceed the actual costs of providing
these services to your Portfolio but at no time will the total amount received
for these services rendered to all Invesco unit investment trusts in any
calendar year exceed the aggregate cost of providing these services in that
year.


Miscellaneous Expenses. The following additional charges are or may be
incurred by your Portfolio: (a) normal expenses (including the cost of mailing
reports to Unitholders) incurred in connection with the operation of the
Portfolio, (b) fees of the Trustee for extraordinary services, (c) expenses of
the Trustee (including legal and auditing expenses) and of counsel designated
by the Sponsor, (d) various governmental charges, (e) expenses and costs of any
action taken by the Trustee to protect the Portfolio and the rights and
interests of Unitholders, (f) indemnification of the Trustee for any loss,
liability or expenses incurred in the administration of the Portfolio without
negligence, bad faith or wilful misconduct on its part, (g) foreign custodial
and transaction fees (which may include compensation paid to the Trustee or its
subsidiaries or affiliates), (h) costs associated with liquidating the
securities held in the Portfolio, (i) any offering costs incurred after the end
of the initial offering period and (j) expenditures incurred in contacting
Unitholders upon termination of the Portfolio. Each Portfolio may pay the
expenses of updating its registration statement each year. The Select 5
Industrial Portfolio, Global 45 Dividend Strategy Portfolio and The Dow Jones
Select Dividend Index Strategy Portfolio will each pay a license fee to CME for
use of certain service marks and other property. The Select S&P Industrial
Portfolio, Select S&P Core Portfolio and the Global 45 Dividend Strategy
Portfolio will each pay a license fee to SPIAS for use of certain trademarks
and other property. The Dow Jones Select Dividend Index Strategy Portfolio will
pay a license fee to Horizon Investment Services, LLC for the use of certain
service marks and other property. The EAFE Select Portfolio and the Global 45
Dividend Strategy Portfolio will each pay a license fee to MSCI Inc. for the
use of certain trademarks and other property.

RISK FACTORS



Price Volatility. Because the Portfolios invest in stocks of U.S. and
foreign companies, you should understand the risks of investing in stocks
before purchasing Units. These risks include the risk that the financial
condition of the company or the general condition of the stock market may
worsen and the value of the stocks (and therefore Units) will fall. Stocks are
especially susceptible to general stock market movements. The value of stocks
often rises or falls rapidly and unpredictably as market confidence and
perceptions of companies change. These perceptions are based on factors
including expectations regarding government economic policies, inflation,
interest rates, economic expansion or contraction, political climates and
economic or banking crises. The value of Units will fluctuate with the value of
the stocks in a Portfolio and may be more or less than the price you originally
paid for your Units. As with any investment, we cannot guarantee that the
performance of a Portfolio will be positive over any period of time. Because
the Portfolios are unmanaged, the Trustee will not sell stocks in response to
market fluctuations as is common in managed investments. In addition, because
some Portfolios hold a relatively small number of stocks, you may encounter
greater market risk than in a more diversified investment.


Dividends. Stocks represent ownership interests in a company and are not
obligations of the company. Common stockholders have a right to receive
payments from the company that is subordinate to the rights of creditors,
bondholders or preferred stockholders of the company. This means that common
stockholders have a right to receive dividends only if a company's board of
directors declares a dividend and the company has provided for payment of all
of its creditors, bondholders and preferred stockholders. If a company issues
additional debt securities or preferred stock, the owners of these securities
will have a claim against the company's assets before common stockholders if
the company declares bankruptcy or liquidates its assets even though the common
stock was issued first. As a result, the company may be less willing or able to
declare or pay dividends on its common stock.


Foreign Stocks. Because certain Portfolios invest in foreign stocks, these
Portfolios involve additional risks that differ from an investment in domestic
stocks. Investments in foreign securities may involve a greater degree of risk
than those in domestic securities. There is generally less publicly available
information about foreign companies in the form of reports and ratings similar
to those that are published about issuers in the United States. Also, foreign
issuers are generally not subject to uniform accounting, auditing and financial
reporting requirements comparable to those applicable to United States issuers.
With respect to certain foreign countries, there is the possibility of adverse
changes in investment or exchange control regulations, expropriation,
nationalization or confiscatory taxation, limitations on the removal of funds
or other assets of a Portfolio, political or social instability, or diplomatic
developments which could affect United States investments in those countries.
Moreover, industrial foreign economies may differ favorably or unfavorably from
the United States' economy in terms of growth of gross national product, rate
of inflation, capital reinvestment, resource self-sufficiency and balance of
payments position. Foreign securities markets are generally not as developed or
efficient as those in the United States. While growing in volume, they usually
have substantially less volume than the New York Stock Exchange, and securities
of some foreign issuers are less liquid and more volatile than securities of
comparable United States issuers. Fixed commissions on foreign exchanges are
generally higher than negotiated commissions on United States exchanges. There
is generally less government supervision and regulation of securities
exchanges, brokers and listed issuers than in the United States.


Foreign Currencies. Certain Portfolios also involve the risk that
fluctuations in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and foreign currencies
may negatively affect the value of the stocks. For example, if a foreign stock
rose 10% in price but the U.S. dollar gained 5% against the related foreign
currency, a U.S. investor's return would be reduced to about 5%. This is
because the foreign currency would "buy" fewer dollars or, conversely, a dollar
would buy more of the foreign currency. Many foreign currencies have fluctuated
widely against the U.S. dollar for a variety of reasons such as supply and
demand of the currency, investor perceptions of world or country economies,
political instability, currency speculation by institutional investors, changes
in government policies, buying and selling of currencies by central banks of
countries, trade balances and changes in interest rates. A Portfolio's foreign
currency transactions will be conducted with foreign exchange dealers acting as
principals on a spot (i.e., cash) buying basis. These dealers realize a profit
based on the difference between the price at which they buy the currency (bid
price) and the price at which they sell the currency (offer price). The Trustee
will estimate the currency exchange rates based on current activity in the
related currency exchange markets, however, due to the volatility of the
markets and other factors, the estimated rates may not be indicative of the
rate a Portfolio might obtain had the Trustee sold the currency in the market
at that time.


Consumer Discretionary and Consumer Staples Issuers. Certain Portfolios may
invest significantly in issuers that manufacture or sell consumer products. The
profitability of these companies will be affected by various factors including
the general state of the economy and consumer spending trends. In the past,
there have been major changes in the retail environment due to the declaration
of bankruptcy by some of the major corporations involved in the retail
industry, particularly the department store segment. The continued viability of
the retail industry will depend on the industry's ability to adapt and to
compete in changing economic and social conditions, to attract and retain
capable management, and to finance expansion. Weakness in the banking or real
estate industry, a recessionary economic climate with the consequent slowdown
in employment growth, less favorable trends in unemployment or a marked
deceleration in real disposable personal income growth could result in
significant pressure on both consumer wealth and consumer confidence, adversely
affecting consumer spending habits. Increasing employee and retiree benefit
costs may also have an adverse effect on the industry. In many sectors of the
retail industry, competition may be fierce due to market saturation, converging
consumer tastes and other factors. Because of these factors and the recent
increase in trade opportunities with other countries, American retailers are
now entering global markets which entail added risks such as sudden weakening
of foreign economies, difficulty in adapting to local conditions and
constraints and added research costs.


Financial Services Issuers. An investment in Units of certain Portfolios
should be made with an understanding of the problems and risks inherent in the
bank and financial services sector in general.


The effects of the global financial crisis that began to unfold in 2007
continue to manifest in nearly all the sub-divisions of the financial services
industry. Financial losses and write downs among investment banks and similar
institutions reached significant levels in 2008. The impact of these losses
among traditional banks, investment banks, broker/dealers and insurers has
forced a number of large such institutions into either liquidation or
combination, while drastically increasing the credit risk, and possibility of
default, of bonds issued by such institutions faced with these troubles. Many
of the institutions are having difficulty in accessing credit markets to
finance their operations and in maintaining appropriate levels of equity
capital. In some cases, U.S. and foreign governments have acted to bail out or
provide support to select institutions, however the risk of default by such
issuers has nonetheless increased substantially.


While the U.S. and foreign governments, and their respective government
agencies, have taken steps to address problems in the financial markets and
with financial institutions, there can be no assurance that the risks
associated with investment in financial services company issuers will decrease
as a result of these steps.


Banks and their holding companies are especially subject to the adverse
effects of economic recession, volatile interest rates, portfolio
concentrations in geographic markets and in commercial and residential real
estate loans, and competition from new entrants in their fields of business.
Banks are highly dependent on net interest margin. Bank profitability is
largely dependent on the availability and cost of capital funds, and can
fluctuate significantly when interest rates change or due to increased
competition. Banks had received significant consumer mortgage fee income as a
result of activity in mortgage and refinance markets. As initial home
purchasing and refinancing activity subsided as a result of increasing interest
rates and other factors, this income diminished. Economic conditions in the
real estate markets have deteriorated and have had a substantial negative
effect upon banks because they generally have a portion of their assets
invested in loans secured by real estate.


Banks and their holding companies are subject to extensive federal
regulation and, when such institutions are state-chartered, to state regulation
as well. Such regulations impose strict capital requirements and limitations on
the nature and extent of business activities that banks may pursue.
Furthermore, bank regulators have a wide range of discretion in connection with
their supervisory and enforcement authority and may substantially restrict the
permissible activities of a particular institution if deemed to pose
significant risks to the soundness of such institution or the safety of the
federal deposit insurance fund. Regulatory actions, such as increases in the
minimum capital requirements applicable to banks and increases in deposit
insurance premiums required to be paid by banks and thrifts to the Federal
Deposit Insurance Corporation ("FDIC"), can negatively impact earnings and the
ability of a company to pay dividends. Neither federal insurance of deposits
nor governmental regulations, however, insures the solvency or profitability of
banks or their holding companies, or insures against any risk of investment in
the securities issued by such institutions.


The statutory requirements applicable to, and regulatory supervision of,
banks and their holding companies have increased significantly and have
undergone substantial change in the past. To a great extent, these changes are
embodied in the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act,
enacted in August 1989; the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement
Act of 1991, and the regulations promulgated under these laws. The impact of
these laws on the business, financial condition and prospects of the Securities
in your Portfolio cannot be predicted with certainty. The Gramm-Leach-Bliley
Act financial services overhaul legislation allows banks, securities firms and
insurance companies to form one-stop financial conglomerates marketing a wide
range of financial service products to investors and permits new entrants to
offer various financial products. This legislation has resulted in increased
merger activity and heightened competition among existing and new participants
in the field. Technological advances such as the Internet allow these
nontraditional lending sources to cut overhead and permit the more efficient
use of customer data. Banks continue to face tremendous pressure from mutual
funds, brokerage firms and other financial service providers in the competition
to furnish services that were traditionally offered by banks. Legislation to
liberalize interstate banking has recently been signed into law. Under the
legislation, banks will be able to purchase or establish subsidiary banks in
any state, one year after the legislation's enactment. Since mid-1997, banks
have been allowed to turn existing banks into branches. Consolidation is likely
to continue. The Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") and the Financial
Accounting Standards Board require the expanded use of market value accounting
by banks and have imposed rules requiring market accounting for investment
securities held in trading accounts or available for sale. Adoption of
additional such rules may result in increased volatility in the reported health
of the industry, and mandated regulatory intervention to correct such problems.
Additional legislative and regulatory changes may be forthcoming. For example,
the bank regulatory authorities have proposed substantial changes to the
Community Reinvestment Act and fair lending laws, rules and regulations, and
there can be no certainty as to the effect, if any, that such changes would
have on the Securities in your Portfolio. In addition, from time to time the
deposit insurance system is reviewed by Congress and federal regulators, and
proposed reforms of that system could, among other things, further restrict the
ways in which deposited moneys can be used by banks or reduce the dollar amount
or number of deposits insured for any depositor. Such reforms could reduce
profitability, as investment opportunities available to bank institutions
become more limited and as consumers look for savings vehicles other than bank
deposits. Banks face significant competition from other financial institutions
such as mutual funds, credit unions, mortgage banking companies and insurance
companies, and increased competition may result from legislative broadening of
regional and national interstate banking powers. Among other benefits, such
legislation allows banks and bank holding companies to acquire across
previously prohibited state lines and to consolidate their various bank
subsidiaries into one unit. The Sponsor makes no prediction as to what, if any,
manner of bank regulatory actions might ultimately be adopted or what ultimate
effect such actions might have on the your Portfolio.


The Federal Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 generally prohibits a bank
holding company from (1) acquiring, directly or indirectly, more than 5% of the
outstanding shares of any class of voting securities of a bank or bank holding
company, (2) acquiring control of a bank or another bank holding company, (3)
acquiring all or substantially all the assets of a bank, or (4) merging or
consolidating with another bank holding company, without first obtaining
Federal Reserve Board ("FRB") approval. In considering an application with
respect to any such transaction, the FRB is required to consider a variety of
factors, including the potential anti-competitive effects of the transaction,
the financial condition and future prospects of the combining and resulting
institutions, the managerial resources of the resulting institution, the
convenience and needs of the communities the combined organization would serve,
the record of performance of each combining organization under the Community
Reinvestment Act and the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, and the prospective
availability to the FRB of information appropriate to determine ongoing
regulatory compliance with applicable banking laws. In addition, the federal
Change In Bank Control Act and various state laws impose limitations on the
ability of one or more individuals or other entities to acquire control of
banks or bank holding companies.


The FRB has issued a policy statement on the payment of cash dividends by
bank holding companies. In the policy statement, the FRB expressed its view
that a bank holding company experiencing earnings weaknesses should not pay
cash dividends which exceed its net income or which could only be funded in
ways that would weaken its financial health, such as by borrowing. The FRB also
may impose limitations on the payment of dividends as a condition to its
approval of certain applications, including applications for approval of
mergers and acquisitions. The Sponsor makes no prediction as to the effect, if
any, such laws will have on the Securities or whether such approvals, if
necessary, will be obtained.


Companies engaged in the investment management industry are subject to the
adverse effects of economic recession, volatile interest rates, and competition
from new entrants in their fields of business. Adverse changes in the direction
of the stock market, investor confidence, equity transaction volume, the level
and direction of interest rates and the outlook of emerging markets could
adversely affect the financial stability, as well as the stock prices, of these
companies. Additionally, competitive pressures, including increased competition
with new and existing competitors, the ongoing commoditization of traditional
businesses and the need for increased capital expenditures on new technology
could adversely impact the profit margins of companies in the investment
management and brokerage industries. Companies involved in the investment
management industry are also subject to extensive regulation by government
agencies and self-regulatory organizations, and changes in laws, regulations or
rules, or in the interpretation of such laws, regulations and rules could
adversely affect the stock prices of such companies.


Companies involved in the insurance, reinsurance and risk management
industry underwrite, sell or distribute property, casualty and business
insurance. Many factors affect insurance, reinsurance and risk management
company profits, including but not limited to interest rate movements, the
imposition of premium rate caps, a misapprehension of the risks involved in
given underwritings, competition and pressure to compete globally, weather
catastrophes or other disasters and the effects of client mergers. Individual
companies may be exposed to material risks including reserve inadequacy and the
inability to collect from reinsurance carriers. Insurance companies are subject
to extensive governmental regulation, including the imposition of maximum rate
levels, which may not be adequate for some lines of business. Proposed or
potential tax law changes may also adversely affect insurance companies' policy
sales, tax obligations and profitability. In addition to the foregoing, profit
margins of these companies continue to shrink due to the commoditization of
traditional businesses, new competitors, capital expenditures on new technology
and the pressure to compete globally.


In addition to the normal risks of business, companies involved in the
insurance and risk management industry are subject to significant risk factors,
including those applicable to regulated insurance companies, such as:


o    the inherent uncertainty in the process of establishing
property-liability loss reserves, and the fact that ultimate losses
could materially exceed established loss reserves, which could have a
material adverse effect on results of operations and financial
condition;


o    the fact that insurance companies have experienced, and can be
expected in the future to experience, catastrophic losses, which could
have a material adverse impact on their financial conditions, results
of operations and cash flow;


o    the inherent uncertainty in the process of establishing
property-liability loss reserves due to changes in loss payment
patterns caused by new claim settlement practices;


o    the need for insurance companies and their subsidiaries to maintain
appropriate levels of statutory capital and surplus, particularly in
light of continuing scrutiny by rating organizations and state
insurance regulatory authorities, and in order to maintain acceptable
financial strength or claims-paying ability ratings;


o    the extensive regulation and supervision to which insurance companies
are subject, and various regulatory and other legal actions;


o    the adverse impact that increases in interest rates could have on the
value of an insurance company's investment portfolio and on the
attractiveness of certain of its products; and


o    the uncertainty involved in estimating the availability of
reinsurance and the collectability of reinsurance recoverables.


The state insurance regulatory framework has, during recent years, come
under increased federal scrutiny, and certain state legislatures have
considered or enacted laws that alter and, in many cases, increase state
authority to regulate insurance companies and insurance holding company
systems. Further, the National Association of Insurance Commissioners ("NAIC")
and state insurance regulators are re-examining existing laws and regulations,
specifically focusing on insurance companies, interpretations of existing laws
and the development of new laws. In addition, Congress and certain federal
agencies have investigated the condition of the insurance industry in the
United States to determine whether to promulgate additional federal regulation.
The Sponsor is unable to predict whether any state or federal legislation will
be enacted to change the nature or scope of regulation of the insurance
industry, or what effect, if any, such legislation would have on the industry.


All insurance companies are subject to state laws and regulations that
require diversification of their investment portfolios and limit the amount of
investments in certain investment categories. Failure to comply with these laws
and regulations would cause non-conforming investments to be treated as
non-admitted assets for purposes of measuring statutory surplus and, in some
instances, would require divestiture.


Utility Issuers. An investment in Units of certain Portfolios should be made
with an understanding of the characteristics of the public utility industry and
the risks which such an investment may entail. General problems of the public
utility industry include the difficulty in obtaining an adequate return on
invested capital despite frequent increases in rates which have been granted by
the public service commissions having jurisdiction, the difficulty in financing
large construction programs during an inflationary period, the restrictions on
operations and increased cost and delays attributable to environmental, nuclear
safety and other regulatory considerations, the difficulty of the capital
markets absorbing utility debt and equity securities, the difficulty in
obtaining fuel for electric generation at reasonable prices, unusual,
unexpected or normal weather and its effects, regulatory restrictions on the
ability to pass increasing wholesale costs along to the retail and business
customer, and the effects of energy conservation. There is no assurance that
public service commissions will grant rate increases in the future or that any
such increases will be timely or adequate to cover operating and other expenses
and debt service requirements. All of the public utilities which are issuers of
the Securities have been experiencing many of these problems in varying
degrees. Furthermore, utility stocks are particularly susceptible to interest
rate risk, generally exhibiting an inverse relationship to interest rates. As a
result, electric utility stock prices may be adversely affected as interest
rates rise. Similarly, the success of certain companies is tied to a relatively
small concentration of products or technologies with intense competition
between companies. There can be no assurance that these customers will place
additional orders, or that an issuer of Securities will obtain orders of
similar magnitude as past orders from other customers. Accordingly, a decline
in demand for products or technologies or from such customers could have a
material adverse impact on issuers of the Securities.


Utilities are generally subject to extensive regulation by state utility
commissions which, for example, establish the rates which may be charged and
the appropriate rate of return on an approved asset base, which must be
approved by the state commissions. Certain utilities have had difficulty from
time to time in persuading regulators, who are subject to political pressures,
to grant rate increases necessary to maintain an adequate return on investment.
Any unexpected limitations could negatively affect the profitability of
utilities whose budgets are planned far in advance. In addition, gas pipeline
and distribution companies have had difficulties in adjusting to short and
surplus energy supplies, enforcing or being required to comply with long-term
contracts and avoiding litigation with their customers, on the one hand, or
suppliers, on the other. Furthermore, regulatory authorities, which may be
subject to political and other pressures, may not grant future rate increases,
or may impose accounting or operational policies, any of which could adversely
affect a company's profitability and its stock price. Certain utility companies
have experienced full or partial deregulation in recent years. These utility
companies are frequently more similar to industrial companies in that they are
subject to greater competition and have been permitted by regulators to
diversify outside of their original geographic regions and their traditional
lines of business. These opportunities may permit certain utility companies to
earn more than their traditional regulated rates of return. Some companies,
however, may be forced to defend their core business and may be less
profitable.


Certain of the issuers of the Securities may own or operate nuclear
generating facilities. Governmental authorities may from time to time review
existing, and impose additional, requirements governing the licensing,
construction and operation of nuclear power plants. In the past, nuclear
generating projects in the electric utility industry have experienced
substantial cost increases, construction delays and licensing difficulties.
These have been caused by various factors, including inflation, high financing
costs, required design changes and rework, allegedly faulty construction,
objections by groups and governmental officials, limits on the ability to
obtain financing, reduced forecasts of energy requirements and economic
conditions. This experience indicates that the risk of significant cost
increases, delays and licensing difficulties remain present until completion
and achievement of commercial operation of any nuclear project. Also, nuclear
generating units in service have experienced unplanned outages or extensions of
scheduled outages due to equipment problems or new regulatory requirements
sometimes followed by a significant delay in obtaining regulatory approval to
return to service. A major accident at a nuclear plant anywhere could cause the
imposition of limits or prohibitions on the operation, construction or
licensing of nuclear units.


In view of the uncertainties discussed above, there can be no assurance that
any utility company's share of the full cost of nuclear units under
construction ultimately will be recovered in rates or the extent to which a
company could earn an adequate return on its investment in such units. The
likelihood of a significantly adverse event occurring in any of the areas of
concern described above varies, as does the potential severity of any adverse
impact. It should be recognized, however, that one or more of such adverse
events could occur and individually or collectively could have a material
adverse impact on a company's financial condition, the results of its
operations, its ability to make interest and principal payments on its
outstanding debt or to pay dividends.


Other general problems of the electric, gas and water utility industries
(including state and local joint action power agencies) include rising costs of
rail transportation to transport fossil fuels, the uncertainty of transmission
service costs for both interstate and intrastate transactions, changes in tax
laws which adversely affect a utility's ability to operate profitably,
increased competition in service costs, recent reductions in estimates of
future demand for electricity and gas in certain areas of the country,
restrictions on operations and increased cost and delays attributable to
environmental considerations, uncertain availability and increased cost of
capital, unavailability of fuel for electric generation at reasonable prices,
including the steady rise in fuel costs and the costs associated with
conversion to alternate fuel sources such as coal, availability and cost of
natural gas for resale, technical and cost factors and other problems
associated with construction, licensing, regulation and operation of nuclear
facilities for electric generation, including, among other considerations, the
problems associated with the use of radioactive materials and the disposal of
radioactive wastes, and the effects of energy and environmental conservation
efforts. Each of the problems referred to could adversely affect the ability of
the issuers of any Securities to make dividend payments and the value of such
Securities on redemption of your Units.


Liquidity. Whether or not the stocks in a Portfolio are listed on a stock
exchange, the stocks may delist from the exchange or principally trade in an
over-the-counter market. As a result, the existence of a liquid trading market
could depend on whether dealers will make a market in the stocks. We cannot
guarantee that dealers will maintain a market or that any market will be
liquid. The value of the stocks could fall if trading markets are limited or
absent.


Additional Units. The Sponsor may create additional Units of a Portfolio by
depositing into the Portfolio additional stocks or cash with instructions to
purchase additional stocks. A deposit could result in a dilution of your
investment and anticipated income because of fluctuations in the price of the
stocks between the time of the deposit and the purchase of the stocks and
because the Portfolio will pay brokerage or acquisition fees.


Voting. Only the Trustee may sell or vote the stocks in a Portfolio. While
you may sell or redeem your Units, you may not sell or vote the stocks in your
Portfolio. The Sponsor will instruct the Trustee how to vote the stocks. The
Trustee will vote the stocks in the same general proportion as shares held by
other shareholders if the Sponsor fails to provide instructions.

TRUSTEE INFORMATION



The Trustee is The Bank of New York Mellon, a trust company organized under
the laws of New York. The Bank of New York Mellon has its principal unit
investment trust division offices at 2 Hanson Place, 12th Floor, Brooklyn, New
York 11217, (800) 856-8487. The Bank of New York Mellon is subject to
supervision and examination by the Superintendent of Banks of the State of New
York and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, and its deposits
are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation to the extent
permitted by law.


The duties of the Trustee are primarily ministerial in nature. It did not
participate in the selection of Securities for the Portfolios.


In accordance with the Trust Agreement, the Trustee shall keep proper books
of record and account of all transactions at its office for each Portfolio.
Such records shall include the name and address of, and the number of Units of
each Portfolio held by, every Unitholder. Such books and records shall be open
to inspection by any Unitholder at all reasonable times during the usual
business hours. The Trustee shall make such annual or other reports as may from
time to time be required under any applicable state or federal statute, rule or
regulation. The Trustee is required to keep a certified copy or duplicate
original of the Trust Agreement on file in its office available for inspection
at all reasonable times during the usual business hours by any Unitholder,
together with a current list of the Securities held in each Portfolio.


Under the Trust Agreement, the Trustee or any successor trustee may resign
and be discharged of its responsibilities created by the Trust Agreement by
executing an instrument in writing and filing the same with the Sponsor. The
Trustee or successor trustee must mail a copy of the notice of resignation to
all Unitholders then of record, not less than 60 days before the date specified
in such notice when such resignation is to take effect. The Sponsor upon
receiving notice of such resignation is obligated to appoint a successor
trustee promptly. If, upon such resignation, no successor trustee has been
appointed and has accepted the appointment within 30 days after notification,
the retiring Trustee may apply to a court of competent jurisdiction for the
appointment of a successor. The Sponsor may remove the Trustee and appoint a
successor trustee as provided in the Trust Agreement at any time with or
without cause. Notice of such removal and appointment shall be mailed to each
Unitholder by the Sponsor. Upon execution of a written acceptance of such
appointment by such successor trustee, all the rights, powers, duties and
obligations of the original trustee shall vest in the successor. The
resignation or removal of a Trustee becomes effective only when the successor
trustee accepts its appointment as such or when a court of competent
jurisdiction appoints a successor trustee.


Any corporation into which a Trustee may be merged or with which it may be
consolidated, or any corporation resulting from any merger or consolidation to
which a Trustee shall be a party, shall be the successor trustee. The Trustee
must be a banking corporation organized under the laws of the United States or
any state and having at all times an aggregate capital, surplus and undivided
profits of not less than $5,000,000.



TAXATION




Regulated Investment Companies



The prospectus contains a discussion of certain U.S. federal income tax
issues concerning the Portfolios and the purchase, ownership and disposition of
Portfolio Units. The discussion below supplements the prospectus discussion and
is qualified in its entirety by the prospectus discussion. Prospective
investors should consult their own tax advisors with regard to the federal tax
consequences of the purchase, ownership, or disposition of Portfolio Units, as
well as the tax consequences arising under the laws of any state, locality,
non-U.S. country, or other taxing jurisdiction.


This federal income tax summary is based in part on the advice of counsel to
the Sponsor. The Internal Revenue Service could disagree with any conclusions
set forth in this section. In addition, our counsel was not asked to review the
federal income tax treatment of the assets to be deposited in your Portfolio.


The Global 45 Dividend Strategy Portfolio intends to elect and to qualify
annually as a regulated investment company under the Internal Revenue Code of
1986, as amended (the "Code") and to comply with applicable distribution
requirements so that each will not pay federal income tax on income and capital
gains distributed to its Unitholders.


To qualify for the favorable U.S. federal income tax treatment generally
accorded to regulated investment companies, your Portfolio must, among other
things, (a) derive in each taxable year at least 90% of its gross income from
dividends, interest, payments with respect to securities loans and gains from
the sale or other disposition of stock, securities or foreign currencies or
other income derived with respect to its business of investing in such stock,
securities or currencies, and net income from qualified publicly traded
partnerships; (b) diversify its holdings so that, at the end of each quarter of
the taxable year, (i) at least 50% of the market value of the Portfolio's
assets is represented by cash and cash items (including receivables), U.S.
government securities, the securities of other regulated investment companies
and other securities, with such other securities of any one issuer generally
limited for the purposes of this calculation to an amount not greater than 5%
of the value of the Portfolio's total assets and not greater than 10% of the
outstanding voting securities of such issuer, and (ii) not more than 25% of the
value of its total assets is invested in the securities (other than U.S.
government securities or the securities of other regulated investment
companies) of any one issuer, or two or more issuers which the Portfolio
controls (by owning 20% or more of the issuer's outstanding voting securities)
and which are engaged in the same, similar or related trades or businesses, or
the securities of qualified publicly traded partnerships; and (c) distribute at
least 90% of its investment company taxable income (which includes, among other
items, dividends, interest and net short-term capital gains in excess of net
long-term capital losses but excludes net capital gain, if any) and at least
90% of its net tax-exempt interest income, if any, each taxable year.


As a regulated investment company, your Portfolio generally will not be
subject to U.S. federal income tax on its investment company taxable income (as
that term is defined in the Code), but without regard to the deduction for
dividends paid) and net capital gain (the excess of net long-term capital gain
over net short-term capital loss), if any, that it distributes to Unitholders.
Your Portfolio intends to distribute to its Unitholders, at least annually,
substantially all of its investment company taxable income and net capital
gain. If your Portfolio retains any net capital gain or investment company
taxable income, it will generally be subject to federal income tax at regular
corporate rates on the amount retained. In addition, amounts not distributed on
a timely basis in accordance with a calendar year distribution requirement are
subject to a nondeductible 4% excise tax unless, generally, your Portfolio
distributes during each calendar year an amount equal to the sum of (1) at
least 98% of its ordinary income (not taking into account any capital gains or
losses) for the calendar year, (2) at least 98.2% of its capital gains in
excess of its capital losses (adjusted for certain ordinary losses) for the
one-year period ending October 31 of the calendar year, and (3) any ordinary
income and capital gains for previous years that were not distributed or taxed
during those years. To prevent application of the excise tax, your Portfolio
intends to make its distributions in accordance with the calendar year
distribution requirement. Further, if your Portfolio retains any net capital
gain, your Portfolio may designate the retained amount as undistributed capital
gains in a notice to Unitholders who, if subject to federal income tax on
long-term capital gains (i) will be required to include in income for federal
income tax purposes, as long-term capital gain, their share of such
undistributed amount, and (ii) will be entitled to credit their proportionate
share of the tax paid by the Portfolio against their federal income tax
liabilities, if any, and to claim refunds to the extent the credit exceeds such
liabilities. A distribution will be treated as paid on December 31 of the
current calendar year if it is declared by your Portfolio in October, November
or December with a record date in such a month and paid by the Portfolio during
January of the following calendar year. These distributions will be taxable to
Unitholders in the calendar year in which the distributions are declared,
rather than the calendar year in which the distributions are received.


If a Portfolio failed to qualify as a regulated investment company or failed
to satisfy the 90% distribution requirement in any taxable year, the Portfolio
would be taxed as an ordinary corporation on its taxable income (even if such
income were distributed to its Unitholders) and all distributions out of
earnings and profits would be taxable to Unitholders as ordinary dividend
income.


Your Portfolio may be required to withhold as backup withholding federal
income tax at the backup withholding rate (currently 28%) on all taxable
distributions payable to you if you fail to provide your correct taxpayer
identification number or to make required certifications, or if the IRS
indicates that you are subject to backup withholding. Backup withholding is not
an additional tax. Any amounts withheld may be credited against your federal
income tax liability if you provide the required information or certification.


If a Portfolio is treated as holding directly or indirectly 10 percent or
more of the combined voting power of the stock of a foreign corporation, and
all U.S. shareholders collectively own more than 50 percent of the vote or
value of the stock of such corporation, the foreign corporation may be treated
as a "controlled foreign corporation" (a "CFC") for U.S. federal income tax
purposes. In such circumstances, a Portfolio will be required to include
certain types of passive income and certain other types of income relating to
insurance, sales and services with related parties and oil related income in
the Portfolio's taxable income whether or not such income is distributed.


If a Portfolio holds an equity interest in any "passive foreign investment
companies" ("PFICs"), which are generally certain foreign corporations that
receive at least 75% of their annual gross income from passive sources (such as
interest, dividends, certain rents and royalties or capital gains) or that hold
at least 50% of their assets in investments producing such passive income, the
Portfolio could be subject to U.S. federal income tax and additional interest
charges on gains and certain distributions with respect to those equity
interests, even if all the income or gain is timely distributed to its
Unitholders. A Portfolio will not be able to pass through to its Unitholders
any credit or deduction for such taxes. A Portfolio may be able to make an
election that could ameliorate these adverse tax consequences. In this case, a
Portfolio would recognize as ordinary income any increase in the value of such
PFIC shares, and as ordinary loss any decrease in such value to the extent it
did not exceed prior increases included in income. Under this election, a
Portfolio might be required to recognize in a year income in excess of its
distributions from PFICs and its proceeds from dispositions of PFIC stock
during that year, and such income would nevertheless be subject to the
distribution requirement and would be taken into account for purposes of the 4%
excise tax (described above). Dividends paid by PFICs will not be treated as
qualified dividend income.



PORTFOLIO TERMINATION



A Portfolio may be liquidated at any time by consent of Unitholders
representing 66 2/3% of the Units of such Portfolio then outstanding or by the
Trustee when the value of the Securities owned by a Portfolio, as shown by any
evaluation, is less than $500,000 ($3,000,000 if the value of the Portfolio has
exceeded $15,000,000). A Portfolio will be liquidated by the Trustee in the
event that a sufficient number of Units of such Portfolio not yet sold are
tendered for redemption by the Sponsor, so that the net worth of such Portfolio
would be reduced to less than 40% of the value of the Securities at the time
they were deposited in such Portfolio. If a Portfolio is liquidated because of
the redemption of unsold Units by the Sponsor, the Sponsor will refund to each
purchaser of Units the entire sales charge paid by such purchaser. The Trust
Agreement will terminate upon the sale or other disposition of the last
Security held thereunder, but in no event will it continue beyond the Mandatory
Termination Date.


Commencing during the period beginning nine business days prior to, and no
later than, the Mandatory Termination Date, Securities will begin to be sold in
connection with the termination of the Portfolios. The Sponsor will determine
the manner, timing and execution of the sales of the Securities. The Sponsor
shall direct the liquidation of the Securities in such manner as to effectuate
orderly sales and a minimal market impact. In the event the Sponsor does not so
direct, the Securities shall be sold within a reasonable period and in such
manner as the Trustee, in its sole discretion, shall determine. Unitholders who
do not elect the Rollover Option will receive a cash distribution from the sale
of the remaining Securities within a reasonable time following the Mandatory
Termination Date. The Trustee will deduct from the funds of the appropriate
Portfolio any accrued costs, expenses, advances or indemnities provided by the
Trust Agreement, including estimated compensation of the Trustee, costs of
liquidation and any amounts required as a reserve to provide for payment of any
applicable taxes or other governmental charges. Any sale of Securities in a
Portfolio upon termination may result in a lower amount than might otherwise be
realized if such sale were not required at such time. The Trustee will then
distribute to each Unitholder of each Portfolio his pro rata share of the
balance of the Income and Capital Accounts of such Portfolio.


The Sponsor may, but is not obligated to, offer for sale units of a
subsequent series of the Portfolios pursuant to the Rollover Option. There is,
however, no assurance that units of any new series of the Portfolios will be
offered for sale at that time, or if offered, that there will be sufficient
units available for sale to meet the requests of any or all Unitholders.


Within 60 days of the final distribution Unitholders will be furnished a
final distribution statement of the amount distributable. At such time as the
Trustee in its sole discretion will determine that any amounts held in reserve
are no longer necessary, it will make distribution thereof to Unitholders in
the same manner.

Re: Invesco Unit Trusts, Series 1293 (the "Trust")




Ladies and Gentlemen:


We have acted as counsel for Invesco Capital Markets, Inc. as depositor and
sponsor (the "Depositor") of the Trust in connection with the deposit of
securities therein pursuant to the Indenture referred to below, by which the
Trust was created and under which the units of fractional undivided interest
(collectively, the "Units") have been issued. Pursuant to the Indenture, the
Depositor has transferred to the Trust either cash together with instructions
for the Trustee to purchase certain securities, or certain securities and
contracts or delivery statements relating to contracts to purchase certain
securities together with irrevocable letters of credit to be held by the Trustee
upon the terms and conditions set forth in the Indenture. (All securities to be
acquired by the Trust are collectively referred to as the "Securities.")


In connection with our representation, we have examined the originals or
certified copies of the following documents relating to the creation of the
Trust, the deposit of the Securities and the issuance and sale of the Units: (a)
the Standard Terms and Conditions of Trust For Invesco Unit Trusts, Effective
for Unit Investment Trusts Established On and After December 6, 2012 (Including
Invesco Unit Trusts, Series 1281 and Subsequent Series), and the Trust Agreement
of even date herewith relating to the Trust (collectively, the "Indenture")
among the Depositor, Invesco Investment Advisers LLC, as supervisor, and The
Bank of New York Mellon, as trustee (the "Trustee"); (b) the Closing Memorandum
relating to the deposit of the Securities in the Trust, which includes
certification by an authorized officer of the Depositor with respect to certain
factual matters contained therein ("Officer's Certification"); (c) the
Notification of Registration on Form N-8A and the Registration Statements on
Form N-8B-2, as amended, relating to the Trust, as filed with the Securities and
Exchange Commission (the "Commission") pursuant to the Investment Company Act of
1940, as amended (the "1940 Act"); (d) the Registration Statement on Form S-6
(Registration No. 333-184864) filed with the Commission pursuant to the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "1933 Act"), and all Amendments thereto
(said Registration Statement, as amended by said Amendment(s) being herein
called the "Registration Statement"); (e) the proposed form of final prospectus
(the "Prospectus") relating to the Units, which is expected to be filed with the
Commission this day; (f) the Certificate of Incorporation and By-Laws of the
Depositor, as amended, each certified to by an authorized officer of the
Depositor; and (g) certificates or telegrams of public officials as to matters
set forth upon therein.


We have assumed the genuineness of all agreements, instruments and documents
submitted to us as originals and the conformity to originals of all copies
thereof submitted to us. We have also assumed the genuineness of all signatures
and the legal capacity of all persons executing agreements, instruments and
documents examined or relied upon by us.


Where matters are stated to be "to the best of our knowledge" or "known to us,"
our knowledge is limited to the actual knowledge of those attorneys in our
office who have performed services for the Trust, their review of documents
provided to us by the Depositor in connection with this engagement and inquiries
of officers of the Depositor, the results of which are reflected in the
Officer's Certification. We have not independently verified the accuracy of the
matters set forth in the written statements or certificates upon which we have
relied. We have not reviewed the financial statements, compilation of the
Securities held by the Trust, or other financial or statistical data contained
in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus, as to which we understand you
have been furnished with the reports of the accountants appearing in the
Registration Statement and the Prospectus. In addition, we have made no specific
inquiry as to whether any stop order or investigatory proceedings have been
commenced with respect to the Registration Statement or the Depositor nor have
we reviewed court or governmental agency dockets.


Statements in this opinion as to the validity, binding effect and enforceability
of agreements, instruments and documents are subject: (i) to limitations as to
enforceability imposed by bankruptcy, reorganization, moratorium, insolvency and
other laws of general application relating to or affecting the enforceability of
creditors' rights, and (ii) to limitations under equitable principles governing
the availability of equitable remedies.


We are not admitted to the practice of law in any jurisdiction but the State of
New York and we do not hold ourselves out as experts in or express any opinion
as to the laws of other states or jurisdictions except as to matters of federal
law. No opinion is expressed as to the effect that the law of any other
jurisdiction might have upon the subject matter of the opinions expressed herein
under applicable conflicts of law principles, rules or regulations or otherwise.
Based on and subject to the foregoing, we are of the opinion that:


(1)  The Indenture has been duly authorized and executed and delivered by
an authorized officer of the Depositor and is a valid and binding
obligation of the Depositor in accordance with its terms.


(2)  The registration of Units on the registration books of the Trust by
the Trustee has been duly authorized by the Depositor in accordance
with the provisions of the Indenture and issued for the consideration
contemplated therein, the Units will constitute fractional undivided
interests in the Trust, will be entitled to the benefits of the
Indenture, and will conform in all material respects to the
description thereof contained in the Prospectus. Upon payment of the
consideration for the Units as provided in the Indenture and the
Registration Statement, the Units will be validly issued, fully paid
and non-assessable by the Trust.


We hereby consent to the filing of this opinion as an exhibit to the
Registration Statement and to the use of our name in the Registration Statement
and in the related Prospectus. This opinion is intended solely for the benefit
of the addressee in connection with the issuance of the Units of the Trust and
may not be relied upon in any other manner or by any other person without our
express written consent.


Very truly yours,

Re:      Invesco Unit Trusts, Series 1293


Ladies and Gentlemen:


We have acted as counsel for Invesco Unit Trusts, Series 1293 (the "Fund"), in
connection with the issuance of units of fractional undivided interest in the
Fund (the "Units"), under a trust agreement dated January 2, 2013 (the
"Indenture"), among Invesco Capital Markets, Inc., as depositor (the
"Depositor"), Invesco Investment Advisers LLC, as supervisor, and The Bank of
New York Mellon, as trustee (the "Trustee"). The Fund is comprised of the
following unit investment trusts: EAFE Select 20 Portfolio 2013-1, Select 5
Industrial Portfolio 2013-1, The Dow Jones Select Dividend Index Strategy
Portfolio 2013-1, Select S&P Core Portfolio 2013-1, Select S&P Industrial
Portfolio 2013-1, Select 10 Industrial Portfolio 2013-1 (each, a "Trust" and
collectively, the "Trusts") and Global 45 Dividend Strategy Portfolio 2013-1.
This opinion relates only to the Trusts. Holders of units of beneficial
interests in the Trusts are referred to herein as the "Unitholders".


In this connection, we have examined the registration statement and the
prospectus for the Fund (the "Prospectus"), the Indenture, and such other
instruments and documents, as we have deemed pertinent and which are listed on
Exhibit A hereto (the "Transaction Documents"). For purposes of this opinion, we
have assumed that each Trust will at all times be operated in accordance with
the Indenture and the Prospectus and the other Transaction Documents and that
the parties to the Indenture will at all times fully comply with the terms of
the Indenture. Failure to operate a Trust at all times in accordance with the
Indenture, the Prospectus, and/or any other Transaction Documents, or failure to
comply fully at all times with the terms of the Indenture, the Prospectus,
and/or any other Transaction Documents, could result in tax treatment different
from that described below.


You have informed us, and we are assuming for purposes of the opinion rendered
herein, that the assets of each Trust will consist of a portfolio as set forth
in the Prospectus. All the assets of a Trust will constitute the "Trust Assets"
of such Trust. You have not requested us to examine, and accordingly we have not
examined, any of the Trust Assets and express no opinion as to the federal,
state, or local tax treatment thereof.


The Transaction Documents include certain representations by the Depositor and
the Trustee with respect to which we have no independent knowledge and have done
no independent investigation. We have assumed for purposes of the opinion
rendered herein, and such opinion is subject to, the accuracy of such
representations. Such representations include, without limitation, that (i) a
Trust will acquire and hold the Trust Assets solely for the account of the
Unitholders, and (ii) the activities of a Trust will consist of the investment
of funds in the Trust Assets, the collection of the income and proceeds from
such investments, and the incidental replacement of Trust Assets and temporary
reinvestment of proceeds under limited and specified circumstances. In addition,
we have assumed for purposes of the opinion rendered herein that each Trust has
not and will not (i) establish an office, (ii) hire employees, or (iii) conduct
any acts not permitted by the Indenture.


Based on the foregoing and assuming the current and continued satisfaction and
accuracy of the aforementioned representations and assumptions, and based upon
an investigation of such matters of law as we consider to be applicable, we are
of the opinion that:


1.   Each Trust is not an association taxable as a corporation for federal
income tax purposes, and income received by each Trust will be treated
as income of the Unitholders in the manner set forth below.


2.   Each Unitholder will be considered the owner of a pro rata portion of
each Security in each Trust under the grantor trust rules of Sections
671-679 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code").
A taxable event will generally occur with respect to each Unitholder
when a Trust disposes of a Security (whether by sale, exchange or
redemption) or upon the sale, exchange or redemption of Units by such
Unitholder. A Unitholder should determine its tax cost for each
Security represented by its Units by allocating the total cost for its
Units, including the sales charge, among the Securities in the Trust
in which it holds Units (in proportion to the fair market values of
those Securities on the date the Unitholder purchases its Units).


3.   A Unitholder will be considered to have received all of the dividends
paid on its pro rata portion of each Security when such dividends are
received by a Trust even if the Unitholder does not actually receive
such distributions in the year received by the Trust, including if the
Unitholder reinvests its dividend distributions pursuant to the
Reinvestment Plan. An individual Unitholder who itemizes deductions
will be entitled to deduct its pro rata share of fees and expenses
paid by the Trust, but only to the extent that this amount together
with the Unitholder's other miscellaneous itemized deductions exceeds
2% of its adjusted gross income. The deduction of fees and expenses is
subject to limitations for individuals with incomes in excess of
certain thresholds.


4.   Under the income tax laws of the State and City of New York, each
Trust is not an association taxable as a corporation and is not
subject to the New York Franchise Tax on Business Corporations or the
New York City General Corporation Tax. For a Unitholder who is a New
York resident, however, a pro rata portion of the income of each Trust
will be treated as income of the Unitholder under the income tax laws
of the State and City of New York. Similar treatment may apply in
other states.


Our opinion is based on the Code, the New York State Tax Law, the Administrative
Code of the City of New York, the regulations promulgated thereunder and other
relevant authorities and law, all as in effect on the date hereof. Consequently,
future changes in such law, the regulations promulgated thereunder and other
relevant authorities and law may cause the tax treatment of the transaction to
be materially different from that described above. This opinion is given as of
the date hereof, and we undertake no, and hereby disclaim any, obligation to
advise you of any change in any matter set forth herein. Our opinion represents
only our legal judgment, is not a guarantee of a result and, unlike a tax
ruling, is binding neither on the Internal Revenue Service, the New York State
or New York City taxing authorities, nor a court of law, and has no official
status of any kind. The Internal Revenue Service, the New York State or New York
City taxing authorities or a court of law could disagree with the opinion
expressed herein.


This opinion, as qualified herein, covers only the opinions expressly contained
herein, and we express no opinion with respect to any other considerations which
may arise relating to the transaction, any other taxes or any other matters
arising under United States federal, state, local or foreign law.


Paul Hastings LLP does not and will not impose any limitation on the disclosure
of the tax treatment or tax structure of any transaction relating to this
matter.


Very truly yours,



PAUL HASTINGS LLP

Ladies and Gentlemen:


We are acting as your counsel in connection with the execution and delivery
by you of a certain trust agreement, dated as of today (the "Indenture"), among
Invesco Capital Markets, Inc., as depositor (the "Depositor"), Invesco
Investment Advisers LLC, as supervisor (the "Supervisor"), and you, as Trustee,
establishing Invesco Unit Trusts, Series 1293 (the "Fund"), consisting of EAFE
Select 20 Portfolio 2013-1, The Dow Jones Select Dividend Index Strategy
Portfolio 2013-1, Select 5 Industrial Portfolio 2013-1, Select S&P Industrial
Portfolio 2013-1, Select S&P Core Portfolio 2013-1, Global 45 Dividend Strategy
Portfolio 2013-1 and Select 10 Industrial Portfolio 2013-1 (each, a "Trust" and
collectively, the "Trusts"), and the registration by you, as Trustee on the
registration books of each Trust, of ownership of all of the units of fractional
undivided interests ("Units") in the Trusts, as set forth in the prospectus,
dated today, for filing as an amendment to the registration statement heretofore
filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission under the Securities Act of
1933, as amended (respectively the "Prospectus" and the "Registration
Statement"), relating to the Fund (File Number 333-184864). Each Trust consists
of the securities set forth in the Prospectus (including delivery statements
relating to contracts for the purchase of certain securities not yet delivered
and cash, cash equivalents, an irrevocable letter of credit, or a combination
thereof, in the amount required to pay for such purchase upon the receipt of
such securities) defined in the Indenture as "Securities" and listed in Schedule
A to the Indenture (such securities, delivery statements and cash, cash
equivalents or letter of credit being herein called the "Underlying
Securities").


We have examined the Indenture and originals (or copies certified or
otherwise identified to our satisfaction) of such other instruments,
certificates and documents, as we have deemed necessary or appropriate for the
purpose of rendering this opinion letter. In such examination, we have assumed
the genuineness of all signatures, the authenticity of all documents submitted
to us as originals and the conformity to the original documents of all documents
submitted to us as copies. As to any facts material to this opinion letter, we
have, when relevant facts were not independently established, relied upon the
aforesaid instruments, certificates and documents.


Based on the foregoing, we are of the opinion that:


1.   The Bank of New York Mellon is a corporation organized under the laws
of the State of New York with the powers of a trust company under the
Banking Law of the State of New York.


2.   The execution of the Indenture is within the authorization of the
executing officers of The Bank of New York Mellon.


3.   The Indenture is in proper form for execution and delivery by you as
Trustee.


4.   Upon receipt by you of the Underlying Securities you may properly
register the units on the registration books of each Trust in the name
of Cede & Co., as nominee of Depository Trust Company ("DTC"). Upon
receipt of advice of the effectiveness of the Registration Statement,
you may cause the Units to be credited to, or upon the order of, the
Depositor, as provided in the Closing Memorandum being executed and
delivered today by the parties to the Indenture.


5.   You as Trustee may lawfully, under the Banking Law of the State of New
York, advance to a Trust such amounts as may be necessary to provide
periodic distributions or payment of expenses for a Trust, and be
reimbursed without interest for any such advances from funds in the
income or capital account for a Trust on the ensuing record date or as
otherwise provided in the Indenture.


In rendering the foregoing opinions we have not considered, among other
things, the merchantability of the Underlying Securities, whether the Underlying
Securities have been duly authorized and delivered and are fully paid for and
non-assessable or the tax status of the Underlying Securities under any federal,
state or local laws.


The foregoing opinions are limited to the laws of the State of New York and
the federal laws of the United States of America.


We hereby consent to the filing of this opinion letter as an exhibit to the
Registration Statement and to the use of our name and the reference to our firm
in the Registration Statement and in the Prospectus.


Very truly yours,

Quality Municipal Income Trust, 20+ Year (QUAL0196)
	
	




Objective
Take advantage of federal tax-exempt investments through a convenient and efficient way of purchasing a professionally selected and diversified portfolio of quality municipal bonds. The Trust is a long-term portfolio1 that offers tax-exempt federal income with the potential for a higher yield than a portfolio holding insured municipal bonds. The bonds in the portfolio are generally not insured, and, if rated, have credit ratings of at least A- by Standard & Poor's or at least A3 by Moody's as of the deposit date.2 The Trust seeks to provide federal tax-exempt income3 and to preserve capital. The Trust invests in a portfolio of tax-exempt municipal bonds. 




1 Due to the nature of municipal bonds, there is a risk that a bond may be called before maturity, potentially below it's par value, and investors may be unable to reinvest their principal at the same rate of return.
2 Each bond’s rating may change after its inclusion in the Trust. 
3 A portion of your interest income may be subject to state or local taxes.
Diversification does not ensure a profit or eliminate the risk of loss.

1Estimated current return (ECR) is based on the estimated annual income as a percentage of the current price of the units. Estimated long-term return (ELTR) is calculated using a formula which (1) takes into consideration and determines and factors in the relative weightings of the market values, yields (which takes into account the amortization of premiums and the accretion of discounts) and estimated retirement of all the bonds in the trust and (2) takes into account the expenses and sales charge associated with each trust unit. There can be no assurance that either the estimated current return or ELTR will be realized in the future and an investor's units, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost.
2The ELTR life represents the estimated life of the bonds in a Trust's portfolio determined for the purposes of calculating Estimated Long-Term Return.
3Estimated Annual Income Per Unit is as of close the most recent business day and is based on the estimated cash flows per unit. This amount will vary with changes in expenses, interest rates and the maturity, call or sale of bonds.
4Estimated Daily Rate of Accrual represents the annual interest from the securities within the portfolio divided by the number of days on which interest is calculated annually.
5Represents the principal amount of the underlying bonds per unit. Bonds may be sold to meet redemptions, to pay expenses, and in other limited circumstances. The sale of bonds will affect the principal amount of bonds included in the trust and as a result the principal amount of bonds per unit. There can be no assurance that a unitholder will receive this par value per unit in the future.


For Fixed-Income trusts, "S.F." indicates a sinking fund is established with respect to an issue of bonds.The trust portfolio is provided for informational purposes only and should not be deemed as a recommendation to buy or sell the individual securities shown above.



 Important Information About Benchmarks





About risk



There is no assurance that a unit investment trust will achieve its investment objective. An investment in this unit trust is subject to market risk, which is the possibility that the market values of securities owned by the trust will decline and that the value of trust units may therefore be less than what you paid for them. This trust is unmanaged. Accordingly, you can lose money investing in this trust. 
An investment in a trust should be made with an understanding of the risks associated therewith, such as the inability of the issuer or an insurer to pay the principal of or interest on a bond when due, volatile interest rates, early call provisions and changes to the tax status of the bonds.
The financial condition of an issuer may worsen or its credit ratings may drop, resulting in a reduction in the value of your Units. This may occur at any point in time, including during the primary offering period.
The value of the bonds will generally fall if interest rates, in general, rise. Given the historically low interest rate environment in the U.S., risks associated with rising rates are heightened. The negative impact on fixed income securities from any interest rate increases could be swift and significant. No one can predict whether interest rates will rise or fall in the future.
A portion of your interest may be subject to state and local taxes.
A credit rating is an assessment provided by a nationally recognized statistical rating organization (NRSRO) of the creditworthiness of an issuer with respect to debt obligations, including specific securities, money market instruments or other debts. Ratings are measured on a scale that generally ranges from AAA/Aaa (highest) to D/C (lowest); ratings are subject to change without notice. For more information on Standard and Poor's rating methodology, please visit www.standardandpoors.com and select "Understanding Ratings" under Rating Resources on the homepage or Moody's at www.moodys.com and select "Rating Methodologies" under Research and Ratings on the homepage.
Please see the information supplement for a discussion of situations in which the Trust may designate previously distributed interest income during the year as taxable net capital gain in order to satisfy certain of the annual distribution requirements for regulated investment companies.
Invesco and its representatives do not provide tax advice. Individuals should consult their personal tax advisors before making any tax-related investment decisions.

1The S&P and Moody's ratings apply to the bonds held by the trust, and not the trust itself.   A Standard & Poor's credit rating is a current opinion of the creditworthiness of an obligor with respect to a specific debt obligation. This opinion of creditworthiness may take into consideration the creditworthiness of guarantors, insurers or other forms of credit enhancement on the obligation.  Moody's municipal ratings are opinions of the investment quality of the issues and issues in the US municipal and tax-exempt markets. As such, these ratings incorporate Moody's assessment of the default probability and loss severity of these issuers and issues.


1Estimated current return (ECR) is based on the estimated annual income as a percentage of the current price of the units. Estimated long-term return (ELTR) is calculated using a formula which (1) takes into consideration and determines and factors in the relative weightings of the market values, yields (which takes into account the amortization of premiums and the accretion of discounts) and estimated retirement of all the bonds in the trust and (2) takes into account the expenses and sales charge associated with each trust unit. There can be no assurance that either the estimated current return or ELTR will be realized in the future and an investor's units, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost.
2The ELTR life represents the estimated life of the bonds in a Trust's portfolio determined for the purposes of calculating Estimated Long-Term Return.
3Estimated Annual Income Per Unit is as of close the most recent business day and is based on the estimated cash flows per unit. This amount will vary with changes in expenses, interest rates and the maturity, call or sale of bonds.
4Estimated Daily Rate of Accrual represents the annual interest from the securities within the portfolio divided by the number of days on which interest is calculated annually.
5Represents the principal amount of the underlying bonds per unit. Bonds may be sold to meet redemptions, to pay expenses, and in other limited circumstances. The sale of bonds will affect the principal amount of bonds included in the trust and as a result the principal amount of bonds per unit. There can be no assurance that a unitholder will receive this par value per unit in the future.


For Fixed-Income trusts, "S.F." indicates a sinking fund is established with respect to an issue of bonds.The trust portfolio is provided for informational purposes only and should not be deemed as a recommendation to buy or sell the individual securities shown above.



 Important Information About Benchmarks





About risk



There is no assurance that a unit investment trust will achieve its investment objective. An investment in this unit trust is subject to market risk, which is the possibility that the market values of securities owned by the trust will decline and that the value of trust units may therefore be less than what you paid for them. This trust is unmanaged. Accordingly, you can lose money investing in this trust. 
An investment in a trust should be made with an understanding of the risks associated therewith, such as the inability of the issuer or an insurer to pay the principal of or interest on a bond when due, volatile interest rates, early call provisions and changes to the tax status of the bonds.
The financial condition of an issuer may worsen or its credit ratings may drop, resulting in a reduction in the value of your Units. This may occur at any point in time, including during the primary offering period.
The value of the bonds will generally fall if interest rates, in general, rise. Given the historically low interest rate environment in the U.S., risks associated with rising rates are heightened. The negative impact on fixed income securities from any interest rate increases could be swift and significant. No one can predict whether interest rates will rise or fall in the future.
A portion of your interest may be subject to state and local taxes.
A credit rating is an assessment provided by a nationally recognized statistical rating organization (NRSRO) of the creditworthiness of an issuer with respect to debt obligations, including specific securities, money market instruments or other debts. Ratings are measured on a scale that generally ranges from AAA/Aaa (highest) to D/C (lowest); ratings are subject to change without notice. For more information on Standard and Poor's rating methodology, please visit www.standardandpoors.com and select "Understanding Ratings" under Rating Resources on the homepage or Moody's at www.moodys.com and select "Rating Methodologies" under Research and Ratings on the homepage.
Please see the information supplement for a discussion of situations in which the Trust may designate previously distributed interest income during the year as taxable net capital gain in order to satisfy certain of the annual distribution requirements for regulated investment companies.
Invesco and its representatives do not provide tax advice. Individuals should consult their personal tax advisors before making any tax-related investment decisions.

LIQUIDATION PRICE  Represents the value per unit that a unitholder would receive if the unitholder redeemed or sold units. This price is equal to the net asset value per unit plus any remaining organization costs and creation and development fee. This price reflects any remaining deferred sales charges payable in connection with a liquidation of units.
OFFER PRICE Represents the net asset value per unit plus any applicable organization costs and sales charges. This is the regular public offering price per unit paid to purchase units. This price is often subject to certain sales charge discounts described in a trust prospectus.

The performance data quoted for the individual series of a trust that has not terminated or has an open termination date is from the deposit date through the current date quoted. For individual series that have terminated, performance data quoted is from the deposit date through the termination date.Performance data quoted represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results. Investment returns and principal value will fluctuate and units, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost.
Returns are cumulative total returns (not annualized) unless labeled as average annual total returns. All returns reflect trust expenses as incurred and assume reinvestment of income and principal distributions, except for trusts that do not offer the option of reinvesting distributions into additional trust units. Please see the related trust prospectus for additional information. Returns do not reflect taxes.
A trust's performance, especially for short time periods, should not be the sole factor in making your investment decision. Please keep in mind that high, double-digit returns are highly unusual and cannot be sustained. Investors should also be aware that these returns were primarily achieved during favorable market conditions.
Returns With Sales Charge reflect the maximum sales charge that would be payable by an investor upon sale or redemption of units at the end of the applicable period(s). The sales charge includes any initial or deferred sales charges other than creation and development fee.

1Estimated current return (ECR) is based on the estimated annual income as a percentage of the current price of the units. Estimated long-term return (ELTR) is calculated using a formula which (1) takes into consideration and determines and factors in the relative weightings of the market values, yields (which takes into account the amortization of premiums and the accretion of discounts) and estimated retirement of all the bonds in the trust and (2) takes into account the expenses and sales charge associated with each trust unit. There can be no assurance that either the estimated current return or ELTR will be realized in the future and an investor's units, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost.
2The ELTR life represents the estimated life of the bonds in a Trust's portfolio determined for the purposes of calculating Estimated Long-Term Return.
3Estimated Annual Income Per Unit is as of close the most recent business day and is based on the estimated cash flows per unit. This amount will vary with changes in expenses, interest rates and the maturity, call or sale of bonds.
4Estimated Daily Rate of Accrual represents the annual interest from the securities within the portfolio divided by the number of days on which interest is calculated annually.
5Represents the principal amount of the underlying bonds per unit. Bonds may be sold to meet redemptions, to pay expenses, and in other limited circumstances. The sale of bonds will affect the principal amount of bonds included in the trust and as a result the principal amount of bonds per unit. There can be no assurance that a unitholder will receive this par value per unit in the future.

There is no assurance that a unit investment trust will achieve its investment objective. An investment in this unit trust is subject to market risk, which is the possibility that the market values of securities owned by the trust will decline and that the value of trust units may therefore be less than what you paid for them. This trust is unmanaged. Accordingly, you can lose money investing in this trust. 
An investment in a trust should be made with an understanding of the risks associated therewith, such as the inability of the issuer or an insurer to pay the principal of or interest on a bond when due, volatile interest rates, early call provisions and changes to the tax status of the bonds.
The financial condition of an issuer may worsen or its credit ratings may drop, resulting in a reduction in the value of your Units. This may occur at any point in time, including during the primary offering period.
The value of the bonds will generally fall if interest rates, in general, rise. Given the historically low interest rate environment in the U.S., risks associated with rising rates are heightened. The negative impact on fixed income securities from any interest rate increases could be swift and significant. No one can predict whether interest rates will rise or fall in the future.
A portion of your interest may be subject to state and local taxes.
A credit rating is an assessment provided by a nationally recognized statistical rating organization (NRSRO) of the creditworthiness of an issuer with respect to debt obligations, including specific securities, money market instruments or other debts. Ratings are measured on a scale that generally ranges from AAA/Aaa (highest) to D/C (lowest); ratings are subject to change without notice. For more information on Standard and Poor's rating methodology, please visit www.standardandpoors.com and select "Understanding Ratings" under Rating Resources on the homepage or Moody's at www.moodys.com and select "Rating Methodologies" under Research and Ratings on the homepage.
Please see the information supplement for a discussion of situations in which the Trust may designate previously distributed interest income during the year as taxable net capital gain in order to satisfy certain of the annual distribution requirements for regulated investment companies.
