Annualized rate of 7.35% based on VII Peaks-KBR Co-Optivist Income BDC II's current $10.00 per share public offering price. 


    
    REDWOOD CITY, CA, August 01, 2012 /24-7PressRelease/ -- The Board of Directors of VII Peaks-KBR Co-Optivist Income BDC II, Inc. declared its first two regular semi-monthly distributions of $0.0306250 per share each (an annualized rate of 7.35% based on VII Peaks-KBR Co-Optivist Income BDC II's current $10.00 per share public offering price) on July 30, 2012. The distributions will be paid on August 17, 2012 and August 31, 2012 to stockholders of record on July 30, 2012.

About VII Peaks-KBR Co-Optivist Income BDC II

VII Peaks-KBR Co-OptivistTM Income BDC II, Inc. (the "Company") is a publicly registered non-traded business development company (BDC) that intends to primarily invest in discounted traded corporate debt securities of public and private companies that have solid business fundamentals and business prospects, including historical revenue growth, positive cash flow and sufficient asset coverage, but also a perceived risk of near term liquidity issues based on their maturing debt.

The Company anticipates providing regular distributions to investors from income generated by our investments in debt securities, while actively working with the target company's management to restructure the underlying debt to generate potential event-driven upside.

The Company will employ VII Peaks Capital's proprietary Co-OptivistTM ("cooperative activism") approach in executing its investment strategy. The BDC intends to utilize this strategy to acquire principal positions in corporate debt of target companies with the goal of restructuring the underlying debt to de-lever the balance sheets and improve the overall liquidity of the target companies. The Co-Optivist approach includes proactively engaging the target company's management team on average 24 months prior to a redemption event.

The Company seeks to raise up to $750 million in capital from the issuance of common stock through a best efforts, continuous public offering with KBR Capital Markets, LLC, member FINRA/SIPC, serving as the dealer-manager.

A registration statement relating to the common stock of VII Peaks-KBR Co-Optivist Income BDC II, Inc. was filed with and has been declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission. These securities have not been approved or disapproved by the Securities and Exchange Commission or any state securities commission, nor have they passed upon the accuracy or adequacy of the prospectus. The offering of the Company's common stock is being made solely by means of a written prospectus forming part of the effective registration statement. The prospectus, which is available at www.sec.gov or may be obtained by calling 1-877-700-0527, contains additional information about the Company. The prospectus should be read carefully by an investor before investing. Investors are advised to consider the investment objective, risks, charges and expenses of the Company carefully before investing. Available only in states where registration is effective.

Past performance may not be indicative of future results.

Certain Information About Distributions

The determination of the tax attributes of the distributions will be made annually as of the end of the Company's fiscal year based upon its taxable income and distributions paid, in each case, for the full year. Therefore, a determination as to the tax attributes of the distributions made on a quarterly basis may not be representative of the actual tax attributes for a full year. The Company intends to update stockholders quarterly with an estimated percentage of its distributions that resulted from taxable ordinary income. The actual tax characteristics of distributions to stockholders will be reported to stockholders annually on a Form 1099-DIV. The payment of future distributions on the Company's common stock is subject to the discretion of the Board of Directors and applicable legal restrictions, and therefore, there can be no assurance as to the amount or timing of any such future distributions.

This press release may contain certain forward-looking statements, including statements with regard to the future performance of the Company. Words such as "believes," "expects," "projects," and "future" or similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are subject to the inherent uncertainties in predicting future results and conditions. Certain factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in these forward-looking statements, and some of these factors are enumerated in the filings the Company makes with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

	VII PEAKS-KBR CO-OPTIVIST INCOME BDC II, INC.






	  

	NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS




	June 30, 2012




	 




	(Unaudited)



	 


	 



	Note 1.  Nature of Operations



	 


	VII Peaks-KBR Co-Optivist
	Income BDC II, Inc. (the “Fund”), a Maryland corporation formed on August 3, 2011, is an externally managed, non-diversified
	closed-end management investment company that has elected to be treated as a business development company (“BDC”) under
	the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “1940 Act”). The Fund intends to elect to be treated for federal
	income tax purposes as a regulated investment company (“RIC”) under subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986,
	as amended (the “Code”). The Fund intends to invest in discounted corporate debt and equity-linked debt securities
	of public and private companies whose securities trade on the secondary loan market for institutional investors.


	 


	On August
	9, 2011, the Fund filed a registration statement on Form N-2 to sell up to 75,000,000 shares of common stock at an
	initial public offering price of $10.00 per share. The registration statement was declared effective by the Securities
	Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on March 1, 2012. The Fund will not commence operations until it is able to raise
	gross offering proceeds of $1,000,000, all of which must be from persons who are not affiliated with the Fund or us or
	VII Peaks-KBR BDC Advisor II, LLC (the “Manager”) by one year from the date the registration statement was
	declared effective by the SEC. Pending satisfaction of this condition, all subscription payments will be placed in an account
	held by the escrow agent, UMB Bank, N.A., in trust for the benefit of the Fund’s subscribers, pending release to the
	Fund. If the Fund does not meet the minimum offering requirement by one year from the date the registration statement was
	declared effective by the SEC, or March 1, 2013, the Fund will promptly return all funds in the escrow account (including
	interest), and will stop offering shares. The Fund achieved the minimum offering requirement on July 10, 2012 and commenced
	operations on such date.


	 


	The Fund has not established
	sources of revenue sufficient to fund the development of business and will rely on future sales of its common stock to provide
	it with sufficient capital to complete its business plan.


	 



	Note 2.  Summary of Significant
	Accounting Policies



	 




	Basis of Presentation




	 




	The financial statements of the Fund included
	herein were prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP")
	for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X.


	Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete financial statements.
	In the opinion of management, these financial statements include all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments
	and accruals, necessary for a fair presentation of the results for the interim period. These financial statements should be read
	in conjunction with the audited financial statements and notes thereto as of December 31, 2011 and for the year then ended, which
	are included in the Fund’s Annual Report on Form N-2/A as filed with the SEC on March 1, 2012.




	 






	Use of Estimates in the Preparation
	of Financial Statements






	 




	The preparation of
	the accompanying financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect
	the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
	statements, and income, gains (losses) and expenses during the period reported. Actual results could differ materially from those
	estimates.




	 







	5










	 










	 



	Note 2.  Summary of Significant
	Accounting Policies (continued)



	 




	Cash and Cash Equivalents




	 


	The Fund considers
	all highly-liquid instruments with an original maturity of three months or less, at date of purchase, to be cash equivalents.


	 


	The Fund’s cash
	and cash equivalents consist of money held in a checking account at one major financial institution, which is insured by the Federal
	Deposit Insurance Corporation (the “FDIC”). As of June 30, 2012 and December 31, 2011, the Fund does not have deposits
	in excess of the deposit insurance. Upon commencement of operations cash concentrations may exceed the FDIC insured amount.


	 




	Organizational Costs




	 


	Organizational costs
	are expensed by the Fund as incurred (see Note 4).



	 





	Offering Costs




	 


	The Fund is a closed-end
	fund with a continuous offering period. Accordingly, the Fund follows the guidance of the Financial Accounting Standards Board
	(“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topics 946 20-25-6 and 946-20-35-5 and offering costs
	are capitalized and will be amortized on a straight-line basis over a period not to exceed twelve months from the date that operations
	commence. As of June 30, 2012 and December 31, 2011, $862,396 and $354,025 of offering costs have been incurred and deferred since
	operations had not yet commenced, respectively (see Note 4).


	 




	U.S. Federal Income Taxes




	 


	The Fund intends to
	elect to be treated for federal income tax purposes as a RIC under subchapter M of the Code and to operate in a manner so as to
	qualify for the tax treatment applicable to RICs. In order to qualify as a RIC, among other things, the Fund is required to annually
	distribute to its stockholders at least 90% of investment company taxable income, as defined by the Code. So long as the Fund maintains
	its status as a RIC, it generally will not pay corporate-level U.S. federal income taxes on any ordinary income or capital gains
	that it distributes at least annually to its stockholders as dividends. Rather, any tax liability related to income earned by the
	Fund represents obligations of the Fund’s investors and will not be reflected in the financial statements of the Fund. The
	Fund will also be subject to nondeductible federal excise taxes if it does not distribute at least 98% of net ordinary income,
	98.2% of capital gain net income, if any, and any recognized and undistributed income from prior years for which it paid no federal
	income taxes.


	 




	New Accounting Pronouncements




	 




	In June 2011, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”)
	No. 2011-05,

	“Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Presentation of Comprehensive Income,”

	that will require a company
	to present components of net income and other comprehensive income in one continuous statement or in two separate, but consecutive
	statements. There are no changes to the components that are recognized in net income or other comprehensive income under current
	GAAP. This guidance is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2011,
	with early adoption permitted. The Fund does not expect the adoption of ASU 2011-05 to have a material effect on its financial
	statements.




	 


	In May 2011, the FASB
	issued ASU No. 2011-04, Amendments to

	Achieve Common Fair Value Measurement
	and Disclosure Requirements

	in GAAP and IFRSs (“ASU 2011-04”), which amends GAAP to conform it with fair value
	measurement and disclosure requirements in International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”).


	 


	The amendments in ASU
	2011-04 change the wording used to describe the requirements in GAAP for measuring fair value and for disclosing information about
	fair value measurements. The amendments in ASU 2011-04 are to be applied prospectively and are effective during interim and annual
	periods beginning after December 15, 2011. As such, the Fund has adopted this ASU and there were no related impacts on its
	financial position or results of operations.

	Note 3. Valuation of Portfolio Investments



	 


	The Fund intends to
	determine the net asset value of its investment portfolio each quarter. Securities that are publicly-traded will be valued at the
	reported closing price on the valuation date. Securities that are not publicly-traded will be valued at fair value as determined
	in good faith by the board of directors. In connection with that determination, the Manager will prepare portfolio company valuations
	using relevant inputs, including, but not limited to, indicative dealer quotes, values of like securities, the most recent portfolio
	company financial statements and forecasts, and valuations prepared by third-party valuation services.


	 


	With respect to investments
	for which market quotations are not readily available, the Fund will undertake a multi-step valuation process each quarter, as
	described below:


	 




	 


	•


	the quarterly valuation process will begin with each portfolio company or investment being initially valued by members of the investment committee, with such valuation taking into account information received from an independent valuation firm, if applicable;




	 




	 


	•


	preliminary valuation conclusions will then be documented and discussed with the members of the board of directors; and




	 




	 


	•


	the board of directors will discuss valuations and will determine the fair value of each investment in the portfolio in good faith based on various statistical and other factors, including the input and recommendation of members of the investment committee and any third-party valuation firm, if applicable.




	 


	Investments will
	be valued utilizing a market approach, an income approach, or both approaches, as appropriate. The market approach uses
	prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets or
	liabilities (including a business). The income approach uses valuation techniques to convert future amounts (for example,
	cash flows or earnings) to a single present value amount (discounted) calculated based on an appropriate discount rate. The
	measurement is based on the net present value indicated by current market expectations about those future amounts. In
	following these approaches, the types of factors that we may take into account in fair value pricing our investments include,
	as relevant: available current market data, including relevant and applicable market trading and transaction comparables,
	applicable market yields and multiples, security covenants, call protection provisions, information rights, the nature and
	realizable value of any collateral, the portfolio company’s ability to make payments, its earnings and discounted cash
	flows, the markets in which the portfolio company does business, comparisons of financial ratios of peer companies that are
	public, mergers and acquisition comparables, the principal market and enterprise values, among other factors.


	 


	The Fund has adopted
	FASB ASC Topic 820,

	Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures

	(formerly Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 157,

	Fair Value Measurements

	), which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with
	generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair value measurements.


	 


	ASC Topic 820 clarifies
	that the exchange price is the price in an orderly transaction between market participants to sell an asset or transfer a liability
	in the market in which the reporting entity would transact for the asset or liability, that is, the principal or most advantageous
	market for the asset or liability. The transaction to sell the asset or transfer the liability is a hypothetical transaction at
	the measurement date, considered from the perspective of market participants. ASC Topic 820 provides a consistent definition of
	fair value which focuses on exit price and prioritizes, within a measurement of fair value, the use of market-based inputs over
	entity-specific inputs. In addition, ASC Topic 820 provides a framework for measuring fair value and establishes a three-level
	hierarchy for fair value measurements based upon the transparency of inputs to the valuation of an asset or liability as of the
	measurement date. The three levels of valuation hierarchy established by ASC Topic 820 are defined as follows:


	 


	Level 1:  Quoted
	prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities, accessible by the Fund at the measurement date.


	 









	7










	 








	 



	Note 3. Valuation of Portfolio Investments
	(continued)



	 


	Level 2:  Quoted
	prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, or quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in
	markets that are not active, or other observable inputs other than quoted prices.


	 


	Level 3:  Unobservable
	inputs for the asset or liability.


	 


	In all cases, the level
	in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement in its entirety falls has been determined based on the lowest
	level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.


	 



	Note 4.  Related Party Transactions



	 




	The Fund is managed by the Manager. The
	Manager is wholly-owned by VII Peaks-KBR, LLC which is a joint venture between VII Peaks Capital, LLC (“VII Peaks”),
	and KBR Capital Advisors, LLC (“KBR”). The Manager has agreed to fund offering costs and organization costs. The Fund
	has recorded $999,246 as due to related party on the Statements of Assets and Liabilities as of June 30, 2012, of which $847,972
	is related to offering costs funded by the Manager and, of which $151,274 is related to organizational costs funded by the Manager.
	The Fund has recorded $454,539 as due to related party on the Statements of Assets and Liabilities as of December 31, 2011, of
	which $354,025 is related to offering costs funded by the Manager and, of which $100,514 is related to organizational costs funded
	by the Manager. The Manager will recover organizational and offering costs funded from offering proceeds to the extent the reimbursement
	would not cause the selling commission, dealer manager fee, accountable due diligence expenses and other organizational and offering
	expenses borne by the Fund to exceed 15% of the gross offering proceeds. To the extent that the Manager is unable to recover these
	costs through offering proceeds, the Fund would be required to reimburse the Manager.




	 


	For the six
	months ended June 30, 2012, the Fund has incurred $4,253 in costs on behalf of the Manager. Accordingly, the Fund has
	recorded $4,253 and $0 as due from related party on the Statement of Assets and Liabilities as of June 30, 2012 and December
	31, 2011, respectively. The June 30, 2012 balance includes insurance premiums paid on behalf of the Manager by the Fund.


	 


	The Manager is
	entitled to a base management and incentive fee as outlined in the Investment Advisory Agreement with the Fund. The
	base management fee is 2% of net assets below $100 million; 1.75% of net assets between $100 million and $250 million; and
	1.5% of net assets over $250 million. The incentive fee has two parts. The first part, the subordinated incentive fee on
	income, is calculated and payable quarterly in arrears based upon the Fund’s “pre-incentive fee net investment
	income” for the immediately preceding quarter. The subordinated incentive fee on income is 20% of pre-incentive net
	investment income subject to a quarterly return to investors, expressed as a rate of return on adjusted capital at the
	beginning of the most recently completed calendar quarter, of 2.0% (8.0% annualized). The second part of the incentive fee,
	the incentive fee on capital gains, is an incentive fee on capital gains earned on liquidated investments from the portfolio
	and is determined and payable in arrears as of the end of each calendar year (or upon termination of the investment advisory
	agreement). This fee equals 20.0% of the Fund’s incentive fee capital gains, which will equal the Fund’s realized
	capital gains on a cumulative basis from inception, calculated as of the end of each calendar year, computed net of all
	realized capital losses and unrealized capital depreciation on a cumulative basis, less the aggregate amount of any
	previously paid capital gains incentive fees. As of June 30, 2012, the Fund had not yet commenced operations and no fees were
	paid to the Manager pursuant to such agreement.


	 


	The Fund has also entered
	into an administration agreement with the Manager under which the Manager provides the Fund with office facilities, equipment and
	clerical, bookkeeping and record keeping services at such facilities and provides or oversees the performance of, the Fund’s
	required administrative services, which include, among other things, being responsible for the financial records which the Fund
	is required to maintain and preparing reports to its stockholders. The Manager is reimbursed amounts based on allocable portion
	of overhead costs under this agreement.

	Note 4.  Related Party Transactions
	(continued)



	 


	The Manager purchased
	111 and 22,222 shares of common stock on August 31, 2011 and December 31, 2011, respectively. These shares were purchased at a
	price of $9.00 per share, which represents the initial public offering price of $10.00 per share, net of selling commission and
	dealer manager fees.


	 


	KBR Capital Markets,
	LLC (the “Dealer Manager”) is an affiliate of KBR, and is a licensed broker-dealer registered with the Financial Industry
	Regulatory Authority (“FINRA”) and serves as the Dealer Manager for the Fund’s public offering of shares of common
	stock. The Dealer Manager receives selling commission of 7% of gross offering proceeds and a dealer manager fee of up to 3%
	of gross offering proceeds, all or a portion of which may be reallowed to selected dealers.


	 





	Note 5.  Subsequent Events



	 


	Management of the Fund
	has evaluated subsequent events in the preparation of the Fund’s financial statements and has determined that no events require
	recognition or disclosure in the financial statements except for the following:


	 




	On June 27, 2012, Joseph
	M. Doncheski, the Fund’s Chief Financial Officer, Secretary and Treasurer tendered his resignation to the Fund’s
	board of directors. Mr. Doncheski’s resignation was effective as of July 3, 2012.


	 


	On July 3, 2012, the
	Fund’s board of directors appointed Cecilia Shea to replace Mr. Doncheski as the Fund’s Chief Financial Officer,
	Secretary and Treasurer. Ms. Shea’s appointment was effective as of July 3, 2012.




	 


	On July 10, 2012, the Fund satisfied
	the minimum offering requirement of raising $1.0 million in offering proceeds from persons not affiliated with the Fund or
	the Manager and admitted the initial public investors as stockholders of the Fund. The Fund commenced operations as of July
	10, 2012. From July 10, 2012 to August 10, 2012, the Fund issued 186,754 shares of common stock for gross proceeds of $1.9
	million. With the proceeds from the Fund’s continuous offering, the Fund purchased a total of eight debt investments with
	an aggregate face value of $1.1 million for $1.1 million in cash. 




	 


	On July 31,
	2012, the Fund declared two semi-monthly distributions of $0.0306250 per share each (an annualized rate of 7.35% based on
	the Fund’s initial public offering price of $10.00 per share) to stockholders of record on July 30, 2012, payable on

	Overview




	 


	We intend to invest
	in discounted corporate debt and equity-linked debt securities of public and private companies whose securities trade on the secondary
	loan market for institutional investors and provide distributions to investors. At the same time, we will actively work with the
	target company’s management to restructure the underlying securities and improve the liquidity position of the target company’s
	balance sheet. We will employ a proprietary “Co-Optivist

	TM

	” approach (“cooperative activism”,
	Co-Optivist

	TM

	is a registered trademark of VII Peaks Capital, LLC, or VII Peaks, and is being used with their permission)
	in executing our investment strategy, which entails proactively engaging the target company management on average 24 months prior
	to a redemption event (typically a put or maturity event) to create an opportunity for growth in the investments. Our strategy
	is not dependent on restructuring to generate distributions.


	 


	Our investment objectives
	are to generate current income and capital appreciation. We intend to meet our investment objectives by: (i) realizing income and
	capital appreciation through the acquisition, management and orderly liquidation of corporate debt securities, (ii) making distributions
	of available distributable cash to our shareholders, and (iii) preserving the capital investments of our shareholders.

	Our proprietary “Co-Optivist

	TM”

	(cooperative activism) approach entails investment in the corporate debt and equity-linked debt securities
	of target companies, or target investments, in conjunction with proactively engaging the target companies’ management. We
	intend to acquire target investments whose debt securities trade on the over-the-counter market for institutional loans at a discount
	to their par redemption value, and will be subject to a “redemption event” within (on average) 24 months. We define
	a “redemption event” as a maturity event or a put event (where investors in the target company’s debt security
	can have a redemption right at a pre-determined price). We intend to hold such debt an average of 12 – 18 months, during
	which time we anticipate working actively with the target company’s management to effect and/or participate in a restructuring
	or exchange of the invested securities for new securities.


	 


	We will make investments
	in target companies that meet our investment criteria. The size of an individual investment will vary based on numerous factors,
	including the amount of funds raised in this offering. However, assuming we raise the maximum offering amount of $750 million,
	we expect to hold at least 50 investments, and we anticipate that the minimum investment size will be approximately $250,000. We
	do not anticipate being heavily invested in any one industry, and generally, we do not expect to invest in more than two different
	classes of debt of the same target company. We intend to invest in debt and equity-linked debt of target companies with a minimum
	enterprise value of $200 million and whose debt and equity-linked debt is actively traded in the secondary loan market. We expect
	our portfolio to be predominantly composed of fixed-rate high-yield and equity-linked corporate debt securities. However, we may
	also purchase senior secured corporate debt securities which may have variable interest rates. We currently anticipate that the
	portion of our portfolio composed of variable rate corporate debt securities, if any, will not exceed 20%, but we may increase
	that to 33% of our aggregate portfolio at the time of any purchase depending on market opportunities.


	 


	We intend to
	offer our shareholders the ability to receive distributions as well as the potential capital appreciation resulting from the
	restructuring of the debt of our target companies. To the extent we have distributable income available we anticipate
	declaring distributions monthly and paying them on a semi-monthly basis. We declared our first two distributions of
	$0.0306250 per share each (an annualized rate of 7.35% based on our initial public offering price of $10.00 per
	share) to shareholders of record as of July 30, 2012, payable on August 17, 2012 and August 31, 2012.


	 


	Between 2001 and 2008,
	corporate debt levels and the supply of leverage offered by banks and other investors steadily increased. We believe a significant
	amount of this debt will be subject to a redemption event prior to 2015. Many of the companies that have outstanding issues of
	such debt have not, or been unable to proactively refinance, creating a “refinancing wall” that we believe will create
	a liquidity shortfall for many issuers. The value of the debt securities of these companies as reflected in prices quoted in the
	secondary loan market, may be at a significant discount to par, and represent a premium yield to maturity reflective of these liquidity
	concerns, creating the opportunity for us to identify and invest in the debt securities of select companies at attractive current
	market valuations. We believe that our Co-Optivist

	TM

	approach can help our target companies achieve results that are
	beneficial to the long-term value of their businesses, which will in turn, result in capital gains through capital appreciation,
	or the exchange of invested securities into a current security or cash at a premium to its acquisition price. Our principals collectively
	have experience in principal investing, debt securities and general capital markets, and we believe we are well-positioned to capitalize
	on these opportunities.


	 


	Our investment activities
	are managed by our Manager who is registered as an investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended, or
	the Advisers Act. Our Manager is responsible for sourcing potential investments, conducting research on prospective investments,
	analyzing investment opportunities, structuring our investments, and monitoring our investments and portfolio companies on an ongoing
	basis. Our Manager is led by Gurpreet (Gurprit) S. Chandhoke, who also serves as our Chief Executive Officer, who has extensive
	experience in underwriting and issuing debt products that include high-yield, bank debt and convertible debt and has acted as financial
	adviser to private equity funds, venture capital firms and corporations in mergers and acquisitions, recapitalization and corporate
	finance transactions, and has served as principal investor in private equity and leveraged buyout transactions.


	 


	Our Manager has
	an investment committee that is responsible for reviewing, discussing and approving each investment opportunity we seek to
	pursue. We anticipate that our investment committee will meet once a week to discuss new and existing opportunities and
	developments on current investments. Our investment committee currently consists of Mr. Chandhoke, our Chief Executive
	Officer, Stephen F. Shea and Quinlan D. Fang.

	Critical Accounting Policies




	 


	This discussion of
	our expected operating plans is based upon our expected financial statements, which will be prepared in accordance with accounting
	principles generally accepted in the United States, or GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements will require our management
	to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. Changes in the
	economic environment, financial markets and any other parameters used in determining such estimates could cause actual results
	to differ. In addition to the discussion below, we will describe our critical accounting policies in the notes to our future financial
	statements.


	 



	Valuation of Portfolio Investments



	 


	The Fund intends to
	determine the net asset value of our investment portfolio each quarter. Securities that are publicly-traded will be valued at the
	reported closing price on the valuation date. Securities that are not publicly-traded will be valued at fair value as determined
	in good faith by our board of directors. In connection with that determination, our Manager will prepare portfolio company valuations
	using relevant inputs, including, but not limited to, indicative dealer quotes, values of like securities, the most recent portfolio
	company financial statements and forecasts, and valuations prepared by third-party valuation services.


	 


	With respect to investments
	for which market quotations are not readily available, we will undertake a multi-step valuation process each quarter, as described
	below:


	 




	 


	·


	our quarterly valuation process will begin with each portfolio company or investment being initially valued by members of our investment committee, with such valuation taking into account information received from our independent valuation firm, if applicable;




	 




	 


	·


	preliminary valuation conclusions will then be documented and discussed with the members of our board of directors; and




	 




	 


	·


	the board of directors will discuss valuations and will determine the fair value of each investment in our portfolio in good faith based on various statistical and other factors, including the input and recommendation of members of our investment committee and any third-party valuation firm, if applicable.




	 


	Investments will be
	valued utilizing a market approach, an income approach, or both approaches, as appropriate. The market approach uses prices and
	other relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets or liabilities (including
	a business). The income approach uses valuation techniques to convert future amounts (for example, cash flows or earnings) to a
	single present value amount (discounted) calculated based on an appropriate discount rate. The measurement is based on the net
	present value indicated by current market expectations about those future amounts. In following these approaches, the types of
	factors that we may take into account in fair value pricing our investments include, as relevant: available current market data,
	including relevant and applicable market trading and transaction comparables, applicable market yields and multiples, security
	covenants, call protection provisions, information rights, the nature and realizable value of any collateral, the portfolio company’s
	ability to make payments, its earnings and discounted cash flows, the markets in which the portfolio company does business, comparisons
	of financial ratios of peer companies that are public, M&A comparables, the principal market and enterprise values, among other
	factors.


	 


	We have adopted FASB
	ASC Topic 820,

	Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures

	(formerly Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 157,

	Fair
	Value Measurements

	), which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with generally
	accepted accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair value measurements.


	  









	12










	 






	 


	ASC Topic 820 clarifies
	that the exchange price is the price in an orderly transaction between market participants to sell an asset or transfer a liability
	in the market in which the reporting entity would transact for the asset or liability, that is, the principal or most advantageous
	market for the asset or liability. The transaction to sell the asset or transfer the liability is a hypothetical transaction at
	the measurement date, considered from the perspective of market participants. ASC Topic 820 provides a consistent definition of
	fair value which focuses on exit price and prioritizes, within a measurement of fair value, the use of market-based inputs over
	entity-specific inputs. In addition, ASC Topic 820 provides a framework for measuring fair value and establishes a three-level
	hierarchy for fair value measurements based upon the transparency of inputs to the valuation of an asset or liability as of the
	measurement date. The three levels of valuation hierarchy established by ASC Topic 820 are defined as follows:


	 


	Level 1:  Quoted
	prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities, accessible by the Fund at the measurement date.


	 


	Level 2:  Quoted
	prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, or quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in
	markets that are not active, or other observable inputs other than quoted prices.


	 


	Level 3:  Unobservable
	inputs for the asset or liability.


	 


	In all cases, the level
	in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement in its entirety falls has been determined based on the lowest
	level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.


	 



	Revenue Recognition



	 


	We record interest
	income on an accrual basis to the extent that we expect to collect such amounts. For loans and debt securities with contractual
	payment-in-kind (“PIK”) interest, which represents contractual interest accrued and added to the principal balance,
	we generally will not accrue PIK interest for accounting purposes if the portfolio company valuation indicates that such PIK interest
	is not collectible. We do not accrue as a receivable interest on loans and debt securities for accounting purposes if we have reason
	to doubt our ability to collect such interest. Original issue discounts, market discounts or premiums are accreted or amortized
	using the effective interest method as interest income. We record prepayment premiums on loans and debt securities as interest
	income. Dividend income, if any, is recognized on an accrual basis to the extent that we expect to collect such amount.



	 




	Net Realized Gains or Losses and Net
	Change in Unrealized Appreciation or Depreciation



	 


	We will measure net
	realized gains or losses by the difference between the net proceeds from the repayment or sale and the amortized cost basis of
	the investment, without regard to unrealized appreciation or depreciation previously recognized, but considering unamortized upfront
	fees and prepayment penalties. Net change in unrealized appreciation or depreciation will reflect the change in portfolio investment
	values during the reporting period, including any reversal of previously recorded unrealized appreciation or depreciation, when
	gains or losses are realized.


	 



	Payment-in-Kind Interest




	 



	We may have investments
	in our portfolio that contain a PIK interest provision. Any PIK interest will be added to the principal balance of such investments
	and is recorded as income, if the portfolio company valuation indicates that such PIK interest is collectible. In order to maintain
	our status as a RIC, substantially all of this income must be paid out to shareholders in the form of dividends, even if we have
	not collected any cash.


	 









	13










	 








	 



	Organization and Offering Expenses



	 


	Organization expenses
	will be expensed on the Fund’s statements of operations. Continuous offering expenses, excluding sales load, will be capitalized
	on the Fund’s statements of assets and liabilities as deferred offering expenses and expensed to the Fund’s statements
	of operations over a period not to exceed 12 months.


	 



	Federal Income Taxes



	 


	We intend to elect
	to be treated for federal income tax purposes as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code. As a RIC, we generally will not have to
	pay corporate-level federal income taxes on any ordinary income or capital gains that we distribute to our shareholders from our
	tax earnings and profits. To obtain and maintain our RIC tax treatment, we must meet, among other things, specified source-of-income
	and asset diversification requirements and distribute annually at least 90% of our ordinary income and realized net short-term
	capital gains in excess of realized net long-term capital losses, if any.


	 




	Results of Operations




	 


	As of June 30, 2012,
	we had not commenced operations. For the six months ended June 30, 2012, we incurred organization costs of $63,360, general and
	administrative costs of $91,211 and other costs of $321, which represented our only operating activities. The organization costs
	included, among other items, the cost of legal services pertaining to our organization. Our management is not aware of any material trends or uncertainties, favorable or
	unfavorable, other than national economic conditions affecting our targeted portfolio,
	which may be reasonably anticipated to have a material impact on the capital resources and the revenue or income to be derived
	from the operation of our assets.


	 




	On July 10,
	2012, we satisfied our minimum offering requirement of raising gross offering proceeds in excess of $1.0 million from persons
	who are not affiliated with us or our Manager, and commenced operations. From July 10, 2012 to August 10, 2012, we issued
	186,754 shares of common stock for gross proceeds of $1.9 million. With the proceeds from our continuous offering, we purchased a
	total of eight debt investments in with an aggregate face value of $1.1 million for $1.1 million in cash.




	 




	Revenues




	 


	Our activities since inception have largely been organizational activities
	and those necessary to prepare for our public offering of shares of our common stock. We plan to generate revenue primarily from
	the cash interest we will collect on our debt investments and, to a lesser extent, from the early termination fees that many of
	our debt investments require the borrower to pay. Further, we may generate revenue in the form of commitment, origination, structuring
	or diligence fees. Any such fees will be generated in connection with our investments and recognized as earned.


	 




	Expenses




	 


	We expect our primary
	annual operating expenses to be the payment of base management fees and incentive fees and the reimbursement of expenses under
	our investment advisory agreement and our administration agreement with our Manager. We will bear all other expenses, which are
	expected to include, among other things:


	 




	 


	•


	corporate, organizational and offering expenses relating to offerings of our common stock, subject to limitations included in our investment advisory agreement;




	 




	 


	•


	the cost of calculating our net asset value, including the related fees and cost of any third-party valuation services;




	 




	 


	•


	the cost of effecting sales and repurchases of shares of our common stock and other securities;




	 




	 


	•


	fees payable to third parties relating to, or associated with, monitoring our financial and legal affairs, making investments, and valuing investments, including fees and expenses associated with performing due diligence reviews of prospective investments;




	 




	 


	•


	transfer agent and custodial fees;




	 




	 


	•


	fees and expenses associated with marketing efforts;




	 









	14










	 










	 




	 


	•


	federal and state registration fees and any stock exchange listing fees;




	 




	 


	•


	federal, state and local taxes;




	 




	 


	•


	independent directors’ fees and expenses, including travel expenses;




	 




	 


	•


	costs of director and shareholder meetings, proxy statements, shareholders’ reports and notices;




	 




	 


	•


	costs of fidelity bond, directors and officers/errors and omissions liability insurance and other types of insurance;




	 




	 


	•


	direct costs, including those relating to printing of shareholder reports and advertising or sales materials, mailing, long distance telephone and staff;




	 




	 


	•


	fees and expenses associated with independent audits and outside legal costs, including compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the 1940 Act and applicable federal and state securities laws;




	 




	 


	•


	brokerage commissions for our investments;




	 


	 


	 




	 


	•


	all other expenses incurred by us or our Manager in connection with administering our business, including expenses incurred by our Manager in performing its obligations; and




	 




	 


	•


	the reimbursement of the compensation of our chief financial officer and chief compliance officer, whose salaries are paid by our Manager or one of its affiliates, to the extent that each such reimbursement amount is annually approved by our independent directors and subject to the limitations included in our administration agreement. 




	 


	As of June
	30, 2012, we had not met the minimum offering requirement set forth in our prospectus and had, therefore, not
	commenced operations. As of June 30, 2012 and December 31, 2011, we incurred offering costs of $862,396 and $354,025,
	respectively. See Note 4 in “Notes to Financial Statements” for additional information.


	 





	Net Realized Gains or Losses



	 


	We had no net realized gains or losses during
	the quarter ended June 30, 2012, since we had not yet commenced operations. Therefore, we did not have a portfolio of investments
	to value. Since we commenced operations in on July 10, 2012, we purchased a total of eight debt investments that will
	be valued by our board of directors in connection with the issuance of quarterly results.


	 



	Net Loss



	 


	During the three
	and six months ended June 30, 2012, we had net losses of $55,864 and $154,892, respectively.


	 




	Liquidity and Capital Resources




	 


	We intend to generate
	cash primarily from the net proceeds of our ongoing continuous public offering and from cash flows from fees, interest and dividends
	earned from our investments as well as principal repayments and proceeds from sales of our investments. Immediately after we meet
	our minimum offering requirement, gross subscription funds will total approximately $1,000,000. Subsequent to meeting our minimum
	offering requirement, we will sell our shares on a continuous basis at an initial offering price of $10.00; however, to the extent
	that our net asset value per share increases, we will sell at a price necessary to ensure that our shares are not sold at a price,
	after deduction of selling commissions and dealer manager fees, that is below our net asset value per share. In the event of a
	material decline in our NAV per share, which we consider to be a 5.0% decrease below our current net offering price, and subject
	to certain conditions, we will reduce our offering price accordingly. A decline in our NAV per share to an amount more than 5.0%
	below our current offering price, net of selling commissions and dealer manager fees, creates a rebuttable presumption that there
	has been a material change in the value of our assets such that a reduction in the offering price per share is warranted. This
	presumption may only be rebutted if our board of directors, in consultation with its management, reasonably and in good faith
	determines that the decline in NAV per share is the result of a temporary movement in the credit markets or the value of our assets,
	rather than a more fundamental shift in the valuation of our portfolio. In the event that (i) NAV per share decreases to more
	than 5.0% below our current net offering price and (ii) our board of directors believes that such decrease in NAV per share is
	the result of a non-temporary movement in the credit markets or the value of our assets, the board of directors will undertake
	to establish a new net offering price that is not more than 5.0% above our NAV per share. If our board of directors determines
	that the decline in our NAV per share is the result of a temporary movement in the credit markets or the value of our assets,
	investors will purchase common stock at an offering price per share, net of selling commissions and dealer manager fees, which
	represents a premium to the NAV per share of greater than 5.0% In connection with each semi-monthly closing on the sale of our
	shares pursuant to this prospectus on a continuous basis, our board of directors or a committee thereof is required to make the
	determination that we are not selling our shares at a price below our then current net asset value within 48 hours of the time
	that we price our shares.


	 




	On July 10,
	2012, we satisfied our minimum offering requirement of raising gross offering proceeds in excess of $1.0 million from persons
	who are not affiliated with us or our Manager, and commenced operations. From July 10, 2012 to August 10, 2012, we issued
	186,754 shares of common stock for gross proceeds of $1.9 million. With the proceeds from our continuous offering, we purchased a
	total of eight debt investments with an aggregate face value of $1.1 million for $1.1 million in cash.


	 


	Prior to investing
	in debt securities, we will invest the net proceeds from our continuous offering primarily in cash, cash equivalents, U.S. government
	securities, and high-quality debt instruments maturing in one year or less from the time of investment, consistent with our business
	development company election and our election to be taxed as a RIC.


	 


	We do not expect to
	borrow funds during the following twelve months to make investments. In the future, however, if the market for debt financing presents
	attractively priced debt financing opportunities, or if our board of directors determines that leveraging our portfolio would be
	in our best interests and the best interests of our shareholders, we may decide to borrow funds to make investments. We do not
	currently anticipate issuing any preferred shares.

	Distributions




	 


	As of June 30, 2012
	we had not made any distributions. We intend to authorize and declare distributions
	monthly and pay distributions on a semi-monthly basis to our shareholders.


	 




	We commenced operations on July 10, 2012, and on July 31,
	2012, we declared two semi-monthly distributions of $0.0306250 per share each (an annualized rate of 7.35% based on
	our initial public offering price of $10.00 per share) to stockholders of record on July 30, 2012,
	payable on August 17, 2012 and August 31, 2012.




	 


	Any distributions to our shareholders will be declared out of assets legally available
	for distribution. We expect to continue making distributions unless
	our results of operations, our general financial condition, general economic conditions, or other factors prohibit us from doing
	so. There can be no assurance that we will be able to sustain distributions at any particular level.


	  


	Each year a statement
	on Internal Revenue Service Form 1099-DIV (or such successor form) identifying the source of the distribution (i.e., paid from
	ordinary income, paid from net capital gain on the sale of securities, or a return of capital) will be mailed to our shareholders.
	Our distributions may exceed our earnings, especially during the period before we have substantially invested the proceeds from
	this offering. As a result, a portion of the distributions we make may represent a return of capital for tax purposes. The tax
	basis of shares must be reduced by the amount of any return of capital distributions, which will result in an increase in the
	amount of any taxable gain (or a reduction in any deductible loss) on the sale of shares.


	 




	Distribution Reinvestment Plan




	 


	We have adopted an
	“opt-in” distribution reinvestment plan pursuant to which you may elect to have the full amount of your cash distributions
	reinvested in additional shares of our common stock. If you wish to receive your distribution in cash, no action will be required
	on your part to do so. There will be no selling commissions, dealer manager fees or other sales charges to you if, you elect to
	participate in the distribution reinvestment plan. We will pay the plan administrator’s fees under the plan. Your distribution
	amount will purchase shares at 95% of the price that the shares are offered pursuant to the effective registration
	statement of the public offering. Shares issued pursuant to our distribution reinvestment plan will have the same voting rights
	as our shares of common stock offered pursuant to this prospectus.


	 




	Election as a RIC




	 


	We intend to elect
	to be treated as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code commencing in the first taxable year in which we meet the minimum offering
	requirements. As a RIC, we generally will not have to pay corporate-level U.S. federal income taxes on any income that we distribute
	to our stockholders from our tax earnings and profits. To qualify as a RIC, we must, among other things, meet certain source-of-income
	and asset diversification requirements. In addition, in order to obtain RIC tax treatment, we must distribute to our stockholders,
	for each taxable year, at least 90% of our “investment company taxable income,” which is generally our net ordinary
	income plus the excess, if any, of realized net short-term capital gain over realized net long-term capital loss, or the annual
	distribution requirement. Even if we qualify as a RIC, we generally will be subject to corporate-level U.S. federal income tax
	on our undistributed taxable income and could be subject to U.S. federal excise, state, local and foreign taxes.


	 




	Related-Party Transactions and Agreements




	 


	Conflicts of interest
	between us and the various roles, activities and duties of the Manager and its affiliates may occur from time to time. The Manager,
	its officers and other affiliates may act as a manager or general partner of other private or public entities, some of whom may
	have the same or a similar investment objective as us. As a result, conflicts of interest between us and the other activities of
	the Manager and its affiliates may occur from time to time. None of the agreements or arrangements, including those relating to
	compensation, between us, the Manager or their affiliates, is the result of arm’s-length negotiations. As a result, there
	may be conflicts between us, on the one hand, and our Manager, including members of its management team, on the other, regarding
	the allocation of resources to the management of our day-to-day activities.


	 




	Our Manager is wholly-owned by VII Peaks-KBR,
	LLC which is a joint venture between VII Peaks and KBR. Our Manager has agreed to fund offering costs and organization costs. We
	have recorded $999,246 as due to related party on the Statements of Assets and Liabilities as of June 30, 2012 of which, $847,972
	is related to offering costs funded by our Manager and $151,274 is related to organizational costs funded by the Manager. We have
	recorded $454,539 as due to related party on the Statements of Assets and Liabilities as of December 31, 2011 of which, $354,025
	is related to offering costs funded by the Manager and $100,514 is related to organizational costs funded by the Manager. The Manager
	will recover organizational and offering costs funded from offering proceeds to the extent the reimbursement would not cause the
	selling commission, dealer manager fee, accountable due diligence expenses and other organizational and offering expenses borne
	by us to exceed 15% of the gross offering proceeds. To the extent that the Manager is unable to recover these costs through offering
	proceeds, we would be required to reimburse the Manager.


	 


	The compensation
	we pay to our Manager was not entered into on an arm’s-length basis with unaffiliated third parties. As a result, the form
	and amount of such compensation may be less favorable to us than they might have been had they been entered into through arm’s-length
	transactions with unaffiliated parties.




	 


	Further, the officers
	of VII Peaks are involved in other ventures, some of which may compete with us for investment opportunities, including certain
	affiliated funds or managed accounts, and may be incentivized to offer investment opportunities to such other ventures rather than
	to us which would make it more difficult to achieve our investment objectives.

	In addition, the officers
	of KBR may also be involved in other ventures, some of which may compete with us for investment opportunities.


	 


	As a BDC, we are
	subject to certain regulatory restrictions in making our investments. For example, we generally are not permitted to co-invest
	with certain entities affiliated with our Manager in transactions originated by our Manager or its affiliates unless we obtain
	an exemptive order from the SEC or co-invest alongside our Manager or its affiliates in accordance with existing regulatory guidance
	and our allocation policy. Under existing regulatory guidance, we are permitted to, and may co-invest in syndicated deals and
	secondary loan market transactions where price is the only negotiated point.


	 


	We may seek exemptive
	relief from the SEC to engage in co-investment transactions with our Manager and/or its affiliates. However, there can be no assurance
	that we will obtain such exemptive relief, if requested. Even if we receive exemptive relief, neither our Manager nor its affiliates
	are obligated to offer us the right to participate in any transactions originated by them. Prior to obtaining exemptive relief,
	we may co-invest alongside our Manager or its affiliates only in accordance with existing regulatory guidance and our allocation
	policy.


	 

	 



	KBR
	Capital Markets, LLC, our Dealer Manager, is an affiliate of KBR, and is a licensed broker-dealer registered with the
	Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, and serves as the Dealer Manager for our public offering of shares of common stock.
	The Dealer Manager will receive selling commission of 7% of gross offering proceeds and a dealer manager fee of up to 3% of
	gross offering proceeds, all or a portion of which may be reallowed to selected dealers. This relationship may create
	conflicts in connection with KBR Capital Markets’ due diligence obligations under the federal securities laws.


	 




	Contractual Obligations




	 


	We have entered
	into an agreement with the Manager to provide investment advisory services. Payments for investment
	advisory services under the investment advisory agreement will be comprised of a base management fee and an
	incentive fee. The base management fee will equal 2.0% of net assets below $100 million; 1.75% of net assets between $100
	million and $250 million; and 1.5% of net assets over $250 million. The incentive fee has two parts. The first part, the
	subordinated incentive fee on income, will be calculated and payable quarterly in arrears based upon our “pre-incentive
	fee net investment income” for the immediately preceding quarter. The subordinated incentive fee on income will be 20%
	of pre-incentive net investment income subject to a quarterly return to investors, expressed as a rate of return on adjusted
	capital at the beginning of the most recently completed calendar quarter, of 2.0% (8.0% annualized). The second part of the
	incentive fee, the incentive fee on capital gains, will be an incentive fee on capital gains earned on liquidated investments
	from the portfolio and will be determined and payable in arrears as of the end of each calendar year (or upon termination of
	the investment advisory agreement). This fee will equal 20.0% of our incentive fee capital gains, which will equal our
	realized capital gains on a cumulative basis from inception, calculated as of the end of each calendar year, computed net of
	all realized capital losses and unrealized capital depreciation on a cumulative basis, less the aggregate amount of any
	previously paid capital gains incentive fees. As of June 30, 2012, no services had been performed by the Manager under this
	agreement, and no fees have been paid to it.


	 


	We have also entered
	into an administration agreement with the Manager under which the Manager provides us with office facilities, equipment and clerical,
	bookkeeping and record keeping services at such facilities and provides or oversees the performance of, our required administrative
	services, which include, among other things, being responsible for the financial records which we are required to maintain and
	preparing reports to our stockholders. The Manager is reimbursed amounts based on allocable portion of overhead costs under this
	agreement.

	Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements




	 


	We have no off-balance
	sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in
	financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.



	 





	Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative
	Disclosures about Market Risk



	 


	As of the date of this
	Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, we had not yet commenced operations. We are subject to financial market risks, including changes
	in interest rates. Any investments we make that are denominated in a foreign currency will be subject to risks associated with
	changes in currency exchange rates. These risks include the possibility of significant fluctuations in the foreign currency markets,
	the imposition or modification of foreign exchange controls and potential illiquidity in the secondary market. These risks will
	vary depending upon the currency or currencies involved.


	 


	We may hedge against
	interest rate and currency exchange rate fluctuations by using standard hedging instruments such as futures, options and forward
	contracts subject to the requirements of the 1940 Act. While hedging activities may insulate us against adverse changes in interest
	rates, they may also limit our ability to participate in benefits of lower interest rates with respect to our portfolio of investments
	with fixed interest rates.



	 





	Item 4. Controls and Procedures



	 




	Disclosure Controls





	 



	In accordance with
	Rules 13a-15(b) and 15d-15(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), we, under the
	supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, carried out an evaluation of
	the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and Rule 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act)
	as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and determined that the disclosure controls and procedures
	are effective.


	 




	Change In Internal Control Over Financial
	Reporting




	 


	No change occurred
	in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) during the quarter
	ended June 30, 2012 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial
	reporting.

According to recent SEC filings, on May 15, 2017, VII Peaks Co-Optivist Income BDC II, Inc. reported that it would not be able to file its Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2017 in a timely manner, and would file the Form 10-Q as soon as possible.
What is a Business Development Company (BDC)?
A Business Development Company (“BDC”)  invests in small and mid-sized businesses. Investors can buy shares in a BDC, and the money from their investments is used to fund the businesses. In turn, investors can profit from dividends paid on their investments, or, in some cases, the sale of their shares.
BDCs were created in 1980 after Congress approved a series of amendments to the Investment Act of 1940. The creation of BDCs was meant to spur investment in smaller companies that couldn’t attract traditional forms of capital. BDCs have become increasingly popular in recent years, in part due to their ability to create strong returns on investment. However, BDCs are not without their risks and pitfalls.
Risks of Business Development Companies
Business Development Companies such as VII Peaks Co-Optivist Income BDC II, operate much like REITs (Real Estate Investment Trusts). Non-traded BDCs have many of the same problems for investors as non-traded REITs. They are high-risk, often have high commissions, and lack liquidity.
The White Law Group has represented a number of investors over the last few years in non-traded REITs and as well as BDCs– in large part because of their high commission structure and the possibility that nefarious financial advisors will push these products unsuitably to maximize their own commissions.  As such, the firm is investigating the liability that brokerage firms may have for recommending high-risk BDCs, like VII Peaks Co-Optivist Income BDC II.
Brokerage firms are required to perform adequate due diligence on any investment they recommend and to ensure that all recommendations are suitable for the investor in light of that particular investor’s age, investment experience, net worth, risk tolerance, investment objectives, and income.  Firms that fail to perform adequate due diligence or that make unsuitable recommendations can be held responsible for investment losses in a FINRA arbitration claim.

BDC dumps distributor over financial issues
VII Peaks Capital actively looking for new wholesaler

      A nascent nontraded business development company has cut ties with its outside broker-dealer manager, citing a lack of financial stability at the broker-dealer. The VII Peaks-KBR Co-Optivist Income BDC II Inc. said in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Friday that its board decided to split from its investment adviser, VII Peaks-KBR BDC Advisor II LLC. The BDC's board retained VII Peaks but terminated KBR as the investment adviser. The new name of the BDC, which has $18 million in assets under management, is VII Peaks Co-Optivist Income BDC II Inc. Its net asset value per share is $8.83, according to its most recent quarterly report. The current offering price is $10.15 per share.
				



KBR, through the broker-dealer KBR Capital Markets LLC, distributed the BDC. BDCs are typically closed-end investment companies that invest in debt and equity of private companies. Nontraded BDCs currently are one of the most popular alternative investments sold through independent broker-dealers. Yields can be attractive due to BDCs' exposure to high credit risks that are amplified by leverage, according to the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority Inc. According to investment bank Robert A. Stanger & Co. Inc., nontraded BDC sales have been booming this year. Sales of nonlisted BDCs during the first half reached $2.1 billion, a 47.2% increase over the same period of 2012.  The biggest seller over the first six months was FS Investment Corp. II, which raised $827.5 million over that time. VII Peaks Capital has $46.2 million in total assets, according to its Form ADV. SEC filings show that VII Peaks and KBR had four other offerings, but those were private and not publicly registered. The BDC is actively seeking a new broker-dealer as a distributor, said Gurpreet Chandhoke, chief executive and chairman. “We are moving on from KBR,” Mr. Chandhoke said. “We terminated the advisory agreement. We do the investment management, and KBR was purely a distributor.”He cited financial issues at KBR as a concern. “We need to have a stable distribution partner,” he said. Vinay Kumar, the owner of KBR Capital Markets, did not return a phone message left at the firm Monday. He also did not respond to e-mails sent him Monday and Tuesday. According to a filing with the SEC, KBR posted a net loss of $1.2 million last year.
