HOTEL ASSET MANAGEMENT
TFG Asset Management’s Hotel Asset Management team brings extensive hospitality experience, ensuring the very best results are achieved for your hotel property in Dubai






Hotel Asset Management
Upholding your vision


Expand All






TFG Asset Management knows what it takes to make your hotel investment in Dubai a success. It also knows that owning a hotel property can be a daunting task, given the ever-increasing cost of development, operation and growing supply and competition. While TFG Asset Management works very closely with hotel operators, its objectives differ slightly from theirs. Its primary aim is to increase the net revenue of your Dubai hotel property by meticulously monitoring the way it is operated. The objectives of a hotel operator may not always be in line with the interests of the hotel owner.


TFG Asset Management provides the balance between the two, securing, safeguarding and managing your hotel asset in Dubai and your vision, whilst motivating the operator to provide the highest quality of service standards.
•    A leader in hotel asset management in Dubai•    Led by a primary aim of increasing your hotel’s net revenue•    A portfolio of hotels that average over 20% occupancy and revenue than main competitors



Hotel Asset Management Services
Hotel Operation Solutions:
TFG Asset Management’s Hotel Asset Management team watches over the day-to-day operations of the hotel. This includes closely monitoring expenses, budget, cash flows and capital expenditure, as well as ensuring the hotel operator is providing the highest possible level of service.
Hotel Strategy and Positioning:
Reviewing a hotel’s position versus its primary market is crucial to maximising its financial returns and success. Thanks to a strong long-term plan in partnership with TFG Asset Management’s Hotel Operation Solutions, hotels in Dubai under the TFG Asset Management portfolio are averaging 20% more occupancy and revenue than their primary competitors.
Asset Optimization and Maintenance:
A well maintained asset is critical to the long-term performance of a hotel. TFG Asset Management continously monitors, audits and measures the efficiency of a hotel to ensure it stays in line with its owner’s objectives and delivers top returns.
Legal Process and Overall Compliance
In this constantly changing environment, TFG Asset Management stays up to date with all the current local, regional and national regulations that might have an impact on your hotel in Dubai. Its legal team is on hand to make sure the hotel complies with laws across every level. TFG Asset Management will arrange all necessary licenses and supervises, along with the hotel operator, inspections from the Tourism department or any other local authorities.

Numerix Acquires TFG Financial Systems to Deliver Scalable, Real-Time Risk Platform of the Future

Numerix, the leader in risk technology today announces the acquisition of TFG Financial Systems, the only real-time risk, P&L and position management system in the industry. TFG’s dependency graph capabilities, at the heart of its SaaS risk and portfolio management software and technology framework, will be leveraged to provide core real-time, distributed, event-driven processing capabilities in Numerix Oneview enterprise trading and risk solutions.
“Built on a real-time, distributed, fault tolerant, event-driven calculation framework with dynamic directed graph technology, TFG is a state-of-the-art software built for real-time systems. We’re proud to be adding the highest level of performance for front office real-time scenarios – spanning solutions for automated structured products distribution, trading, risk management and now a robust solution for hedge funds and fixed income market makers,” said Steve O’Hanlon, Chief Executive Officer of Numerix. “Echoing our recent Chartis RiskTech 100® award for demonstrating excellence in strategy, this deal clearly exemplifies how we’ve continued to expand our next generation technology platform. Numerix and TFG are already synonymous with fast, robust and scalable products; in 2017 we are focused on continuing to grow and evolve our world class systems.”
Peyman Mestchian, Managing Director of Chartis Research, adds: “Numerix is already a leader in pricing and quantitative risk analytics. By acquiring TFG’s event-driven buy-side and sell-side platform, it has extended its position, and responded to market demand for cost-reducing architectures that combine hybrid data management, analytics, workflow and visualization.”
Scalable, High-Performance Graph Technology for Real-Time Risk
“A dependency graph is essentially a technology for connecting server systems that speak to each other in an event-driven real-time, efficient way,” said Satyam Kancharla, Chief Product and Strategy Officer of Numerix. “The streaming Directed Acyclic Graph, or DAG technology, triggers modules only if data they depend on changes, maximizing efficiency and throughput. As such, the system can calculate VaR, Greeks and carry out stress testing on a sub-second basis, or price 25,000 interest rate swaps per second in volatile markets.”
Numerix Oneview Asset Management, formerly TFG Complete, provides Numerix with a turnkey SaaS based real-time front-to-back office solution to immediately begin working with a range of new buy-side institutions, including hedge funds who operate global macro style strategies, as well as endowments, pension funds and sovereign wealth funds.
TFG’s graph technology will also be central to future versions of the Numerix Oneview enterprise platform. Underpinning Numerix’s technology architecture, Numerix Oneview will be the only independent provider of real-time trading and risk with a single source of data and analytics for front and middle office risk.
“We conducted considerable due diligence on many firms who have staked the claim to delivering real-time capabilities in the market. It’s been well documented how many financial institutions have tried to develop real-time systems on their own and failed. Meanwhile, closed systems like SecDB have operated around proprietary languages and a legacy data model, and select vendor solutions are content to build out similar shell systems without the maturity of data model and analytics,” said O’Hanlon. “As a state-of-the-art trading and risk system utilizing a dynamic dependency graph, Numerix Oneview is the next generation SecDB. Built utilizing standardized components like Python and a modern market standard data model, Numerix is providing technology akin to what firms like Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan are providing while remaining independent and unbiased.”
“TFG has made significant inroads into the hedge fund and banking space, gaining several new clients globally in the last 12 months. With an established track record and strong brand reputation, Numerix will allow us to take our solutions to a more diverse client base and be leveraged to address a wider range of market needs,” said Barry Fenwick, Chief Executive Officer of TFG. “TFG personnel bring decades’ worth of market knowledge across risk management, development and performance technologies. The deep practical knowledge, experience and IT understanding of our joined staff will give us unique insight into recognizing opportunity for our clients. We’re proud to be part of the global leader in risk technology, and the role we’ll have in the future of Numerix Oneview.”

White PapersOption Valuation using Finite DifferencesMartin Toyer, TFG Systems, October 2015TFG has built a method to value options with a non-standard pay-out function and Knock-Out barriers. As this calculation is integrated into a real-time system, performance and stability are critical. This has been achieved by using implicit finite differences where more detailed grids are used when the estimate of the error exceeds the required tolerance.

LCM is a specialist in below-investment grade U.S. broadly-syndicated leveraged loans.
The business was established in 2001 and has offices in New York and London.
TFG owns 100% of LCM.
Currently, LCM manages loan assets exclusively through CLOs, which are long-term, multi-year investment vehicles. The typical duration of a CLO, and thus LCM’s management fee stream, depends on, among other things, the term of its reinvestment period (currently typically four to five years for a new issue CLO), the prepayment rate of the underlying loan assets, as well as post-reinvestment period reinvestment flexibility and weighted average life constraints.

Further information on LCM is available at www.lcmam.com.

Tetragon’s investment manager seeks to find high-quality managers who invest in various asset classes, selects or structures suitable investment vehicles that optimise risk-adjusted returns for Tetragon’s capital and seeks for Tetragon to own a share of the asset management company through TFG Asset Management. Tetragon aims to not only produce asset-level returns, but also aims to enhance these returns with profits from owning asset management businesses that derive income from external investors. Thus, Tetragon seeks to use its balance sheet to facilitate the growth of TFG Asset Management to help create value for itself and for its shareholders.
Some of the growth of TFG Asset Management has been organic – through active capital raising into existing businesses leveraging off the TFG Asset Management platform and launching new businesses such as Hawke’s Point. The investment manager has also sought to accelerate growth through joint ventures and partnerships with existing businesses and via acquisitions, as was the case with Equitix.
Certain considerations when evaluating the viability of a potential asset manager typically include: performance track records, reputation, regulatory requirements, infrastructure needs and asset gathering capacity. Potential profitability and scalability of the business are also important considerations. Additionally, the core capabilities, investment focus and strategy of any new business should offer a complementary operating income stream to TFG Asset Management’s existing businesses. The investment manager looks to mitigate potential correlated risks across TFG Asset Management’s investment managers by diversifying its exposure across asset classes, investment vehicles, durations, and investor types, among other factors.
Tetragon's asset management businesses can operate autonomously, or on the TFG Asset Management platform. In either case, the objective is for them to benefit from an established infrastructure, which can assist in critical business management functions such as risk management, investor relations, financial control, technology, and compliance/legal matters, while maintaining entrepreneurial independence.
Tetragon's permanent capital base should increase the likelihood of success for this strategy of investing in alternative asset managers and the assets they manage, as its capital is available both for supporting operations of the management businesses and for co-investing, seeding or anchoring new investment funds of the managers.
The investment manager believes that considerable value has been built within TFG Asset Management. Given the significantly increased scale of TFG Asset Management in light of its organic growth and, in particular, following the February 2015 acquisition of Equitix, the investment manager has determined to continue to grow TFG Asset Management with a view to a possible initial public offering and listing of its shares in the medium term.
TFG Asset Management L.P. is registered as an investment adviser under the U.S. Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and one of its investment management entities, Polygon Global Partners LLP, is authorised and regulated by the United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority.
 
(i) Includes the AUM of LCM, the GreenOak Joint Venture, Polygon, Equitix, Hawke’s Point, TCIP and TCICM, as calculated by the applicable fund administrators. Includes, where relevant, investments by Tetragon Financial Group Master Fund Limited.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.

                        Investment Strategy
                      


 
 
To achieve Tetragon’s investment objective of generating distributable income and capital appreciation, the company’s current investment strategy is:

To identify attractive asset classes and investment strategies.
To identify asset managers it believes to be superior.
To use the market experience of Tetragon's investment manager to negotiate favourable terms for its investments.
To own, where sensible, all, or a portion of, asset management companies with which it invests in order to enhance the returns achieved on its capital.

In addition, the current investment strategy is to continue to grow TFG Asset Management – as Tetragon’s diversified alternative asset management business – with a view to a possible initial public offering and listing of its shares.

As part of its investment strategy, Tetragon’s investment manager may employ hedging strategies and leverage in seeking to provide attractive returns while managing risk.
