This report is not for commercial use. Thorough reviews have been conducted to assure this data accurately reflects disclosures. However for a complete and definitive understanding of the pay practices of any company, users should refer directly to the actual, complete proxy statement. 


Use of Data / Disclaimer
The information shown here is a reporting of information included in the company's proxy statement. The proxy statement includes footnotes and explanations of this information plus other information that is pertinent in assessing the overall value and appropriateness of the compensation information. For those interested in conducting a detailed compensation analysis, we recommend that you review the entire proxy statement. You may retrieve the full proxy statement by going to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) website at www.sec.gov and entering the company's name and then looking in the first column for an entry of "Form DEF 14A" (or any similar code). You may also find the annual proxy statement by going directly to the company's website.


What is a proxy statement?
A proxy statement (or "proxy") is a form that every publicly traded U.S. company is required to file with the U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) within 120 days after the end of its fiscal year. The proxy must be sent to every shareholder in advance of the company's annual shareholders meeting. All proxy statements are public filings made available to the general public by the SEC.


The proxy statement's main purpose is to alert shareholders to the annual meeting and provide them information about the issues that will be voted on during the annual meeting, including decisions such as electing directors, ratifying the selection of auditors, and other shareholder-related decisions, including shareholder-initiated initiatives. Also, proxies must disclose specific detailed information regarding the pay practices for certain executives.

	NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS




	June 30, 2016




	(UNAUDITED)




	 




	 




	NOTE 1- ORGANIZATION




	 




	Nanning Tongji Hospital, Inc. ("NTH") was established in Nanning in the province of Guangxi of the People’s Republic of China ("PRC" or “China”) by the Nanning Tongji Medical Co. Ltd. and an individual on October 30, 2003.




	 




	NTH is a designated hospital for medical insurance in the city of Nanning and Guangxi province. NTH specializes in the areas of internal medicine, surgery, gynecology, pediatrics, emergency medicine, ophthalmology, medical cosmetology, rehabilitation, dermatology, otolaryngology, traditional Chinese medicine, medical imaging, anesthesia, acupuncture, physical therapy,
	health examination, and prevention.




	 




	On December 19, 2006, NTH filed the Articles of Incorporation in the State of Nevada to establish Tongji Healthcare Group, Inc. (the "Company"). On the same day, Tongji, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, was incorporated in the State of Colorado. Tongji Inc. was later dissolved on March 25, 2011.




	 




	On December 27, 2006, Tongji Inc. acquired 100% of the equity in NTH pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger, pursuant to which NTH became a wholly owned subsidiary of Tongji Inc. Pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger, the Company issued 15,652,557 shares of common stock to the stockholders of NTH in exchange for 100% of the issued and outstanding shares of
	common stock of NTH. Thereafter and for purposes of these consolidated financial statements the "Company" and "NTH" are used to refer to the operations of NTH. The acquisition of NTH was accounted for as a reverse acquisition under the purchase method of accounting since the stockholders of NTH obtained control of the consolidated entity. Accordingly, the reorganization of the two companies was recorded as a recapitalization of NTH, with NTH being treated as the continuing operating entity.




	 




	The Company is authorized to issue 50,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share and 20,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.001 per share.




	 




	According to the PRC Regulation of Healthcare Institutions, hospitals are subject to registration with the health department of the local government to obtain business license for hospital services. We received our renewed business license from Nanning municipal government in November 2007, and this license is valid until November, 2020. Other existing regulations having
	material effects on our business include regulations dealing with physician's licensing, usage of medicine and injection, and public security in health and medical advertising.




	 




	NTH must register with and maintain an operating license from the local health department, due to the fact that NTH currently maintains a facility with over 100 beds. NTH is subject to review by the local health department at least once every three years. If NTH fails to meet their standards, NTH’s business license may be revoked. NTH is also obligated to provide
	free services or dispatch our physicians or other employees in the event of a need for public assistance. NTH dedicates a very small percentage of its resources to providing free public services.




	 




	NOTE 2- SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES




	 




	The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared by management without audit pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Certain information and disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles have been condensed or omitted
	as allowed by such rules and regulations, and management believes that the disclosures are adequate to make the information presented not misleading. These condensed consolidated financial statements include all of the adjustments, which, in the opinion of management, are necessary to a fair presentation of financial position and results of operations. All such adjustments are of a normal and recurring nature. Interim results are not necessarily indicative of results for a full year. The condensed consolidated
	balance sheet information as of December 31, 2015 was derived from the audited consolidated financial statements included in the Form 10-K. These condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended on December 31, 2015 (“Form 10-K”), filed with the Commission on April 16, 2016.

	NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS




	June 30, 2016




	(UNAUDITED)




	 


	 






	This summary of significant accounting policies of the Company is presented to assist in understanding the Company’s consolidated financial statements. The consolidated financial statements and notes are representations of the Company’s management, which is responsible for their integrity and objectivity. These accounting policies conform to generally accepted
	accounting principles and have been consistently applied in the preparation of the condensed consolidated financial statements and the Form 10-K.




	 




	BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND CONSOLIDATION




	 




	These financial statements present the Company’s results of operations, financial position and cash flows on a consolidated basis. The consolidated financial statements include the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries. Intercompany transactions and accounts have been eliminated in consolidation. Our policy is to consolidate all subsidiaries in which a greater
	than 50% voting interest is owned. The Company operates in one segment in accordance with the accounting guidance FASB ASC topic 280, “Segment Reporting”.




	 




	CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS




	 




	For purposes of the statements of cash flows, the Company considers all highly liquid debt instruments purchased with a maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. A substantial amount of the Company’s cash is held in bank accounts in the PRC and is not protected by Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) insurance or any other similar insurance.
	Cash held in China amounted to $36,542 as of June 30, 2016. Given the current economic environment and the financial condition of the banking industry, there is a risk that the deposits may not be readily available or covered by such insurance. The Company has had no loss of cash in domestic or foreign banks in past years.




	 




	USE OF ESTIMATES




	 




	The preparation of these consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported
	amounts of net revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results may differ from those estimates and such differences may be material. The more significant estimates and assumptions by management include, among others, useful lives and residual values of fixed assets, valuation of inventories, accounts receivable, stock based compensation, and allowance for bad debt. The current economic environment has increased the degree of uncertainty inherent in these estimates and assumptions.




	 





	 


	TRANSLATION ADJUSTMENT





	 




	The Company's functional currency is the Chinese Renminbi (RMB). The reporting currency is that of the US Dollar. Capital accounts of the consolidated financial statements are translated into United States dollars from RMB at their historical exchange rates when the capital transactions occurred. Assets and liabilities are translated at the exchange rates as of the balance
	sheet date. Income and expenditures are translated at the average exchange rate of the year. The RMB is not freely convertible into foreign currency and all foreign currency exchange transactions must take place through authorized institutions. No representation is made that the RMB amounts could have been, or could be, converted into US dollar at the rates used in translation.

	Statement of income and other comprehensive income






	RMB 6.2192 to US $1.00








	 




	REVENUE RECOGNITION




	 




	The Company's revenue recognition policies are in compliance with Staff Accounting Bulletin 104 (ASC 605). Service revenue is recognized on the dates services were rendered. When a formal arrangement exists, the price is fixed or determinable. When the service is completed, no other significant obligations of the Company exist and collectability is reasonably assured.
	Payments received before all of the relevant criteria for revenue recognition are satisfied are recorded as unearned revenue.




	 




	The Company generates revenue from individual patients as well as third-party payers, including PRC government programs and insurance providers, under which the hospital is paid based upon government established charges. Revenues for pharmaceutical drug sales are recognized upon the drug being administered to a patient.




	 




	Patient revenues are recorded based on pre-established rates set by the local government. The Company bills for services provided to Medicare patients through a medical card (the US equivalent of an insurance card). There have not been significant differences between the amounts the Company has billed the government Medicare funds and the amounts collected from the Medicare
	funds.




	 




	ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE




	 




	Accounts receivable are recorded at the estimated net realizable amounts from government fund, insurance companies and patients. Collections have not been considered an area that exposes the Company to additional risk. Hospital staff verifies patient coverage prior to examinations and/or procedures.




	 




	For any Medicare patient who visits the hospital and is qualified for acceptance, the hospital will only include the portion that the social insurance organization will pay in the accounts receivable and collects the self-pay portion in cash at the time of service. Management continues to estimate the likelihood of bad debt on an ongoing basis.




	 




	The Company has estimated a bad debt allowance of approximately $29,000 and $31,000 as of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.

	FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS




	 




	The Company applies the provisions of FASB ASC Topic 825, which requires all entities to disclose the fair value of financial instruments, both assets and liabilities recognized and not recognized on the balance sheet, for which it is practicable to estimate fair value, and defines fair value of a financial instrument as the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged
	in a current transaction between willing parties. As of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 the fair value of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued expenses, notes payable and other payables approximated the carrying value due to the short maturity of the instruments, quoted market prices or interest rates which fluctuate with market rates except for related party debt or receivables for which it is not practicable to estimate fair value.




	 




	FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS




	 




	FASB ASC Topic 820, “Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures”, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and requires additional disclosures about the use of fair value measurements.




	 




	Various inputs are considered when determining the fair value of the Company’s investments, and long-term debt. The inputs or methodologies used for valuing securities are not necessarily an indication of the risk associated with investing in these securities. These inputs are summarized in the three broad levels listed below.




	 








	●






	 






	Level 1 – observable market inputs that are unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.








	●






	 






	Level 2 – other significant observable inputs (including quoted prices for similar securities, interest rates, credit risk, etc.).








	●






	 






	Level 3 – significant unobservable inputs (including the Company’s own assumptions in determining the fair value of investments).








	 




	The carrying value of financial assets and liabilities recorded at fair value is measured on a recurring or non-recurring basis. Financial assets and liabilities measured on a non-recurring basis are those that are adjusted to fair value when a significant event occurs. The Company had no financial assets or liabilities carried and measured on a nonrecurring basis during
	the reporting periods. Financial assets and liabilities measured on a recurring basis are those that are adjusted to fair value each time a financial statement is prepared. The Company had no financial assets and liabilities carried at fair value on a recurring basis.




	 




	The availability of inputs observable in the market varies from instrument to instrument and depends on a variety of factors including the type of instrument, whether the instrument is actively traded, and other characteristics particular to the transaction. For many financial instruments, pricing inputs are readily observable in the market, the valuation methodology used
	is widely accepted by market participants, and the valuation does not require significant management discretion. For other financial instruments, pricing inputs are less observable in the market and may require management judgment.




	 




	CONCENTRATIONS, RISKS, AND UNCERTAINTIES




	 




	All of the Company’s operations are located in the PRC. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to successfully continue to operate and failure to do so would have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial position, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, the success of the Company’s operations is subject to numerous
	contingencies, some of which are beyond management’s control. These contingencies include general economic conditions, the price of medicine, competition, governmental and political conditions, and changes in regulations. Because the Company is dependent on the domestic market of the PRC, the Company is subject to various additional political, economic and other uncertainties. Among other risks, the Company’s operations will be subject to risk of restrictions on the transfer of funds, domestic policy
	changes, changing taxation policies, foreign exchange restrictions, and political and governmental regulations.

	NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS




	June 30, 2016




	(UNAUDITED)




	 








	CONTINGENCIES




	 




	Certain conditions may exist as of the date the consolidated financial statements are issued. These conditions may result in a future loss to the Company but which will only be resolved when one or more future events occur or fail to occur. The Company’s management and legal counsel assess such contingent liabilities, and such assessment inherently involves an exercise
	of judgment. In assessing loss contingencies related to legal proceedings that are pending against the Company or unasserted claims that may result in such proceedings, the Company’s legal counsel evaluates the perceived merits of any legal proceedings or unasserted claims as well as the perceived merits of the amount of relief sought or expected to be sought.




	 




	If the assessment of a contingency indicates that it is probable that a material loss has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be estimated, then the estimated liability would be accrued. If the assessment indicates that a potential material loss contingency is not probable but is reasonably possible, or is probable but cannot be estimated, then the nature
	of the contingent liability, together with an estimate of the range of possible loss if determinable and material would be disclosed. Loss contingencies considered to be remote by management are generally not disclosed unless they involve guarantees, in which case the guarantee would be disclosed.




	 




	MEDICAL SUPPLIES




	 




	Medical supplies include both western and traditional Chinese medicine, are valued on the lower of weighted average cost or market basis. Inventory includes product cost and inbound freight. Management compares the cost of medical supplies with the market value and allowance is made for writing down their inventories to market value, if such value is lower.




	 




	EQUIPMENT




	 




	Equipment is recorded at cost. Depreciation is computed over the estimated useful lives of the related asset type using the straight-line method. Maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred and the costs of additions and betterments that increase the useful lives of the assets are capitalized. When equipment is disposed, the cost and related accumulated depreciation
	are removed from the accounts and any gain or loss is included in other income or expenses.




	 




	CONSTRUCTION-IN-PROGRESS




	 




	A hospital facility currently under development is accounted for as construction-in-progress. Construction-in-progress is recorded at acquisition cost, including land rights cost, development expenditure, and professional fees capitalized during the course of construction for the purpose of financing the project. Upon completion of the project, the cost of construction-in-progress
	will be transferred to fixed assets, at which time depreciation will commence.




	 




	CAPITALIZATION OF INTEREST




	 




	Interest cost is capitalized for qualifying assets when the portion of the interest cost incurred during the assets' acquisition periods could have been avoided if expenditures for the assets had not been made. The amount capitalized in an accounting period is determined by applying the capitalization rate to the average amount of accumulated expenditures for the asset
	during the period. The capitalization rates used in an accounting period is based on the rates applicable to borrowings outstanding during the period (also see Note 4).




	 




	Capitalization period covers the duration of the activities required to get the asset ready for its intended use, provided that expenditures for the asset have been made and interest cost is being incurred. Interest capitalization continues as long as those activities and the incurrence of interest cost continue.

	IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS




	 




	The Company’s long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment in accordance with the guidance of FASB Topic ASC 360, “Property, Plant, and Equipment”, and FASB ASC Topic 205 “Presentation of Financial Statements”. The Company tests for impairment losses on long-lived assets used in operations whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate
	that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. Whenever any such impairment exists, an impairment loss will be recognized for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value.




	 




	The Company tests long-lived assets for recoverability at least annually or more frequently upon the occurrence of an event or when circumstances indicate that the net carrying amount is greater than its fair value. Assets are grouped and evaluated at the lowest level for their identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets.
	The Company considers historical performance and future estimated results in its evaluation of potential impairment and then compares the carrying amount of the asset to the future estimated cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset. If the carrying amount of the asset exceeds estimated expected undiscounted future cash flows, the Company measures the amount of impairment by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to its fair value. The estimation of fair value is generally measured by discounting
	expected future cash flows at the rate the Company utilizes to evaluate potential investments. The Company estimates fair value based on the information available in making whatever estimates, judgments and projections are considered necessary. There was no impairment of long-lived assets for the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015.




	 




	BASIC AND DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE




	 




	Earnings per share (EPS) is calculated in accordance with the FASB ASC Topic 260, “Earnings Per Share.” Basic net income (loss) per share is based upon the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted net income (loss) per share is based on the assumption that all dilutive convertible shares and stock options were converted or exercised. Dilution
	is computed by applying the treasury stock method. Under this method, options and warrants are assumed to be exercised at the beginning of the period (or at the time of issuance, if later), and as if funds obtained thereby were used to purchase common stock at the average market price during the period. Potentially dilutive securities to purchase 100,000 shares of common stock were not included in the calculation of the diluted earnings per share as their effect would be anti-dilutive for the six months ended
	June 30, 2016. During the six month period ended June 30, 2016, the average market price of the common stock was less than the exercise price of the stock options and the Company was in net loss position. Accordingly, the stock options were anti-dilutive and have not been included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share.




	 




	INCOME TAXES




	 




	FASB ASC Topic 740, "Income Taxes” requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements or tax returns. Under this method, deferred income taxes are recognized for the tax consequences in future years of differences between the tax bases of assets and
	liabilities and their financial reporting amounts at each period end based on enacted tax laws and statutory tax rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income. Valuation allowances are established, when necessary, to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized.




	 




	In accordance with ASC Topic 740-10, “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes — An Interpretation of FASB ASC Topic 740”   

	,    

	which requires income tax positions to meet a more-likely-than-not recognition threshold to be recognized in the financial statements. Tax positions
	that previously failed to meet the more-likely-than-not threshold should be recognized in the first subsequent financial reporting period in which that threshold is met. Previously recognized tax positions that no longer meet the more-likely-than-not threshold should be derecognized in the first subsequent financial reporting period in which that threshold is no longer met.




	 




	The application of tax laws and regulations is subject to legal and factual interpretation, judgment and uncertainty. Tax laws and regulations themselves are subject to change as a result of changes in fiscal policy, changes in legislation, the evolution of regulations and court rulings. Therefore, the actual liability may be materially different from our estimates, which
	could result in the need to record additional tax liabilities or potentially reverse previously recorded tax liabilities or deferred tax asset valuation allowance.

	The Company has made a comprehensive review of its portfolio of tax positions in accordance with recognition standards established by ASC 740-10 and has not recognized any material uncertain tax positions.




	 




	In addition, companies in the PRC are required to pay business taxes consisting of 5% of income they derive from providing medical treatment, as well as city construction taxes and educational taxes which are 7% and 3%, respectively, of the business taxes. In April 2010, the Company was granted an exemption from these taxes until further notice from the tax bureau.




	 




	The Company had accrued approximately $40,000 in Other Payable as of June 30, 2016 for failure to file US tax returns and Form 5472 between the years 2006 to 2009. The Company is current with its required filings. In addition, the Company does not accrue United States income taxes on unremitted earnings from foreign operations, as it is the Company’s intention to
	invest these earnings in the foreign operations indefinitely.




	 




	STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS




	 




	In accordance with FASB ASC Topic 230, "Statement of Cash Flows," cash flows from the Company's operations are calculated based upon the local currencies. As a result, amounts related to assets and liabilities reported on the statement of cash flows will not necessarily agree with changes in the corresponding balances on the balance sheet.




	 




	EMPLOYEE BENEFIT COSTS




	 




	The Company contributes to a defined contribution retirement plan organized by the municipal government in the province in which the Company’s subsidiary is registered. The Company makes contributes for qualified employees that are eligible to participate in the plan. Contributions to the plan are calculated at 30% of the employees’ salaries above a fixed threshold
	amount; employees contribute 8% and the Company’s subsidiary contributes the balance of 22%. The Chinese government is responsible for the benefit liability to retired employees. The Company has no other material obligation for the payment of retirement beyond the annual contribution.




	 




	STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION




	 




	For purposes of determining the variables used in the calculation of stock compensation expense under the provisions of FASB ASC Topic 505, “Equity” and FASB ASC Topic 718, “Compensation   

	— Stock Compensation,”    

	we perform an analysis of current market data and historical
	Company data to calculate an estimate of implied volatility, the expected term of the option and the expected forfeiture rate. With the exception of the expected forfeiture rate, which is not an input, we use these estimates as variables in the Black Scholes model. Depending upon the number of stock options granted, any fluctuations in these calculations could have a material effect on the results presented in our consolidated statement of operations. In addition, any differences between estimated forfeitures
	and actual forfeitures could also have a material impact on our financial statements. 




	 




	Stock-based compensation costs that have been included in operating expenses amounted to $0 and $0, for the six month periods ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.




	 




	COMPREHENSIVE INCOME




	 




	The Company reports comprehensive income in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 220 “Comprehensive Income," which established standards for reporting and displaying comprehensive income and its components in a financial statement that is displayed with the same prominence as other financial statements.




	 




	Total comprehensive income is defined as all changes in stockholders' equity during a period, other than those resulting from investments by and distributions to stockholders (i.e., issuance of equity securities and dividends). Generally, for the Company, total comprehensive income (loss) equals net income (loss) plus or minus adjustments for currency translation. 

	Total
	comprehensive income (loss) represents the activity for a period net of related tax and was a gain of $62,807 and a loss of $87,563 for the three month periods ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

	 Total comprehensive income (loss) represents the activity for a period net of related tax and was a loss of $77,559 and $160,350 for the six month periods ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

	(UNAUDITED)




	 


	 






	While total comprehensive income is the activity in a period and is largely driven by net earnings in that period, accumulated other comprehensive income or loss (“AOCI”) represents the cumulative balance of other comprehensive income as of the balance sheet date. For the Company, AOCI is primarily the cumulative balance related to the currency adjustments
	and increased overall equity by $311,333 and $236,115 as of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.




	 




	RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS




	 




	Recent accounting pronouncements issued by the FASB, the AICPA and the SEC  did not, or are not believed by management to, have a material effect on the Company’s present or future consolidated financial statements. 




	 




	GOING CONCERN




	 




	The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles, which contemplate continuation of the Company as a going concern. However, the Company has negative working capital of $17,507,040, an accumulated deficit of $3,718,339, and a stockholders’ deficit of $2,950,826 as of June 30, 2016. The
	Company’s ability to continue as a going concern ultimately is dependent on the management’s ability to obtain equity or debt financing, attain further operating efficiencies, and achieve profitable operations. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company not be able to continue as a going concern.




	 




	Management has taken certain restructuring steps to provide the necessary capital to continue its operations. 

	These steps included: 1) plan to convert existing related party loans into equity, 2) plan to complete construction of the new hospital and begin generating revenue by 2017, 3) plan to increase sales revenue with additional
	medical equipment, 4) plan to obtain more funding from related party entity, that is controlled by the CEO to complete the construction of the new hospital. No assurances can be given that the steps taken will provide necessary capital for the Company to continue its operations.

	Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.




	 




	You should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with our condensed consolidated financial statements and the related condensed notes included elsewhere in this report. Our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The following discussion and analysis
	contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements.




	 




	Overview




	 




	Nanning Tongji Hospital, Inc. ("NTH" or “Tongji Hospital”) was established in Nanning city Guangxi province of the Peoples’ Republic of China ("PRC") by the Guangxi Tongji Medical Co. Ltd. and an individual on October 30, 2003.




	 




	NTH is a designated hospital for medical insurance in the city of Nanning and Guangxi province. NTH specializes in the areas of internal medicine, surgery, gynecology, pediatrics, emergency medicine, ophthalmology, medical cosmetology, rehabilitation, dermatology, otolaryngology, traditional Chinese medicine, medical imaging, anesthesia, acupuncture, physical therapy,
	health examination, and prevention.




	 




	On December 27, 2006, we, through our wholly-owned subsidiary, Tongji, Inc., a Colorado company, acquired 100% of the equity in NTH pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger. We issued 15,652,557 shares of common stock to the shareholders of NTH in exchange for 100% of the issued and outstanding shares of NTH. Accordingly, NTH became a wholly owned subsidiary of Tongji,
	Inc. We have been in the business of operating hospitals and providing healthcare services in Nanning, Guangxi province of the PRC.




	 




	The acquisition of NTH was accounted for as a reverse acquisition under the purchase method of accounting since the shareholders of NTH obtained control of the consolidated entity. Accordingly, the reorganization of the two companies was recorded as a recapitalization of NTH. We treated NTH as the continuing operating entity.   We have two sources of operating
	revenues: in-patient service revenues and out-patient service revenues. In addition to provide services to our patients, we also sell pharmaceutical drugs to our patients. Revenues from such sales are included in either our in-patient service revenues or our out-patient service revenues. Our revenues come from individuals as well as third-party payers, including PRC government programs and insurance providers, under which the hospital is paid based upon local government established charges. Revenues are recorded
	at estimated net amounts due from patients or third-party payers. Revenues from pharmaceutical drug sales are recognized upon the drug being administered to a patient or at the time a prescription by a registered physician is filled.




	 




	Patient revenues are recorded based on pre-established rates set by the local government. The Company bills for services provided to Medicare patients through a medical card (the US equivalent of an insurance card). Historically, there have been no significant differences between the amounts the Company has billed the government Medicare funds and the amounts collected
	from the Medicare funds.




	 




	We had two major customers for the six month periods ended June 30, 2016 and 2015: Nanning Social Insurance Center accounted for 26% and 36% of revenue for the six month periods ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. China UMS accounted for 6% and 21% of revenue for the six month periods ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. As of June 30, 2016, accounts receivable
	due from Nanning Social Insurance Center and China UMS were approximately $306,000 and $525, respectively.




	 





	The Company purchases the majority of its medicine supplies from Guangxi Kyushu Pharmaceutical Group Co., Ltd. Medicine purchased from them accounted for 78% and 2% of all medicine purchases for six month periods ended June 30, 2016 and 2015.

	The rest are from around 16 different suppliers, one of which is a related party with one common
	major stockholder which accounted for 1% of total medicine purchased for the six-month period ended June 30, 2016.

	Difference in the Medical System between the U.S. and China




	 




	In the United States most hospitals have contracts with health insurance companies that provide reduced rates for healthcare services for patients with health insurance. Medicare and Medicaid patients also receive reduced rates. Functionally, the patient is billed for health services at the higher rate normally charged to patients without insurance. The amount billed is
	then reduced by the charges paid by the insurance carrier and by the difference (sometimes known as the "contractual allowance") between the normal rate for the services and the reduced rate that the hospital estimates it will receive from Medicare, Medicaid and insurance companies.




	 




	For financial reporting purposes, hospitals in the United States record revenues based upon established billing rates less adjustment for contractual allowances. Revenues are recorded based upon the amounts due from the patients and third-party payers, including federal and state agencies (under the Medicare and Medicaid programs) managed care health plans, health insurance
	companies, and employers. Estimates of contractual allowances under third-party payer arrangements are based upon the payment terms specified in the related contractual agreements. Third-party payer contractual payment terms are generally based upon predetermined rates per diagnosis, per diem rates, or discounted fee-for-service rates.




	 




	Due to the complexities involved in determining amounts ultimately due under reimbursement arrangements with a large number of third-party payers, which are often subject to interpretation, the reimbursement actually received by U.S. hospitals for health care services is sometimes different from their estimates.




	 




	The medical system in the PRC is different from that in the United States. Private medical insurance is not generally available to the PRC’s population and as a result services and medications provided by our hospital are usually paid by cash or by the Medicare agencies of the Nanning municipal government and the Guangxi provincial government. Our billing system
	automatically calculates the reimbursements that we are entitled to base upon regulations promulgated by these government agencies. We bill the Medicare agencies directly for services provided to patients covered by these Medicare programs. In addition, due to the fact that rates are established by the government, there is no difference between rates for patients covered by Medicare and patients who pay cash.




	 




	Since we only deal with the Nanning municipal and the Guangxi provincial Medicare agencies, we are familiar with their regulations pertaining to reimbursements. As a result, there is normally no material difference between the amounts we bill and the amounts we receive for services provided to Medicare patients.




	 




	Results of Operation - Three Months Ended June 30, 2016 and 2015




	 





	Material changes of items in our Statement of Operations for the three months ended June 30, 2016, as compared to the three months ended June 30, 2015, are discussed below.

	 




	 





	Operating Revenues

	- Operating revenue for the three-month period ended June 30, 2016, which resulted primarily from in-patient services and out-patient services, was $559,260, a decrease of $ 89,032 or 14%, as compared with the operating revenue of $648,292 for the same period of 2015. Our in-patient service revenue was $333,397
	for the three-month period ended June 30, 2016, as compared to $240,372 for the same period in 2015, an increase of $ 93,025 or 39%. The increase in the in-patient service revenue was primarily due to the replacement of the person in charged of our orthopedic inpatient department. Our out-patient service revenue was $225,863 for the three month period ended June 30, 2016, a decrease of $182,057 or 45% as compared to 407,920 for the same period in 2015. The decrease in the out-patient service revenue was primarily
	due to the elimination of our prepaid health department and resignation of our emergency department physician.




	 





	Operating Expenses -

	Operating expenses were $583,930 for the three month-period ended June 30, 2016, a decrease of 16% as compared to $698,831 for the same period of 2015, which was in line with the decrease in our out-patient service revenues.




	 





	Loss from Operations -

	Operating loss was $24,670 for the three-month period ended June 30, 2016, a decrease of $25,869 or 51% as compared to an operating loss of $50,539 for the same period in 2015. The primary reason for the decreased operating loss is the substantial decrease in our operating expenses.

	Interest Expense -

	Interest expense for the three-month period ended June 30, 2016 was $9,573 as compared to $49,657 for the three-month period ended June 30, 2015, a decrease of $40,084 or 80%.

	The decrease was primarily due to the decrease in related party borrowings to fund the new hospital
	construction.





	 





	Net Loss

	- As a result of the forgoing, the Company had a net loss of $27,472 during the quarter ended June 30, 2016, compared to a net loss of $87,882 for the comparative period in 2015, a decrease of $60,410 or 69%.




	 




	Results of Operation - Six Months Ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 




	 




	Material changes of items in our Statement of Operations for the six months ended June 30, 2016, as compared to the six months ended June 30, 2015, are discussed below.  




	 





	Operating Revenues -

	Operating revenue for the six-month period ended June 30, 2015, which resulted primarily from in-patient service and out-patient service, was $1,060,926, a decrease of $138,148 or 12%, as compared with the operating revenue of $1,199,074 for the same period of 2015. Our in-patient service revenue was $591,299
	for the six-month period ended June 30, 2016, as compared to $463,390 for the same period in 2015, an increase of $127,909 or 28%. The increase in the in-patient service revenue was primarily due to the replacement of the person in charged of our orthopedic inpatient department.  Our out-patient service revenue was $469,627 for the six-month period ended June 30, 2016, a decrease of $266,057 or 36% as compared to $735,684 for the same period in 2015. The decrease in the out-patient service revenue was
	primarily due to the elimination of our prepaid health department and the resignation of an emergency department physician.




	 





	Operating Expenses -

	Operating expenses were $1,137,537 for the six-month period ended June 30, 2016, a decrease of 16% as compared to $1,279,315 for the same period in 2015. The decrease was primarily due to the decrease in administrative and other operating expenses and medicine and supplies expenses.




	  





	Loss from Operations - Operating

	loss was $76,611 for the six-month period ended June 30, 2016, a decrease of $3,630 or 5% as compared to an operating loss of $80,241 for the same period in 2015. The primary reason for the decrease in operating loss is the decrease in our operating expenses.   




	 





	Interest Expense - Interest

	expense for the six-month period ended June 30, 2016 was $90,388 as compared to $97,670 for the six-month period ended June, 2015, a slight decrease of $7,282 or 7%.  





	 





	Net Loss -

	As a result of the forgoing, the Company had a net loss of $152,777 during the six month period ended June 30, 2016, compared to a net loss of $158,078 for the comparative period in 2015, a slight decrease of $5,301 or 3%.




	 




	Trends, Events and Uncertainties




	 




	The China Ministry of Health, as well as other related agencies, has proposed changes to the price limit we can charge for medical services, drugs and medications. We cannot predict the impact of these proposed changes since the changes are not fully defined and we do not know whether those proposed changes will be implemented or when they may take effect.




	 




	We are constructing a new hospital building on leased land. The hospital building is being constructed by Guangxi Construction Engineering Corporation Langdong 8th Group (“Langdong 8th Group”). Costs capitalized primarily consists of payments for construction costs, acquisition cost, land rights cost, development expenditure, professional
	fees, and capitalized interest As of June 30, 2016, the Company had paid approximately $15,011,055 for the construction of the hospital. . In addition to what we had paid for the hospital building construction, we estimate the additional costs to complete the project to be $30,000,000. The Company expects to seek to obtain additional funding through the completion of additional equity, debt, or joint venture transactions. The land lease term will start upon completion of the new hospital construction. The new
	hospital is expected to be completed by the end of 2017 subject to availability of funds.

	We plan to acquire other hospitals and companies involved in the healthcare industry in the PRC using cash and shares of our common stock. Substantial capital may be needed for these acquisitions and we may need to raise additional funds through the sale of our common stock, debt financing or other arrangements. We do not have any commitments
	or arrangements from any person to provide us with any additional capital. Additional capital may not be available to us, or if available, on acceptable terms, in which case we would not be able to acquire other hospitals or businesses in the healthcare industry.





	 




	Other than the factors listed above we do not know of any trends, events or uncertainties that have had or are reasonably expected to have a material impact on our net sales or revenues or income from continuing operations. Our business is not seasonal in nature.




	 




	Accounting Estimates




	 




	In the United States most hospitals have contracts with health insurance companies that provide reduced rates for healthcare services for patients with health insurance. Medicare and Medicaid patients also receive reduced rates. Functionally, the patient is billed for health services at the higher rate normally charged to patients without insurance. The amount billed is
	then reduced by the charges paid by the insurance carrier and by the difference (sometimes known as the "contractual allowance") between the normal rate for the services and the reduced rate that the hospital estimates it will receive from Medicare, Medicaid and insurance companies.

Revenues are recorded based upon the amounts due from the patients and third-party payers, including federal and state agencies (under the Medicare and Medicaid programs) managed care health plans, health insurance
	companies, and employers. Estimates of contractual allowances under third-party payer arrangements are based upon the payment terms specified in the related contractual agreements. Third-party payer contractual payment terms are generally based upon predetermined rates per diagnosis, per diem rates, or discounted fee-for-service rates.




	 




	Due to the complexities involved in determining amounts ultimately due under reimbursement arrangements with a large number of third-party payers, which are often subject to interpretation, the reimbursement actually received by U.S. hospitals for health care services is sometimes different from their estimates.




	 




	The medical system in the PRC is different from that in the United States.

We bill the Medicare agencies directly for services provided to patients covered by theses Medicare programs. In addition, due to the fact that rates are established by the government, there is no difference between rates for patients covered by Medicare and patients who only use cash.




	 




	Since we only deal with the Nanning municipal and the Guangxi provincial Medicare agencies we are familiar with their regulations pertaining to reimbursements. As a result, there is normally no material difference between the amounts we bill and the   

	amounts we receive for services provided to Medicare patients .  





	 




	Liquidity and Capital Resources




	 




	We generally finance our operations through our operating profits and borrowings from related parties. As of the date of this report, we have not experienced any difficulty in raising funds from related parties, and we have not experienced any liquidity problems in settling our payables in our ordinary course of business. We believe that we have adequate funds and capital
	with respect to conducting its business over the next twelve months.

	The Company carefully monitors and controls the amount of cash used to fund operating activities. However, substantial funds are required to fund the construction costs on the new hospital building and a lawsuit settlement (see Note 5 to the Financial Statements accompanying this Report). Financing of operations has come primarily from advances from related parties. We
	are dependent on related parties to provide working capital and pay our management team until such time as our operations are profitable. There can be no assurances that related parties will continue to provide additional capital. Without additional capital, we may be forced to cease operations and liquidate.




	 




	Operating Activities




	 




	Net cash used in operating activities primarily consists of net loss, as adjusted by depreciation, stock option, and changes in operating assets and liabilities such as accounts receivable, medical supplies, capital lease deposits, prepaid expense and other current assets, accounts payables and accrued liabilities and other payables.




	 




	Net cash used in operating activities was $23,215 for the six months ended June 30, 2016, a decrease of $22,457 or 49%, as compared with the net cash used in operating activities of $45,672 for the same period in 2015. The decrease in net cash used in operating activities was primarily due to an increase of $47,517 in accounts payable and accrued expenses, and an increase
	of $29,993 in accounts receivable. 




	 




	Investing Activities




	 




	Net cash used in investing activities was $104,148 for the six months ended June 30, 2016, a increase of $7,417 or 8%, as compared with the net cash used in investing activities of $96,731 for the same period in 2015. The increase in net cash used in investing activities was primarily due to the addition of fixed assets $15,302.




	 




	Financing Activities




	 




	Net cash provided by financing activities primarily consists of proceeds from related party loans.




	 




	Net cash provided by financing activities was $154,316 for the six months ended June 30, a decrease of $27,095 or 15%, as compared with the net cash provided by financing activities of $181,411 for the same period in 2015. The decrease was primarily attributable to decrease in funds advanced by related parties for the construction of the new hospital building.




	 




	Working Capital




	 




	Our working capital was negative $17,507,040 as of June 30, 2016, as compared with negative $17,782,721 as of December 31, 2015, a decrease of $275,681, which is primarily attributable to the increase in related party loan of approximately $244,000 and decrease in other payables of $19,000.

	Rental Commitments




	 




	On March 1, 2016, the Company renewed the lease agreement for their hospital with Guangxi Tongji Medicine Co. Ltd that expired in December 2015. Monthly lease payment under the new lease is approximately $4,800. The lease will expire on February 28, 2019. The Company is also in the process of building a new 600-bed hospital in Nanning, China. It expects the new hospital
	to be completed by 2017. The hospital is being constructed by Guangxi Construction Engineering Corporation Langdong 8th Group and, when completed, the land on which the hospital is located will be leased by the Company for a twenty-year term. The annual lease payments will gradually increase each year. Based on the exchange rate at June 30, 2016, minimum future lease payments are as follows:

	Going Concern




	 




	The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles, which contemplate continuation of the Company as a going concern. However, the Company has negative working capital of $17,507,040, an accumulated deficit of $3,718,339, and a stockholders’ deficit of $2,950,826 as of June 30, 2016. The
	Company’s ability to continue as a going concern ultimately is dependent on the management’s ability to obtain equity or debt financing, attain further operating efficiencies, and achieve profitable operations. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company not be able to continue as a going concern.




	 




	Management has taken certain restructuring steps to provide the necessary capital to continue its operations.  

	 

	 

	 

	 

	These steps included: 1) plan to convert existing related party loans into equity, 2) plan to
	complete construction of the new hospital and begin generating revenue by 2017, 3) plan to increase sales revenue with additional medical equipment, 4) plan to obtain more funding from related party entity that is controlled by the CEO to complete the construction of the new hospital. No assurances can be given that the steps taken will provide necessary capital for the Company to continue its operations.





	 




	Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements




	 




	We do not have any off-balance sheet items reasonably likely to have a material effect on our financial condition.

	Our management maintains disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that the material information required to be disclosed by us in our periodic reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded,
	processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.




	 




	As of June 30, 2016, our management, under the supervision of and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as required by Rules 13a-15(b) and 15d-15(b) under the Exchange Act. Based upon this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer
	concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of June 30, 2016 as a result of the material weaknesses identified in our internal control over financial reporting, which are discussed below. Our management considers our internal control over financial reporting to be an integral part of our disclosure controls and procedures.




	 




	Specifically, our management identified certain matters involving internal control and our operations that it considered to be material weaknesses. As defined in the Exchange Act, a material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of
	the registrant's annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. The material weaknesses identified by our management as of June 30, 2016, are described below:




	 








	 






	●






	We did not design, implement, or maintain effective entity-level controls related to our control environment, resulting in the following significant control deficiencies:








	 








	 






	o






	The Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, which was specifically designed for public company applicability, has yet to be formally acknowledged by members of management and the finance department.








	 








	 






	o






	There is an absence of independence and financial expertise on the Board of Directors, and we do not have an Audit Committee or a formalized internal audit function, limiting its ability to provide effective oversight of our management.








	 








	 






	o






	The full implementation of, and related training for, our newly-formalized IT policies and procedures were still in process at year-end. Accordingly, we lacked sufficiently-trained personnel to provide for adequate segregation of duties within the accounting system and effective oversight of controls over access, change, data, and security management.








	 




	2016 Planned Remediation




	As financial conditions permit, we plan to take the following actions to improve our internal control over financial reporting.




	 








	 






	●






	Require all members of our management and the finance department across all corporate entities to certify receipt of the revised Code of Business Conduct and Ethics by signature. Signed copies will be retained by our management. Thereafter, our management plans to periodically require signatories to acknowledge that they understand the contents of the Code of Business
	Conduct and Ethics, and whether they are aware of anyone in our Company that might have violated some part of the Code.








	 






	 




	25










	 






	 





	Item 4. Controls and Procedures.


	- continued






	 








	 






	●






	Recruit an independent financial expert to the Board of Directors to chair an Audit Committee and formalize roles and responsibilities over our internal control over financial reporting for the Board and our management. Our management also plans to develop and implement a formal corporate internal audit capability, reporting directly to an independent Audit Committee,
	to provide effective oversight of our internal control over financial reporting.








	 








	 






	●






	Continue to engage the services of qualified consultants with China GAAP, U.S. GAAP and SEC reporting experience to support our financial reporting and SOX compliance requirements, including assistance with the following:








	 








	 






	o






	Remediating identified material weaknesses;








	 








	 






	o






	Monitoring our internal control over financial reporting on an ongoing basis;








	 








	 






	o






	Managing our period-end financial closing and reporting processes; and








	 








	 






	o






	Identifying and resolving non-routine or complex accounting matters.








	 








	 






	●






	Complete the implementation of, and related training for, its IT policies and procedures related to access, change, data, and security management to ensure that all relevant financial information is secure, identified, captured, processed, and reported within the accounting system and spreadsheets supporting financial reporting.








	 








	 






	●






	Continue providing training to accounting personnel regarding our significant policies and procedures related to accounting, finance, and internal control to ensure that financial reporting competencies are strengthened.








	 




	Our management will continue to monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of its disclosure controls and procedures, as well as its internal control over financial reporting, on an ongoing basis, and is committed to taking further action and implementing additional improvements, as necessary and as funds allow. However, our management cannot guarantee that the measures taken
	or any future measures will remediate the material weaknesses identified or that any additional material weaknesses or significant deficiencies will not arise in the future due to a failure to implement and maintain adequate internal control over financial reporting.




	 




	Notwithstanding the material weaknesses described above, our management believes that there are no material inaccuracies or omissions of material fact and, to the best of its knowledge, believes that the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report present fairly, in all material respects, our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows
	for the periods presented in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.




	 




	Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting




	 




	No changes in the Company's internal control over financial reporting has come to management's attention during the Company's last fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting.

	PART II - OTHER INFORMATION




	 










	Item 1.


	Legal Proceedings.








	 




	In September 2009, Guangxi Nanning Tingyouyuxiang Commercial Co., Ltd. (“Tingyouyuxiang”) filed a civil suit against Nanning Tongji Hospital, Inc. (“NTH”), a subsidiary of the Company in the People’s Court. In the complaint, Tingyouyuxiang asserted a breach of contract claim against NTH, alleging that NTH had failed to make timely and total
	payment of RMB 5,050,000 (approximately $800,000)  under certain Supplement Agreement by and among NTH, Tingyouyuxiang and the Eighth Group of Langdong Village Committee, Nanhu Community Office, Qingxiu District, Nanning City (the “Village Committee”). One December 30, 2009, the People’s Court ruled that NTH shall pay to Tingyouyuxiang damages of RMB 5,050,000 (approximately $800,000) plus interest and the court hearing fee approximately $320,000. On March 9, 2013, NTH appealed to
	the Intermediate Court, alleging, among other things, that NTH was never served. On June 6, 2013, the Intermediate Court remanded the case to the People’s Court.   

	On April 16, 2014, the Intermediate Court dismissed Tingyouyuxiang’s appeal and affirmed the decision of the People’s Court. Upon settlement of the lawsuit, the Company had accrued approximately $1,381,000 in settlement payable as of

	 June 30,

	2016.

	NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
	STATEMENTS




	March 31, 2017




	(UNAUDITED)




	 




	NOTE 1- ORGANIZATION




	 




	Nanning Tongji Hospital, Inc. ("NTH") was established in Nanning in
	the province of Guangxi of the People’s Republic of China
	("PRC" or “China”) by the Nanning Tongji Medical Co.
	Ltd. and an individual on October 30, 2003.




	 




	NTH is a designated hospital for medical insurance in the city of
	Nanning and Guangxi province. NTH specializes in the areas of
	internal medicine, surgery, gynecology, pediatrics, emergency
	medicine, ophthalmology, medical cosmetology, rehabilitation,
	dermatology, otolaryngology, traditional Chinese medicine, medical
	imaging, anesthesia, acupuncture, physical therapy, health
	examination, and prevention.




	 




	On December 19, 2006, NTH filed the Articles of Incorporation in
	the State of Nevada to establish Tongji Healthcare Group, Inc. (the
	"Company"). On the same day, Tongji, Inc., a wholly owned
	subsidiary of the Company, was incorporated in the State of
	Colorado. Tongji Inc. was later dissolved on March 25,
	2011.




	 




	On December 27, 2006, Tongji Inc. acquired 100% of the equity in
	NTH pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger, pursuant to which
	NTH became a wholly owned subsidiary of Tongji Inc. Pursuant to the
	Agreement and Plan of Merger, the Company issued 15,652,557 shares
	of common stock to the stockholders of NTH in exchange for 100% of
	the issued and outstanding shares of common stock of NTH.
	Thereafter and for purposes of these consolidated financial
	statements the "Company" and "NTH" are used to refer to the
	operations of NTH. The acquisition of NTH was accounted for as a
	reverse acquisition under the purchase method of accounting since
	the stockholders of NTH obtained control of the consolidated
	entity. Accordingly, the reorganization of the two companies was
	recorded as a recapitalization of NTH, with NTH being treated as
	the continuing operating entity.




	 




	The Company is authorized to issue 50,000,000 shares of common
	stock, par value $0.001 per share and 20,000,000 shares of
	preferred stock, par value $0.001 per share.




	 




	According to the PRC Regulation of Healthcare Institutions,
	hospitals are subject to registration with the health department of
	the local government to obtain business license for hospital
	services. We received our renewed business license from Nanning
	municipal government in November 2007, and this license is valid
	until November, 2020. Other existing regulations having material
	effects on our business include regulations dealing with
	physician's licensing, usage of medicine and injection, and public
	security in health and medical advertising.




	 




	NTH must register with and maintain an operating license from the
	local health department, due to the fact that NTH currently
	maintains a facility with over 100 beds. NTH is subject to review
	by the local health department at least once every three years. If
	NTH fails to meet their standards, NTH’s business license may
	be revoked. NTH is also obligated to provide free services or
	dispatch our physicians or other employees in the event of a need
	for public assistance. NTH dedicates a very small percentage of its
	resources to providing free public services.




	 




	NOTE 2- SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES




	 




	The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial
	statements have been prepared by management without audit pursuant
	to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange
	Commission. Certain information and disclosures normally included
	in financial statements prepared in accordance with generally
	accepted accounting principles have been condensed or omitted as
	allowed by such rules and regulations, and management believes that
	the disclosures are adequate to make the information presented not
	misleading. These condensed consolidated financial statements
	include all of the adjustments, which, in the opinion of
	management, are necessary to a fair presentation of financial
	position and results of operations. All such adjustments are of a
	normal and recurring nature. Interim results are not necessarily
	indicative of results for a full year. The condensed consolidated
	balance sheet information as of December 31, 2016 was derived from
	the audited consolidated financial statements included in the Form
	10-K. These condensed consolidated financial statements should be
	read in conjunction with the audited financial statements in the
	Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year
	ended on December 31, 2016(“Form 10-K”), filed with the
	Commission on April 18, 2017.




	 




	This summary of significant accounting policies of the Company is
	presented to assist in understanding the Company’s
	consolidated financial statements. The consolidated financial
	statements and notes are representations of the Company’s
	management, which is responsible for their integrity and
	objectivity. These accounting policies conform to generally
	accepted accounting principles and have been consistently applied
	in the preparation of the condensed consolidated financial
	statements and the Form 10-K.

	NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
	STATEMENTS




	March 31, 2017




	(UNAUDITED)




	 





	NOTE 2- SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES


	-
	continued





	 




	BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND CONSOLIDATION




	 




	These financial statements present the Company’s results of
	operations, financial position and cash flows on a consolidated
	basis. The consolidated financial statements include the Company
	and its wholly owned subsidiaries. Intercompany transactions and
	accounts have been eliminated in consolidation. Our policy is to
	consolidate all subsidiaries in which a greater than 50% voting
	interest is owned and all variable interest entities to which we
	had a variable interest and effectively control the entity. The
	Company operates in one segment in accordance with the accounting
	guidance FASB ASC topic 280, “Segment
	Reporting”.




	 




	CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS




	 




	For purposes of the statements of cash flows, the Company considers
	all highly liquid debt instruments purchased with a maturity of
	three months or less to be cash equivalents. A substantial amount
	of the Company’s cash is held in bank accounts in the PRC and
	is not protected by Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC)
	insurance or any other similar insurance. Cash held in China
	amounted to $42,251 as of March 31, 2017. Given the current
	economic environment and the financial condition of the banking
	industry, there is a risk that the deposits may not be readily
	available or covered by such insurance. The Company has had no loss
	of cash in domestic or foreign banks in past years.




	 




	USE OF ESTIMATES




	 




	The preparation of these consolidated financial statements in
	accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
	United States of America requires management to make estimates and
	assumptions that affect the reported assets and liabilities,
	disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of
	the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of
	net revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual
	results may differ from those estimates and such differences may be
	material. The more significant estimates and assumptions by
	management include, among others, useful lives and residual values
	of fixed assets, valuation of inventories, accounts receivable,
	stock based compensation, and allowance for bad debt. The current
	economic environment has increased the degree of uncertainty
	inherent in these estimates and assumptions.




	 




	TRANSLATION ADJUSTMENT




	 




	The Company's functional currency is the Chinese Renminbi (RMB).
	The reporting currency is that of the US Dollar. Capital accounts
	of the consolidated financial statements are translated into United
	States dollars from RMB at their historical exchange rates when the
	capital transactions occurred. Assets and liabilities are
	translated at the exchange rates as of the balance sheet date.
	Income and expenditures are translated at the average exchange rate
	of the year. The RMB is not freely convertible into foreign
	currency and all foreign currency exchange transactions must take
	place through authorized institutions. No representation is made
	that the RMB amounts could have been, or could be, converted into
	US dollar at the rates used in translation.




	 




	The exchange rates used to translate amounts in RMB into USD for
	the purposes of preparing the financial statements were as
	follows:

	NOTE 2- SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES


	-
	continued





	 




	RECLASSIFICATIONS




	 




	Certain items previously reported under specific financial
	statement captions have been reclassified to conform to the current
	year presentation.




	 




	REVENUE RECOGNITION




	 




	The Company's revenue recognition policies are in compliance with
	Staff Accounting Bulletin 104 (ASC 605). Service revenue is
	recognized on the dates services were rendered. When a formal
	arrangement exists, the price is fixed or determinable. When the
	service is completed, no other significant obligations of the
	Company exist and collectability is reasonably assured. Payments
	received before all of the relevant criteria for revenue
	recognition are satisfied are recorded as unearned
	revenue.




	 




	The Company generates revenue from individual patients as well as
	third-party payers, including PRC government programs and insurance
	providers, under which the hospital is paid based upon government
	established charges. Revenues for pharmaceutical drug sales are
	recognized upon the drug being administered to a
	patient.




	 




	Patient revenues are recorded based on pre-established rates set by
	the local government. The Company bills for services provided to
	Medicare patients through a medical card (the US equivalent of an
	insurance card). There have not been significant differences
	between the amounts the Company has billed the government Medicare
	funds and the amounts collected from the Medicare
	funds.




	 




	ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE




	 




	Accounts receivable are recorded at the estimated net realizable
	amounts from government fund, insurance companies and patients.
	Collections have not been considered an area that exposes the
	Company to additional risk. Hospital staff verifies patient
	coverage prior to examinations and/or procedures.




	 




	For any Medicare patient who visits the hospital and is qualified
	for acceptance, the hospital will only include the portion that the
	social insurance organization will pay in the accounts receivable
	and collects the self-pay portion in cash at the time of service.
	Management continues to estimate the likelihood of bad debt on an
	ongoing basis.




	 




	The Company has estimated a bad debt allowance of approximately
	$28,268 as of March 31, 2017 and $28,000 as of December 31,
	2016.




	 




	FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS




	 




	The Company applies the provisions of FASB ASC Topic 825, which
	requires all entities to disclose the fair value of financial
	instruments, both assets and liabilities recognized and not
	recognized on the balance sheet, for which it is practicable to
	estimate fair value, and defines fair value of a financial
	instrument as the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged
	in a current transaction between willing parties. As of March 31,
	2017 and December 31, 2016 the fair value of cash and cash
	equivalents, accounts receivable, other current receivable,
	accounts payable and accrued expenses, settlement payable, capital
	lease payable and other payables approximated the carrying value
	due to the short maturity of the instruments, quoted market prices
	or interest rates which fluctuate with market rates except for
	related party debt or receivables for which it is not practicable
	to estimate fair value.




	 




	FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS




	 




	FASB ASC Topic 820, “Fair Value Measurements and
	Disclosures”, establishes a framework for measuring fair
	value and requires additional disclosures about the use of fair
	value measurements.




	 




	Various inputs are considered when determining the fair value of
	the Company’s investments, and long-term debt. The inputs or
	methodologies used for valuing securities are not necessarily an
	indication of the risk associated with investing in these
	securities. These inputs are summarized in the three broad levels
	listed below.

	NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
	STATEMENTS

	(UNAUDITED)




	 





	NOTE 2- SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES


	-
	continued





	 








	 






	·






	Level 1 – observable market inputs that are unadjusted quoted
	prices for identical assets or liabilities in active
	markets.








	 






	·






	Level 2 – other significant observable inputs (including
	quoted prices for similar securities, interest rates, credit risk,
	etc.).








	 






	·






	Level 3 – significant unobservable inputs (including the
	Company’s own assumptions in determining the fair value of
	investments).








	 




	The carrying value of financial assets and liabilities recorded at
	fair value is measured on a recurring or non-recurring basis.
	Financial assets and liabilities measured on a non-recurring basis
	are those that are adjusted to fair value when a significant event
	occurs. The Company had no financial assets or liabilities carried
	and measured on a nonrecurring basis during the reporting periods.
	Financial assets and liabilities measured on a recurring basis are
	those that are adjusted to fair value each time a financial
	statement is prepared. The Company had no financial assets and
	liabilities carried at fair value on a recurring
	basis.




	 




	The availability of inputs observable in the market varies from
	instrument to instrument and depends on a variety of factors
	including the type of instrument, whether the instrument is
	actively traded, and other characteristics particular to the
	transaction. For many financial instruments, pricing inputs are
	readily observable in the market, the valuation methodology used is
	widely accepted by market participants, and the valuation does not
	require significant management discretion. For other financial
	instruments, pricing inputs are less observable in the market and
	may require management judgment.




	 




	CONCENTRATIONS, RISKS, AND UNCERTAINTIES




	 




	All of the Company’s operations are located in the PRC. There
	can be no assurance that the Company will be able to successfully
	continue to operate and failure to do so would have a material
	adverse effect on the Company’s financial position, results
	of operations and cash flows. In addition, the success of the
	Company’s operations is subject to numerous contingencies,
	some of which are beyond management’s control. These
	contingencies include general economic conditions, the price of
	medicine, competition, governmental and political conditions, and
	changes in regulations. Because the Company is dependent on the
	domestic market of the PRC, the Company is subject to various
	additional political, economic and other uncertainties. Among other
	risks, the Company’s operations will be subject to risk of
	restrictions on the transfer of funds, domestic policy changes,
	changing taxation policies, foreign exchange restrictions, and
	political and governmental regulations.




	 




	CONTINGENCIES




	 




	Certain conditions may exist as of the date the consolidated
	financial statements are issued. These conditions may result in a
	future loss to the Company but which will only be resolved when one
	or more future events occur or fail to occur. The Company’s
	management and legal counsel assess such contingent liabilities,
	and such assessment inherently involves an exercise of judgment. In
	assessing loss contingencies related to legal proceedings that are
	pending against the Company or unasserted claims that may result in
	such proceedings, the Company’s legal counsel evaluates the
	perceived merits of any legal proceedings or unasserted claims as
	well as the perceived merits of the amount of relief sought or
	expected to be sought.




	 




	If the assessment of a contingency indicates that it is probable
	that a material loss has been incurred and the amount of the
	liability can be estimated, then the estimated liability would be
	accrued. If the assessment indicates that a potential material loss
	contingency is not probable but is reasonably possible, or is
	probable but cannot be estimated, then the nature of the contingent
	liability, together with an estimate of the range of possible loss
	if determinable and material would be disclosed. Loss contingencies
	considered to be remote by management are generally not disclosed
	unless they involve guarantees, in which case the guarantee would
	be disclosed.




	 




	MEDICAL SUPPLIES




	 




	Medical supplies include both western and traditional Chinese
	medicine, are valued on the lower of weighted average cost or
	market basis. Inventory includes product cost and inbound freight.
	Management compares the cost of medical supplies with the market
	value and allowance is made for writing down their inventories to
	market value, if such value is lower.

	EQUIPMENT




	 




	Equipment is recorded at cost. Depreciation is computed over the
	estimated useful lives of the related asset type using the
	straight-line method. Maintenance and repairs are expensed as
	incurred and the costs of additions and betterments that increase
	the useful lives of the assets are capitalized. When equipment is
	disposed, the cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed
	from the accounts and any gain or loss is included in other income
	or expenses.




	 




	IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS




	 




	The Company’s long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment
	in accordance with the guidance of FASB Topic ASC 360,
	“Property, Plant, and Equipment”, and FASB ASC Topic
	205 “Presentation of Financial Statements”. The Company
	tests for impairment losses on long-lived assets used in operations
	whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the
	carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. Whenever any
	such impairment exists, an impairment loss will be recognized for
	the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair
	value.




	 




	The Company tests long-lived assets for recoverability at least
	annually or more frequently upon the occurrence of an event or when
	circumstances indicate that the net carrying amount is greater than
	its fair value. Assets are grouped and evaluated at the lowest
	level for their identifiable cash flows that are largely
	independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets. The
	Company considers historical performance and future estimated
	results in its evaluation of potential impairment and then compares
	the carrying amount of the asset to the future estimated cash flows
	expected to result from the use of the asset. If the carrying
	amount of the asset exceeds estimated expected undiscounted future
	cash flows, the Company measures the amount of impairment by
	comparing the carrying amount of the asset to its fair value. The
	estimation of fair value is generally measured by discounting
	expected future cash flows at the rate the Company utilizes to
	evaluate potential investments. The Company estimates fair value
	based on the information available in making whatever estimates,
	judgments and projections are considered necessary. There was no
	impairment of long-lived assets for the three months ended March
	31, 2017 and 2016.




	 




	BASIC AND DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE




	 




	Earnings per share (EPS) is calculated in accordance with the FASB
	ASC Topic 260, “Earnings Per Share.” Basic net income
	(loss) per share is based upon the weighted average number of
	common shares outstanding. Diluted net income (loss) per share is
	based on the assumption that all dilutive convertible shares and
	stock options were converted or exercised. Dilution is computed by
	applying the treasury stock method. Under this method, options and
	warrants are assumed to be exercised at the beginning of the period
	(or at the time of issuance, if later), and as if funds obtained
	thereby were used to purchase common stock at the average market
	price during the period. Potentially dilutive securities to
	purchase 100,000 shares of common stock were not included in the
	calculation of the diluted earnings per share as their effect would
	be anti-dilutive for the three months ended March 31, 2017. During
	the three month period ended March 31, 2017, the average market
	price of the common stock was less than the exercise price of the
	stock options and the Company was in net loss position.
	Accordingly, the stock options were anti-dilutive and have not been
	included in the calculation of diluted earnings per
	share.




	 




	INCOME TAXES




	 




	FASB ASC Topic 740, "Income Taxes” requires the recognition
	of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax
	consequences of events that have been included in the financial
	statements or tax returns. Under this method, deferred income taxes
	are recognized for the tax consequences in future years of
	differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and
	their financial reporting amounts at each period end based on
	enacted tax laws and statutory tax rates applicable to the periods
	in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income.
	Valuation allowances are established, when necessary, to reduce
	deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be
	realized.




	 





	In accordance with ASC Topic 740-10, “Accounting for
	Uncertainty in Income Taxes — An Interpretation of FASB ASC
	Topic 740” 


	, 


	which requires income tax positions to meet a
	more-likely-than-not recognition threshold to be recognized in the
	financial statements. Tax positions that previously failed to meet
	the more-likely-than-not threshold should be recognized in the
	first subsequent financial reporting period in which that threshold
	is met. Previously recognized tax positions that no longer meet the
	more-likely-than-not threshold should be derecognized in the first
	subsequent financial reporting period in which that threshold is no
	longer met.

	NOTE 2- SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES


	-
	continued





	 




	The application of tax laws and regulations is subject to legal and
	factual interpretation, judgment and uncertainty. Tax laws and
	regulations themselves are subject to change as a result of changes
	in fiscal policy, changes in legislation, the evolution of
	regulations and court rulings. Therefore, the actual liability may
	be materially different from our estimates, which could result in
	the need to record additional tax liabilities or potentially
	reverse previously recorded tax liabilities or deferred tax asset
	valuation allowance.




	  




	The Company has made a comprehensive review of its portfolio of tax
	positions in accordance with recognition standards established by
	ASC 740-10 and has not recognized any material uncertain tax
	positions.




	 




	In addition, companies in the PRC are required to pay business
	taxes consisting of 5% of income they derive from providing medical
	treatment, as well as city construction taxes and educational taxes
	which are 7% and 3%, respectively, of the business taxes. In April
	2010, the Company was granted an exemption from these taxes until
	further notice from the tax bureau.




	 




	The Company had accrued approximately $40,000 under taxes payable
	account for failure to file US tax returns and Form 5472 between
	the years 2006 to 2009. The Company is current with its required
	filings. In addition, the Company does not accrue United States
	income taxes on unremitted earnings from foreign operations, as it
	is the Company’s intention to invest these earnings in the
	foreign operations indefinitely.




	 




	STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS




	 




	In accordance with FASB ASC Topic 230, "Statement of Cash Flows,"
	cash flows from the Company's operations are calculated based upon
	the local currencies. As a result, amounts related to assets and
	liabilities reported on the statement of cash flows will not
	necessarily agree with changes in the corresponding balances on the
	balance sheet.




	 




	EMPLOYEE BENEFIT COSTS




	 




	The Company contributes to a defined contribution retirement plan
	organized by the municipal government in the province in which the
	Company’s subsidiary is registered. The Company makes
	contributes for qualified employees that are eligible to
	participate in the plan. Contributions to the plan are calculated
	at 30% of the employees’ salaries above a fixed threshold
	amount; employees contribute 8% and the Company’s subsidiary
	contributes the balance of 22%. The Chinese government is
	responsible for the benefit liability to retired employees. The
	Company has no other material obligation for the payment of
	retirement beyond the annual contribution.




	 




	STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION




	 





	For purposes of determining the variables used in the calculation
	of stock compensation expense under the provisions of FASB ASC
	Topic 505, “Equity” and FASB ASC Topic 718,
	“Compensation 


	— Stock
	Compensation,” 


	we
	perform an analysis of current market data and historical Company
	data to calculate an estimate of implied volatility, the expected
	term of the option and the expected forfeiture rate. With the
	exception of the expected forfeiture rate, which is not an input,
	we use these estimates as variables in the Black Scholes model.
	Depending upon the number of stock options granted, any
	fluctuations in these calculations could have a material effect on
	the results presented in our consolidated statement of operations.
	In addition, any differences between estimated forfeitures and
	actual forfeitures could also have a material impact on our
	financial statements.





	 




	Stock-based compensation costs that have been included in operating
	expenses amounted to $0 and $0, for the three month periods ended
	March 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.




	 




	COMPREHENSIVE INCOME




	 




	The Company reports comprehensive income in accordance with FASB
	ASC Topic 220 “Comprehensive Income," which established
	standards for reporting and displaying comprehensive income and its
	components in a financial statement that is displayed with the same
	prominence as other financial statements.

	Total comprehensive income is defined as all changes in
	stockholders' equity during a period, other than those resulting
	from investments by and distributions to stockholders (i.e.,
	issuance of equity securities and dividends). Generally, for the
	Company, total comprehensive income (loss) equals net income (loss)
	plus or minus adjustments for currency translation. Total
	comprehensive income (loss) represents the activity for a period
	net of related tax and was a loss of $(216,780) and $(140,366) for
	the three month periods ended March 31, 2017 and 2016,
	respectively.




	 




	While total comprehensive income is the activity in a period and is
	largely driven by net earnings in that period, accumulated other
	comprehensive income or loss (“AOCI”) represents the
	cumulative balance of other comprehensive income as of the balance
	sheet date. For the Company, AOCI is primarily the cumulative
	balance related to the currency adjustments and increased overall
	equity by $533,917and $587,508 as of March 31, 2017 and December
	31, 2016, respectively.




	 




	RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS




	 




	Recent accounting pronouncements issued by the FASB, the AICPA and
	the SEC did not, or are not believed by management to, have a
	material effect on the Company’s present or future
	consolidated financial statements.




	 




	GOING CONCERN




	 




	The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been
	prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting
	principles, which contemplate continuation of the Company as a
	going concern. However, the Company has negative working capital of
	$6,947,247, an accumulated deficit of $7,369,605, and a
	stockholders’ deficit of $6, 379,508 as of March 31, 2017.
	The Company’s ability to continue as a going concern
	ultimately is dependent on the management’s ability to obtain
	equity or debt financing, attain further operating efficiencies,
	and achieve profitable operations. The consolidated financial
	statements do not include any adjustments relating to the
	recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or
	amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary
	should the Company not be able to continue as a going
	concern.




	 




	Management has taken certain restructuring steps to provide the
	necessary capital to continue its operations. These steps included:
	1) disposal of the construction-in-progress new hospital. 2) plan
	to convert existed related parties’ loans into equity, 3)
	plan to increase sales revenue with additional medical equipment,
	No assurances can be given that the steps taken will provide
	necessary capital for the Company to continue its
	operations.

	NOTE 4- OTHER CURRENT RECEIVABLE




	 




	In March 2016, Nanning Tongji Hospital, Inc. sold its construction
	in progress hospital building to Guangxi Yida Friendship Hospital
	Management, Inc. for RMB 86,000,000 (approximately $13,000,000). As
	of the date of disposal, we had accrued approximately $15,000,000
	for the construction of the hospital. As a result of the sale, we
	increased other receivables to approximately $13,000,000.
	Concurrently, the remaining balance results in an extraordinary
	loss in the approximate amount of $2,000,000 in 2016. As of March
	31, 2017, we received payment of approximately $5,400,000, whereas
	no payment received during first quarter of 2017. The remaining

	NOTE 5- LAWSUIT SETTLEMENT PAYABLE  




	 





	In September 2009, Guangxi Nanning Tingyouyuxiang Commercial Co.,
	Ltd. (“Tingyouyuxiang”) filed a civil suit against
	Nanning Tongji Hospital, Inc. (“NTH”), a subsidiary of
	the Company in the People’s Court. In the complaint,
	Tingyouyuxiang asserted a breach of contract claim against NTH,
	alleging that NTH had failed to make timely and total payment of
	RMB 5,050,000 (approximately $800,000)  under certain
	Supplement Agreement by and among NTH, Tingyouyuxiang and the
	Eighth Group of Langdong Village Committee, Nanhu Community Office,
	Qingxiu District, Nanning City (the “Village
	Committee”). On December 30, 2009, the People’s Court
	ruled that NTH shall pay to Tingyouyuxiang damages of RMB 5,050,000
	(approximately $800,000) plus interest and the court hearing fee
	approximately $320,000. On March 9, 2012, NTH appealed to the
	Intermediate Court in Nanning City, alleging, among other things,
	that NTH was never served. On June 6, 2012, the Intermediate Court
	remanded the case to the People’s Court. On June 20, 2013,
	the People’s Court dismissed the action. On October 21, 2013,
	NTH appealed the dismissal to the Intermediate Court and the
	Intermediate Court accepted the appeal on October 21,
	2013.


	 


	On
	April 16, 2014, the Intermediate Court dismissed NTH appeal and
	affirmed the decision of the People’s Court. Upon settlement
	of the lawsuit, the Company had accrued approximately $1,399,980
	settlement payable as of March 31,
	2017.

	As of March 31, 2017, the Company had accumulated deficits of
	$7,369,605. Therefore, the Company did not appropriate any fund for
	the statutory surplus reserve for the three month period ended
	March 31, 2017.




	 




	Stock Option




	 




	No stock-based compensation recorded for the three months periods
	ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.




	 




	On March 3, 2011, an option to purchase 100,000 shares of common
	stock was granted to the Company’s CFO. The option vests in
	three equal installments starting on the first anniversary of grant
	and subsequent anniversaries thereafter, at an exercise price
	equivalent to the closing price per share of common stock on the
	date of grant.




	 




	The fair value of the option award is estimated on the date of
	grant using the Black Scholes model to be $15,400. The valuation
	was based on the assumptions noted in the following
	table.

	The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield
	curve in effect for the expected term of the option at the time of
	grant. The dividend yield on our common stock is assumed to be zero
	since we do not pay dividends and have no current plans to pay them
	in the future. The market price volatility of our common stock was
	based on historical volatility since May 13, 2010. The expected
	life of the options is based upon our anticipated expectations of
	exercise behavior since no options have been exercised in the past
	to provide relevant historical data.

	Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
	Condition and Results of Operations.




	 




	You should read the following discussion and analysis of our
	financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with
	our condensed consolidated financial statements and the related
	condensed notes included elsewhere in this report. Our financial
	statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The
	following discussion and analysis contains forward-looking
	statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results
	could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking
	statements.




	 




	Overview




	 




	Nanning Tongji Hospital, Inc. ("NTH" or “Tongji
	Hospital”) was established in Nanning city Guangxi province
	of the Peoples’ Republic of China ("PRC") by the Guangxi
	Tongji Medical Co. Ltd. and an individual on October 30,
	2003.




	 




	NTH is a designated hospital for medical insurance in city of
	Nanning and Guangxi province. NTH specializes in the areas of
	internal medicine, surgery, gynecology, pediatrics, emergency
	medicine, ophthalmology, medical cosmetology, rehabilitation,
	dermatology, otolaryngology, traditional Chinese medicine, medical
	imaging, anesthesia, acupuncture, physical therapy, health
	examination, and prevention.




	 




	On December 27, 2006, we, through our wholly-owned subsidiary,
	Tongji, Inc., a Colorado company, acquired 100% of the equity in
	NTH pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger. We issued
	15,652,557 shares of common stock to the shareholders of NTH in
	exchange for 100% of the issued and outstanding shares of NTH.
	Accordingly, NTH became a wholly owned subsidiary of Tongji, Inc.
	We have been in the business of operating hospitals and providing
	healthcare services in Nanning, Guangxi province of the
	PRC.




	 





	The acquisition of NTH was accounted for as a reverse acquisition
	under the purchase method of accounting since the shareholders of
	NTH obtained control of the consolidated entity. Accordingly, the
	reorganization of the two companies was recorded as a
	recapitalization of NTH. We treated NTH as the continuing operating
	entity. 


	We have two
	sources of operating revenues: in-patient service revenues and
	out-patient service revenues. In addition to provide services to
	our patients, we also sell pharmaceutical drugs to our patients.
	Revenues from such sales are included in either our in-patient
	service revenues or our out-patient service revenues. Our revenues
	come from individuals as well as third-party payers, including PRC
	government programs and insurance providers, under which the
	hospital is paid based upon local government established charges.
	Revenues are recorded at estimated net amounts due from patients or
	third-party payers. Revenues from pharmaceutical drug sales are
	recognized upon the drug being administered to a patient or at the
	time a prescription by a registered physician is
	filled.





	 




	Patient revenues are recorded based on pre-established rates set by
	the local government. The Company bills for services provided to
	Medicare patients through a medical card (the US equivalent of an
	insurance card). Historically, there have been no significant
	differences between the amounts the Company has billed the
	government Medicare funds and the amounts collected from the
	Medicare funds.




	 




	The Company had two major customers for the three month period
	ended March 31, 2017 and 2016: Nanning Social Insurance Center and
	China UMS. Nanning Social Insurance Center accounted for 53% and
	47% of revenue for the three month period ended March 31, 2017 and
	2016, respectively. China UMS accounted for 10% and 14% of revenue
	for the three month period ended March 31, 2017 and 2016,
	respectively.





	 


	 





	The Company purchases the majority of its medicine supplies from
	two suppliers which collectively accounted for more than 57% of our
	total purchases for the three month period ended March 31, 2017.
	The rest are from around 12 different suppliers. One of the former
	suppliers, Guangxi Tongji Medicine Co. Ltd., is a related company
	that our Chief Executive Officer controls and accounted for 0% of
	our total purchases for the three month period ended March 31,
	2017.




	 




	In March 2016, we sold our construction-in-progress hospital
	building to Guangxi Yida Friendship Hospital Management, Inc. for
	RMB 86,000,000 (approximately $13,000,000). The hospital building
	is being constructed by Guangxi Construction Engineering
	Corporation Langdong 8th Group (“Langdong 8th Group”).
	Costs capitalized primarily consists of payments for construction
	costs, acquisition cost, land rights cost, development expenditure,
	professional fees, and capitalized interest. As of the date of
	disposal, we had accrued approximately $15,000,000 for the
	construction of the hospital. As a result of the sale, we increased
	the other receivables to approximately $13,000,000. Concurrently,
	the remaining balance results in an extraordinary loss in the
	approximate amount of $2,000,000 in 2016. As of March 31, 2017, we
	received payment amount of $5,400,000, whereas no payment received
	during the first quarter of 2017. We incurred value-added tax (VAT)
	and other taxes liability of RMB 4,530,000 (approximately $658,124)
	related to this transaction. The amount is included in other
	payables.

	Difference in the Medical System between the U.S. and
	China




	 




	In the United States most hospitals have contracts with health
	insurance companies that provide reduced rates for healthcare
	services for patients with health insurance. Medicare and Medicaid
	patients, also, receive reduced rates. Functionally, the patient is
	billed for health services at the higher rate normally charged to
	patients without insurance. The amount billed is then reduced by
	the charges paid by the insurance carrier and by the difference
	(sometimes known as the "contractual allowance") between the normal
	rate for the services and the reduced rate that the hospital
	estimates it will receive from Medicare, Medicaid an d insurance
	companies.




	 




	For financial reporting purposes, hospitals in the United States
	record revenues based upon established billing rates less
	adjustment for contractual allowances. Revenues are recorded based
	upon the amounts due from the patients and third-party payers,
	including federal and state agencies (under the Medicare and
	Medicaid programs) managed care health plans, health insurance
	companies, and employers. Estimates of contractual allowances under
	third-party payer arrangements are based upon the payment terms
	specified in the related contractual agreements. Third-party payer
	contractual payment terms are generally based upon predetermined
	rates per diagnosis, per diem rates, or discounted fee-for-service
	rates.




	 




	Due to the complexities involved in determining amounts ultimately
	due under reimbursement arrangements with a large number of
	third-party payers, which are often subject to interpretation, the
	reimbursement actually received by U.S. hospitals for health care
	services is sometimes different from their estimates.




	 




	The medical system in the PRC is different from that in the United
	States. Private medical insurance is not generally available to the
	PRC’s population and as a result services and medications
	provided by our hospital are usually paid by cash or by the
	Medicare agencies of the Nanning municipal government and the
	Guangxi provincial government. Our billing system automatically
	calculates the reimbursements that we are entitled to base upon
	regulations promulgated by theses government agencies. We bill the
	Medicare agencies directly for services provided to patients
	covered by these Medicare programs. In addition, due to the fact
	that rates are established by the government, there is no
	difference between rates for patients covered by Medicare and
	patients who pay cash.




	 




	Since we only deal with the Nanning municipal and the Guangxi
	provincial Medicare agencies, we are familiar with their
	regulations pertaining to reimbursements. As a result, there is
	normally no material difference between the amounts we bill and the
	amounts we receive for services provided to Medicare
	patients.




	 




	Results of Operation - Three Months Ended March 31, 2017 and
	2016




	 




	Material changes of items in our Statement of Operations for the
	three months ended March 31, 2017, as compared to the three months
	ended March 31, 2016, are discussed below.




	 





	Operating Revenues 


	– Operating revenue for the three month
	period ended March 31, 2016, which resulted primarily from
	in-patient services and out-patient services, was $338,396, a
	decrease of $163,270 or 33%, as compared with the operating revenue
	of $501,666 for the same period of 2016. Our in-patient service
	revenue was $194,626 for the three month period ended March 31,
	2017, as compared to $257,902 for the same period in 2016, a
	decrease of $63,276 or 25%. The decrease in the in-patient service
	revenue was primarily due to reduced revenue from our in-patient
	ophthalmology department.. Our out-patient service revenue was
	$143,770 for the three month period ended March 31, 2017, a
	decrease of $99,994 or 41% as compared to $243,764 for the same
	period in 2016. The decrease in the out-patient service revenue was
	primarily due to the closure of personnel medical care department
	and resignation of doctors from our out-patient department since
	second quarter of 2016, resulting in fewer patients being
	treated. 





	 





	Operating Expenses 


	– Operating expenses were $419,176 for
	the three month period ended March 31, 2017, a decrease of 24% as
	compared to $553,607 for the same period of 2016, which is in line
	with the decrease in our operating revenues.





	 





	Loss from Operations - 


	Operating loss was $80,780 for the three month
	period ended March 31, 2017, an increase of $28,839 or56% as
	compared to an operating loss of $51,941 for the same period of
	2016. The primary reason for the increase in loss from operations
	is the decline in operating revenues.





	 





	Interest Expense – 


	Interest expense for the three month period ended
	March 31, 2017 was $88,858 as compared to $80,815 for the three
	month period ended March 31, 2016, a slight increase of $8,043
	or10%.


	 





	 





	Net Loss 


	- As a result of
	the forgoing, the Company had a net loss of $163,189 during the
	quarter ended March 31, 2017, compared to a net loss of $125,305
	for the comparative period in 2016, an increase of $37,884 or
	30%.

	Trends, Events and Uncertainties




	 




	The China Ministry of Health, as well as other related agencies,
	has proposed changes to the prices we can charge for medical
	services, drugs and medications. We cannot predict the impact of
	these proposed changes since the changes are not fully defined and
	we do not know whether those proposed changes will ever be
	implemented or when they may take effect.




	 




	In March 2016, Nanning Tongji Hospital, Inc. sold its construction
	in progress hospital building to Guangxi Yida Friendship Hospital
	Management, Inc. for RMB 86,000,000 (approximately $13,000,000).
	The hospital building is being constructed by Guangxi Construction
	Engineering Corporation Langdong 8th Group (“Langdong 8th
	Group”). Costs capitalized primarily consists of payments for
	construction costs, acquisition cost, land rights cost, development
	expenditure, professional fees, and capitalized interest. As of the
	date of disposal, we had accrued approximately $15,000,000 for the
	construction of the hospital. As a result of the sale, we increased
	other receivables by approximately $13,000,000. Concurrently, the
	remaining balance results in an extraordinary loss of approximately
	$2,000,000 in 2016. As of March 31, 2017, we have received payment
	of approximately $5,400,000. We incurred value-added tax (VAT) and
	other taxes liability of RMB 4,530,000 (approximately $658,124)
	related to this transaction. The amount is included in other
	payable.




	 




	We plan to acquire other hospitals and companies involved in the
	healthcare industry in the PRC using cash and shares of our common
	stock. Substantial capital may be needed for these acquisitions and
	we may need to raise additional funds through the sale of our
	common stock, debt financing or other arrangements. We do not have
	any commitments or arrangements from any person to provide us with
	any additional capital. Additional capital may not be available to
	us, or if available, on acceptable terms, in which case we would
	not be able to acquire other hospitals or businesses in the
	healthcare industry.




	 




	Other than the factors listed above, we do not know of any trends,
	events or uncertainties that have had or are reasonably expected to
	have a material impact on our net sales or revenues or income from
	continuing operations. Our business is not seasonal in
	nature.




	 




	Accounting Estimates




	 




	In the United States most hospitals have contracts with health
	insurance companies that provide reduced rates for healthcare
	services for patients with health insurance. Medicare and Medicaid
	patients also receive reduced rates. Functionally, the patient is
	billed for health services at the higher rate normally charged to
	patients without insurance. The amount billed is then reduced by
	the charges paid by the insurance carrier and by the difference
	(sometimes known as the "contractual allowance") between the normal
	rate for the services and the reduced rate that the hospital
	estimates it will receive from Medicare, Medicaid and insurance
	companies.




	 




	For financial reporting purposes, hospitals in the United States
	record revenues based upon established billing rates less
	adjustment for contractual allowances. Revenues are recorded based
	upon the amounts due from the patients and third-party payers,
	including federal and state agencies (under the Medicare and
	Medicaid programs) managed care health plans, health insurance
	companies, and employers. Estimates of contractual allowances under
	third-party payer arrangements are based upon the payment terms
	specified in the related contractual agreements. Third-party payer
	contractual payment terms are generally based upon predetermined
	rates per diagnosis, per diem rates, or discounted fee-for-service
	rates.




	  




	Due to the complexities involved in determining amounts ultimately
	due under reimbursement arrangements with a large number of
	third-party payers, which are often subject to interpretation, the
	reimbursement actually received by U.S. hospitals for health care
	services is sometimes different from their estimates.




	 




	The medical system in the PRC is different from that in the United
	States. Private medical insurance is not generally available to the
	PRC’s population and as a result services and medications
	provided by our hospital are usually paid for in cash or by the
	Medicare agencies of the Nanning municipal government and the
	Guangxi provincial government. Our billing system automatically
	calculates the reimbursements that we are entitled to base upon
	regulations promulgated by theses government agencies. We bill the
	Medicare agencies directly for services provided to patients
	covered by theses Medicare programs. In addition, due to the fact
	that rates are established by the government, there is no
	difference between rates for patients covered by Medicare and
	patients who only use cash.




	 





	Since we only deal with the Nanning municipal and the Guangxi
	provincial Medicare agencies we are familiar with their regulations
	pertaining to reimbursements. As a result, there is normally no
	material difference between the amounts we bill and
	the 


	amounts we receive for
	services provided to Medicare
	patients.

	Liquidity and Capital Resources




	 




	We generally finance our operations through our operating profits
	and borrowings from related parties. As of the date of this report,
	we have not experienced any difficulty in raising funds from
	related parties, and we have not experienced any liquidity problems
	in settling our payables in our ordinary course of business. We
	believe that we have adequate funds and capital with respect to
	conducting its business over the next twelve months.




	 




	The following shows our material sources and uses of cash during
	the three month periods ended March 31, 2017 and 2016:

	The Company carefully monitors and controls the amount of cash used
	to fund operating activities. However, substantial funds are
	required to fund the lawsuit settlement (see Note 5 to the
	Financial Statements accompanying this Report). Financing of
	operations has come primarily from advances from related parties.
	We are dependent on related parties to provide working capital and
	pay our management team until such time as our operations are
	profitable. There can be no assurances that related parties will
	continue to provide additional capital. Without additional capital,
	we may be forced to cease operations and liquidate.




	 




	Operating Activities




	 




	Net cash used in operating activities primarily consists of net
	loss, as adjusted by depreciation, stock option, and changes in
	non-cash working capital items such as accounts receivable, medical
	supplies, capital lease deposits, prepaid expense and other current
	assets, accounts payables and accrued liabilities , and other
	payables.




	 




	Net cash used in operating activities was $43,698 for the three
	months ended March 31, 2017, a decrease of $62,358 or 334% as
	compared with the net cash provided by operating activities of
	$18,660 for the same period in 2016. The decrease in net cash
	provided in operating activities was primarily due to the reduced
	revenue, resulting in a $37,884 increase in net loss.




	 




	Investing Activities




	 




	Net cash used in investing activities was $0for the three months
	ended March 31, 2017, a decrease of $50,957 or 100%, as compared
	with the net cash used in investing activities of $50,957 for the
	same period in 2016. The decrease in net cash used in investing
	activities was primarily due to disposal of construction in
	progress in 2016, resulting reduced cash contribution in the
	current period. 




	 




	Financing Activities




	 




	Net cash provided by financing activities primarily consists of
	proceeds from related party loans.




	 




	Net cash provided by financing activities was $37,940 for the three
	months ended March 31, 2017, a decrease of $26,399 or 41%, as
	compared with the net cash provided by financing activities of
	$64,339 for the same period in 2016. The decrease was primarily
	attributable to decrease in funds advanced by related parties due
	to disposal of construction in progress. 




	 




	Working Capital




	 




	Our working capital was negative $6,947,247 as of March 31, 2017,
	as compared with negative $6,745,663 as of December 31, 2016, a
	decrease of $201,584, which is primarily attributable to the
	increase in related party loans of approximately $128,054, decrease
	in accounts receivable of approximately $48,778 and increase in
	other payables of approximately $49,533.




	 




	Rental Commitments




	 




	On March 1, 2015, the Company renewed the lease agreement for their
	hospital with Guangxi Tongji Medicine Co. Ltd that expires in
	December 2014. Monthly lease payment under the new lease is
	approximately $4,800. The lease will expire on February 28, 2018.
	Based on the exchange rate at March 31, 2017, minimum future lease
	payments are as follows:

	Going Concern




	 




	The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been
	prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting
	principles, which contemplate continuation of the Company as a
	going concern. However, the Company has negative working capital of
	$6,947,247, an accumulated deficit of $7,369,605, and a
	stockholders’ deficit of $6,379,508as of March 31, 2017. The
	Company’s ability to continue as a going concern ultimately
	is dependent on the management’s ability to obtain equity or
	debt financing, attain further operating efficiencies, and achieve
	profitable operations. The consolidated financial statements do not
	include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and
	classification of recorded asset amounts or amounts and
	classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the
	Company not be able to continue as a going concern.




	 




	Management has taken certain restructuring steps to provide the
	necessary capital to continue its operations. These steps included:
	1) disposal of the construction-in-progress new hospital. 2) plan
	to convert existed related parties’ loans into equity, 3)
	plan to increase sales revenue with additional medical equipment,
	No assurances can be given that the steps taken will provide
	necessary capital for the Company to continue its
	operations. 




	 




	Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements




	 




	We do not have any off-balance sheet items reasonably likely to
	have a material effect on our financial condition.

	Evaluation of Disclosure Controls




	 




	Our management maintains disclosure controls and procedures, as
	defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange
	Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), that are
	designed to provide reasonable assurance that the material
	information required to be disclosed by us in our periodic reports
	filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed,
	summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the
	SEC’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures
	include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to
	ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the
	reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is
	accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief
	Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely
	decisions regarding required disclosure.




	 




	As of March 31, 2017, our management, under the supervision of and
	with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief
	Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure
	controls and procedures as required by Rules 13a-15(b) and
	15d-15(b) under the Exchange Act. Based upon this evaluation, our
	Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that
	our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of
	March 31, 2017 as a result of the material weaknesses identified in
	our internal control over financial reporting, which are discussed
	below. Our management considers our internal control over financial
	reporting to be an integral part of our disclosure controls and
	procedures.




	 




	Specifically, our management identified certain matters involving
	internal control and our operations that it considered to be
	material weaknesses. As defined in the Exchange Act, a material
	weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in
	internal control over financial reporting such that there is a
	reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the
	registrant's annual or interim financial statements will not be
	prevented or detected on a timely basis. The material weaknesses
	identified by our management as of March 31, 2017, are described
	below:




	 






	 




	22










	 






	 





	Item 4. Controls and Procedures.


	-
	continued





	 








	 






	●






	We did not design, implement, or maintain effective entity-level
	controls related to our control environment, resulting in the
	following significant control deficiencies:








	 








	 






	o






	The Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, which was specifically
	designed for public company applicability, has yet to be formally
	acknowledged by members of management and the finance
	department.








	 








	 






	o






	There is an absence of independence and financial expertise on the
	Board of Directors, and we do not have an Audit Committee or a
	formalized internal audit function, limiting its ability to provide
	effective oversight of our management.








	 








	 






	o






	The full implementation of, and related training for, our
	newly-formalized IT policies and procedures were still in process
	at year-end. Accordingly, we lacked sufficiently-trained personnel
	to provide for adequate segregation of duties within the accounting
	system and effective oversight of controls over access, change,
	data, and security management.








	 




	Our management believes that the pervasive nature of these control
	deficiencies, when aggregated, impact all significant accounts and
	disclosures and rise to the level of material
	weakness.




	 




	2017 Planned Remediation




	 




	As financial conditions permit, we plan to take the following
	actions to improve our internal control over financial
	reporting.




	 








	 






	●






	Require all members of our management and the finance department
	across all corporate entities to certify receipt of the revised
	Code of Business Conduct and Ethics by signature. Signed copies
	will be retained by our management. Thereafter, our management
	plans to periodically require signatories to acknowledge that they
	understand the contents of the Code of Business Conduct and Ethics,
	and whether they are aware of anyone in our Company that might have
	violated some part of the Code.








	 








	 






	●






	Recruit an independent financial expert to the Board of Directors
	to chair an Audit Committee and formalize roles and
	responsibilities over our internal control over financial reporting
	for the Board and our management. Our management also plans to
	develop and implement a formal corporate internal audit capability,
	reporting directly to an independent Audit Committee, to provide
	effective oversight of our internal control over financial
	reporting.








	 








	 






	●






	Continue to engage the services of qualified consultants with China
	GAAP, U.S. GAAP and SEC reporting experience to support our
	financial reporting and SOX compliance requirements, including
	assistance with the following:








	 








	 






	o






	Remediating identified material weaknesses;








	 








	 






	o






	Monitoring our internal control over financial reporting on an
	ongoing basis;








	 








	 






	o






	Managing our period-end financial closing and reporting processes;
	and








	 








	 






	o






	Identifying and resolving non-routine or complex accounting
	matters.








	 








	 






	●






	Complete the implementation of, and related training for, its IT
	policies and procedures related to access, change, data, and
	security management to ensure that all relevant financial
	information is secure, identified, captured, processed, and
	reported within the accounting system and spreadsheets supporting
	financial reporting.








	 








	 






	●






	Continue providing training to accounting personnel regarding our
	significant policies and procedures related to accounting, finance,
	and internal control to ensure that financial reporting
	competencies are strengthened.







	 






	Our management will continue to monitor and evaluate the
	effectiveness of its disclosure controls and procedures, as well as
	its internal control over financial reporting, on an ongoing basis,
	and is committed to taking further action and implementing
	additional improvements, as necessary and as funds allow. However,
	our management cannot guarantee that the measures taken or any
	future measures will remediate the material weaknesses identified
	or that any additional material weaknesses or significant
	deficiencies will not arise in the future due to a failure to
	implement and maintain adequate internal control over financial
	reporting.






	 




	23










	 






	 





	Item 4. Controls and Procedures.


	-
	continued





	 




	Notwithstanding the material weaknesses described above, our
	management believes that there are no material inaccuracies or
	omissions of material fact and, to the best of its knowledge,
	believes that the consolidated financial statements included in
	this annual report present fairly, in all material respects, our
	financial position, results of operations, and cash flows for the
	periods presented in conformity with accounting principles
	generally accepted in the United States.




	 




	Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting




	 




	No changes in the Company's internal control over financial
	reporting has come to management's attention during the Company's
	first quarter ended March 31, 2017 that have materially affected,
	or are likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control
	over financial reporting.






	 






	PART II - OTHER INFORMATION




	 










	Item 1.


	Legal Proceedings.








	 





	 


	In September 2009,
	Guangxi Nanning Tingyouyuxiang Commercial Co., Ltd.
	(“Tingyouyuxiang”) filed a civil suit against Nanning
	Tongji Hospital, Inc. (“NTH”), a subsidiary of the
	Company in the People’s Court. In the complaint,
	Tingyouyuxiang asserted a breach of contract claim against NTH,
	alleging that NTH had failed to make timely and total payment of
	RMB 5,050,000 (approximately $800,000) under certain Supplement
	Agreement by and among NTH, Tingyouyuxiang and the Eighth Group of
	Langdong Village Committee, Nanhu Community Office, Qingxiu
	District, Nanning City (the “Village Committee”). One
	December 30, 2009, the People’s Court ruled that NTH shall
	pay to Tingyouyuxiang damages of RMB 5,050,000 (approximately
	$800,000) plus interest and the court hearing fee approximately
	$320,000. On March 9, 2013, NTH appealed to the Intermediate Court,
	alleging, among other things, that NTH was never served. On
	September 6, 2013, the Intermediate Court remanded the case to the
	People’s Court. On April 16, 2014, the Intermediate Court
	dismissed Tingyouyuxiang’s appeal and affirmed the decision
	of the People’s Court. Upon settlement of the lawsuit, the
	Company had accrued approximately $1,399,980 in settlement payable
	as of March 31, 2017.

	a)
