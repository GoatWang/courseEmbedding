Education[edit]
In September 1948, during the Chinese Civil War, Lee left Shanghai aboard the USS General W.H. Gordon to complete his undergraduate education at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He studied Electrical Engineering and earned his Bachelor of Science in 1950 and Master of Science in 1951. In Fall 1952, Lee entered the PhD program at MIT. He withdrew in 1954 to pursue his career, returned in 1964, and completed his PhD in Electrical Engineering in 1965.[4]
Early career[edit]
In 1954, Lee took a full-time position as Research Engineer with the Servomechanism Laboratory.[5] He was part of a team working on the first Digitally Controlled Milling Machine [6] In 1955, Lee joined the Bizmac Computer Division of RCA. He left a year later to join the UNIVAC super-computer division of Remington Rand.[7][8]
Project MAC[edit]
In 1963, Lee accepted a one-year appointment to work on Project MAC, a time-sharing Multiple Access Computer being developed at MIT under the direction of Robert Fano.[9] Fano launched Project MAC with a 6-week summer session that drew 57 people (including Lee) from universities, industry, and government for brainstorming and collaboration.[10] At the end of the session, Lee described his work on speeding up computer memory in "Lookaside Memory Implementation" (1963).[11] Six years later, Lee presented "Study of Look-Aside Memory," at the IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers) conference: Transactions on Computers, held in June 1969. Lee's paper was published in IEEE Transactions on Computers.[12] Look-Aside Memory is a forerunner of cache memory.[13][14][15]
Reading Machine Project[edit]
At the end of his Project MAC appointment, Lee resumed his graduate studies at MIT and joined Dr. Samuel Jefferson Mason's Cognitive Information Processing Group in the Research Laboratory of Electronics at MIT[16] Lee's group worked on a reading machine for the blind, the first system that would scan text and produce continuous speech.[17] For his Ph.D. thesis, Lee developed a method for converting printed words into phoneme-based spoken language.[4] Lee presented and published two papers on this work.[18][19]
Later professional life and inventions[edit]
In 1965, Lee joined the MIT faculty as an Associate Professor of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. He was promoted to full professor in 1968 and served until early retirement in 1987. In 1969, Lee founded American Data Sciences (ADS) with junior partner Charles L. Bagnaschi, an engineer. The company's name was changed to Lexicon Inc. in 1971. Their focus was applying digital delay to audio technology and language instruction.[20][21] In 1973, Lee brought in Ron Noonan as CEO to diversify Lexicon in the professional audio market.[22]
Digital Cardiac Monitoring System[edit]
Lee applied his knowledge of digital design to Electrocardiography (ECG) technology.[23] At the time, waveforms moved left to right across the screen, then returned to a starting point. A digital delay device would allow heartbeats to be monitored with a continuous moving image on a cathode ray terminal (CRT). Lee brought in Professor Stephen K. Burns, an MIT colleague with a strong interest in bio-medical electronics, to help develop the machine, patented in 1971.[24] Lee and Burns licensed the machine first to Becton Dickinson Company, a bio-medical company, followed by Hewlett-Packard and General Electric Company.
Audio Delay System: Digital Reverb[edit]
The cardiac digital delay unit led to Lee's work in digital audio delay. At the time, sound delay technology (used to synchronize speakers during live performances and create deliberate echo-effects) relied on tape loops and recording devices.[25] MIT lecturer Barry Blesser suggested they try running audio through Lee's digital delay apparatus. With Bagnaschi, they created the first digital signal processor.[26] Steve Temmer, the president of New York City’s Gotham Audio, heard about the experiment and commissioned 50 units of what would be sold as the Delta T-101 in 1971, introducing digital reverberation and effects processors to the recording industry.[1][27][28][29]
Digital Digital Time-Compression and Expansion: Varispeech[edit]







In 1972, Lee filed a patent for a device that could compress or expand the time duration of sound waves while preserving normal sound quality.[30] That year, Lexicon introduced Varispeech, an electronic speech compressor for use in the language instruction market, specifically to help blind students access text more quickly and persons with speech disorders study spoken language.[3][31] Varispeech, the first commercially available pitch shifter, could speed up or slow down recorded speech, while maintaining normal pitch.[32]
Audio Time Compressor and Expander[edit]
An advanced version of Varispeech—the Time Compressor 1200—was introduced in 1981.[33] The device coupled audio time-compression with visual components, allowing broadcasters to show movies and recorded programs at an accelerated rate without audio distortion. Programming and advertisements could be made to fit time slots without cutting. Technicians referred to this process as "lexiconning."[3] Lexicon CEO Ron Noonan described the technology avoiding the "tyranny of scissors." The device was also promoted for creative uses, such as heightening excitement in a TV program or news broadcast by speeding up time.[34][35] Lexicon's Time Compressor Model 1200 received an Emmy in 1984 from the National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences for its technical contributions to editing.[36][37]







Controversy and creativity[edit]
Critics argued that the Time Compressor technology, particularly when applied to movies and older television programs, amounted to "defacing" a creative work, analogous to colorization.[3] Film director Elliot Silverstein argued that, "To use these devices before the artist completes his work makes it part of the creative process. But once the artist has completed his work, to change it without his permission, however subtly, may prejudice his honor or reputation."[3] However, some artists took advantage of the creative possibilities. Stanley Kubrick, for example, used the time-compression device to speed up the sound of guns firing in Full Metal Jacket to intensify the battle scenes.[3] American musician and producer Chris Walla used the early model, Varispeech, to create audio effects, such as making "everything sound like Dr. Who."[32] Pat Metheny describes using Lexicon digital reverb and digital delay technology to "create the 'chorused' thing that i guess i would have to say i was the first to use extensively in jazz and that seemed to have influenced a lot of other guys to do the same."[38][39]
Selling Lexicon[edit]
The company went public in 1985 on the London Stock Exchange. In 1995, Lexicon was sold to Harman International Industries.[40]
Awards[edit]
1984: Emmy Award for Lexicon's Time Compressor Model 1200. Awarded by National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences (NATAS) for Technical Contribution to Editing.[36]

Education[edit]
In September 1948, during the Chinese Civil War, Lee left Shanghai aboard the USS General W.H. Gordon to complete his undergraduate education at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He studied Electrical Engineering and earned his Bachelor of Science in 1950 and Master of Science in 1951. In Fall 1952, Lee entered the PhD program at MIT. He withdrew in 1954 to pursue his career, returned in 1964, and completed his PhD in Electrical Engineering in 1965.[4]
Early career[edit]
In 1954, Lee took a full-time position as Research Engineer with the Servomechanism Laboratory.[5] He was part of a team working on the first Digitally Controlled Milling Machine [6] In 1955, Lee joined the Bizmac Computer Division of RCA. He left a year later to join the UNIVAC super-computer division of Remington Rand.[7][8]
Project MAC[edit]
In 1963, Lee accepted a one-year appointment to work on Project MAC, a time-sharing Multiple Access Computer being developed at MIT under the direction of Robert Fano.[9] Fano launched Project MAC with a 6-week summer session that drew 57 people (including Lee) from universities, industry, and government for brainstorming and collaboration.[10] At the end of the session, Lee described his work on speeding up computer memory in "Lookaside Memory Implementation" (1963).[11] Six years later, Lee presented "Study of Look-Aside Memory," at the IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers) conference: Transactions on Computers, held in June 1969. Lee's paper was published in IEEE Transactions on Computers.[12] Look-Aside Memory is a forerunner of cache memory.[13][14][15]
Reading Machine Project[edit]
At the end of his Project MAC appointment, Lee resumed his graduate studies at MIT and joined Dr. Samuel Jefferson Mason's Cognitive Information Processing Group in the Research Laboratory of Electronics at MIT[16] Lee's group worked on a reading machine for the blind, the first system that would scan text and produce continuous speech.[17] For his Ph.D. thesis, Lee developed a method for converting printed words into phoneme-based spoken language.[4] Lee presented and published two papers on this work.[18][19]
Later professional life and inventions[edit]
In 1965, Lee joined the MIT faculty as an Associate Professor of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. He was promoted to full professor in 1968 and served until early retirement in 1987. In 1969, Lee founded American Data Sciences (ADS) with junior partner Charles L. Bagnaschi, an engineer. The company's name was changed to Lexicon Inc. in 1971. Their focus was applying digital delay to audio technology and language instruction.[20][21] In 1973, Lee brought in Ron Noonan as CEO to diversify Lexicon in the professional audio market.[22]
Digital Cardiac Monitoring System[edit]
Lee applied his knowledge of digital design to Electrocardiography (ECG) technology.[23] At the time, waveforms moved left to right across the screen, then returned to a starting point. A digital delay device would allow heartbeats to be monitored with a continuous moving image on a cathode ray terminal (CRT). Lee brought in Professor Stephen K. Burns, an MIT colleague with a strong interest in bio-medical electronics, to help develop the machine, patented in 1971.[24] Lee and Burns licensed the machine first to Becton Dickinson Company, a bio-medical company, followed by Hewlett-Packard and General Electric Company.
Audio Delay System: Digital Reverb[edit]
The cardiac digital delay unit led to Lee's work in digital audio delay. At the time, sound delay technology (used to synchronize speakers during live performances and create deliberate echo-effects) relied on tape loops and recording devices.[25] MIT lecturer Barry Blesser suggested they try running audio through Lee's digital delay apparatus. With Bagnaschi, they created the first digital signal processor.[26] Steve Temmer, the president of New York City’s Gotham Audio, heard about the experiment and commissioned 50 units of what would be sold as the Delta T-101 in 1971, introducing digital reverberation and effects processors to the recording industry.[1][27][28][29]
Digital Digital Time-Compression and Expansion: Varispeech[edit]







In 1972, Lee filed a patent for a device that could compress or expand the time duration of sound waves while preserving normal sound quality.[30] That year, Lexicon introduced Varispeech, an electronic speech compressor for use in the language instruction market, specifically to help blind students access text more quickly and persons with speech disorders study spoken language.[3][31] Varispeech, the first commercially available pitch shifter, could speed up or slow down recorded speech, while maintaining normal pitch.[32]
Audio Time Compressor and Expander[edit]
An advanced version of Varispeech—the Time Compressor 1200—was introduced in 1981.[33] The device coupled audio time-compression with visual components, allowing broadcasters to show movies and recorded programs at an accelerated rate without audio distortion. Programming and advertisements could be made to fit time slots without cutting. Technicians referred to this process as "lexiconning."[3] Lexicon CEO Ron Noonan described the technology avoiding the "tyranny of scissors." The device was also promoted for creative uses, such as heightening excitement in a TV program or news broadcast by speeding up time.[34][35] Lexicon's Time Compressor Model 1200 received an Emmy in 1984 from the National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences for its technical contributions to editing.[36][37]







Controversy and creativity[edit]
Critics argued that the Time Compressor technology, particularly when applied to movies and older television programs, amounted to "defacing" a creative work, analogous to colorization.[3] Film director Elliot Silverstein argued that, "To use these devices before the artist completes his work makes it part of the creative process. But once the artist has completed his work, to change it without his permission, however subtly, may prejudice his honor or reputation."[3] However, some artists took advantage of the creative possibilities. Stanley Kubrick, for example, used the time-compression device to speed up the sound of guns firing in Full Metal Jacket to intensify the battle scenes.[3] American musician and producer Chris Walla used the early model, Varispeech, to create audio effects, such as making "everything sound like Dr. Who."[32] Pat Metheny describes using Lexicon digital reverb and digital delay technology to "create the 'chorused' thing that i guess i would have to say i was the first to use extensively in jazz and that seemed to have influenced a lot of other guys to do the same."[38][39]
Selling Lexicon[edit]
The company went public in 1985 on the London Stock Exchange. In 1995, Lexicon was sold to Harman International Industries.[40]
Awards[edit]
1984: Emmy Award for Lexicon's Time Compressor Model 1200. Awarded by National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences (NATAS) for Technical Contribution to Editing.[36]

Education[edit]
In September 1948, during the Chinese Civil War, Lee left Shanghai aboard the USS General W.H. Gordon to complete his undergraduate education at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He studied Electrical Engineering and earned his Bachelor of Science in 1950 and Master of Science in 1951. In Fall 1952, Lee entered the PhD program at MIT. He withdrew in 1954 to pursue his career, returned in 1964, and completed his PhD in Electrical Engineering in 1965.[4]
Early career[edit]
In 1954, Lee took a full-time position as Research Engineer with the Servomechanism Laboratory.[5] He was part of a team working on the first Digitally Controlled Milling Machine [6] In 1955, Lee joined the Bizmac Computer Division of RCA. He left a year later to join the UNIVAC super-computer division of Remington Rand.[7][8]
Project MAC[edit]
In 1963, Lee accepted a one-year appointment to work on Project MAC, a time-sharing Multiple Access Computer being developed at MIT under the direction of Robert Fano.[9] Fano launched Project MAC with a 6-week summer session that drew 57 people (including Lee) from universities, industry, and government for brainstorming and collaboration.[10] At the end of the session, Lee described his work on speeding up computer memory in "Lookaside Memory Implementation" (1963).[11] Six years later, Lee presented "Study of Look-Aside Memory," at the IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers) conference: Transactions on Computers, held in June 1969. Lee's paper was published in IEEE Transactions on Computers.[12] Look-Aside Memory is a forerunner of cache memory.[13][14][15]
Reading Machine Project[edit]
At the end of his Project MAC appointment, Lee resumed his graduate studies at MIT and joined Dr. Samuel Jefferson Mason's Cognitive Information Processing Group in the Research Laboratory of Electronics at MIT[16] Lee's group worked on a reading machine for the blind, the first system that would scan text and produce continuous speech.[17] For his Ph.D. thesis, Lee developed a method for converting printed words into phoneme-based spoken language.[4] Lee presented and published two papers on this work.[18][19]
Later professional life and inventions[edit]
In 1965, Lee joined the MIT faculty as an Associate Professor of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. He was promoted to full professor in 1968 and served until early retirement in 1987. In 1969, Lee founded American Data Sciences (ADS) with junior partner Charles L. Bagnaschi, an engineer. The company's name was changed to Lexicon Inc. in 1971. Their focus was applying digital delay to audio technology and language instruction.[20][21] In 1973, Lee brought in Ron Noonan as CEO to diversify Lexicon in the professional audio market.[22]
Digital Cardiac Monitoring System[edit]
Lee applied his knowledge of digital design to Electrocardiography (ECG) technology.[23] At the time, waveforms moved left to right across the screen, then returned to a starting point. A digital delay device would allow heartbeats to be monitored with a continuous moving image on a cathode ray terminal (CRT). Lee brought in Professor Stephen K. Burns, an MIT colleague with a strong interest in bio-medical electronics, to help develop the machine, patented in 1971.[24] Lee and Burns licensed the machine first to Becton Dickinson Company, a bio-medical company, followed by Hewlett-Packard and General Electric Company.
Audio Delay System: Digital Reverb[edit]
The cardiac digital delay unit led to Lee's work in digital audio delay. At the time, sound delay technology (used to synchronize speakers during live performances and create deliberate echo-effects) relied on tape loops and recording devices.[25] MIT lecturer Barry Blesser suggested they try running audio through Lee's digital delay apparatus. With Bagnaschi, they created the first digital signal processor.[26] Steve Temmer, the president of New York City’s Gotham Audio, heard about the experiment and commissioned 50 units of what would be sold as the Delta T-101 in 1971, introducing digital reverberation and effects processors to the recording industry.[1][27][28][29]
Digital Digital Time-Compression and Expansion: Varispeech[edit]







In 1972, Lee filed a patent for a device that could compress or expand the time duration of sound waves while preserving normal sound quality.[30] That year, Lexicon introduced Varispeech, an electronic speech compressor for use in the language instruction market, specifically to help blind students access text more quickly and persons with speech disorders study spoken language.[3][31] Varispeech, the first commercially available pitch shifter, could speed up or slow down recorded speech, while maintaining normal pitch.[32]
Audio Time Compressor and Expander[edit]
An advanced version of Varispeech—the Time Compressor 1200—was introduced in 1981.[33] The device coupled audio time-compression with visual components, allowing broadcasters to show movies and recorded programs at an accelerated rate without audio distortion. Programming and advertisements could be made to fit time slots without cutting. Technicians referred to this process as "lexiconning."[3] Lexicon CEO Ron Noonan described the technology avoiding the "tyranny of scissors." The device was also promoted for creative uses, such as heightening excitement in a TV program or news broadcast by speeding up time.[34][35] Lexicon's Time Compressor Model 1200 received an Emmy in 1984 from the National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences for its technical contributions to editing.[36][37]







Controversy and creativity[edit]
Critics argued that the Time Compressor technology, particularly when applied to movies and older television programs, amounted to "defacing" a creative work, analogous to colorization.[3] Film director Elliot Silverstein argued that, "To use these devices before the artist completes his work makes it part of the creative process. But once the artist has completed his work, to change it without his permission, however subtly, may prejudice his honor or reputation."[3] However, some artists took advantage of the creative possibilities. Stanley Kubrick, for example, used the time-compression device to speed up the sound of guns firing in Full Metal Jacket to intensify the battle scenes.[3] American musician and producer Chris Walla used the early model, Varispeech, to create audio effects, such as making "everything sound like Dr. Who."[32] Pat Metheny describes using Lexicon digital reverb and digital delay technology to "create the 'chorused' thing that i guess i would have to say i was the first to use extensively in jazz and that seemed to have influenced a lot of other guys to do the same."[38][39]
Selling Lexicon[edit]
The company went public in 1985 on the London Stock Exchange. In 1995, Lexicon was sold to Harman International Industries.[40]
Awards[edit]
1984: Emmy Award for Lexicon's Time Compressor Model 1200. Awarded by National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences (NATAS) for Technical Contribution to Editing.[36]

Digital Cardiac Monitoring System[edit]
Lee applied his knowledge of digital design to Electrocardiography (ECG) technology.[23] At the time, waveforms moved left to right across the screen, then returned to a starting point. A digital delay device would allow heartbeats to be monitored with a continuous moving image on a cathode ray terminal (CRT). Lee brought in Professor Stephen K. Burns, an MIT colleague with a strong interest in bio-medical electronics, to help develop the machine, patented in 1971.[24] Lee and Burns licensed the machine first to Becton Dickinson Company, a bio-medical company, followed by Hewlett-Packard and General Electric Company.

With Bagnaschi, they created the first digital signal processor.[26] Steve Temmer, the president of New York City’s Gotham Audio, heard about the experiment and commissioned 50 units of what would be sold as the Delta T-101 in 1971, introducing digital reverberation and effects processors to the recording industry.[1][27][28][29]
Digital Digital Time-Compression and Expansion: Varispeech[edit]







In 1972, Lee filed a patent for a device that could compress or expand the time duration of sound waves while preserving normal sound quality.[30] That year, Lexicon introduced Varispeech, an electronic speech compressor for use in the language instruction market, specifically to help blind students access text more quickly and persons with speech disorders study spoken language.[3][31] Varispeech, the first commercially available pitch shifter, could speed up or slow down recorded speech, while maintaining normal pitch.[32]
Audio Time Compressor and Expander[edit]
An advanced version of Varispeech—the Time Compressor 1200—was introduced in 1981.[33] The device coupled audio time-compression with visual components, allowing broadcasters to show movies and recorded programs at an accelerated rate without audio distortion. Programming and advertisements could be made to fit time slots without cutting. Technicians referred to this process as "lexiconning."[3] Lexicon CEO Ron Noonan described the technology avoiding the "tyranny of scissors." The device was also promoted for creative uses, such as heightening excitement in a TV program or news broadcast by speeding up time.[34][35] Lexicon's Time Compressor Model 1200 received an Emmy in 1984 from the National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences for its technical contributions to editing.[36][37]

Critics argued that the Time Compressor technology, particularly when applied to movies and older television programs, amounted to "defacing" a creative work, analogous to colorization.[3] Film director Elliot Silverstein argued that, "To use these devices before the artist completes his work makes it part of the creative process. But once the artist has completed his work, to change it without his permission, however subtly, may prejudice his honor or reputation."[3] However, some artists took advantage of the creative possibilities. Stanley Kubrick, for example, used the time-compression device to speed up the sound of guns firing in Full Metal Jacket to intensify the battle scenes.[3] American musician and producer Chris Walla used the early model, Varispeech, to create audio effects, such as making "everything sound like Dr. Who."[32] Pat Metheny describes using Lexicon digital reverb and digital delay technology to "create the 'chorused' thing that i guess i would have to say i was the first to use extensively in jazz and that seemed to have influenced a lot of other guys to do the same."[38][39]
Selling Lexicon[edit]
The company went public in 1985 on the London Stock Exchange. In 1995, Lexicon was sold to Harman International Industries.[40]
Awards[edit]
1984: Emmy Award for Lexicon's Time Compressor Model 1200. Awarded by National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences (NATAS) for Technical Contribution to Editing.[36]

Education[edit]
In September 1948, during the Chinese Civil War, Lee left Shanghai aboard the USS General W.H. Gordon to complete his undergraduate education at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He studied Electrical Engineering and earned his Bachelor of Science in 1950 and Master of Science in 1951. In Fall 1952, Lee entered the PhD program at MIT. He withdrew in 1954 to pursue his career, returned in 1964, and completed his PhD in Electrical Engineering in 1965.[4]
Early career[edit]
In 1954, Lee took a full-time position as Research Engineer with the Servomechanism Laboratory.[5] He was part of a team working on the first Digitally Controlled Milling Machine [6] In 1955, Lee joined the Bizmac Computer Division of RCA. He left a year later to join the UNIVAC super-computer division of Remington Rand.[7][8]
Project MAC[edit]
In 1963, Lee accepted a one-year appointment to work on Project MAC, a time-sharing Multiple Access Computer being developed at MIT under the direction of Robert Fano.[9] Fano launched Project MAC with a 6-week summer session that drew 57 people (including Lee) from universities, industry, and government for brainstorming and collaboration.[10] At the end of the session, Lee described his work on speeding up computer memory in "Lookaside Memory Implementation" (1963).[11] Six years later, Lee presented "Study of Look-Aside Memory," at the IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers) conference: Transactions on Computers, held in June 1969. Lee's paper was published in IEEE Transactions on Computers.[12] Look-Aside Memory is a forerunner of cache memory.[13][14][15]
Reading Machine Project[edit]
At the end of his Project MAC appointment, Lee resumed his graduate studies at MIT and joined Dr. Samuel Jefferson Mason's Cognitive Information Processing Group in the Research Laboratory of Electronics at MIT[16] Lee's group worked on a reading machine for the blind, the first system that would scan text and produce continuous speech.[17] For his Ph.D. thesis, Lee developed a method for converting printed words into phoneme-based spoken language.[4] Lee presented and published two papers on this work.[18][19]
Later professional life and inventions[edit]
In 1965, Lee joined the MIT faculty as an Associate Professor of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. He was promoted to full professor in 1968 and served until early retirement in 1987. In 1969, Lee founded American Data Sciences (ADS) with junior partner Charles L. Bagnaschi, an engineer. The company's name was changed to Lexicon Inc. in 1971. Their focus was applying digital delay to audio technology and language instruction.[20][21] In 1973, Lee brought in Ron Noonan as CEO to diversify Lexicon in the professional audio market.[22]
Digital Cardiac Monitoring System[edit]
Lee applied his knowledge of digital design to Electrocardiography (ECG) technology.[23] At the time, waveforms moved left to right across the screen, then returned to a starting point. A digital delay device would allow heartbeats to be monitored with a continuous moving image on a cathode ray terminal (CRT). Lee brought in Professor Stephen K. Burns, an MIT colleague with a strong interest in bio-medical electronics, to help develop the machine, patented in 1971.[24] Lee and Burns licensed the machine first to Becton Dickinson Company, a bio-medical company, followed by Hewlett-Packard and General Electric Company.
Audio Delay System: Digital Reverb[edit]
The cardiac digital delay unit led to Lee's work in digital audio delay. At the time, sound delay technology (used to synchronize speakers during live performances and create deliberate echo-effects) relied on tape loops and recording devices.[25] MIT lecturer Barry Blesser suggested they try running audio through Lee's digital delay apparatus. With Bagnaschi, they created the first digital signal processor.[26] Steve Temmer, the president of New York City’s Gotham Audio, heard about the experiment and commissioned 50 units of what would be sold as the Delta T-101 in 1971, introducing digital reverberation and effects processors to the recording industry.[1][27][28][29]
Digital Digital Time-Compression and Expansion: Varispeech[edit]







In 1972, Lee filed a patent for a device that could compress or expand the time duration of sound waves while preserving normal sound quality.[30] That year, Lexicon introduced Varispeech, an electronic speech compressor for use in the language instruction market, specifically to help blind students access text more quickly and persons with speech disorders study spoken language.[3][31] Varispeech, the first commercially available pitch shifter, could speed up or slow down recorded speech, while maintaining normal pitch.[32]
Audio Time Compressor and Expander[edit]
An advanced version of Varispeech—the Time Compressor 1200—was introduced in 1981.[33] The device coupled audio time-compression with visual components, allowing broadcasters to show movies and recorded programs at an accelerated rate without audio distortion. Programming and advertisements could be made to fit time slots without cutting. Technicians referred to this process as "lexiconning."[3] Lexicon CEO Ron Noonan described the technology avoiding the "tyranny of scissors." The device was also promoted for creative uses, such as heightening excitement in a TV program or news broadcast by speeding up time.[34][35] Lexicon's Time Compressor Model 1200 received an Emmy in 1984 from the National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences for its technical contributions to editing.[36][37]







Controversy and creativity[edit]
Critics argued that the Time Compressor technology, particularly when applied to movies and older television programs, amounted to "defacing" a creative work, analogous to colorization.[3] Film director Elliot Silverstein argued that, "To use these devices before the artist completes his work makes it part of the creative process. But once the artist has completed his work, to change it without his permission, however subtly, may prejudice his honor or reputation."[3] However, some artists took advantage of the creative possibilities. Stanley Kubrick, for example, used the time-compression device to speed up the sound of guns firing in Full Metal Jacket to intensify the battle scenes.[3] American musician and producer Chris Walla used the early model, Varispeech, to create audio effects, such as making "everything sound like Dr. Who."[32] Pat Metheny describes using Lexicon digital reverb and digital delay technology to "create the 'chorused' thing that i guess i would have to say i was the first to use extensively in jazz and that seemed to have influenced a lot of other guys to do the same."[38][39]
Selling Lexicon[edit]
The company went public in 1985 on the London Stock Exchange. In 1995, Lexicon was sold to Harman International Industries.[40]
Awards[edit]
1984: Emmy Award for Lexicon's Time Compressor Model 1200. Awarded by National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences (NATAS) for Technical Contribution to Editing.[36]

Francis Henry "Franny" Lee CBE (born 29 April 1944 in Westhoughton, Lancashire, England) is a former professional footballer.
Lee played for Bolton Wanderers, Manchester City, Derby County and England. A fast forward, he won League Championship medals with Manchester City and Derby, and scored more than 200 goals in his career. In 2010, he was inducted into the English Football Hall of Fame.
He holds the English record for the greatest number of penalties scored in a season, a feat which earned him the nickname Lee Won Pen and led to accusations of diving.[1] One such accusation, from Leeds United's Norman Hunter, led to an on-pitch fight.[2]
After retiring from football, Lee ran a successful toilet roll business, F.H. Lee Ltd, which made him a millionaire. In 1994, he became the major shareholder and chairman of Manchester City, but stepped down four years later.

Playing career[edit]
Lee started his professional career with Bolton Wanderers. Manchester City manager Joe Mercer signed him for a club record transfer fee of £60,000 in 1967.[3] He made his Manchester City debut in a 2–0 win over Wolverhampton Wanderers at Maine Road, and scored his first Manchester City goal the following week at Fulham. In his first season at the club, he scored 16 League goals in 31 appearances, playing a crucial role in City's push for the 1967–68 League Championship; Mercer described him as "the final piece of the jigsaw".[3] The title was decided on the final day of the season, City requiring a win at Newcastle United. City won the match 4–3, Lee scoring one of the goals, and were crowned champions. The following season Lee was part of the Manchester City team which won the 1969 FA Cup.
In the 1969–70 season, Lee was Manchester City's top scorer, an achievement he would subsequently match in each of the next four seasons.[3] His tally that season included one of the most important goals of his career, a penalty in the final of the European Cup Winners' Cup.
Lee represented England at the 1970 World Cup in Mexico and was the first English player ever to receive a card in a World Cup.
In the 1971–72 season, Lee set a British record for the number of penalties scored in a season, with 15 of his 35 goals scored from the penalty spot. Many of the penalties resulted from fouls on Lee, earning him the nickname Lee One Pen. Some journalists, holding the opinion that Lee gained a number of penalties by diving, used the name Lee Won Pen instead.[4] Lee's name is often cited in debates about diving in football; referees' chief Keith Hackett described him as a player who "had a reputation of falling down easily".[5]
Lee left Manchester City in 1974, joining Derby County. For the second time in his career, Lee joined a team viewed as contenders for that season's league title. Lee was upset at Manchester City's decision to sell him and marked his return to his former club by scoring the winning goal for Derby.[6] Lee scored 33 league goals that season, making him the top scorer in the division, and his goals led Derby to their second League title and the second championship medal of Lee's career. On 1 November 1975, Lee had a confrontation with Leeds United defender Norman Hunter, which gained a level of infamy after it was screened on Match of the Day. Lee won and scored a penalty in the match, and Hunter accused Lee of winning the penalty unfairly. The pair then exchanged punches, and were both sent off. In 2003, the incident was named by The Observer as sport's most spectacular dismissal.[7]
He also held the record for the most goals in Manchester derbies, scoring 10 goals in all against Manchester United, a tally that equalled Joe Hayes' record.[8] This record was later beaten by Wayne Rooney who scored his 11th goal in a Manchester derby on 22 September 2013.
Business career[edit]
After his playing career, Lee moved into business. His toilet roll manufacturing business once employed Peter Kay, later a famous comedian, who mentions his time there in his autobiography "The Sound Of Laughter".
In 1994, Lee became chairman of Manchester City, ousting Peter Swales from the position by purchasing £3 million of shares at a price of £13.35 per share.[9] Lee was welcomed as a hero by City's supporters, who had formed a movement named Forward With Franny backing his attempt to gain control of the club.[10] Upon becoming chairman, Lee made a series of extravagant claims about his plans for the club, announcing that "This will be the happiest club in the land. The players will be the best paid and we'll drink plenty of champagne, celebrate and sing until we're hoarse".[10] In 1995, he appointed his friend Alan Ball as manager, but the appointment proved unsuccessful and the club were relegated. Lee stepped down in 1998, with the club on the brink of relegation to the third tier of English football, a fate which Lee had dismissed at the previous annual general meeting by saying that he would "jump off the Kippax" if the club were relegated.[11] He was succeeded by David Bernstein. Lee retained a shareholding after leaving the board of directors but later sold all his shares to Thaksin Shinawatra.
In addition to his business ventures, Lee also had a career as a racehorse trainer. Notable horses trained by Lee include Sir Harry Hardman,[12] Allwight Then[13] and Young Jason.[14] Lee gave the trade up in 2001 to pursue his business commitments.
Before becoming a professional footballer Lee showed promise at cricket, representing the Horwich and Westhoughton Schools FA Team in 1958.[15] When his football career came to an end, he briefly returned to cricket, playing for Westhoughton's first XI in 1977 as a medium-fast bowler and middle to lower order batsman.[16]
Lee was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 2016 New Year Honours for services to football and charity.[17]

Playing career[edit]
Lee started his professional career with Bolton Wanderers. Manchester City manager Joe Mercer signed him for a club record transfer fee of £60,000 in 1967.[3] He made his Manchester City debut in a 2–0 win over Wolverhampton Wanderers at Maine Road, and scored his first Manchester City goal the following week at Fulham. In his first season at the club, he scored 16 League goals in 31 appearances, playing a crucial role in City's push for the 1967–68 League Championship; Mercer described him as "the final piece of the jigsaw".[3] The title was decided on the final day of the season, City requiring a win at Newcastle United. City won the match 4–3, Lee scoring one of the goals, and were crowned champions. The following season Lee was part of the Manchester City team which won the 1969 FA Cup.
In the 1969–70 season, Lee was Manchester City's top scorer, an achievement he would subsequently match in each of the next four seasons.[3] His tally that season included one of the most important goals of his career, a penalty in the final of the European Cup Winners' Cup.
Lee represented England at the 1970 World Cup in Mexico and was the first English player ever to receive a card in a World Cup.
In the 1971–72 season, Lee set a British record for the number of penalties scored in a season, with 15 of his 35 goals scored from the penalty spot. Many of the penalties resulted from fouls on Lee, earning him the nickname Lee One Pen. Some journalists, holding the opinion that Lee gained a number of penalties by diving, used the name Lee Won Pen instead.[4] Lee's name is often cited in debates about diving in football; referees' chief Keith Hackett described him as a player who "had a reputation of falling down easily".[5]

Lee retained a shareholding after leaving the board of directors but later sold all his shares to Thaksin Shinawatra.

Francis Henry "Franny" Lee CBE (born 29 April 1944 in Westhoughton, Lancashire, England) is a former professional footballer.
Lee played for Bolton Wanderers, Manchester City, Derby County and England. A fast forward, he won League Championship medals with Manchester City and Derby, and scored more than 200 goals in his career. In 2010, he was inducted into the English Football Hall of Fame.
He holds the English record for the greatest number of penalties scored in a season, a feat which earned him the nickname Lee Won Pen and led to accusations of diving.[1] One such accusation, from Leeds United's Norman Hunter, led to an on-pitch fight.[2]
After retiring from football, Lee ran a successful toilet roll business, F.H. Lee Ltd, which made him a millionaire. In 1994, he became the major shareholder and chairman of Manchester City, but stepped down four years later.

Playing career[edit]
Lee started his professional career with Bolton Wanderers. Manchester City manager Joe Mercer signed him for a club record transfer fee of £60,000 in 1967.[3] He made his Manchester City debut in a 2–0 win over Wolverhampton Wanderers at Maine Road, and scored his first Manchester City goal the following week at Fulham. In his first season at the club, he scored 16 League goals in 31 appearances, playing a crucial role in City's push for the 1967–68 League Championship; Mercer described him as "the final piece of the jigsaw".[3] The title was decided on the final day of the season, City requiring a win at Newcastle United. City won the match 4–3, Lee scoring one of the goals, and were crowned champions. The following season Lee was part of the Manchester City team which won the 1969 FA Cup.
In the 1969–70 season, Lee was Manchester City's top scorer, an achievement he would subsequently match in each of the next four seasons.[3] His tally that season included one of the most important goals of his career, a penalty in the final of the European Cup Winners' Cup.
Lee represented England at the 1970 World Cup in Mexico and was the first English player ever to receive a card in a World Cup.
In the 1971–72 season, Lee set a British record for the number of penalties scored in a season, with 15 of his 35 goals scored from the penalty spot. Many of the penalties resulted from fouls on Lee, earning him the nickname Lee One Pen. Some journalists, holding the opinion that Lee gained a number of penalties by diving, used the name Lee Won Pen instead.[4] Lee's name is often cited in debates about diving in football; referees' chief Keith Hackett described him as a player who "had a reputation of falling down easily".[5]
Lee left Manchester City in 1974, joining Derby County. For the second time in his career, Lee joined a team viewed as contenders for that season's league title. Lee was upset at Manchester City's decision to sell him and marked his return to his former club by scoring the winning goal for Derby.[6] Lee scored 33 league goals that season, making him the top scorer in the division, and his goals led Derby to their second League title and the second championship medal of Lee's career. On 1 November 1975, Lee had a confrontation with Leeds United defender Norman Hunter, which gained a level of infamy after it was screened on Match of the Day. Lee won and scored a penalty in the match, and Hunter accused Lee of winning the penalty unfairly. The pair then exchanged punches, and were both sent off. In 2003, the incident was named by The Observer as sport's most spectacular dismissal.[7]
He also held the record for the most goals in Manchester derbies, scoring 10 goals in all against Manchester United, a tally that equalled Joe Hayes' record.[8] This record was later beaten by Wayne Rooney who scored his 11th goal in a Manchester derby on 22 September 2013.
Business career[edit]
After his playing career, Lee moved into business. His toilet roll manufacturing business once employed Peter Kay, later a famous comedian, who mentions his time there in his autobiography "The Sound Of Laughter".
In 1994, Lee became chairman of Manchester City, ousting Peter Swales from the position by purchasing £3 million of shares at a price of £13.35 per share.[9] Lee was welcomed as a hero by City's supporters, who had formed a movement named Forward With Franny backing his attempt to gain control of the club.[10] Upon becoming chairman, Lee made a series of extravagant claims about his plans for the club, announcing that "This will be the happiest club in the land. The players will be the best paid and we'll drink plenty of champagne, celebrate and sing until we're hoarse".[10] In 1995, he appointed his friend Alan Ball as manager, but the appointment proved unsuccessful and the club were relegated. Lee stepped down in 1998, with the club on the brink of relegation to the third tier of English football, a fate which Lee had dismissed at the previous annual general meeting by saying that he would "jump off the Kippax" if the club were relegated.[11] He was succeeded by David Bernstein. Lee retained a shareholding after leaving the board of directors but later sold all his shares to Thaksin Shinawatra.
In addition to his business ventures, Lee also had a career as a racehorse trainer. Notable horses trained by Lee include Sir Harry Hardman,[12] Allwight Then[13] and Young Jason.[14] Lee gave the trade up in 2001 to pursue his business commitments.
Before becoming a professional footballer Lee showed promise at cricket, representing the Horwich and Westhoughton Schools FA Team in 1958.[15] When his football career came to an end, he briefly returned to cricket, playing for Westhoughton's first XI in 1977 as a medium-fast bowler and middle to lower order batsman.[16]
Lee was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 2016 New Year Honours for services to football and charity.[17]

Francis Henry "Franny" Lee CBE (born 29 April 1944 in Westhoughton, Lancashire, England) is a former professional footballer.
Lee played for Bolton Wanderers, Manchester City, Derby County and England. A fast forward, he won League Championship medals with Manchester City and Derby, and scored more than 200 goals in his career. In 2010, he was inducted into the English Football Hall of Fame.
He holds the English record for the greatest number of penalties scored in a season, a feat which earned him the nickname Lee Won Pen and led to accusations of diving.[1] One such accusation, from Leeds United's Norman Hunter, led to an on-pitch fight.[2]
After retiring from football, Lee ran a successful toilet roll business, F.H. Lee Ltd, which made him a millionaire. In 1994, he became the major shareholder and chairman of Manchester City, but stepped down four years later.

Playing career[edit]
Lee started his professional career with Bolton Wanderers. Manchester City manager Joe Mercer signed him for a club record transfer fee of £60,000 in 1967.[3] He made his Manchester City debut in a 2–0 win over Wolverhampton Wanderers at Maine Road, and scored his first Manchester City goal the following week at Fulham. In his first season at the club, he scored 16 League goals in 31 appearances, playing a crucial role in City's push for the 1967–68 League Championship; Mercer described him as "the final piece of the jigsaw".[3] The title was decided on the final day of the season, City requiring a win at Newcastle United. City won the match 4–3, Lee scoring one of the goals, and were crowned champions. The following season Lee was part of the Manchester City team which won the 1969 FA Cup.
In the 1969–70 season, Lee was Manchester City's top scorer, an achievement he would subsequently match in each of the next four seasons.[3] His tally that season included one of the most important goals of his career, a penalty in the final of the European Cup Winners' Cup.
Lee represented England at the 1970 World Cup in Mexico and was the first English player ever to receive a card in a World Cup.
In the 1971–72 season, Lee set a British record for the number of penalties scored in a season, with 15 of his 35 goals scored from the penalty spot. Many of the penalties resulted from fouls on Lee, earning him the nickname Lee One Pen. Some journalists, holding the opinion that Lee gained a number of penalties by diving, used the name Lee Won Pen instead.[4] Lee's name is often cited in debates about diving in football; referees' chief Keith Hackett described him as a player who "had a reputation of falling down easily".[5]
Lee left Manchester City in 1974, joining Derby County. For the second time in his career, Lee joined a team viewed as contenders for that season's league title. Lee was upset at Manchester City's decision to sell him and marked his return to his former club by scoring the winning goal for Derby.[6] Lee scored 33 league goals that season, making him the top scorer in the division, and his goals led Derby to their second League title and the second championship medal of Lee's career. On 1 November 1975, Lee had a confrontation with Leeds United defender Norman Hunter, which gained a level of infamy after it was screened on Match of the Day. Lee won and scored a penalty in the match, and Hunter accused Lee of winning the penalty unfairly. The pair then exchanged punches, and were both sent off. In 2003, the incident was named by The Observer as sport's most spectacular dismissal.[7]
He also held the record for the most goals in Manchester derbies, scoring 10 goals in all against Manchester United, a tally that equalled Joe Hayes' record.[8] This record was later beaten by Wayne Rooney who scored his 11th goal in a Manchester derby on 22 September 2013.
Business career[edit]
After his playing career, Lee moved into business. His toilet roll manufacturing business once employed Peter Kay, later a famous comedian, who mentions his time there in his autobiography "The Sound Of Laughter".
In 1994, Lee became chairman of Manchester City, ousting Peter Swales from the position by purchasing £3 million of shares at a price of £13.35 per share.[9] Lee was welcomed as a hero by City's supporters, who had formed a movement named Forward With Franny backing his attempt to gain control of the club.[10] Upon becoming chairman, Lee made a series of extravagant claims about his plans for the club, announcing that "This will be the happiest club in the land. The players will be the best paid and we'll drink plenty of champagne, celebrate and sing until we're hoarse".[10] In 1995, he appointed his friend Alan Ball as manager, but the appointment proved unsuccessful and the club were relegated. Lee stepped down in 1998, with the club on the brink of relegation to the third tier of English football, a fate which Lee had dismissed at the previous annual general meeting by saying that he would "jump off the Kippax" if the club were relegated.[11] He was succeeded by David Bernstein. Lee retained a shareholding after leaving the board of directors but later sold all his shares to Thaksin Shinawatra.
In addition to his business ventures, Lee also had a career as a racehorse trainer. Notable horses trained by Lee include Sir Harry Hardman,[12] Allwight Then[13] and Young Jason.[14] Lee gave the trade up in 2001 to pursue his business commitments.
Before becoming a professional footballer Lee showed promise at cricket, representing the Horwich and Westhoughton Schools FA Team in 1958.[15] When his football career came to an end, he briefly returned to cricket, playing for Westhoughton's first XI in 1977 as a medium-fast bowler and middle to lower order batsman.[16]
Lee was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 2016 New Year Honours for services to football and charity.[17]

Description


Additional information



Description
Francis Lightfoot Lee was a representative from Virginia and a signatory on the Declaration of Independence.  A member of the House of Burgesses, he was a noted radical opposing the Stamp Act.  He called for a general congress, and in 1774 was sent to the Continental Congress, where he served on many committees.  He retired from Congress in 1779 and served briefly in the Virginia Senate.
This Francis Lightfoot Lee mug is part of our Declaration of Independence series profiling the 56 men who signed the Declaration of Independence.  It was on June 11, 1776, that the Second Continental Congress appointed a “Committee of Five” which included: John Adams of Massachusetts, Benjamin Franklin of Pennsylvania, Thomas Jefferson of Virginia, Robert Livingston of New York and Roger Sherman of Connecticut to create this declaration.  A third reading of the draft text was reviewed by the “Committee of the Whole” on July 3, 1776, which resulted in the removal of two passages, most notably the passage that included a denunciation of slavery and the slave trade.  The Declaration of Independence was adopted on July 4, 1776, and signed by two of the appointed members of the “Committee of Five”.  Most of the 56 men signed it on August 2, 1776.  Six of these men were also signatories on the US Constitution in 1787: George Clymer, Benjamin Franklin, Robert Morris, George Read, Roger Sherman and James Wilson.
The content on the mugs is crafted for a stunning visual experience and to inspire an interest to learn more about history.  Robert Compton, who developed History Mugs, colorized the hundred-year-old photographs in order to bring the individuals back to life.  Biography and images are designed and printed in Bristol, Vermont, USA.

Investing Insights



Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/22/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.

Before investing, you should read the prospectus, offering circular, indenture, or similar document carefully for a full description of the product, including its features and risks, to determine whether it is an appropriate investment for your investment objectives, risk tolerance, financial situation and other individual factors, and be sure to re-evaluate those factors on a periodic basis.Performance data shown represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results. Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance data quoted.  Yield and return will vary, therefore, you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares.Stock markets are volatile and can decline significantly in response to adverse issuer, political, regulatory, market, or economic developments.
