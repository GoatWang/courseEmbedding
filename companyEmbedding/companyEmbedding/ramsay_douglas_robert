Douglas Robert Ramsay

 
One of the enduring characteristics          of honoured members in the          Canadian Petroleum Hall of Fame
          is that there are few "silver spoons"          among the men and women who
          have built the Canadian oil and gas
          industry. For the most part, these are
          self-made success stories, built from
        humble beginnings on a foundation of hard work and dedication.

          Doug Ramsay, co-founder and chief executive officer of Calfrac Well Services
          Ltd., fits that model to a T. Born and raised in Edmonton, Doug began his life in
          the industry the way many have before him—working the rigs right out of high
          school, first with BJ Well Services in 1973 and later with Dome Petroleum Ltd.,
          before returning to school to earn his petroleum engineering technology diploma
          (1977) and his certified engineering technologist certificate (1978) from SAIT
          Polytechnic, known at the time as the Southern Alberta Institute of Technology.
          With his engineering certificates in hand (he added a registered engineering
          technology designation to his resumé in 1980), Doug joined Delta
          Consultants (1973) Ltd. in 1979 as a consulting engineer, where he was
          responsible for drilling, completion and production operations for a number
        of oil and gas companies.

          Increasing responsibilities came his way, and in 1981, at the ripe old
          age of 26, Doug joined Eagle Exploration Inc. as manager of drilling and
          completions (D&C), where he handled D&C and workover operations in
          Kansas, Oklahoma and Texas. He was also responsible for the management
        of the company-owned drilling rig.

          He joined American Fracmaster Inc. in 1982, becoming general manager of
          its western division operations in the United States, before being promoted
          in 1984 to manage sales and marketing for its Canadian subsidiary, Canadian
          Fracmaster Ltd. He rose through the ranks there, and was eventually named
          president, in charge of the company's Canadian and international activities.
          The latter portfolio took him to Russia, where he established the first Canadian
          joint venture with Russian partners, and helped other companies, like Royal
          Dutch Shell plc, establish successful joint ventures in the former Soviet Union.
          After a brief hiatus in the mid-1990s, during which he built his family's
          ranching and real estate business, Doug joined forces with Ron Mathison
          to transform an existing coil-tubing entity and an insolvent fracture
          stimulation–services provider into Calfrac. From first-year sales in 1999
          of $4 million and a staff of 22, Calfrac has grown to be a world leader in
          the provision of frac services, counting annual sales of $1.5 billion and
        employing 3,400 people in six countries.

          All of Doug's professional successes, says Doug McNeill, executive vicepresident
          of business development for Stream-Flo Industries Ltd., can be
          traced to his early beginnings in the industry.
          "A long history in the industry, starting out in the field, has given him a
          great foundation to build on for his future leadership and entrepreneurial
          successes," McNeill writes in a letter supporting Doug's nomination to the
          Hall of Fame. "Doug drives integrity, service to the customer, his employees'
          well-being and personal growth for his employees and himself. A very
          humble individual, Doug always had his eye on retaining the culture that
        differentiated the company from the competition."

          Doug has devoted the same energies that built Calfrac to his local
          community, especially in the areas of safety and education.
          A member of the board of the STARS air ambulance service since 2007,
          Doug clearly understands the link between safety in the oilfield and the
          value STARS brings to remote oil and gas field operations. Doug and
          his wife, Susan, have personally committed $2 million to STARS, and
          he continues to provide valuable advice on how STARS can expand and
        enhance its service offerings in western Canada.

          And Doug hasn't forgotten the role SAIT played in shaping his career and
          giving him the foundations for success. With a $3-million contribution from
          Doug and Susan, the institution launched the Ramsay Centre for Petroleum
          Engineering Technology, and Doug continues to provide advice on industry
          trends, process and advancements, which SAIT's MacPhail School of Energy
        continues to incorporate into its curriculum.

          "The Ramsays' generous contribution demonstrates their commitment
          to building a strong, skilled workforce for Alberta and Canada, and it
          will directly impact, engage and inspire thousands of students pursuing
          a career within the petroleum industry," writes Brian Bowman, SAIT 's
          director, alumni and development, in a letter supporting Doug's
          nomination. "As a member of SAIT's Promising Futures Campaign
          Cabinet, he has demonstrated true leadership and an unwavering
          commitment to promoting the value of post-secondary education in the
          energy sector. His dedication and counsel helped draw vital support from
        his industry colleagues."

Douglas Robert Ramsay

 
One of the enduring characteristics          of honoured members in the          Canadian Petroleum Hall of Fame
          is that there are few "silver spoons"          among the men and women who
          have built the Canadian oil and gas
          industry. For the most part, these are
          self-made success stories, built from
        humble beginnings on a foundation of hard work and dedication.

          Doug Ramsay, co-founder and chief executive officer of Calfrac Well Services
          Ltd., fits that model to a T. Born and raised in Edmonton, Doug began his life in
          the industry the way many have before him—working the rigs right out of high
          school, first with BJ Well Services in 1973 and later with Dome Petroleum Ltd.,
          before returning to school to earn his petroleum engineering technology diploma
          (1977) and his certified engineering technologist certificate (1978) from SAIT
          Polytechnic, known at the time as the Southern Alberta Institute of Technology.
          With his engineering certificates in hand (he added a registered engineering
          technology designation to his resumé in 1980), Doug joined Delta
          Consultants (1973) Ltd. in 1979 as a consulting engineer, where he was
          responsible for drilling, completion and production operations for a number
        of oil and gas companies.

          Increasing responsibilities came his way, and in 1981, at the ripe old
          age of 26, Doug joined Eagle Exploration Inc. as manager of drilling and
          completions (D&C), where he handled D&C and workover operations in
          Kansas, Oklahoma and Texas. He was also responsible for the management
        of the company-owned drilling rig.

          He joined American Fracmaster Inc. in 1982, becoming general manager of
          its western division operations in the United States, before being promoted
          in 1984 to manage sales and marketing for its Canadian subsidiary, Canadian
          Fracmaster Ltd. He rose through the ranks there, and was eventually named
          president, in charge of the company's Canadian and international activities.
          The latter portfolio took him to Russia, where he established the first Canadian
          joint venture with Russian partners, and helped other companies, like Royal
          Dutch Shell plc, establish successful joint ventures in the former Soviet Union.
          After a brief hiatus in the mid-1990s, during which he built his family's
          ranching and real estate business, Doug joined forces with Ron Mathison
          to transform an existing coil-tubing entity and an insolvent fracture
          stimulation–services provider into Calfrac. From first-year sales in 1999
          of $4 million and a staff of 22, Calfrac has grown to be a world leader in
          the provision of frac services, counting annual sales of $1.5 billion and
        employing 3,400 people in six countries.

          All of Doug's professional successes, says Doug McNeill, executive vicepresident
          of business development for Stream-Flo Industries Ltd., can be
          traced to his early beginnings in the industry.
          "A long history in the industry, starting out in the field, has given him a
          great foundation to build on for his future leadership and entrepreneurial
          successes," McNeill writes in a letter supporting Doug's nomination to the
          Hall of Fame. "Doug drives integrity, service to the customer, his employees'
          well-being and personal growth for his employees and himself. A very
          humble individual, Doug always had his eye on retaining the culture that
        differentiated the company from the competition."

          Doug has devoted the same energies that built Calfrac to his local
          community, especially in the areas of safety and education.
          A member of the board of the STARS air ambulance service since 2007,
          Doug clearly understands the link between safety in the oilfield and the
          value STARS brings to remote oil and gas field operations. Doug and
          his wife, Susan, have personally committed $2 million to STARS, and
          he continues to provide valuable advice on how STARS can expand and
        enhance its service offerings in western Canada.

          And Doug hasn't forgotten the role SAIT played in shaping his career and
          giving him the foundations for success. With a $3-million contribution from
          Doug and Susan, the institution launched the Ramsay Centre for Petroleum
          Engineering Technology, and Doug continues to provide advice on industry
          trends, process and advancements, which SAIT's MacPhail School of Energy
        continues to incorporate into its curriculum.

          "The Ramsays' generous contribution demonstrates their commitment
          to building a strong, skilled workforce for Alberta and Canada, and it
          will directly impact, engage and inspire thousands of students pursuing
          a career within the petroleum industry," writes Brian Bowman, SAIT 's
          director, alumni and development, in a letter supporting Doug's
          nomination. "As a member of SAIT's Promising Futures Campaign
          Cabinet, he has demonstrated true leadership and an unwavering
          commitment to promoting the value of post-secondary education in the
          energy sector. His dedication and counsel helped draw vital support from
        his industry colleagues."

RAMSAY Parl of DALHOTSIE,
ANTIQUARIES do not exactly a∣gree
about the origin of the illustri∣ous
name of Ramsay.
Some are of opinion, that it came origin∣ally
from Germany, the armorial bearing be∣ing
an eagle displayed.
Others, with more probability, say, from
England; that it is local, and was first assum∣ed
from the lands and abbacy of Ramsay, in
Nottinghame-shire, &c.
Certain it is, the Ramsays were settled in
this country as early as the reign of king Da∣vid
I. who succeeded to the crown of Scot∣land,
anno 1124.—And it appears, from
Rymer's foedaera Angliae, and Prynne's collec∣tions,
that there were many considerable fa∣milies
in Scotland of that sirname, long be∣fore
the reign of king Robert Bruce.
It is evident also from our histories and re∣cords,
that (besides the Ramsays in Mid-Lo∣thian)
there were many eminent families of
that sirname in Fife, Angus, and Perth-shire,
in very early times, viz. the Ramsays of Co∣luthie,
Carnock, Corston, Forthar, Parbroath,
Auchterhouse, Balmain, Banff, and many o∣thers,
some whereof have been hereditary
sheriffs of Angus, sheriffs of Fife, Edinburgh,
&c. and have enjoyed the highest offices in
the state; but whether they are all descend∣ed
from the Ramsays of Dalhousie, who are
certainly the head or chief of the Ramsays in
Midlothian, we shall not pretend to determine,
but shall proceed to deduce the descent of this
noble family by authentic documents, from
I. SIMON de RAMSAY,* who flourished
in the reign of king David I. and Malcom IV.
and is witness in a grant of the church of Li∣vingston,
Page  107
in West-Lothian, by Thurstanus fi∣lius
Livingi, to the monastery of Holyrood∣house,
anno 1140.
He is also witness to a charter, in the reign
of king Malcolm, wherein William de Mor∣ville,
constable of Scotland,* grants the lands
of Gilmorstoun in Mid-Lothian, Eudulpho fi∣lio
Uthredi, &c. ante 1165, in which year
king Malcolm died.
He lived after the year 1170, and left issue
a son,
II. WILLIAM de RAMSAY, who succeed∣ed
him.* In a charter de libertate ecclesiae de
Coldinghame, confirmed by king William the
Lyon, this William de Ramsay, Duncan earl
of Fise, William de Lindsay, Robert de Lon∣don,
Henry de Graham, Hugo chancellor of
Scotland, Archibald abbot of Dunfermline,
&c. are witnesses, before the year 1198,
in which year Archibald abbot of Dunferm∣line
died.
He left issue two sons.
1. William, his heir.
2. Patrick de Ramsay, who is witness in a
confirmation charter of king Alexander II.* to
the abbacy of Dunfermline, anno 1227.
He was succeeded by his eldest son,
III. WILLIAM de RAMSAY, who was in
great favour,* both with king Alexander II.
and III. which last prince constituted him one
of his council, 1st September 1255.
He was also one of the magnates that ad∣vised
the king to change his ministers,* which
was accordingly done that same year.
In a charter of Duncan de Lascels,* con∣firmed
by Alexander de Moravia, this Willi∣am
de Ramsay, John de la Haya, &c. are wit∣nesses,
anno 1260.
He left issue three sons.
1. William.
2. Malcolm, who is witness in a charter
of William de Valoniis,*anno 1284.
3. John, who is witness in the same char∣ter
with his brother Malcolm, and also in the
following charters with his brother William.
He died before 1262, and was succeeded
by his eldest son,
IV. WILLIAM de RAMSAY, who is wit∣ness
in a donation by Symon de Kinneir, to
the abbacy of Balmerino, 1st September,
the 13th year of king Alexander III. and is
also mentioned in a charter of John of Strath∣earn,
terrarum de Beeth, &c. signed in the
royal apartment in the castle of Edinburgh,
in the presence of king Alexander III.—
Coram dominis Willielmo de St. Claro vice∣comite
de Edinburgh, Johanne de Lindes•• ca∣merario
domini regis, domino Ricardo Strai∣ton,
Willielmo de Ramsay,*Johanne de Ram∣say,
Alexandro de Meldrum, Alano de Wa∣chope,
Willielmo de Moravia, Thoma Logan,
Alano de Camera, et altis.—Dated in May
1278.
He died about 1295, and left issue a son
and successor,
V. Sir WILLIAM, who, in several au∣thentic
writs, is designed Willielmus Ramsay
de Dalwolsy, miles, &c. and is the first we
find designed by that title.
He,* with many of his brave countrymen,
was forced to swear fealty to king Edward I.
of England, for his lands lying in Mid-Lo∣thian,
viz. Dalwolsy, &c. anno 1296; and
also for his lands in the shire of Berwick, viz.
Fowlden, &c. eodem anno.
The Ramsays were now become so nume∣rous,
that it is not easy to distinguish what fa∣mily
they belonged to, except when they are
locally designed: there are no less than nine
of that sirname that swore fealty to king Ed∣ward
I.* for lands lying in different counties,
anno 1296 and 1297.
And though this sir William was after∣wards
obliged to renew the same oath,*anno
1304, yet being convinced in his own mind,
that an oath imposed by an enemy, who had
the power in his own hands, could not bind
him against the interest of his country, he was
amongst the first that joined king Robert
Bruce, when he begun to assert his title to
the crown, adhered firmly to his interest ever
after, and performed many brave and heroic
actions in the service of his country, under
the conduct of that great prince.
His brave friend and cousin sir Edmund
Ramsay was, with others of the chief nobili∣ty,
carried to London by king Edward I.* in
1296, but had the good fortune to get back
to Scotland in 1297: he also took the first op∣portunity
of joining king Robert Bruce, and
contributed not a little to the freeing of his
country from the oppressions of the English.
Sir William was one of the worthy patri∣ots,
who signed that famous letter to the pope▪*
asserting the independency of Scotland, anno
1320.
He was succeeded by his son,
VI. Sir ALEXANDER RAMSAY of Dal∣wolsy,
a man of singular sortitude and resolu∣tion:
a good historian designs him,*nobilis
Alexander de Ramsay inter Scotos famosissimus
probitate habebatur.
He per•ormed many glorious actions in
the wars against the enemies of his country,
in the reign of king David II, particularly,
Page  171
he, with remarkable courage and conduct,
raised the siege of Dunbar, then reduced to
great straits by the English, and soon after
surprised and took the strong castle of Rox∣burgh,*anno 1342.
King David, being perfectly sensible of his
worth and merit, thought he could never do
too much for so great a patriot; he therefore
made him constable of the castle of Roxburgh,
warden of the middle marches, and sheriff of
the county of Teviotdale.
This was highly resented by William Dou∣glas,
lord of Liddisdale, who having, by his
own valour and conduct, retaken most of
these lands from the English, and reduced
that country to the king's obedience, thought
none but himself had any title to the chief of∣fices
in those parts; he therefore beset sir A∣lexander,
when holding a court at Hawick,
and suspecting no danger, took him prisoner,
and confined him in his castle of Hermitage,
where,* 'tis said, he was starved to death, an∣no
1348.
He left issue a son and successor,
VII. Sir WILLIAM RAMSAY of Dal∣wolsy,
who, like many of his brave ancestors,
lost no opportunity of exerting his courage
in the wars against the English.
At the battle of Nisbet, he, with singular
prudence and conduct, drew the English ar∣my
into an ambuscade, whereby the Scots
gained a compleat victory,*anno 1355: For∣dun's
words are, miserunt quendam strenuum,
et armis probatum, Willielmum de Ramsay de
Dalwolsy, militem, &c.
In a charter of king David II. de libera fo∣resta
comitatus de Levenax,* William earl of
Douglas, Robert de Erskine, and William
de Ramsay, knights, are witnesses, anno
1360.
Sometime thereafter he put his son in pos∣session
of his estate of Dalwolsy,* Carington,
&c. reserving to himself only a liferent there∣of.
He obtained from king David II. for his
good and faithful services,* an annuity of 20l.
Sterling for life, upon which he got a charter
under the great seal, anno 1362.
Also a grant of the lands of Nether-Liber∣ton,
Willielmo de Ramsay domino de Dalwol∣sy
militi,*et Agnetae sponsae suae, &c. by a char∣ter,
dated the 24th of October 1369.
He died soon thereafter, leaving issue, by
the said Agnes, two sons.
1. Sir Patrick, his heir.
2. David de Ramsay, who got from his fa∣ther
the lands of Innerleith,* upon which he
got a charter, under the great seal, of king
Robert II. dated 2d July 1384.
He was succeeded by his eldest son,
VIII. Sir PATRICK RAMSAY of Dalwolsy,
who, in his father's lifetime, was designed of
Carington.
He made a donation to the abbacy of New∣bottle,
for the safety of his own soul,* and of
Margaret his spouse, &c. without date; but
as William Douglas, lord of Liddisdale, was a
witness, it must have been granted before
1353, in which year he died.
In his father's lifetime he made a resignati∣on
of his estate of Dalwolsy and Carington,
to and in favours of his grandson Alexander,
and the heirs of his body; which failing, to
James his second son, and the heirs of his
body;* which failing, to his own heirs what∣somever;
upon which resignation Alexander
obtained a charter from king David Bruce,
dated 15th June 1367.
Sir Patrick likeways gave the lands of Ma∣milcroft,
with the cote-yard thereof, lying in
the territory of Carington,*in vicecom. de
Edinburg, Johanni filio Maithaei, &c. This
charter is afterwards confirmed by king Da∣vid,
anno regni 40mo.
He died in 1377, and, by the said Mar∣garet
his wife, had issue two sons.
1. Sir Alexander.
2. James, mentioned in his father's re∣signation.
IX. Sir ALEXANDER, first son and ap∣parent
heir of sir Patrick Ramsay of Dalwolsy,
was designed Alexander of Carnock, in the
above resignation.
He died before his father, leaving issue a
son,
X. Sir ALEXANDER RAMSAY,* who suc∣ceeded
his grandfather, and, in a charter of
king Robert II. to Margaret countess of Mar,
dated 2d January 1378, he is designed Alex∣ander
de Ramsay dominus de Dalwolsy, mi∣les,
&c.
He made a donation to the abbacy of New∣bottle,*pro salute animae suae, et Catharinae sponsae
suae, &c. to which William earl of Douglas,
who died in 1384, is a witness.
In a charter of confirmation of the donati∣ons
made by his predecessors to the abbacy of
Newbottle,* he is designed Alexander filius do∣mini
Alexandri, &c. and, by the witnesses,
the confirmation is also before 1384.
He was inferior to none of his worthy an∣cestors,
for military skill or personal resolu∣tion,*
and signalized himself particularly in
the 〈◊〉 of his country, at the battle of
Hom•••on▪ where he unfortunately lost his
life, anno 1401.
Page  172
By the said Catharine, his spouse, he left
issue a son,
XI. ROBERT de RAMSAY, who succeed∣ed
him, and is designed dominus de Dalwolsy,
in a charter of the lands of Barmucks,* by Ar∣chibald
earl of Douglas, to James Dundas of
that ilk, anno 1416.
He left issue a son and successor,
XII. Sir ALEXANDER RAMSAY of Dal∣wolsy,
who, when a young man, obtained
letters of safe conduct from the king of Eng∣land,*
to accompany king James I. into Scot∣land,
anno 1423, and had the honour of
knighthood conferred upon him at his maje∣sty's
coronation, anno 1424.
He was one of the chief commanders with
the earl of Angus,* at the battle of Piper∣den,
where the Scots obtained a compleat
victory over the English, anno 1436.
He confirmed a charter of the lands of
Crichton to John Borthwick, upon the resig∣nation
of Robert Ramsay of Innerleith,* and
in this charter, which is dated in 1446, A∣lexander,
his eldest son and heir, is a wit∣ness.
He made an entail of his estate in favours
of his grandson Alexander, and the heirs-male
of his body; which failing to his own
second son Robert, and the heirs-male of his
body; which failing to his third son George,
and the heirs-male of his body;* which fail∣ing,
to his fourth son William, and the heirs-male
of his body, &c. all which is contained
in a charter, under the great seal of king
James II. dated 3d April 1456.
He got a charter from king James III. ba∣roniarum
de Dalwolsy et Kerington,*necnon ba∣roniae
de Foulden in vicecom. de Berwick. Al∣so
another charter of the same lands, dated
20th March 1473.
This sir Alexander sat in the parliament of
king James III.* wherein Alexander duke of
Albany was forfeited, anno 1479, and is
therein designed dominus de Dalwolsy, &c.
He married—, daughter of—,
by whom he had four sons, according to the
above entail.
1. Alexander.
