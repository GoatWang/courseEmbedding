Am nearly out of ink so I am reordering and really like the fact that this order is costing less than my first order due to a % off and free shipping. Your prices are much lower than the big box stores. I am on Social Security and this discount  really helps.Thank You!

LP® Vibra II with Metal Chamber
LP424D
$64.99

 


The LP Vibra-Slap was originally conceived as a durable replacement for the original delicate rattling horse jawbone. It is an essential instrument for any percussionist. The sound is created when the ball end is struck against the palm of the hand. Wood versions have warm, crisp tones while metal versions produce a clatter with greater attack and longer sustain.

 
FEATURES
 The sound is created when the ball end is struck against the palm of the hand Sound can be varied by simply rotating the sound chamber Produces a metallic clatter with long sustain

Integrated classifier hyperplane placement and feature selection

            Chinneck, John W.
        

            Highlights ► New feature selection filtering criterion that uses linear programming introduced. ► Can be applied before or after hyperplane placement, or integrated with it. ► Applying after hyperplane placement preserves the training hyperplane separation. ► The methods are fast and effective. ► The integrated method improves accuracy and reduces features the most.

Integrated classiﬁer hyperplane placement and feature selectionJohn W. ChinneckSystems and Computer Engineering, Carleton University, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada K1S 5B6article infoKeywords:ClassiﬁcationFeature selectionLinear programmingMaximum feasible subsystemabstractThe process of placing a separating hyperplane for data classiﬁcation is normally disconnected from theprocess of selecting the features to use. An approach for feature selection that is conceptually simple butcomputationally explosive is to simply apply the hyperplane placement process to all possible subsets offeatures, selecting the smallest set of features that provides reasonable classiﬁcation accuracy. Two waysto speed this process are (i) use a faster ﬁltering criterion instead of a complete hyperplane placement,and (ii) use a greedy forward or backwards sequential selection method. This paper introduces a new ﬁl-tering criterion that is very fast: maximizing the drop in the sum of infeasibilities in a linear-program-ming transformation of the problem. It also shows how the linear programming transformation can beapplied to reduce the number of features after a separating hyperplane has already been placed whilemaintaining the separation that was originally induced by the hyperplane. Finally, a new and highlyeffective integrated method that simultaneously selects features while placing the separating hyperplaneis introduced.Ó 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.1. IntroductionClassiﬁer decision trees are constructed by a sequential processof placing separating surfaces, frequently hyperplanes. It is oftenadvantageous to use as few features as possible when placing eachseparating surface, generally because there are costs associatedwith collecting the data for each feature (e.g. the cost of a medicaltest), but also because using fewer features sometimes results inbetter classiﬁcation accuracy.There is a sizable literature on feature selection for classiﬁca-tion. Excellent summaries are provided by Dash and Liu (1997)and Liu and Yu (2005). Following Liu and Yu (2005), there are threemain categories of feature selection methods: (i) ﬁlter methodswhich use metrics based on the data set to select features,(ii) wrapper methods which select subsets of features and evaluatethem by applying the data mining technique (e.g. separatinghyperplane) while using only the selected subset of features, and(iii) hybrid methods that combine elements of both ﬁlter and wrap-per methods.A subcategory of all methods is the search strategy. Completesearch evaluates all possible combinations of features; this is com-binatorially explosive and impractical for more than a few features,though it does return the optimum solution (relative to the evalu-ation metric). For data sets having many features, alternativeapproaches are needed. Random search begins with a random sub-set of features and iterates towards an improved set, e.g. via simu-lated annealing. Sequential search proceeds through the set offeatures based on an ordering heuristic. The two most commonsequential approaches are: Sequential forward selection. This begins with no features andselects the single feature that gives the best value of the evalu-ation metric. It then iteratively adds the next feature that pro-vides the next best value of the evaluation metric. One-by-oneaddition of features continues until a stopping criterion ismet, e.g. there is no improvement in the evaluation criterionby adding the next feature. Sequential backward elimination. This is the opposite of sequen-tial forward selection: it begins with all features included andeliminates the feature whose removal gives the best value ofthe evaluation metric. It then iteratively eliminates the next fea-ture whose removal gives the next best value of the evaluationcriterion. One-by-one elimination of features continues until astopping criterion is met, e.g. there is no improvement in theevaluation criterion by removing the next feature.This paper develops a variety of sequential forward and back-wards search methods using ﬁltering based on a new feature selec-tion evaluation metric. It also develops a new integrated methodthat uses this evaluation metric while alternating between featureaddition and separating hyperplane placement. Finally it developsnew methods for removing features in such a way that a given0957-4174/$ - see front matter Ó 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
