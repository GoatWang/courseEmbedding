Asset Management and investment products
Our asset management philosophy: Focus – Prudence – Thoroughness
For successful asset management, every aspect of the cooperation as well of the mandate must be precisely defined. This is done through close consultation between our clients and our investment experts. This process establishes the asset allocation and the investment guidelines, taking account of the risk criteria for the particular client. The investment strategy is implemented on this basis and the mandate objectives and parameters are harmonized with each other accordingly.
Mandates
We offer investment mandates in the asset categories Equities Switzerland, International, Europe and emerging markets, bonds in Swiss francs and foreign currencies, as well as special mandates such as commodities, currency, overlay, cat bonds, and others. You can select the investment universes "Sustainable" or "Responsible". The portfolio's performance and composition can be personally discussed at any time and monitored via our written reports or online via our e-services.

Institutional funds
Institutional investors can choose from Bank J. Safra Sarasin's broad range of funds to suit their particular requirements.

Private Label Funds
We offer certain institutional clients the possibility of setting up funds under their own name, with either Switzerland or Luxemburg as a domicile.

Sarasin Investment Foundation
Founded in 1991, the SAST investment foundation mainly serves small and mid-sized pension funds, vested benefits foundations, Pillar 3a foundations and other company pension schemes.

Structured products
Bank J. Safra Sarasin’s structured products can provide capital protection, a fixed source of income or higher than average returns. They are made up of a traditional underlying financial instrument (for example equities, fixed income securities) and derivatives (usually options).

Alternative investments 
As investor, you expect higher returns for the investment risk taken. Bank J. Safra Sarasin’s alternative investments help you achieve this goal. We offer investment products whose performance is largely independent from financial markets such as equities and bonds. Bank J. Safra Sarasin’s specialists are happy to offer advice and explain how alternative investments – Hedge Funds, Private Equity and Commodities '– can enhance your portfolio.
