Hedging Strategies

Simple Short Exposure. This strategy effectively shorts the S&P 500 by
        buying shares in the S&P 500 Short ETF.
        Simple Hedging will assume that 100%
        of the backtest's invested principal is always in the backtest's long positions.

        For example, if you choose a 25% hedging rate, then for a $10,000 portfolio,
        you will be long $10,000 and have a $2,500 short on the S&P 500.
        The short position will adjust each rebalancing period to match 25% of the total portfolio.
        Any gains/losses from the short are added to the overall available capital for the long positions in the
        portfolio.
      

Moving Average Hedge.  With this strategy, your portfolio will be hedged
        by shorting the S&P 500 whenever your long portfolio's performance drops below the monthly moving average.
        So if you set a 25% hedge, 25% of your long portfolio will be sold and the funds reallocated to the short
        whenever the hedge is in effect.
        Once your long portfolio performance goes back over the moving average, the short hedge will be removed
        and the funds from the short will be reallocated to your long positions.
      

        When hedging strategies are being used, backtests can only go back as far as 2006.  This is the date
        the S&P 500 Short ETF first appeared.

Stock Sell Buffer

      You can optionally include a stock sell buffer in your backtesting model.
      It works by keeping a stock in your portfolio even when it would otherwise drop out
      during rebalancing as long as it remains within your sell buffer threshold.
      For example, you are backtesting with the top 20 stocks each quarter and set a sell buffer of 50.
      In the first quarter, AAPL is one of the top 20 stocks and is included in the portfolio.
      In quarter 2, AAPL drops down to number 25. Without the sell buffer, AAPL would drop out
      for that quarter, but since it is still within the sell buffer threshold of 50,
      it will remain in the portfolio.
      Your portfolio size remains the same. The stocks that would have fallen out stay in and the
      stocks that would otherwise have been added stay out. Using the sell buffer may
      help produce a lower turnover rate.
    

      Sell Buffer Size (must be greater than # of holdings in portfolio to work):
      
No sell buffer
10
25
35
50
100




Rebalancing Frequency

      By default backtester rebalances quarterly using new 13F filing data. You can
      adjust the rebalancing frequency using the dropdown below. Reasons for
      changing the frequency include lower turnover and possible tax advantages
      by keeping stocks at least one year before selling.
    


        Do not rebalance after each quarter

or rebalance:
        
Every quarter (default)
 Every other quarter
 Once a year




How many days after the end-of-quarter date before doing the backtest? (0 - 60)

      Or use day whenever the filing was submitted to the SEC
      (or the last filing when using a group of funds):

      By default backtester will test your strategy using all available dates going back to 2001 (for subscribers only).
      You can optionally adjust when the backtest actually starts.

NEW YORK, Jan. 14, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Lakewood Capital Management, LP (together with its affiliates, "Lakewood"), the second largest unaffiliated shareholder of Select Income REIT ("SIR" or the "Company") (NYSE:   SIR) with current ownership of approximately 7.0% of the outstanding shares of SIR, today announced that it has filed a detailed presentation with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC").  In the presentation, Lakewood outlines its concerns with SIR's governance and the misalignment of incentives between the Company and its manager, Reit Management & Research LLC ("RMR").  The presentation also includes detailed information regarding the vast qualifications of Lakewood's nominee for election to SIR's Board of Trustees, William H. Lenehan.  On December 5, 2014, Lakewood nominated Mr. Lenehan, a real estate executive with significant public company experience, for election to the Board of Trustees at SIR's 2015 Annual Meeting of Shareholders.  Lakewood firmly believes that Mr. Lenehan's election as a Trustee would give shareholders a voice towards improving the Company's corporate governance and share price performance.  As set forth in more detail in the presentation, Lakewood believes that with proper governance improvements, SIR shares could be worth $40 per share or more, representing an increase of over 50% above recent trading levels.
Lakewood's detailed presentation is available at the SEC's website and can be viewed by clicking the following link: http://tinyurl.com/Lakewood-Presentation-Jan15 
Additionally, Lakewood announced today it has delivered an open letter to SIR shareholders, the full text of which follows:
January 14, 2015
Dear Fellow Shareholders,
Funds managed by Lakewood Capital Management, LP ("Lakewood") currently own in the aggregate approximately 7.0% of the outstanding shares of Select Income REIT ("SIR" or the "Company").  We are long-term SIR shareholders, having owned shares since the days immediately following the Company's initial public offering in March 2012.  Like many of you, we have grown frustrated with the poor governance at SIR that we believe has led to the stock's significant discount to net asset value and dramatic underperformance over the past year.  We believe this remarkably low stock valuation and significant share price underperformance is a direct result of governance concerns resulting from the misalignment of incentives between the Company and its manager, Reit Management & Research LLC ("RMR"), and a Board of Trustees that has not duly protected the interests of shareholders.  On December 5, 2014, Lakewood nominated William H. Lenehan, a highly qualified real estate executive with significant public company experience, to the Board of Trustees to give shareholders a voice and improve the Company's governance.   
Earlier today, we filed a detailed presentation with the SEC that is available on the SEC's website at the following link: http://tinyurl.com/Lakewood-Presentation-Jan15 
Specifically, our presentation outlines the following:

Our belief that SIR shares could be worth $40 per share or more, representing an increase of 50% above recent trading levels. 
How SIR's stock trades at a deep discount to its net asset value and has dramatically underperformed its peers due, we believe, to widely-held concerns around corporate governance. 
The misalignment of interests due to SIR's external management structure in which RMR receives fees almost entirely based off of the size of the assets of the Company, as opposed to SIR's share price performance. 
Several recent actions taken by the Board of Trustees that have only served to deepen investor mistrust. 
Our belief that shareholders will benefit meaningfully from enhanced governance and greater accountability. 
The vast qualifications of William H. Lenehan, our nominee to the Board of Trustees and an accomplished real estate executive who can help improve governance at SIR.
RECORD DATE
Please note that we have been advised that SIR has notified Broadridge Financial Solutions of a Wednesday, January 21, 2015 record date for the SIR 2015 Annual Meeting of Shareholders (the "Annual Meeting").  For comparison, this date is 48 days earlier in the year than expected based on last year's record date of March 10, 2014 for the 2014 Annual Meeting.  We have serious concerns that the acceleration of the record date will disenfranchise certain shareholders with respect to the election of trustees at the 2015 Annual Meeting.  
IMPORTANTLY, IF SIR SETS JANUARY 21, 2015 AS THE RECORD DATE FOR THE 2015 ANNUAL MEETING, ANY SHARES MUST BE PURCHASED FOR ALL PRACTICAL PURPOSES BY THE END OF TRADING ON THURSDAY, JANUARY 15, 2015 (ALLOWING FOR A THREE DAY SETTLEMENT PERIOD) TO BE ENTITLED TO BE VOTED AT THE 2015 ANNUAL MEETING.  FURTHERMORE, SIR SHAREHOLDERS SHOULD CALL THEIR BROKER TO ENSURE THAT THEIR SHARES ARE NOT CURRENTLY BEING LENT OUT IN ORDER TO MAKE SURE THAT THOSE SHARES ARE IN THEIR BROKER'S POSSESSION AND CAN BE VOTED AT THE SIR 2015 ANNUAL MEETING.
We look forward to communicating with you in more detail in the weeks to come regarding our serious concerns at SIR and the election of our highly qualified nominee to SIR's Board of Trustees at the 2015 Annual Meeting.  
Sincerely,
Anthony T. Bozza
