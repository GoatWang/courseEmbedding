Blaze Pizza is a modern day “pizza joint”, serving up artisanal pizzas that are both fast and affordable. 
View Blaze Pizza Website
Founded by Elise and Rick Wetzel (co-founder of Wetzel’s Pretzels), Blaze Pizza opened its first restaurant on August 6, 2012, in Irvine, CA, and the Company quickly gained attention for its chef-driven recipes, thoughtful interior design and service culture celebrating individuality. Named ‘#1 Brand of the Year’ in the 2017 Fast Casual Top 100, the Company is building momentum and developing a cult-like following as it expands across North America. Each Blaze Pizza restaurant features an interactive open-kitchen format that allows guests to customize one of the menu’s signature pizzas or create their own, choosing from a wide selection of fresh, “clean” ingredients. The generously-sized personal pizzas are then sent to a blazing hot open-flame oven – the centerpiece of the restaurant – where dedicated pizzasmiths ensure the thin-crust pies are fast-fire’d and ready to eat in just 180 seconds.  Restaurants make fresh dough from scratch using a proprietary recipe, which requires a 24-hour fermentation period to produce the Company’s signature light-as-air, crisp crust. Blaze also serves freshly made salads, blood orange lemonade and s’more pies, and offers gluten-free dough and vegan cheese for pizza fans with specific dietary needs.

Brentwood Associates Raises $1.15 Billion for Sixth Private Equity 
      Fund




Investment strategy focused on category-defining brands with 
      exceptional customer loyalty and growth prospects






July 12, 2017 07:42 PM Eastern Daylight Time



LOS ANGELES--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Brentwood Associates, a leading Los Angeles-based private equity 
      investment firm (“Brentwood”), announced the final closing of Brentwood 
      Associates Private Equity VI, L.P. and parallel funds (“Fund VI”), with 
      $1.15 billion of capital commitments. Fund VI closed at its hard cap and 
      exceeded its target of $750 million. Fund VI is the largest fund raised 
      by Brentwood to date, and the firm now has over $2.4 billion in assets 
      under management. The new fund follows the strategy of its predecessor, 
      Brentwood Associates Fund V, L.P. and parallel funds, which closed at 
      its hard cap in November 2014 with total commitments of $688 million.
    


      “We are delighted with the results of our fundraising process,” said 
      Brentwood partner, Bill Barnum. “Our team is very appreciative of the 
      long-term support we’ve received from our existing limited partners, and 
      we are excited to welcome new investors to Fund VI. We value these 
      relationships and the confidence our partners have shown in our team and 
      investment strategy.”
    

      Brentwood’s investment strategy focuses on partnering with growing 
      category-defining brands, with exceptional customer loyalty and growth 
      prospects, where Brentwood can utilize its experience and resources to 
      realize untapped value. Brentwood is a value-added partner with 
      management in driving growth through improved branding, marketing 
      optimization, new product development, direct-to-consumer growth, 
      distribution expansion and optimization, and acquisitions.
    

      Fund VI generally will seek to make control-oriented equity investments 
      in companies with enterprise values between $50 million and $500 
      million, with a focus on buyouts, growth equity investments and minority 
      recapitalizations in the North American middle market. The firm is led 
      by its partners Bill Barnum, Roger Goddu, Steve Moore, Eric Reiter and 
      Rahul Aggarwal.
    

      Kirkland & Ellis LLP provided legal counsel, and Park Hill Group LLC 
      acted as an advisor and exclusive placement agent.

Brentwood Associates Raises $1.15 Billion for Sixth Private Equity Fund

07/13/2017
 Brentwood Associates Raises $1.15 Billion for Sixth Private Equity Fund    Investment strategy focused on category-defining brands with exceptional customer loyalty and growth prospects  

  Brentwood Associates, a leading Los Angeles-based private equity investment firm (“Brentwood”), announced the final closing of Brentwood Associates Private Equity VI, L.P. and parallel funds (“Fund VI”), with $1.15 billion of capital commitments. Fund VI closed at its hard cap and exceeded its target of $750 million. Fund VI is the largest fund raised by Brentwood to date, and the firm now has over $2.4 billion in assets under management. The new fund follows the strategy of its predecessor, Brentwood Associates Fund V, L.P. and parallel funds, which closed at its hard cap in November 2014 with total commitments of $688 million.   “We are delighted with the results of our fundraising process,” said Brentwood partner, Bill Barnum. “Our team is very appreciative of the long-term support we’ve received from our existing limited partners, and we are excited to welcome new investors to Fund VI. We value these relationships and the confidence our partners have shown in our team and investment strategy.”   Brentwood’s investment strategy focuses on partnering with growing category-defining brands, with exceptional customer loyalty and growth prospects, where Brentwood can utilize its experience and resources to realize untapped value. Brentwood is a value-added partner with management in driving growth through improved branding, marketing optimization, new product development, direct-to-consumer growth, distribution expansion and optimization, and acquisitions.   Fund VI generally will seek to make control-oriented equity investments in companies with enterprise values between $50 million and $500 million, with a focus on buyouts, growth equity investments and minority recapitalizations in the North American middle market. The firm is led by its partners Bill Barnum, Roger Goddu, Steve Moore, Eric Reiter and Rahul Aggarwal.   Kirkland & Ellis LLP provided legal counsel, and Park Hill Group LLC acted as an advisor and exclusive placement agent.    ABOUT BRENTWOOD ASSOCIATES

 Beyond the tear sheet: War stories from the front lines of hedge fund due diligence 
 Investing in private partnership structures such as hedge funds, private equity and private real estate can be a fruitful and exciting endeavor, especially when venturing into asset classes that lack competition and efficiency. An important qualification to remember when beginning due diligence on a partnership is that no investment is perfect. Each one has its own risks, however esoteric or idiosyncratic, and risks change over time, as do the operations and other intricacies of investment management.
