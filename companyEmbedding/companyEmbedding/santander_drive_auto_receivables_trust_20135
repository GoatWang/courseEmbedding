Fitch Rates Santander Drive Auto Receivables Trust 2013-5 | Business Wire


























































      Fitch Rates Santander Drive Auto Receivables Trust 2013-5
    





November 21, 2013 02:06 PM Eastern Standard Time



NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Fitch Ratings has assigned the following ratings to the Santander Drive 
      Auto Receivables Trust 2013-5 notes:
    

      --$223,000,000 class A-1 notes 'F1+sf';
    

      --$252,000,000 class A-2A notes 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$252,000,000 class A-2B notes 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$226,580,000 class A-3 notes 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$201,920,000 class B notes 'AAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$204,470,000 class C notes 'Asf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$100,960,000 class D notes 'BBBsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$87,380,000 class E notes 'BBsf'; Outlook Stable.
    

      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    

      Marginally Weaker Credit Quality: The credit quality of 2013-5 is 
      representative of subprime borrowers. While the weighted average (WA) 
      Fair Isaac Corp. (FICO) score (590) and internal loss forecasting score 
      (LFS; 563) are relatively consistent with the prior three transactions, 
      the 2013-5 pool has a higher concentration in the weaker LFS score 
      buckets.
    

      Higher Credit Enhancement (CE): The cash flow distribution is a 
      sequential-pay structure. Initial hard CE totals 45.80% for the class A 
      up from 43% in 2013-4 (not rated by Fitch) and 2013-3, and is higher for 
      the class B, C and D notes, but unchanged for the class E notes. The 
      higher CE in 2013-5 compensates for the marginally weaker pool, lower 
      excess spread, and the incorporation of the unhedged floating-rate class 
      A-2B notes.
    

      Stable Portfolio/Securitization Performance: Delinquencies and losses on 
      SCUSA's portfolio and 2010-2012 securitizations declined from prior 
      years, supported by the improving U.S. economy and healthy used vehicle 
      values elevating recovery rates.
    

      Stable Corporate Health: SCUSA recorded solid financial results recently 
      and has been profitable since 2007. Fitch rates Santander, majority 
      owner of SCUSA, 'BBB+/F2' with a Negative Outlook.
    

      Consistent Origination/Underwriting/Servicing: SCUSA demonstrates 
      adequate abilities as originator, underwriter and servicer, as evidenced 
      by historical portfolio and securitizations' delinquency and loss 
      performance.
    

      Legal Structure Integrity: The legal structure of the transaction should 
      provide that a bankruptcy of SCUSA would not impair the timeliness of 
      payments on the securities.
    

      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    

      Unanticipated increases in the frequency of defaults and loss severity 
      on defaulted receivables could produce loss levels higher than the base 
      case and could result in potential rating actions on the notes. Fitch 
      evaluated the sensitivity of the ratings assigned to SDART 2013-5 to 
      increased credit losses over the life of the transaction. Fitch's 
      analysis found that the transaction displays some sensitivity to 
      increased defaults and credit losses, showing a potential downgrade of 
      one or two categories under Fitch's moderate (1.5x base case loss) 
      scenario, especially for the subordinate bonds. The notes could 
      experience downgrades of up to three or more rating categories, under 
      Fitch's severe (2.5x base case loss) scenario. For both scenarios, the 
      senior tranche notes do not display negative rating sensitivities.
    

      Key Rating Drivers and Rating Sensitivities are further described in the 
      accompanying presale report.
    

      The presale report is available to all investors on Fitch's website at 'www.fitchratings.com'.

                            [Dow Jones & Company, Inc. · 2007-04-04] - The following is a press release  from Moody's Investors Service: Moody's Assigns Definitive Ratings To Santander Drive Auto Receivables Trust 2007-1 Asset Backed Notes $1.2 Billion of Asset-Backed Securities Rated.
                        

                            New York,  April 04, 2007 -- Moody's Investors Service has assigned ratings to the  notes issued by Santander Drive Auto Receivables Trust 2007-1.
                        

                            This  is the first subprime auto loan securitization for 2007 and the first  public transaction for Drive Financial Services Inc. (successor to Drive Financial Services LP).
                        

                            The complete rating action is as follows:
                        


                                Issuer: Santander Drive Auto Receivables Trust 2007-1
                            

                                $204,000,000 5.324% Class A-1 Asset backed Notes, rated Prime-1
                            

                                $340,000,000 5.20% Class A-2 Asset backed Notes, rated Aaa
                            

                                $185,000,000 5.05% Class A-3 Asset backed Notes, rated Aaa
                            

                                $471,000,000 LIBOR + 0.05% Class A-4 Asset backed Notes, rated Aaa
                            


                            Moody's said the rating of Prime-1 for the Class A-1 notes is based primarily on the expected cashflows on the underlying receivables during the collection periods prior to the Class A-1 final maturity date, and partially on the financial guaranty insurance policy provided by Financial Guaranty Insurance Company (FGIC), whose insurance financial  strength rating is Aaa. The ratings of Aaa for the remaining classes of notes are based primarily on the FGIC policy. Moody's believes the risk  assumed by FGIC in insuring the notes is investment- grade at closing.

Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

	Exchange Commission on March 30, 2016 and is being filed for the purpose of (a) filing a new Exhibit 31.1 (Certification pursuant to Section 302 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (Santander Drive)), (b) amending and revising

	Item 1117 of

	Since July 2014, Santander Consumer USA Inc. has received civil subpoenas and civil investigative
	demands from various federal and state agencies, including from the U.S. Department of Justice under the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission and several state attorneys
	general, requesting the production of documents and communications that, among other things, relate to the origination, underwriting and securitization of auto loans for varying time periods since 2007. Investigations, proceedings or
	information-gathering requests that Santander Consumer USA Inc. is, or may become, involved in may result in adverse consequences to Santander Consumer USA Inc. including, without limitation, adverse judgments, settlements, fines, penalties,
	injunctions, or other actions.

	U.S. Bank, National Association, as the indenture trustee, has provided the following
	information: Since 2014 various plaintiffs or groups of plaintiffs, primarily investors, have filed claims against U.S. Bank National Association (U.S. Bank), in its capacity as trustee or successor trustee (as the case may be) under
	certain residential mortgage backed securities (RMBS) trusts. The plaintiffs or plaintiff groups have filed substantially similar complaints against other RMBS trustees, including Deutsche Bank, Citibank, HSBC, Bank of New York Mellon
	and Wells Fargo. The complaints against U.S. Bank allege the trustee caused losses to investors as a result of alleged failures by the sponsors, mortgage loan sellers and servicers for these RMBS trusts and assert causes of action based upon the
	trustees purported failure to enforce repurchase obligations of mortgage loan sellers for alleged breaches of representations and warranties concerning loan quality. The complaints also assert that the trustee failed to notify securityholders
	of purported events of default allegedly caused by breaches of servicing standards by mortgage loan servicers and that the trustee purportedly failed to abide by a heightened standard of care following alleged events of default.


	Currently U.S. Bank is a defendant in multiple actions alleging individual or class action claims against the trustee with respect to multiple
	trusts as described above with the most substantial case being:

	BlackRock Balanced Capital Portfolio et al v. U.S. Bank National Association

	, No. 605204/2015 (N.Y. Sup. Ct.) (class action alleging claims with respect to approximately 794
	trusts) and its companion case

	BlackRock Core Bond Portfolio et al v. U.S Bank National Association

	, No. 14-cv-9401 (S.D.N.Y.). Some of the trusts implicated in the aforementioned Blackrock cases, as well as other trusts, are involved in
	actions brought by separate groups of plaintiffs related to no more than 100 trusts per case.


	There can be no assurance as to the outcome
	of any of the litigation, or the possible impact of these litigations on the trustee or the RMBS trusts. However, U.S. Bank denies liability and believes that it has performed its obligations under the RMBS trusts in good faith, that its actions
	were not the cause of losses to investors and that it has meritorious defenses, and it intends to contest the plaintiffs claims vigorously.

	Santander Consumer USA Inc. is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Santander Consumer USA Holdings Inc., a Delaware corporation (SC Holdings). SC Holdings
	filed its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015 (the 2015 Form 10-K) after the extended filing deadline. SC Holdings identified certain material weaknesses in internal control over financial
	reporting in Item 9A of the 2015 Form 10-K. Certain of these material weaknesses involve the failure of controls to operate effectively, resulting in misstatements in SC Holdings filed financial statements as of for the years ended
	December 31, 2014 and 2013, and interim periods in 2015 and 2014. The errors and resulting corrections to annual financial statements are described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of the 2015 Form
	10-K, with corrections to interim periods shown in Item 9B of the 2015 Form 10-K. Additional information about SC Holdings, including information contained in required annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current
	reports on Form 8-K, is on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission under the name Santander Consumer USA Holdings Inc. and file number 001-36270.

	Managements Report on Assessment of Compliance with SEC Regulation AB Servicing Criteria



	 




	1.


	Santander Consumer USA Inc. (the Asserting Party) is responsible for Assessing compliance with the servicing criteria applicable to it under paragraph (d) of Item 1122 of Regulation AB as of and
	for the year ended December 31, 2015 (the Reporting Period). The transactions covered by this report include the Asserting Partys publicly offered registered SDART transactions consisting of auto loans (the
	Platform). See Appendix A.




	 




	2.


	The Asserting Party used the criteria set forth in paragraph (d) of Item 1122 of Regulation AB (See Appendix B) to assess the compliance with the applicable servicing criteria except for the following criteria
	which the Asserting Party determined are not applicable to the activities performed by the Asserting Party with respect to the Platform: 1122(d)(1)(iv), 1122(d)(2)(iii), 1122(d)(2)(vi), 1122(d)(4)(ix), 1122(d)(4)(x), 1122(d)(4)(xi), 1122(d)(4)(xii),
	and 1122(d)(4)(xiii).




	 




	3.


	There were no external enhancements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2015 with respect to the Platform taken as a whole.




	 




	4.


	With respect to servicing criterion, Item 1122(d)(1)(iii), some of the transactions included in the FY15 Regulation AB Platform require the Company to utilize a backup servicer when certain events, which are
	specified within the transaction agreements, occur. As of and for the year ended December 31, 2015, the events that would require a backup servicer as listed in the transaction documents did not occur, and therefore the requirement for a backup
	servicer does not apply.




	 




	5.


	With respect to servicing criterion Item 1122(d)(2)(i), we have engaged various vendors to serve as repositories for customer payments (i.e., a lockbox bank and a third-party money wire transfer provider).
	Similarly, with respect to Item 1122(d)(4)(i), we have also outsourced maintenance and safeguarding of the titling and registering of the vehicles through online services made available by the motor vehicle administrations in various states to
	DealerTrack Collateral Management Services, a third party vendor that did not provide an Item 1122 (d) attestation report. We have determined that none of these vendors are a servicer as defined in Item 1101 (j) of
	Regulation AB, and we elect to take responsibility for assessing compliance with the portion of the servicing criteria applicable to each such vendor as permitted by the SECs Compliance and Disclosure Interpretation 200.06, Vendors Engaged by
	Servicers (C&DI 200.06),formerly SEC Manual Telephone Interpretation 17.06. We have policies and procedures in place to provide reasonable assurance that each vendors activities comply in all material respects with the
	servicing criteria applicable to each vendor. The Asserting Party has taken responsibility for assessing compliance with regards to C&DI 200.06 with the portion of the servicing criterion performed by those vendors. We are solely responsible for
	determining that it meets the SEC requirements to apply C&DI 200.06 for the vendors and related criteria.




	 




	6.


	The Asserting Party has complied, in all material respects, with the applicable servicing criteria as of and for the year ended December 31, 2015 with respect to the Platform taken as a whole.




	 




	7.


	The Asserting Party has not identified and is not aware of any material instance of non-compliance by the vendors with regard to the applicable servicing criteria, or performance of certain functions with regard to the
	servicing criteria, as of and for the year ended December 31, 2015, with respect to the Platform taken as a whole.









	8.


	The Asserting Party has not identified any material deficiency in its policies and procedures to monitor the compliance by the vendors with the applicable servicing criteria, as of and for the year ended
	December 31, 2015 with respect to the Platform taken as a whole.




	 




	9.


	Deloitte & Touche LLP, a registered public accounting firm, has issued an attestation report on the Asserting Partys assessment of compliance with all the applicable servicing criteria as of
	December 31, 2015 and for the Reporting Period.

	REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM



	The Audit Committee of Santander Consumer USA Inc.


	Dallas,
	Texas


	We have examined managements assertion, included in the accompanying Managements Report on Assessment of Compliance with SEC Regulation
	AB Servicing Criteria, that Santander Consumer USA Inc. (the Company) complied with the servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122(d) of the Securities and Exchange Commissions Regulation AB for SCUSAs publicly offered
	registered SDART transactions consisting of auto loans (the Platform) as of and for the year ended December 31, 2015, excluding criteria 1122(d)(1)(iv), 1122(d)(2)(iii), 1122(d)(2)(vi), 1122(d)(4)(ix), 1122(d)(4)(x), 1122(d)(4)(xi),
	1122(d)(4)(xii) and 1122(d)(4)(xiii), which management has determined are not applicable to the activities performed by the Company with respect to the Platform. Appendix A to managements assertion identifies the individual asset-backed
	transactions defined by management as constituting the Platform. Management is responsible for the Companys compliance with the servicing criteria. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on managements assertion about the
	Companys compliance with the servicing criteria based on our examination.


	Our examination was conducted in accordance with the standards of the
	Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), and, accordingly, included examining, on a test basis, evidence about the Companys compliance with the applicable servicing criteria, including tests on a sample basis of the servicing
	activities related to the Platform, determining whether the Company performed those selected activities in compliance with the servicing criteria during the specified period, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the
	circumstances. Our procedures were limited to selected servicing activities performed by the Company during the period covered by this report and, accordingly, such samples may not have included servicing activities related to each asset-backed
	transaction included in the Platform. Further, an examination is not designed to detect noncompliance arising from errors that may have occurred prior to the period specified above that may have affected the balances or amounts calculated or
	reported by the Company during the period covered by this report. We believe that our examination provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Our examination does not provide a legal determination on the Companys compliance with the servicing
	criteria.


	As described in managements assertion for servicing criteria 1122(d)(2)(i), the Company has engaged vendors to perform certain activities
	required by this servicing criteria. The Company has determined that these vendors are not considered a servicer as defined in Item 1101(j) of Regulation AB, and the Company has elected to take responsibility for assessing
	compliance with the servicing criteria applicable to these vendors as permitted by the SECs

	Compliance and Disclosure Interpretation 200.06, Vendors Engaged by Servicers

	(C&DI 200.06) (formerly SEC Manual Telephone
	Interpretation 17.06). As permitted by C&DI 200.06, the Company has asserted that it has policies and procedures in place designed to provide reasonable assurance that the vendors activities comply in all material respects with the
	servicing criteria applicable to these vendors. The Company is solely responsible for determining that it meets the SEC requirements to apply C&DI 200.06 for the vendors and related criteria as described in its assertion, and we performed no
	procedures with respect to the Companys determination of its eligibility to apply C&DI 200.06.





	In our opinion, managements assertion that the Company complied with the aforementioned applicable
	servicing criteria as of and for the year ended December 31, 2015 for the Platform is fairly stated, in all material respects.

	Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm


	The Board of Directors


	U.S. Bank National Association


	We have examined managements assertion, included in the accompanying Report on Assessment of Compliance with Applicable Servicing Criteria, that U.S.
	Bank National Association (the Company) complied with the servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122 (d) of the Securities and Exchange Commissions Regulation AB for the U.S. Bank Corporate Trust Asset-Backed Securities
	Platform (the Platform), for which the Company provides trustee, registrar, paying agent and securities administration services, as of and for the year ended December 31, 2015, except for servicing criteria 1122 (d)(1)(iii), 1122
	(d)(4)(i)-(ii), and 1122 (d)(4)(iv)-(xiv), which the Company has determined are not applicable to the activities performed by them with respect to the servicing platform covered by this report. Management is responsible for the Companys
	compliance with those servicing criteria. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on managements assertion about the Companys compliance with the servicing criteria based on our examination.


	Our examination was conducted in accordance with attestation standards established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, as adopted by
	the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) and, accordingly, included examining, on a test basis, evidence about the Companys compliance with the applicable servicing criteria and performing such other procedures as we
	considered necessary in the circumstances. Our examination included testing of less than all of the individual asset-backed transactions and securities that comprise the Platform, testing of less than all of the servicing activities related to the
	Platform, and determining whether the Company processed those selected transactions and performed those selected activities in compliance with the servicing criteria. Furthermore, our procedures were limited to the selected transactions and
	servicing activities performed by the Company during the period covered by this report. Our procedures were not designed to determine whether errors may have occurred either prior to or subsequent to our tests that may have affected the balances or
	amounts calculated or reported by the Company during the period covered by this report for the selected transactions or any other transactions. Although the Company is responsible for assessing compliance with Items 1122 (d)(1)(ii), 1122 (d)(1)(v),
	and 1122 (d)(2)(iii) of Regulation AB, there were no servicing activities performed by the Company as of and for the year ended December 31, 2015, that required these servicing criteria to be complied with. We believe that our examination
	provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Our examination does not provide a legal determination on the Companys compliance with the servicing criteria.


	In our opinion, managements assertion that the Company complied with the aforementioned servicing criteria as of and for the year ended
	December 31, 2015, for the U.S. Bank Corporate Trust Asset-Backed Securities Platform is fairly stated, in all material respects.
