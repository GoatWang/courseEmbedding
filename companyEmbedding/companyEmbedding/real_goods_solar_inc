History of Real Goods[edit]
Early years[edit]
In 1977, 29-year-old John Schaeffer lived on an off-grid community in Mendocino County, California, and commuted 35 miles (56 km) to work each day as a computer operator. As one of the few people with a vehicle and a job in town, he became the designated person to pick up supplies for the community. This led him to create his own general store that sold all the “real goods” for off-grid living at fair prices. In 1978, Schaeffer took $3,000 in savings and a $5,000 loan from his father and opened the first Real Goods store in Willits, California.
One day, a man from Los Angeles arrived at the store with a Porsche full of solar panels. First developed at Bell Laboratories in the 1950s and used in the 1960s in the NASA space program,[2] solar panels had yet to find commercial applications. On a whim, John bought 100 of these novel 9-Watt panels for $600 apiece. He quickly sold them for $900 each to people interested in simple living in Mendocino County who also wanted to enjoy light fixtures, TV and a few of mainstream civilization’s other creature comforts without doing business with utilities. These sales made Real Goods one of the first companies to sell a solar panel commercially in the United States.[3] The success of the Willits store prompted Schaeffer to open an additional store in Ukiah, California, in 1980 and a third store in Santa Rosa, California in 1982. That same year, Real Goods published the first edition of The Solar Living Source Book, which was written as a comprehensive source for sustainable living principles and practices.
By 1985, Real Goods' annual sales were $3 million, but growth was erratic, and all three retail stores were closed. Schaeffer invested his last $3,000 in a 16-page catalog and rejuvenated the company as a mail order business operating out of his garage, sending catalogs to the 2,000-name mailing list the company had accumulated.[4] Customers returned and the company was revived.
The 1990s[edit]
During the 1990s, Real Goods expanded its business by presenting a clear message about the benefits of solar energy. In 1990, the entire solar industry received a boost from the 20th anniversary of Earth Day and the Persian Gulf War, and Real Goods took advantage of it.[3] That year, the company also set its Billion Pound Goal to keep one billion pounds of carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere by 2000, which it completed three years early in 1997.
In 1991, Real Goods held its first direct public stock offering, selling stock directly to its customers, and raised $1 million. The following year Real Goods declared a National Off-The-Grid Day, which soon became the National Tour of Solar Homes, during which the public could see solar-powered living firsthand. Real Goods held its second stock offering in 1993, and in 1994, used those funds to break ground on the Solar Living Center (SLC) in Hopland, California. The same year, Real Goods launched its e-commerce business. In 1998, Schaeffer formed the Solar Living Institute (SLI), a nonprofit organization whose mission is to promote sustainable living through inspirational environmental education.[5] The SLI offers classes and workshops and manages the SLC.
Partnership with Gaiam and the birth of Real Goods Solar[edit]
Real Goods grew significantly in the first decade of the 21st century. By this time, the company had five brick and mortar stores located in Hopland, Santa Rosa, Los Gatos, Berkeley and West Los Angeles, California. The company’s catalog and e-commerce businesses grew as well, and Real Goods increased its annual revenues to $19 million.
In 2001, Real Goods merged with the sustainable lifestyle company Gaiam Inc. (NASDAQ: GAIA) in a stock swap worth $8.7 million.[6] Per the merger agreement, Real Goods shareholders received one share of Class A GAIA common stock for each 10 shares of Real Goods stock owned.[7] Gaiam consolidated order processing and distribution in Cincinnati and accounting responsibilities in Broomfield, Colorado, and implemented a new supply chain management information system.
With the influx of additional capital and the power of Gaiam behind it, Real Goods looked for a promising growth opportunity and found it in the residential solar installation market. Since Real Goods was now headquartered in Colorado, yet maintained the SLC, SLI and offices in California, and since the federal government and both states offered attractive tax incentives for installing solar systems, Real Goods opened its residential solar system installation division in both states in 2002. The commercial solar business was also growing, and Real Goods launched its commercial solar installation division in 2004.
Initial public offering[edit]
In 2008, Real Goods positioned itself for aggressive growth by separating its mail order division from Gaiam, re-launching the Real Goods website as a stand-alone e-commerce channel, expanding its solar division, and going public. On May 8, 2008, Real Goods completed an initial public offering as Real Goods Solar and raised $55 million. Real Goods Solar began trading on the NASDAQ under the symbol RSOL.[8] Through holding 100 percent of Real Goods’ Class B shares, Gaiam maintained control of Real Goods.
Solar installation expansion[edit]
Between 2007 and 2008 Real Goods acquired four solar installation companies in California and became one of the nation’s largest solar installers. In November 2007, Real Goods Solar acquired San Rafael, California-based Marin Solar for $3.2 million in cash and stock.[9] In a similar deal inked in January 2008, RSOL purchased Carlson Solar, headquartered in Hemet, California for $3.2 million in cash and stock.[9] In August 2008, Real Goods Solar completed its third acquisition — Santa Cruz, California-based Independent Energy Systems for $3.6 million.[9] In October 2008, RSOL completed its fourth acquisition in less than a year by acquiring Regrid Power of Campbell, California in a deal valued at $3.8 million in cash and stock.[9] With the acquisition of Marin Solar, Real Goods added the commercial experience and expertise necessary to position itself as a major competitor in the commercial solar installation market.
Merger with Alteris Renewables[edit]
On June 22, 2011, Real Goods Solar announced a merger agreement with Connecticut-based renewable energy installer Earth Friendly Energy Group Holdings, LLC, d/b/a Alteris Renewables. The merger was completed on December 20, 2011, and the combined company retained the Real Goods Solar name, NASDAQ ticker (RSOL), and Louisville, Colorado headquarters. Alteris equity holders were issued 8.7 million shares of Real Goods Solar Class A common stock in exchange for 100% of Alteris' outstanding equity.[10]
The merger was seen by both companies as an opportunity to increase its national footprint, as Real Goods Solar operated in the West and Alteris operated in the Northeast. The companies' respective regions were considered the two fastest-growing markets for solar installations, and both companies had more than 30 years of experience operating in them.[11]
Divisions[edit]
Real Goods Solar division[edit]
Today, Real Goods Solar maintains its headquarters in Louisville, Colorado. By the start of 2013, the company had installed over 235 MW of solar power across more than 22,500 solar energy systems for residential, commercial, and utility properties.[12]
Real Goods retail division[edit]
Real Goods' retail division is headquartered at its flagship retail store in Hopland, California, where e-commerce and order fulfillment operations are located. The Real Goods Store and its e-commerce website offer a range of items for sustainable on- and off-grid living, including urban gardening and remote homesteading supplies, pond and composting tools, camping gear, organic bedding and clothing, non-toxic cleaning and laundry solutions, air and water purifiers, appliances, and renewable energy systems for solar, wind, hydro and solar hot water.
The Hopland store was opened in 1996 on the Solar Living Center grounds. Housed in a strawbale building utilizing passive solar design principles, the store is lighted and heated by an onsite solar system and by south-facing windows that capture the sun’s heat.
In the early 2000s, Real Goods refocused on its national mail order and local solar installation businesses and closed all of its physical stores except for the Hopland store. Catalog printing was stopped in the winter of 2010 in favor of a paperless commerce solution.
Solar Living Source Book[edit]
Real Goods published its first edition of The Solar Living Source Book in 1982. It was written as a one-stop information source for renewable energy and sustainable living. Now in its 30th anniversary (13th) edition, and printed using soy inks on 100 percent post-consumer content recycled paper, the Solar Living Source Book is a comprehensive reference for the layperson on renewable energy technologies and sustainable living. There are more than 600,000 copies in print in 44 English-speaking countries.
Solar Living Institute[edit]
In 1998, John Schaeffer founded a 501(c)(3) nonprofit education institute called the Solar Living Institute (SLI) with the mission of promoting sustainable living through inspirational environmental education. The result is an organization that functions both as a renewable energy and green living experiential classroom and as an example of successful sustainable development. Throughout each year the SLI hosts between 50 and 75 hands-on workshops on everything from photovoltaic system design and installation and strawbale home construction to beekeeping, green career seminars and its Earth Day for Kids programs that introduces inner-city kids to renewable energy and environmental responsibility.[13] The SLI also runs a year-round internship program that offers interns in-depth, hands-on training in renewable energy systems, sustainable building, community gardening and more. In 2009, the SLI began teaching classes online and in 2010, the nonprofit launched an online solar energy training program. The SLI had taught more than 1,000 workshops to nearly 10,000 students.
Solar Living Center[edit]
The SLI and the Real Goods Store are both headquartered at the Solar Living Center (SLC), a 5,000-square-foot (460 m2) strawbale building surrounded by 12 acres (49,000 m2) of permaculture gardens in Hopland, California. The building was designed using passive solar principles and requires little additional heat or light, and the gardens are laid out in a pattern similar to that of U.S. climate zones. In 2000, Real Goods installed a commercial solar system at the SLC that produces 160,000 kW-hours of electricity annually. Opened in 1996, the SLC serves as a “place in the sun” for everyone interested in sustainable living. Approximately 200,000 people visit the SLC each year. The SLC also hosts the annual Solfest celebration, a four-day renewable energy and sustainable living fair and fundraiser for the SLI that includes workshops, demonstrations, educational panels, keynote speakers, music, artists, wine tasting and dancing.[14]
Environmental commitment[edit]
Billion pound goal[edit]
In 1990, based on concerns about global warming, Real Goods set a goal to keep one billion pounds of carbon dioxide (CO2) out of the atmosphere within 10 years through customer purchases of products that reduce CO2 production. Calculations of CO2 reduction on a product-by-product basis were based on a formula developed by the Union of Concerned Scientists. In addition, Real Goods changed its energy usage, shipping and other corporate practices to become more environmentally friendly. The company tracked its progress through regular updates in the Real Goods catalog. In 1997, that goal was achieved three years ahead of schedule. In 2005, Real Goods and Gaiam set another goal to eliminate one billion pounds of CO2 from the atmosphere by 2010. In 2008, that goal was achieved two years early.[15]
Paper reduction/packaging[edit]
In 2007, Real Goods increased the post-consumer recycled paper content for its catalogs from 20 percent to 30 percent. This earned the company Forest Stewardship Council certification. From 2008 to 2010 Real Goods lowered its paper and printing impact another 75 percent by reducing paper weight, catalog trim size and reducing the number of catalogs mailed by driving more business to the Internet. Real Goods customers were asked to reduce the number of catalogs they requested, and catalogs were mailed based on past purchase activity. Customers were also encouraged to shop at Real Goods’ website as exemplified by the “Don’t Buy From This Catalog” campaign the company ran in its Spring/Summer 2010 and Fall/Holiday 2010 catalogs.[16]
Go Zero[edit]
In 2006, Real Goods and Gaiam partnered with The Conservation Fund to introduce the world’s first carbon-neutral product shipping program called Go Zero. Gaiam Real Goods made a contribution that allowed Go Zero to plant nearly 1,500 trees, which offset the company’s operations at its headquarters and fulfillment center for that year.
Company headquarters[edit]
In 2008, Real Goods — with Gaiam as its majority shareholder — moved into new corporate offices in Louisville, Colorado and went solar with a 100 kW solar system installed by Real Goods Solar[17] that provides approximately 20 percent of the company’s energy requirements. In addition, the new headquarters feature low-VOC paints, bamboo flooring and cabinetry, earth-friendly carpet and glue, and recycled office cubicles. In 2008, Real Goods also added composting collection to its comprehensive office recycling program, and some company parties are now zero-waste events.
Awards and accolades[edit]
The company made Inc. magazine’s Top 500 Fastest Growing Companies list and John Schaeffer was the Small Business Administration’s Small Business Person of the Year in 1994. Schaeffer also received the 2007 Green Power Pioneer Award,[18] and was inducted into the International Green Industry Hall of Fame in March 2013.[19] Real Goods has received three Rodale Awards, as well as news coverage in The Wall Street Journal, Fortune, Time and numerous other publications.[3]

History of Real Goods[edit]
Origin of Real Goods[edit]
In 1977, Real Goods President and founder John Schaeffer was 29 years old and living in an off-grid community in Mendocino County, California. As one of the few members of the community with a vehicle and a commute, he became the designated person to pick up supplies for the community. In 1978, Schaeffer took $3,000 in savings and a $5,000 loan from his father and opened his own general store with a partner in Willits, California that sold all the "real goods" for off-grid living at fair prices.
During the store's first year, Schaeffer bought 100 9-Watt solar panels for $600 each and sold them for $900 each to people interested in getting their electricity from a source other than an electric utility. These sales made Real Goods the first company to sell a solar panel commercially in the United States.[1]
By 1982, Real Goods had opened two additional stores in Ukiah, California and Santa Rosa, California, and published the first edition of the Solar Living Sourcebook (now in its 14th edition), written by Schaeffer as a comprehensive source for sustainable living principles and practices. By 1985, the three Real Goods stores had closed and Schaeffer invested his last $3,000 in a 16-page catalog, successfully reinventing the company as a mail order business operating out of his garage.
In 1991, Real Goods held its first direct public stock offering (DPO), selling stock directly to its customers, and raised $1 million. The following year, Real Goods declared a National Off-The-Grid Day - which became the National Tour of Solar Homes - during which the public could see solar-powered living firsthand. Real Goods held its second stock offering in 1993. In 1994, the company used those funds to break ground on the Solar Living Center in Hopland, California, which is home to the Real Goods retail store today, as well as the Solar Living Institute. The same year, Real Goods launched its e-commerce business.
Partnership with Gaiam and the Birth of Real Goods Solar[edit]
In 2001, Real Goods merged with the sustainable lifestyle company Gaiam in a stock swap worth $8.7 million.[2] Per the merger agreement, Real Goods shareholders received one share of Gaiam's Class A common stock for each 10 shares of Real Goods stock owned,[3] and Real Goods' headquarters moved to Broomfield, Colorado.
With the influx of additional capital from the Gaiam merger behind it, Real Goods opened a residential solar panel installation division in 2002 called Real Goods Solar. Real Goods Solar began installing home solar panel systems in Colorado, where Real Goods was now headquartered, and in California, where it maintained the Solar Living Center. Real Goods Solar’s success led Real Goods to launch a commercial solar panel installation division in 2004.
In 2008, Real Goods - with Gaiam as its majority shareholder - moved into new corporate headquarters in Louisville, Colorado and began using solar power itself with a 100 kW solar photovoltaic system installed by Real Goods Solar.[4] The Louisville headquarters featured a number of other environmentally-friendly features including low-VOC paint, bamboo flooring and cabinetry, environmentally-friendly carpet and glue, recycled office cubicles, and an office recycling program that included compost collection. Many Real Goods company parties were zero-waste events.
Initial Public Offering and Solar Installation Expansion[edit]
On May 8, 2008, Real Goods completed an initial public offering (IPO) as Real Goods Solar and raised $55 million. Real Goods Solar began trading on the Nasdaq under the symbol RSOL.[5] Through holding 100% of Real Goods Solar's Class B shares, Gaiam maintained control of the company.
Between 2007 and 2008, Real Goods Solar, led by Schaeffer as its CEO, acquired four solar panel installation companies in California and became one of the nation's largest solar installers. In November 2007, Real Goods Solar acquired San Rafael, California-based Marin Solar for $3.2 million in cash and stock.[6] In January 2008, Real Goods Solar purchased Hemet, California-based Carlson Solar for $3.2 million in cash and stock.[6] In August 2008, Real Goods Solar acquired Santa Cruz, California-based Independent Energy Systems for $3.6 million.[6] In October 2008, Real Goods Solar acquired Campbell, California-based Regrid Power for $3.8 million in cash and stock.[6]
On December 20, 2011, Real Goods Solar completed a merger agreement with Connecticut-based renewable energy installer Earth Friendly Energy Group Holdings, LLC, d/b/a Alteris Renewables. The combined company retained the Real Goods Solar name, Nasdaq ticker RSOL, and Louisville, Colorado headquarters. Alteris equity holders were issued 8.7 million shares of Real Goods Solar Class A common stock in exchange for 100% of Alteris' outstanding equity.[7]
A Return to the Real Goods Roots[edit]
In January 2014, Real Goods Solar announced a combining of its residential and commercial solar installation divisions, a company-wide rebranding as RGS Energy, and a switch from the Nasdaq ticker RSOL to RGSE.[8]
In December 2014, John Schaeffer purchased 100% of the Real Goods retail, catalog, and e-commerce business from RGS Energy for $1 million.[9] Schaeffer, along with his wife Nantzy Hensley, is now once again the sole owner of Real Goods, as he was before the merger with Gaiam.
Solar Living Center[edit]
The Solar Living Center (SLC) is a 12-acre living demonstration of permaculture and renewable energy in Hopland, California. It is also home to the nonprofit Solar Living Institute and the Real Goods retail store. The SLC was founded by John Schaeffer in 1994 on land that was formerly a landfill for the California Department of Transportation, and opened in 1996. It is a popular tourist attraction and rest stop along U.S. Route 101, and is notable for some unique features like its "grow-through car" tree grove and its self-proclaimed "weird restrooms" made from recycled plastic bottles and repurposed toilet tank lids. A solar photovoltaic system on the property produces approximately 160,000 kW-hours of electricity annually. The SLC receives as many as 200,000 visitors each year.[10] The SLC is also home to an observation beehive, pollinator garden, children’s garden, sculpture garden, permaculture vegetable garden, bamboo pyramid, hops tipi, lavender labyrinth, and bicycle generator exhibit. In October 2015, a solar-powered cannabis dispensary, Emerald Pharms, opened on the property, focusing on the medical, non-psychoactive CBD strains, and on education.
Solar Living Institute[edit]
In 1998, Schaeffer formed the Solar Living Institute, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization whose mission is to promote sustainable living through inspirational environmental education.[11] The Solar Living Institute is headquartered at the Solar Living Center along with the Real Goods retail store. It offers classes and workshops to the public and a year-round internship program.
The Real Goods Store[edit]
The Real Goods retail store is located at the center of the SLC grounds. It is a 5,000 square foot building made of strawbales and pneumatically impacted stabilized earth (PISE), and was designed using passive solar principles so that it requires little additional heat and light beyond what is provided by the sun.[10] The Real Goods retail store is open to the public for shopping, and also houses Real Goods' e-commerce and order fulfillment operations.
Environmental Commitments[edit]
Billion Pound Goal[edit]
In 1990, Real Goods set a Billion Pound Goal to prevent a billion pounds of carbon dioxide from entering the atmosphere by 2000 through changes to its business practices and customer purchases of products that reduce CO2 emission (calculated using a formula developed by the Union of Concerned Scientists). The company tracked its progress through regular updates in its mail order catalogs, and in 1997 the goal was completed three years early. In 2005, Real Goods set another Billion Pound Goal to be reached by 2010, and in 2008 that goal was reached two years early.[12]
Paper an Packaging Reduction[edit]
In 2007, Real Goods earned Forest Stewardship Council certification when it increased the post-consumer recycled paper content for its catalogs from 20% to 30%. From 2008 to 2010, Real Goods lowered its paper and printing impact another 75% by reducing paper weight and catalog trim size, and by reducing the number of catalogs mailed by driving more business to its website, as exemplified by the "Don't Buy From This Catalog" campaign the company ran in its Spring/Summer 2010 and Fall/Holiday 2010 catalogs.[13] Real Goods customers were also asked to reduce the number of catalogs they requested, and catalogs were mailed based on past purchase activity.
Go Zero[edit]
In 2006, Gaiam/Real Goods partnered with The Conservation Fund to introduce the world's first carbon-neutral product shipping program called Go Zero. Real Goods made a contribution that allowed Go Zero to plant nearly 1,500 trees, which offset the company's operations at its headquarters and fulfillment center for that year.
Solar Living Sourcebook[edit]
Real Goods published its first edition of the Solar Living Sourcebook in 1982. It was written as a comprehensive resource for information about renewable energy and sustainable living. Now in its 14th edition and printed using soy ink on 100% post-consumer content recycled paper, there are more than 600,000 copies of the Solar Living Sourcebook in print in 44 English-speaking countries.[14]
Awards and Accolades[edit]
The company made Inc. magazine's Top 500 Fastest Growing Companies list and John Schaeffer was the Small Business Administration's Small Business Person of the Year in 1994. Schaeffer also received the 2007 Green Power Pioneer Award,[15] and was inducted into the International Green Industry Hall of Fame in March 2013.[16] Real Goods has received three Rodale Awards, as well as news coverage in The Wall Street Journal, Fortune, Time and numerous other publications.[1]

History of Real Goods[edit]
Origin of Real Goods[edit]
In 1977, Real Goods President and founder John Schaeffer was 29 years old and living in an off-grid community in Mendocino County, California. As one of the few members of the community with a vehicle and a commute, he became the designated person to pick up supplies for the community. In 1978, Schaeffer took $3,000 in savings and a $5,000 loan from his father and opened his own general store with a partner in Willits, California that sold all the "real goods" for off-grid living at fair prices.
During the store's first year, Schaeffer bought 100 9-Watt solar panels for $600 each and sold them for $900 each to people interested in getting their electricity from a source other than an electric utility. These sales made Real Goods the first company to sell a solar panel commercially in the United States.[1]
By 1982, Real Goods had opened two additional stores in Ukiah, California and Santa Rosa, California, and published the first edition of the Solar Living Sourcebook (now in its 14th edition), written by Schaeffer as a comprehensive source for sustainable living principles and practices. By 1985, the three Real Goods stores had closed and Schaeffer invested his last $3,000 in a 16-page catalog, successfully reinventing the company as a mail order business operating out of his garage.
In 1991, Real Goods held its first direct public stock offering (DPO), selling stock directly to its customers, and raised $1 million. The following year, Real Goods declared a National Off-The-Grid Day - which became the National Tour of Solar Homes - during which the public could see solar-powered living firsthand. Real Goods held its second stock offering in 1993. In 1994, the company used those funds to break ground on the Solar Living Center in Hopland, California, which is home to the Real Goods retail store today, as well as the Solar Living Institute. The same year, Real Goods launched its e-commerce business.
Partnership with Gaiam and the Birth of Real Goods Solar[edit]
In 2001, Real Goods merged with the sustainable lifestyle company Gaiam in a stock swap worth $8.7 million.[2] Per the merger agreement, Real Goods shareholders received one share of Gaiam's Class A common stock for each 10 shares of Real Goods stock owned,[3] and Real Goods' headquarters moved to Broomfield, Colorado.
With the influx of additional capital from the Gaiam merger behind it, Real Goods opened a residential solar panel installation division in 2002 called Real Goods Solar. Real Goods Solar began installing home solar panel systems in Colorado, where Real Goods was now headquartered, and in California, where it maintained the Solar Living Center. Real Goods Solar’s success led Real Goods to launch a commercial solar panel installation division in 2004.
In 2008, Real Goods - with Gaiam as its majority shareholder - moved into new corporate headquarters in Louisville, Colorado and began using solar power itself with a 100 kW solar photovoltaic system installed by Real Goods Solar.[4] The Louisville headquarters featured a number of other environmentally-friendly features including low-VOC paint, bamboo flooring and cabinetry, environmentally-friendly carpet and glue, recycled office cubicles, and an office recycling program that included compost collection. Many Real Goods company parties were zero-waste events.
Initial Public Offering and Solar Installation Expansion[edit]
On May 8, 2008, Real Goods completed an initial public offering (IPO) as Real Goods Solar and raised $55 million. Real Goods Solar began trading on the Nasdaq under the symbol RSOL.[5] Through holding 100% of Real Goods Solar's Class B shares, Gaiam maintained control of the company.
Between 2007 and 2008, Real Goods Solar, led by Schaeffer as its CEO, acquired four solar panel installation companies in California and became one of the nation's largest solar installers. In November 2007, Real Goods Solar acquired San Rafael, California-based Marin Solar for $3.2 million in cash and stock.[6] In January 2008, Real Goods Solar purchased Hemet, California-based Carlson Solar for $3.2 million in cash and stock.[6] In August 2008, Real Goods Solar acquired Santa Cruz, California-based Independent Energy Systems for $3.6 million.[6] In October 2008, Real Goods Solar acquired Campbell, California-based Regrid Power for $3.8 million in cash and stock.[6]
On December 20, 2011, Real Goods Solar completed a merger agreement with Connecticut-based renewable energy installer Earth Friendly Energy Group Holdings, LLC, d/b/a Alteris Renewables. The combined company retained the Real Goods Solar name, Nasdaq ticker RSOL, and Louisville, Colorado headquarters. Alteris equity holders were issued 8.7 million shares of Real Goods Solar Class A common stock in exchange for 100% of Alteris' outstanding equity.[7]
A Return to the Real Goods Roots[edit]
In January 2014, Real Goods Solar announced a combining of its residential and commercial solar installation divisions, a company-wide rebranding as RGS Energy, and a switch from the Nasdaq ticker RSOL to RGSE.[8]
In December 2014, John Schaeffer purchased 100% of the Real Goods retail, catalog, and e-commerce business from RGS Energy for $1 million.[9] Schaeffer, along with his wife Nantzy Hensley, is now once again the sole owner of Real Goods, as he was before the merger with Gaiam.
Solar Living Center[edit]
The Solar Living Center (SLC) is a 12-acre living demonstration of permaculture and renewable energy in Hopland, California. It is also home to the nonprofit Solar Living Institute and the Real Goods retail store. The SLC was founded by John Schaeffer in 1994 on land that was formerly a landfill for the California Department of Transportation, and opened in 1996. It is a popular tourist attraction and rest stop along U.S. Route 101, and is notable for some unique features like its "grow-through car" tree grove and its self-proclaimed "weird restrooms" made from recycled plastic bottles and repurposed toilet tank lids. A solar photovoltaic system on the property produces approximately 160,000 kW-hours of electricity annually. The SLC receives as many as 200,000 visitors each year.[10] The SLC is also home to an observation beehive, pollinator garden, children’s garden, sculpture garden, permaculture vegetable garden, bamboo pyramid, hops tipi, lavender labyrinth, and bicycle generator exhibit. In October 2015, a solar-powered cannabis dispensary, Emerald Pharms, opened on the property, focusing on the medical, non-psychoactive CBD strains, and on education.
Solar Living Institute[edit]
In 1998, Schaeffer formed the Solar Living Institute, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization whose mission is to promote sustainable living through inspirational environmental education.[11] The Solar Living Institute is headquartered at the Solar Living Center along with the Real Goods retail store. It offers classes and workshops to the public and a year-round internship program.
The Real Goods Store[edit]
The Real Goods retail store is located at the center of the SLC grounds. It is a 5,000 square foot building made of strawbales and pneumatically impacted stabilized earth (PISE), and was designed using passive solar principles so that it requires little additional heat and light beyond what is provided by the sun.[10] The Real Goods retail store is open to the public for shopping, and also houses Real Goods' e-commerce and order fulfillment operations.
Environmental Commitments[edit]
Billion Pound Goal[edit]
In 1990, Real Goods set a Billion Pound Goal to prevent a billion pounds of carbon dioxide from entering the atmosphere by 2000 through changes to its business practices and customer purchases of products that reduce CO2 emission (calculated using a formula developed by the Union of Concerned Scientists). The company tracked its progress through regular updates in its mail order catalogs, and in 1997 the goal was completed three years early. In 2005, Real Goods set another Billion Pound Goal to be reached by 2010, and in 2008 that goal was reached two years early.[12]
Paper an Packaging Reduction[edit]
In 2007, Real Goods earned Forest Stewardship Council certification when it increased the post-consumer recycled paper content for its catalogs from 20% to 30%. From 2008 to 2010, Real Goods lowered its paper and printing impact another 75% by reducing paper weight and catalog trim size, and by reducing the number of catalogs mailed by driving more business to its website, as exemplified by the "Don't Buy From This Catalog" campaign the company ran in its Spring/Summer 2010 and Fall/Holiday 2010 catalogs.[13] Real Goods customers were also asked to reduce the number of catalogs they requested, and catalogs were mailed based on past purchase activity.
Go Zero[edit]
In 2006, Gaiam/Real Goods partnered with The Conservation Fund to introduce the world's first carbon-neutral product shipping program called Go Zero. Real Goods made a contribution that allowed Go Zero to plant nearly 1,500 trees, which offset the company's operations at its headquarters and fulfillment center for that year.
Solar Living Sourcebook[edit]
Real Goods published its first edition of the Solar Living Sourcebook in 1982. It was written as a comprehensive resource for information about renewable energy and sustainable living. Now in its 14th edition and printed using soy ink on 100% post-consumer content recycled paper, there are more than 600,000 copies of the Solar Living Sourcebook in print in 44 English-speaking countries.[14]
Awards and Accolades[edit]
The company made Inc. magazine's Top 500 Fastest Growing Companies list and John Schaeffer was the Small Business Administration's Small Business Person of the Year in 1994. Schaeffer also received the 2007 Green Power Pioneer Award,[15] and was inducted into the International Green Industry Hall of Fame in March 2013.[16] Real Goods has received three Rodale Awards, as well as news coverage in The Wall Street Journal, Fortune, Time and numerous other publications.[1]

History of Real Goods[edit]
Early years[edit]
In 1977, 29-year-old John Schaeffer lived on an off-grid community in Mendocino County, California, and commuted 35 miles (56 km) to work each day as a computer operator. As one of the few people with a vehicle and a job in town, he became the designated person to pick up supplies for the community. This led him to create his own general store that sold all the “real goods” for off-grid living at fair prices. In 1978, Schaeffer took $3,000 in savings and a $5,000 loan from his father and opened the first Real Goods store in Willits, California.
One day, a man from Los Angeles arrived at the store with a Porsche full of solar panels. First developed at Bell Laboratories in the 1950s and used in the 1960s in the NASA space program,[2] solar panels had yet to find commercial applications. On a whim, John bought 100 of these novel 9-Watt panels for $600 apiece. He quickly sold them for $900 each to people interested in simple living in Mendocino County who also wanted to enjoy light fixtures, TV and a few of mainstream civilization’s other creature comforts without doing business with utilities. These sales made Real Goods one of the first companies to sell a solar panel commercially in the United States.[3] The success of the Willits store prompted Schaeffer to open an additional store in Ukiah, California, in 1980 and a third store in Santa Rosa, California in 1982. That same year, Real Goods published the first edition of The Solar Living Source Book, which was written as a comprehensive source for sustainable living principles and practices.
By 1985, Real Goods' annual sales were $3 million, but growth was erratic, and all three retail stores were closed. Schaeffer invested his last $3,000 in a 16-page catalog and rejuvenated the company as a mail order business operating out of his garage, sending catalogs to the 2,000-name mailing list the company had accumulated.[4] Customers returned and the company was revived.
The 1990s[edit]
During the 1990s, Real Goods expanded its business by presenting a clear message about the benefits of solar energy. In 1990, the entire solar industry received a boost from the 20th anniversary of Earth Day and the Persian Gulf War, and Real Goods took advantage of it.[3] That year, the company also set its Billion Pound Goal to keep one billion pounds of carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere by 2000, which it completed three years early in 1997.
In 1991, Real Goods held its first direct public stock offering, selling stock directly to its customers, and raised $1 million. The following year Real Goods declared a National Off-The-Grid Day, which soon became the National Tour of Solar Homes, during which the public could see solar-powered living firsthand. Real Goods held its second stock offering in 1993, and in 1994, used those funds to break ground on the Solar Living Center (SLC) in Hopland, California. The same year, Real Goods launched its e-commerce business. In 1998, Schaeffer formed the Solar Living Institute (SLI), a nonprofit organization whose mission is to promote sustainable living through inspirational environmental education.[5] The SLI offers classes and workshops and manages the SLC.
Partnership with Gaiam and the birth of Real Goods Solar[edit]
Real Goods grew significantly in the first decade of the 21st century. By this time, the company had five brick and mortar stores located in Hopland, Santa Rosa, Los Gatos, Berkeley and West Los Angeles, California. The company’s catalog and e-commerce businesses grew as well, and Real Goods increased its annual revenues to $19 million.
In 2001, Real Goods merged with the sustainable lifestyle company Gaiam Inc. (NASDAQ: GAIA) in a stock swap worth $8.7 million.[6] Per the merger agreement, Real Goods shareholders received one share of Class A GAIA common stock for each 10 shares of Real Goods stock owned.[7] Gaiam consolidated order processing and distribution in Cincinnati and accounting responsibilities in Broomfield, Colorado, and implemented a new supply chain management information system.
With the influx of additional capital and the power of Gaiam behind it, Real Goods looked for a promising growth opportunity and found it in the residential solar installation market. Since Real Goods was now headquartered in Colorado, yet maintained the SLC, SLI and offices in California, and since the federal government and both states offered attractive tax incentives for installing solar systems, Real Goods opened its residential solar system installation division in both states in 2002. The commercial solar business was also growing, and Real Goods launched its commercial solar installation division in 2004.
Initial public offering[edit]
In 2008, Real Goods positioned itself for aggressive growth by separating its mail order division from Gaiam, re-launching the Real Goods website as a stand-alone e-commerce channel, expanding its solar division, and going public. On May 8, 2008, Real Goods completed an initial public offering as Real Goods Solar and raised $55 million. Real Goods Solar began trading on the NASDAQ under the symbol RSOL.[8] Through holding 100 percent of Real Goods’ Class B shares, Gaiam maintained control of Real Goods.
Solar installation expansion[edit]
Between 2007 and 2008 Real Goods acquired four solar installation companies in California and became one of the nation’s largest solar installers. In November 2007, Real Goods Solar acquired San Rafael, California-based Marin Solar for $3.2 million in cash and stock.[9] In a similar deal inked in January 2008, RSOL purchased Carlson Solar, headquartered in Hemet, California for $3.2 million in cash and stock.[9] In August 2008, Real Goods Solar completed its third acquisition — Santa Cruz, California-based Independent Energy Systems for $3.6 million.[9] In October 2008, RSOL completed its fourth acquisition in less than a year by acquiring Regrid Power of Campbell, California in a deal valued at $3.8 million in cash and stock.[9] With the acquisition of Marin Solar, Real Goods added the commercial experience and expertise necessary to position itself as a major competitor in the commercial solar installation market.
Merger with Alteris Renewables[edit]
On June 22, 2011, Real Goods Solar announced a merger agreement with Connecticut-based renewable energy installer Earth Friendly Energy Group Holdings, LLC, d/b/a Alteris Renewables. The merger was completed on December 20, 2011, and the combined company retained the Real Goods Solar name, NASDAQ ticker (RSOL), and Louisville, Colorado headquarters. Alteris equity holders were issued 8.7 million shares of Real Goods Solar Class A common stock in exchange for 100% of Alteris' outstanding equity.[10]
The merger was seen by both companies as an opportunity to increase its national footprint, as Real Goods Solar operated in the West and Alteris operated in the Northeast. The companies' respective regions were considered the two fastest-growing markets for solar installations, and both companies had more than 30 years of experience operating in them.[11]
Divisions[edit]
Real Goods Solar division[edit]
Today, Real Goods Solar maintains its headquarters in Louisville, Colorado. By the start of 2013, the company had installed over 235 MW of solar power across more than 22,500 solar energy systems for residential, commercial, and utility properties.[12]
Real Goods retail division[edit]
Real Goods' retail division is headquartered at its flagship retail store in Hopland, California, where e-commerce and order fulfillment operations are located. The Real Goods Store and its e-commerce website offer a range of items for sustainable on- and off-grid living, including urban gardening and remote homesteading supplies, pond and composting tools, camping gear, organic bedding and clothing, non-toxic cleaning and laundry solutions, air and water purifiers, appliances, and renewable energy systems for solar, wind, hydro and solar hot water.
The Hopland store was opened in 1996 on the Solar Living Center grounds. Housed in a strawbale building utilizing passive solar design principles, the store is lighted and heated by an onsite solar system and by south-facing windows that capture the sun’s heat.
In the early 2000s, Real Goods refocused on its national mail order and local solar installation businesses and closed all of its physical stores except for the Hopland store. Catalog printing was stopped in the winter of 2010 in favor of a paperless commerce solution.
Solar Living Source Book[edit]
Real Goods published its first edition of The Solar Living Source Book in 1982. It was written as a one-stop information source for renewable energy and sustainable living. Now in its 30th anniversary (13th) edition, and printed using soy inks on 100 percent post-consumer content recycled paper, the Solar Living Source Book is a comprehensive reference for the layperson on renewable energy technologies and sustainable living. There are more than 600,000 copies in print in 44 English-speaking countries.
Solar Living Institute[edit]
In 1998, John Schaeffer founded a 501(c)(3) nonprofit education institute called the Solar Living Institute (SLI) with the mission of promoting sustainable living through inspirational environmental education. The result is an organization that functions both as a renewable energy and green living experiential classroom and as an example of successful sustainable development. Throughout each year the SLI hosts between 50 and 75 hands-on workshops on everything from photovoltaic system design and installation and strawbale home construction to beekeeping, green career seminars and its Earth Day for Kids programs that introduces inner-city kids to renewable energy and environmental responsibility.[13] The SLI also runs a year-round internship program that offers interns in-depth, hands-on training in renewable energy systems, sustainable building, community gardening and more. In 2009, the SLI began teaching classes online and in 2010, the nonprofit launched an online solar energy training program. The SLI had taught more than 1,000 workshops to nearly 10,000 students.
Solar Living Center[edit]
The SLI and the Real Goods Store are both headquartered at the Solar Living Center (SLC), a 5,000-square-foot (460 m2) strawbale building surrounded by 12 acres (49,000 m2) of permaculture gardens in Hopland, California. The building was designed using passive solar principles and requires little additional heat or light, and the gardens are laid out in a pattern similar to that of U.S. climate zones. In 2000, Real Goods installed a commercial solar system at the SLC that produces 160,000 kW-hours of electricity annually. Opened in 1996, the SLC serves as a “place in the sun” for everyone interested in sustainable living. Approximately 200,000 people visit the SLC each year. The SLC also hosts the annual Solfest celebration, a four-day renewable energy and sustainable living fair and fundraiser for the SLI that includes workshops, demonstrations, educational panels, keynote speakers, music, artists, wine tasting and dancing.[14]
Environmental commitment[edit]
Billion pound goal[edit]
In 1990, based on concerns about global warming, Real Goods set a goal to keep one billion pounds of carbon dioxide (CO2) out of the atmosphere within 10 years through customer purchases of products that reduce CO2 production. Calculations of CO2 reduction on a product-by-product basis were based on a formula developed by the Union of Concerned Scientists. In addition, Real Goods changed its energy usage, shipping and other corporate practices to become more environmentally friendly. The company tracked its progress through regular updates in the Real Goods catalog. In 1997, that goal was achieved three years ahead of schedule. In 2005, Real Goods and Gaiam set another goal to eliminate one billion pounds of CO2 from the atmosphere by 2010. In 2008, that goal was achieved two years early.[15]
Paper reduction/packaging[edit]
In 2007, Real Goods increased the post-consumer recycled paper content for its catalogs from 20 percent to 30 percent. This earned the company Forest Stewardship Council certification. From 2008 to 2010 Real Goods lowered its paper and printing impact another 75 percent by reducing paper weight, catalog trim size and reducing the number of catalogs mailed by driving more business to the Internet. Real Goods customers were asked to reduce the number of catalogs they requested, and catalogs were mailed based on past purchase activity. Customers were also encouraged to shop at Real Goods’ website as exemplified by the “Don’t Buy From This Catalog” campaign the company ran in its Spring/Summer 2010 and Fall/Holiday 2010 catalogs.[16]
Go Zero[edit]
In 2006, Real Goods and Gaiam partnered with The Conservation Fund to introduce the world’s first carbon-neutral product shipping program called Go Zero. Gaiam Real Goods made a contribution that allowed Go Zero to plant nearly 1,500 trees, which offset the company’s operations at its headquarters and fulfillment center for that year.
Company headquarters[edit]
In 2008, Real Goods — with Gaiam as its majority shareholder — moved into new corporate offices in Louisville, Colorado and went solar with a 100 kW solar system installed by Real Goods Solar[17] that provides approximately 20 percent of the company’s energy requirements. In addition, the new headquarters feature low-VOC paints, bamboo flooring and cabinetry, earth-friendly carpet and glue, and recycled office cubicles. In 2008, Real Goods also added composting collection to its comprehensive office recycling program, and some company parties are now zero-waste events.
Awards and accolades[edit]
The company made Inc. magazine’s Top 500 Fastest Growing Companies list and John Schaeffer was the Small Business Administration’s Small Business Person of the Year in 1994. Schaeffer also received the 2007 Green Power Pioneer Award,[18] and was inducted into the International Green Industry Hall of Fame in March 2013.[19] Real Goods has received three Rodale Awards, as well as news coverage in The Wall Street Journal, Fortune, Time and numerous other publications.[3]

The store is amazing, from big appliances to clothes, with an amazing selection of books and kid, kitchen, home, and garden goods!Parker S., Bay Area, CA
This kind of customer service can only come from those who have been there for a long time, are happy with their job, care about what they are doing, and believe in the company that they are working for.Sean H.
The Solar Living Sourcebook is a breath of fresh air for everyone interested in being part of the evolutionary revolution. John's book is the best single source I’ve ever found on the technologies, philosophies, and the lifestyle changes we must embrace in order for our species to survive and thrive into the future. Time is of the essence for all of us to start walking the talk and this book is the guide for taking those first steps.Woody Harrelson, environmentalist & actor
There are not a lot of places on Yelp that get 5 stars from EVERY reviewer, but Real Goods deserves it. They have THE BEST selection of sustainable construction, off-the-grid living, and healthy eating books that I have seen anywhere other than Amazon.Jay S., Glen Rock, NJ
Used the Solar Living Sourcebook roughly 16 years ago to build an off-the-grid camp in the Bwindi Impenetrable National Park. It was my bible. The mountain gorillas and the Ugandan people will forever benefit.G. Anderson, Republic of South Africa
Great shopping experience for self-sufficiency. Everything under the sun for solar independence. Very helpful and friendly staff.Janet A., Healdsburg, CA
John Schaeffer has been a pathfinder in spreading distributed solar energy and self-reliant life ways since the earliest days. In this astutely practical sourcebook, he provides an indispensable field manual at exactly the tipping point when these tools are finally becoming the norm. This masterful compendium pulls it all together and gives everyone what we need to get off the grid and democratize clean energy.Kenny Ausubel, CEO & Founder of Bioneers
We visited Real Goods LONG ago (the first annual SolFest), and that visit changed our lives. We were inspired to change the way we live because of the beauty created on that CALTRANS dump site (we have installed two "willow rooms" for shade, installed solar, switched to a hybrid car, learned permaculture). The lessons we learned at Real Goods influenced our impact on the Earth.Cathy K., Northampton, MA
John is a sustainability and solar industry pioneer, who sold the first residential solar system and published the Solar Living Sourcebook more than three decades ago. His visionary actions and ideas then have now become a big, mainstream business - solar is the fastest growing industry in the U.S. and residential solar the fastest growing sector within it. That is good news for our environment, economy, and national security. Thirty years from now his recommendations for more sustainable living should improve our lives in the same ways.Nat Kreamer, Chairman of the Solar Energy Industries Association, White House Champion of Change & CEO of Clean Power Finance

Solar Panels




Whether on or off the grid, using solar panels - or solar modules - is one of the simplest and cleanest ways to convert the sun's energy into electricity. Real Goods' legacy is directly linked to the practicality and reliability of off-grid solar panels (we sold the first off-grid solar panel in the U.S., after all). We've built off-grid solar panel systems for thousands of customers across the country since 1978, and most are still going strong decades later.Solar panels are clean, quiet, direct, and incredibly durable, with a maintenance-free lifespan of decades. And solar has declined in price by more than half in just the last 10 years. Real Goods carries a variety of solar panels, but we're most fond of the industry-leading Canadian Solar modules and the made-in-the-USA SolarWorlds.

"Ultimately, almost all energy on Earth comes from the sun. Some is harvested directly by plants, trees, and of course solar panels (also known as photovoltaics). Much is used indirectly in the form of wood, coal, or oil. Solar panels receive this energy directly."

History of Real Goods[edit]
Early years[edit]
In 1977, 29-year-old John Schaeffer lived on an off-grid community in Mendocino County, California, and commuted 35 miles (56 km) to work each day as a computer operator. As one of the few people with a vehicle and a job in town, he became the designated person to pick up supplies for the community. This led him to create his own general store that sold all the “real goods” for off-grid living at fair prices. In 1978, Schaeffer took $3,000 in savings and a $5,000 loan from his father and opened the first Real Goods store in Willits, California.
One day, a man from Los Angeles arrived at the store with a Porsche full of solar panels. First developed at Bell Laboratories in the 1950s and used in the 1960s in the NASA space program,[2] solar panels had yet to find commercial applications. On a whim, John bought 100 of these novel 9-Watt panels for $600 apiece. He quickly sold them for $900 each to people interested in simple living in Mendocino County who also wanted to enjoy light fixtures, TV and a few of mainstream civilization’s other creature comforts without doing business with utilities. These sales made Real Goods one of the first companies to sell a solar panel commercially in the United States.[3] The success of the Willits store prompted Schaeffer to open an additional store in Ukiah, California, in 1980 and a third store in Santa Rosa, California in 1982. That same year, Real Goods published the first edition of The Solar Living Source Book, which was written as a comprehensive source for sustainable living principles and practices.
By 1985, Real Goods' annual sales were $3 million, but growth was erratic, and all three retail stores were closed. Schaeffer invested his last $3,000 in a 16-page catalog and rejuvenated the company as a mail order business operating out of his garage, sending catalogs to the 2,000-name mailing list the company had accumulated.[4] Customers returned and the company was revived.
The 1990s[edit]
During the 1990s, Real Goods expanded its business by presenting a clear message about the benefits of solar energy. In 1990, the entire solar industry received a boost from the 20th anniversary of Earth Day and the Persian Gulf War, and Real Goods took advantage of it.[3] That year, the company also set its Billion Pound Goal to keep one billion pounds of carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere by 2000, which it completed three years early in 1997.
In 1991, Real Goods held its first direct public stock offering, selling stock directly to its customers, and raised $1 million. The following year Real Goods declared a National Off-The-Grid Day, which soon became the National Tour of Solar Homes, during which the public could see solar-powered living firsthand. Real Goods held its second stock offering in 1993, and in 1994, used those funds to break ground on the Solar Living Center (SLC) in Hopland, California. The same year, Real Goods launched its e-commerce business. In 1998, Schaeffer formed the Solar Living Institute (SLI), a nonprofit organization whose mission is to promote sustainable living through inspirational environmental education.[5] The SLI offers classes and workshops and manages the SLC.
Partnership with Gaiam and the birth of Real Goods Solar[edit]
Real Goods grew significantly in the first decade of the 21st century. By this time, the company had five brick and mortar stores located in Hopland, Santa Rosa, Los Gatos, Berkeley and West Los Angeles, California. The company’s catalog and e-commerce businesses grew as well, and Real Goods increased its annual revenues to $19 million.
In 2001, Real Goods merged with the sustainable lifestyle company Gaiam Inc. (NASDAQ: GAIA) in a stock swap worth $8.7 million.[6] Per the merger agreement, Real Goods shareholders received one share of Class A GAIA common stock for each 10 shares of Real Goods stock owned.[7] Gaiam consolidated order processing and distribution in Cincinnati and accounting responsibilities in Broomfield, Colorado, and implemented a new supply chain management information system.
With the influx of additional capital and the power of Gaiam behind it, Real Goods looked for a promising growth opportunity and found it in the residential solar installation market. Since Real Goods was now headquartered in Colorado, yet maintained the SLC, SLI and offices in California, and since the federal government and both states offered attractive tax incentives for installing solar systems, Real Goods opened its residential solar system installation division in both states in 2002. The commercial solar business was also growing, and Real Goods launched its commercial solar installation division in 2004.
Initial public offering[edit]
In 2008, Real Goods positioned itself for aggressive growth by separating its mail order division from Gaiam, re-launching the Real Goods website as a stand-alone e-commerce channel, expanding its solar division, and going public. On May 8, 2008, Real Goods completed an initial public offering as Real Goods Solar and raised $55 million. Real Goods Solar began trading on the NASDAQ under the symbol RSOL.[8] Through holding 100 percent of Real Goods’ Class B shares, Gaiam maintained control of Real Goods.
Solar installation expansion[edit]
Between 2007 and 2008 Real Goods acquired four solar installation companies in California and became one of the nation’s largest solar installers. In November 2007, Real Goods Solar acquired San Rafael, California-based Marin Solar for $3.2 million in cash and stock.[9] In a similar deal inked in January 2008, RSOL purchased Carlson Solar, headquartered in Hemet, California for $3.2 million in cash and stock.[9] In August 2008, Real Goods Solar completed its third acquisition — Santa Cruz, California-based Independent Energy Systems for $3.6 million.[9] In October 2008, RSOL completed its fourth acquisition in less than a year by acquiring Regrid Power of Campbell, California in a deal valued at $3.8 million in cash and stock.[9] With the acquisition of Marin Solar, Real Goods added the commercial experience and expertise necessary to position itself as a major competitor in the commercial solar installation market.
Merger with Alteris Renewables[edit]
On June 22, 2011, Real Goods Solar announced a merger agreement with Connecticut-based renewable energy installer Earth Friendly Energy Group Holdings, LLC, d/b/a Alteris Renewables. The merger was completed on December 20, 2011, and the combined company retained the Real Goods Solar name, NASDAQ ticker (RSOL), and Louisville, Colorado headquarters. Alteris equity holders were issued 8.7 million shares of Real Goods Solar Class A common stock in exchange for 100% of Alteris' outstanding equity.[10]
The merger was seen by both companies as an opportunity to increase its national footprint, as Real Goods Solar operated in the West and Alteris operated in the Northeast. The companies' respective regions were considered the two fastest-growing markets for solar installations, and both companies had more than 30 years of experience operating in them.[11]
Divisions[edit]
Real Goods Solar division[edit]
Today, Real Goods Solar maintains its headquarters in Louisville, Colorado. By the start of 2013, the company had installed over 235 MW of solar power across more than 22,500 solar energy systems for residential, commercial, and utility properties.[12]
Real Goods retail division[edit]
Real Goods' retail division is headquartered at its flagship retail store in Hopland, California, where e-commerce and order fulfillment operations are located. The Real Goods Store and its e-commerce website offer a range of items for sustainable on- and off-grid living, including urban gardening and remote homesteading supplies, pond and composting tools, camping gear, organic bedding and clothing, non-toxic cleaning and laundry solutions, air and water purifiers, appliances, and renewable energy systems for solar, wind, hydro and solar hot water.
The Hopland store was opened in 1996 on the Solar Living Center grounds. Housed in a strawbale building utilizing passive solar design principles, the store is lighted and heated by an onsite solar system and by south-facing windows that capture the sun’s heat.
In the early 2000s, Real Goods refocused on its national mail order and local solar installation businesses and closed all of its physical stores except for the Hopland store. Catalog printing was stopped in the winter of 2010 in favor of a paperless commerce solution.
Solar Living Source Book[edit]
Real Goods published its first edition of The Solar Living Source Book in 1982. It was written as a one-stop information source for renewable energy and sustainable living. Now in its 30th anniversary (13th) edition, and printed using soy inks on 100 percent post-consumer content recycled paper, the Solar Living Source Book is a comprehensive reference for the layperson on renewable energy technologies and sustainable living. There are more than 600,000 copies in print in 44 English-speaking countries.
Solar Living Institute[edit]
In 1998, John Schaeffer founded a 501(c)(3) nonprofit education institute called the Solar Living Institute (SLI) with the mission of promoting sustainable living through inspirational environmental education. The result is an organization that functions both as a renewable energy and green living experiential classroom and as an example of successful sustainable development. Throughout each year the SLI hosts between 50 and 75 hands-on workshops on everything from photovoltaic system design and installation and strawbale home construction to beekeeping, green career seminars and its Earth Day for Kids programs that introduces inner-city kids to renewable energy and environmental responsibility.[13] The SLI also runs a year-round internship program that offers interns in-depth, hands-on training in renewable energy systems, sustainable building, community gardening and more. In 2009, the SLI began teaching classes online and in 2010, the nonprofit launched an online solar energy training program. The SLI had taught more than 1,000 workshops to nearly 10,000 students.
Solar Living Center[edit]
The SLI and the Real Goods Store are both headquartered at the Solar Living Center (SLC), a 5,000-square-foot (460 m2) strawbale building surrounded by 12 acres (49,000 m2) of permaculture gardens in Hopland, California. The building was designed using passive solar principles and requires little additional heat or light, and the gardens are laid out in a pattern similar to that of U.S. climate zones. In 2000, Real Goods installed a commercial solar system at the SLC that produces 160,000 kW-hours of electricity annually. Opened in 1996, the SLC serves as a “place in the sun” for everyone interested in sustainable living. Approximately 200,000 people visit the SLC each year. The SLC also hosts the annual Solfest celebration, a four-day renewable energy and sustainable living fair and fundraiser for the SLI that includes workshops, demonstrations, educational panels, keynote speakers, music, artists, wine tasting and dancing.[14]
Environmental commitment[edit]
Billion pound goal[edit]
In 1990, based on concerns about global warming, Real Goods set a goal to keep one billion pounds of carbon dioxide (CO2) out of the atmosphere within 10 years through customer purchases of products that reduce CO2 production. Calculations of CO2 reduction on a product-by-product basis were based on a formula developed by the Union of Concerned Scientists. In addition, Real Goods changed its energy usage, shipping and other corporate practices to become more environmentally friendly. The company tracked its progress through regular updates in the Real Goods catalog. In 1997, that goal was achieved three years ahead of schedule. In 2005, Real Goods and Gaiam set another goal to eliminate one billion pounds of CO2 from the atmosphere by 2010. In 2008, that goal was achieved two years early.[15]
Paper reduction/packaging[edit]
In 2007, Real Goods increased the post-consumer recycled paper content for its catalogs from 20 percent to 30 percent. This earned the company Forest Stewardship Council certification. From 2008 to 2010 Real Goods lowered its paper and printing impact another 75 percent by reducing paper weight, catalog trim size and reducing the number of catalogs mailed by driving more business to the Internet. Real Goods customers were asked to reduce the number of catalogs they requested, and catalogs were mailed based on past purchase activity. Customers were also encouraged to shop at Real Goods’ website as exemplified by the “Don’t Buy From This Catalog” campaign the company ran in its Spring/Summer 2010 and Fall/Holiday 2010 catalogs.[16]
Go Zero[edit]
In 2006, Real Goods and Gaiam partnered with The Conservation Fund to introduce the world’s first carbon-neutral product shipping program called Go Zero. Gaiam Real Goods made a contribution that allowed Go Zero to plant nearly 1,500 trees, which offset the company’s operations at its headquarters and fulfillment center for that year.
Company headquarters[edit]
In 2008, Real Goods — with Gaiam as its majority shareholder — moved into new corporate offices in Louisville, Colorado and went solar with a 100 kW solar system installed by Real Goods Solar[17] that provides approximately 20 percent of the company’s energy requirements. In addition, the new headquarters feature low-VOC paints, bamboo flooring and cabinetry, earth-friendly carpet and glue, and recycled office cubicles. In 2008, Real Goods also added composting collection to its comprehensive office recycling program, and some company parties are now zero-waste events.
Awards and accolades[edit]
The company made Inc. magazine’s Top 500 Fastest Growing Companies list and John Schaeffer was the Small Business Administration’s Small Business Person of the Year in 1994. Schaeffer also received the 2007 Green Power Pioneer Award,[18] and was inducted into the International Green Industry Hall of Fame in March 2013.[19] Real Goods has received three Rodale Awards, as well as news coverage in The Wall Street Journal, Fortune, Time and numerous other publications.[3]

Solar Panels




Whether on or off the grid, using solar panels - or solar modules - is one of the simplest and cleanest ways to convert the sun's energy into electricity. Real Goods' legacy is directly linked to the practicality and reliability of off-grid solar panels (we sold the first off-grid solar panel in the U.S., after all). We've built off-grid solar panel systems for thousands of customers across the country since 1978, and most are still going strong decades later.Solar panels are clean, quiet, direct, and incredibly durable, with a maintenance-free lifespan of decades. And solar has declined in price by more than half in just the last 10 years. Real Goods carries a variety of solar panels, but we're most fond of the industry-leading Canadian Solar modules and the made-in-the-USA SolarWorlds.

"Ultimately, almost all energy on Earth comes from the sun. Some is harvested directly by plants, trees, and of course solar panels (also known as photovoltaics). Much is used indirectly in the form of wood, coal, or oil. Solar panels receive this energy directly."

History of Real Goods[edit]
Origin of Real Goods[edit]
In 1977, Real Goods President and founder John Schaeffer was 29 years old and living in an off-grid community in Mendocino County, California. As one of the few members of the community with a vehicle and a commute, he became the designated person to pick up supplies for the community. In 1978, Schaeffer took $3,000 in savings and a $5,000 loan from his father and opened his own general store with a partner in Willits, California that sold all the "real goods" for off-grid living at fair prices.
During the store's first year, Schaeffer bought 100 9-Watt solar panels for $600 each and sold them for $900 each to people interested in getting their electricity from a source other than an electric utility. These sales made Real Goods the first company to sell a solar panel commercially in the United States.[1]
By 1982, Real Goods had opened two additional stores in Ukiah, California and Santa Rosa, California, and published the first edition of the Solar Living Sourcebook (now in its 14th edition), written by Schaeffer as a comprehensive source for sustainable living principles and practices. By 1985, the three Real Goods stores had closed and Schaeffer invested his last $3,000 in a 16-page catalog, successfully reinventing the company as a mail order business operating out of his garage.
In 1991, Real Goods held its first direct public stock offering (DPO), selling stock directly to its customers, and raised $1 million. The following year, Real Goods declared a National Off-The-Grid Day - which became the National Tour of Solar Homes - during which the public could see solar-powered living firsthand. Real Goods held its second stock offering in 1993. In 1994, the company used those funds to break ground on the Solar Living Center in Hopland, California, which is home to the Real Goods retail store today, as well as the Solar Living Institute. The same year, Real Goods launched its e-commerce business.
Partnership with Gaiam and the Birth of Real Goods Solar[edit]
In 2001, Real Goods merged with the sustainable lifestyle company Gaiam in a stock swap worth $8.7 million.[2] Per the merger agreement, Real Goods shareholders received one share of Gaiam's Class A common stock for each 10 shares of Real Goods stock owned,[3] and Real Goods' headquarters moved to Broomfield, Colorado.
With the influx of additional capital from the Gaiam merger behind it, Real Goods opened a residential solar panel installation division in 2002 called Real Goods Solar. Real Goods Solar began installing home solar panel systems in Colorado, where Real Goods was now headquartered, and in California, where it maintained the Solar Living Center. Real Goods Solar’s success led Real Goods to launch a commercial solar panel installation division in 2004.
In 2008, Real Goods - with Gaiam as its majority shareholder - moved into new corporate headquarters in Louisville, Colorado and began using solar power itself with a 100 kW solar photovoltaic system installed by Real Goods Solar.[4] The Louisville headquarters featured a number of other environmentally-friendly features including low-VOC paint, bamboo flooring and cabinetry, environmentally-friendly carpet and glue, recycled office cubicles, and an office recycling program that included compost collection. Many Real Goods company parties were zero-waste events.
Initial Public Offering and Solar Installation Expansion[edit]
On May 8, 2008, Real Goods completed an initial public offering (IPO) as Real Goods Solar and raised $55 million. Real Goods Solar began trading on the Nasdaq under the symbol RSOL.[5] Through holding 100% of Real Goods Solar's Class B shares, Gaiam maintained control of the company.
Between 2007 and 2008, Real Goods Solar, led by Schaeffer as its CEO, acquired four solar panel installation companies in California and became one of the nation's largest solar installers. In November 2007, Real Goods Solar acquired San Rafael, California-based Marin Solar for $3.2 million in cash and stock.[6] In January 2008, Real Goods Solar purchased Hemet, California-based Carlson Solar for $3.2 million in cash and stock.[6] In August 2008, Real Goods Solar acquired Santa Cruz, California-based Independent Energy Systems for $3.6 million.[6] In October 2008, Real Goods Solar acquired Campbell, California-based Regrid Power for $3.8 million in cash and stock.[6]
On December 20, 2011, Real Goods Solar completed a merger agreement with Connecticut-based renewable energy installer Earth Friendly Energy Group Holdings, LLC, d/b/a Alteris Renewables. The combined company retained the Real Goods Solar name, Nasdaq ticker RSOL, and Louisville, Colorado headquarters. Alteris equity holders were issued 8.7 million shares of Real Goods Solar Class A common stock in exchange for 100% of Alteris' outstanding equity.[7]
A Return to the Real Goods Roots[edit]
In January 2014, Real Goods Solar announced a combining of its residential and commercial solar installation divisions, a company-wide rebranding as RGS Energy, and a switch from the Nasdaq ticker RSOL to RGSE.[8]
In December 2014, John Schaeffer purchased 100% of the Real Goods retail, catalog, and e-commerce business from RGS Energy for $1 million.[9] Schaeffer, along with his wife Nantzy Hensley, is now once again the sole owner of Real Goods, as he was before the merger with Gaiam.
Solar Living Center[edit]
The Solar Living Center (SLC) is a 12-acre living demonstration of permaculture and renewable energy in Hopland, California. It is also home to the nonprofit Solar Living Institute and the Real Goods retail store. The SLC was founded by John Schaeffer in 1994 on land that was formerly a landfill for the California Department of Transportation, and opened in 1996. It is a popular tourist attraction and rest stop along U.S. Route 101, and is notable for some unique features like its "grow-through car" tree grove and its self-proclaimed "weird restrooms" made from recycled plastic bottles and repurposed toilet tank lids. A solar photovoltaic system on the property produces approximately 160,000 kW-hours of electricity annually. The SLC receives as many as 200,000 visitors each year.[10] The SLC is also home to an observation beehive, pollinator garden, children’s garden, sculpture garden, permaculture vegetable garden, bamboo pyramid, hops tipi, lavender labyrinth, and bicycle generator exhibit. In October 2015, a solar-powered cannabis dispensary, Emerald Pharms, opened on the property, focusing on the medical, non-psychoactive CBD strains, and on education.
Solar Living Institute[edit]
In 1998, Schaeffer formed the Solar Living Institute, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization whose mission is to promote sustainable living through inspirational environmental education.[11] The Solar Living Institute is headquartered at the Solar Living Center along with the Real Goods retail store. It offers classes and workshops to the public and a year-round internship program.
The Real Goods Store[edit]
The Real Goods retail store is located at the center of the SLC grounds. It is a 5,000 square foot building made of strawbales and pneumatically impacted stabilized earth (PISE), and was designed using passive solar principles so that it requires little additional heat and light beyond what is provided by the sun.[10] The Real Goods retail store is open to the public for shopping, and also houses Real Goods' e-commerce and order fulfillment operations.
Environmental Commitments[edit]
Billion Pound Goal[edit]
In 1990, Real Goods set a Billion Pound Goal to prevent a billion pounds of carbon dioxide from entering the atmosphere by 2000 through changes to its business practices and customer purchases of products that reduce CO2 emission (calculated using a formula developed by the Union of Concerned Scientists). The company tracked its progress through regular updates in its mail order catalogs, and in 1997 the goal was completed three years early. In 2005, Real Goods set another Billion Pound Goal to be reached by 2010, and in 2008 that goal was reached two years early.[12]
Paper an Packaging Reduction[edit]
In 2007, Real Goods earned Forest Stewardship Council certification when it increased the post-consumer recycled paper content for its catalogs from 20% to 30%. From 2008 to 2010, Real Goods lowered its paper and printing impact another 75% by reducing paper weight and catalog trim size, and by reducing the number of catalogs mailed by driving more business to its website, as exemplified by the "Don't Buy From This Catalog" campaign the company ran in its Spring/Summer 2010 and Fall/Holiday 2010 catalogs.[13] Real Goods customers were also asked to reduce the number of catalogs they requested, and catalogs were mailed based on past purchase activity.
Go Zero[edit]
In 2006, Gaiam/Real Goods partnered with The Conservation Fund to introduce the world's first carbon-neutral product shipping program called Go Zero. Real Goods made a contribution that allowed Go Zero to plant nearly 1,500 trees, which offset the company's operations at its headquarters and fulfillment center for that year.
Solar Living Sourcebook[edit]
Real Goods published its first edition of the Solar Living Sourcebook in 1982. It was written as a comprehensive resource for information about renewable energy and sustainable living. Now in its 14th edition and printed using soy ink on 100% post-consumer content recycled paper, there are more than 600,000 copies of the Solar Living Sourcebook in print in 44 English-speaking countries.[14]
Awards and Accolades[edit]
The company made Inc. magazine's Top 500 Fastest Growing Companies list and John Schaeffer was the Small Business Administration's Small Business Person of the Year in 1994. Schaeffer also received the 2007 Green Power Pioneer Award,[15] and was inducted into the International Green Industry Hall of Fame in March 2013.[16] Real Goods has received three Rodale Awards, as well as news coverage in The Wall Street Journal, Fortune, Time and numerous other publications.[1]

I'm totally jazzed about this purchase and will remember in the future whom to call for a system redo/update: You!!!Nancy M., Sebastopol, CA
The Solar Living Sourcebook features the latest nuts-and-bolts information on how to harvest renewable energy in a variety of ways depending on need.Scientific American
You are one of the few true solar pioneers and you have done a great deal to shape a very important industry.Lee Gordon, President of Morningstar Corp.
The store is amazing, from big appliances to clothes, with an amazing selection of books and kid, kitchen, home, and garden goods!Parker S., Bay Area, CA
This kind of customer service can only come from those who have been there for a long time, are happy with their job, care about what they are doing, and believe in the company that they are working for.Sean H.
The Solar Living Sourcebook is a breath of fresh air for everyone interested in being part of the evolutionary revolution. John's book is the best single source I’ve ever found on the technologies, philosophies, and the lifestyle changes we must embrace in order for our species to survive and thrive into the future. Time is of the essence for all of us to start walking the talk and this book is the guide for taking those first steps.Woody Harrelson, environmentalist & actor
There are not a lot of places on Yelp that get 5 stars from EVERY reviewer, but Real Goods deserves it. They have THE BEST selection of sustainable construction, off-the-grid living, and healthy eating books that I have seen anywhere other than Amazon.Jay S., Glen Rock, NJ
Used the Solar Living Sourcebook roughly 16 years ago to build an off-the-grid camp in the Bwindi Impenetrable National Park. It was my bible. The mountain gorillas and the Ugandan people will forever benefit.G. Anderson, Republic of South Africa
Great shopping experience for self-sufficiency. Everything under the sun for solar independence. Very helpful and friendly staff.Janet A., Healdsburg, CA
John Schaeffer has been a pathfinder in spreading distributed solar energy and self-reliant life ways since the earliest days. In this astutely practical sourcebook, he provides an indispensable field manual at exactly the tipping point when these tools are finally becoming the norm. This masterful compendium pulls it all together and gives everyone what we need to get off the grid and democratize clean energy.Kenny Ausubel, CEO & Founder of Bioneers
We visited Real Goods LONG ago (the first annual SolFest), and that visit changed our lives. We were inspired to change the way we live because of the beauty created on that CALTRANS dump site (we have installed two "willow rooms" for shade, installed solar, switched to a hybrid car, learned permaculture). The lessons we learned at Real Goods influenced our impact on the Earth.Cathy K., Northampton, MA
John is a sustainability and solar industry pioneer, who sold the first residential solar system and published the Solar Living Sourcebook more than three decades ago. His visionary actions and ideas then have now become a big, mainstream business - solar is the fastest growing industry in the U.S. and residential solar the fastest growing sector within it.

History of Real Goods[edit]
Early years[edit]
In 1977, 29-year-old John Schaeffer lived on an off-grid community in Mendocino County, California, and commuted 35 miles (56 km) to work each day as a computer operator. As one of the few people with a vehicle and a job in town, he became the designated person to pick up supplies for the community. This led him to create his own general store that sold all the “real goods” for off-grid living at fair prices. In 1978, Schaeffer took $3,000 in savings and a $5,000 loan from his father and opened the first Real Goods store in Willits, California.
One day, a man from Los Angeles arrived at the store with a Porsche full of solar panels. First developed at Bell Laboratories in the 1950s and used in the 1960s in the NASA space program,[2] solar panels had yet to find commercial applications. On a whim, John bought 100 of these novel 9-Watt panels for $600 apiece. He quickly sold them for $900 each to people interested in simple living in Mendocino County who also wanted to enjoy light fixtures, TV and a few of mainstream civilization’s other creature comforts without doing business with utilities. These sales made Real Goods one of the first companies to sell a solar panel commercially in the United States.[3] The success of the Willits store prompted Schaeffer to open an additional store in Ukiah, California, in 1980 and a third store in Santa Rosa, California in 1982. That same year, Real Goods published the first edition of The Solar Living Source Book, which was written as a comprehensive source for sustainable living principles and practices.
By 1985, Real Goods' annual sales were $3 million, but growth was erratic, and all three retail stores were closed. Schaeffer invested his last $3,000 in a 16-page catalog and rejuvenated the company as a mail order business operating out of his garage, sending catalogs to the 2,000-name mailing list the company had accumulated.[4] Customers returned and the company was revived.
The 1990s[edit]
During the 1990s, Real Goods expanded its business by presenting a clear message about the benefits of solar energy. In 1990, the entire solar industry received a boost from the 20th anniversary of Earth Day and the Persian Gulf War, and Real Goods took advantage of it.[3] That year, the company also set its Billion Pound Goal to keep one billion pounds of carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere by 2000, which it completed three years early in 1997.
In 1991, Real Goods held its first direct public stock offering, selling stock directly to its customers, and raised $1 million. The following year Real Goods declared a National Off-The-Grid Day, which soon became the National Tour of Solar Homes, during which the public could see solar-powered living firsthand. Real Goods held its second stock offering in 1993, and in 1994, used those funds to break ground on the Solar Living Center (SLC) in Hopland, California. The same year, Real Goods launched its e-commerce business. In 1998, Schaeffer formed the Solar Living Institute (SLI), a nonprofit organization whose mission is to promote sustainable living through inspirational environmental education.[5] The SLI offers classes and workshops and manages the SLC.
Partnership with Gaiam and the birth of Real Goods Solar[edit]
Real Goods grew significantly in the first decade of the 21st century. By this time, the company had five brick and mortar stores located in Hopland, Santa Rosa, Los Gatos, Berkeley and West Los Angeles, California. The company’s catalog and e-commerce businesses grew as well, and Real Goods increased its annual revenues to $19 million.
In 2001, Real Goods merged with the sustainable lifestyle company Gaiam Inc. (NASDAQ: GAIA) in a stock swap worth $8.7 million.[6] Per the merger agreement, Real Goods shareholders received one share of Class A GAIA common stock for each 10 shares of Real Goods stock owned.[7] Gaiam consolidated order processing and distribution in Cincinnati and accounting responsibilities in Broomfield, Colorado, and implemented a new supply chain management information system.
With the influx of additional capital and the power of Gaiam behind it, Real Goods looked for a promising growth opportunity and found it in the residential solar installation market. Since Real Goods was now headquartered in Colorado, yet maintained the SLC, SLI and offices in California, and since the federal government and both states offered attractive tax incentives for installing solar systems, Real Goods opened its residential solar system installation division in both states in 2002. The commercial solar business was also growing, and Real Goods launched its commercial solar installation division in 2004.
Initial public offering[edit]
In 2008, Real Goods positioned itself for aggressive growth by separating its mail order division from Gaiam, re-launching the Real Goods website as a stand-alone e-commerce channel, expanding its solar division, and going public. On May 8, 2008, Real Goods completed an initial public offering as Real Goods Solar and raised $55 million. Real Goods Solar began trading on the NASDAQ under the symbol RSOL.[8] Through holding 100 percent of Real Goods’ Class B shares, Gaiam maintained control of Real Goods.
Solar installation expansion[edit]
Between 2007 and 2008 Real Goods acquired four solar installation companies in California and became one of the nation’s largest solar installers. In November 2007, Real Goods Solar acquired San Rafael, California-based Marin Solar for $3.2 million in cash and stock.[9] In a similar deal inked in January 2008, RSOL purchased Carlson Solar, headquartered in Hemet, California for $3.2 million in cash and stock.[9] In August 2008, Real Goods Solar completed its third acquisition — Santa Cruz, California-based Independent Energy Systems for $3.6 million.[9] In October 2008, RSOL completed its fourth acquisition in less than a year by acquiring Regrid Power of Campbell, California in a deal valued at $3.8 million in cash and stock.[9] With the acquisition of Marin Solar, Real Goods added the commercial experience and expertise necessary to position itself as a major competitor in the commercial solar installation market.
Merger with Alteris Renewables[edit]
On June 22, 2011, Real Goods Solar announced a merger agreement with Connecticut-based renewable energy installer Earth Friendly Energy Group Holdings, LLC, d/b/a Alteris Renewables. The merger was completed on December 20, 2011, and the combined company retained the Real Goods Solar name, NASDAQ ticker (RSOL), and Louisville, Colorado headquarters. Alteris equity holders were issued 8.7 million shares of Real Goods Solar Class A common stock in exchange for 100% of Alteris' outstanding equity.[10]
The merger was seen by both companies as an opportunity to increase its national footprint, as Real Goods Solar operated in the West and Alteris operated in the Northeast. The companies' respective regions were considered the two fastest-growing markets for solar installations, and both companies had more than 30 years of experience operating in them.[11]
Divisions[edit]
Real Goods Solar division[edit]
Today, Real Goods Solar maintains its headquarters in Louisville, Colorado. By the start of 2013, the company had installed over 235 MW of solar power across more than 22,500 solar energy systems for residential, commercial, and utility properties.[12]
Real Goods retail division[edit]
Real Goods' retail division is headquartered at its flagship retail store in Hopland, California, where e-commerce and order fulfillment operations are located. The Real Goods Store and its e-commerce website offer a range of items for sustainable on- and off-grid living, including urban gardening and remote homesteading supplies, pond and composting tools, camping gear, organic bedding and clothing, non-toxic cleaning and laundry solutions, air and water purifiers, appliances, and renewable energy systems for solar, wind, hydro and solar hot water.
The Hopland store was opened in 1996 on the Solar Living Center grounds. Housed in a strawbale building utilizing passive solar design principles, the store is lighted and heated by an onsite solar system and by south-facing windows that capture the sun’s heat.
In the early 2000s, Real Goods refocused on its national mail order and local solar installation businesses and closed all of its physical stores except for the Hopland store. Catalog printing was stopped in the winter of 2010 in favor of a paperless commerce solution.
Solar Living Source Book[edit]
Real Goods published its first edition of The Solar Living Source Book in 1982. It was written as a one-stop information source for renewable energy and sustainable living. Now in its 30th anniversary (13th) edition, and printed using soy inks on 100 percent post-consumer content recycled paper, the Solar Living Source Book is a comprehensive reference for the layperson on renewable energy technologies and sustainable living. There are more than 600,000 copies in print in 44 English-speaking countries.
Solar Living Institute[edit]
In 1998, John Schaeffer founded a 501(c)(3) nonprofit education institute called the Solar Living Institute (SLI) with the mission of promoting sustainable living through inspirational environmental education. The result is an organization that functions both as a renewable energy and green living experiential classroom and as an example of successful sustainable development. Throughout each year the SLI hosts between 50 and 75 hands-on workshops on everything from photovoltaic system design and installation and strawbale home construction to beekeeping, green career seminars and its Earth Day for Kids programs that introduces inner-city kids to renewable energy and environmental responsibility.[13] The SLI also runs a year-round internship program that offers interns in-depth, hands-on training in renewable energy systems, sustainable building, community gardening and more. In 2009, the SLI began teaching classes online and in 2010, the nonprofit launched an online solar energy training program. The SLI had taught more than 1,000 workshops to nearly 10,000 students.
Solar Living Center[edit]
The SLI and the Real Goods Store are both headquartered at the Solar Living Center (SLC), a 5,000-square-foot (460 m2) strawbale building surrounded by 12 acres (49,000 m2) of permaculture gardens in Hopland, California. The building was designed using passive solar principles and requires little additional heat or light, and the gardens are laid out in a pattern similar to that of U.S. climate zones. In 2000, Real Goods installed a commercial solar system at the SLC that produces 160,000 kW-hours of electricity annually. Opened in 1996, the SLC serves as a “place in the sun” for everyone interested in sustainable living. Approximately 200,000 people visit the SLC each year. The SLC also hosts the annual Solfest celebration, a four-day renewable energy and sustainable living fair and fundraiser for the SLI that includes workshops, demonstrations, educational panels, keynote speakers, music, artists, wine tasting and dancing.[14]
Environmental commitment[edit]
Billion pound goal[edit]
In 1990, based on concerns about global warming, Real Goods set a goal to keep one billion pounds of carbon dioxide (CO2) out of the atmosphere within 10 years through customer purchases of products that reduce CO2 production. Calculations of CO2 reduction on a product-by-product basis were based on a formula developed by the Union of Concerned Scientists. In addition, Real Goods changed its energy usage, shipping and other corporate practices to become more environmentally friendly. The company tracked its progress through regular updates in the Real Goods catalog. In 1997, that goal was achieved three years ahead of schedule. In 2005, Real Goods and Gaiam set another goal to eliminate one billion pounds of CO2 from the atmosphere by 2010. In 2008, that goal was achieved two years early.[15]
Paper reduction/packaging[edit]
In 2007, Real Goods increased the post-consumer recycled paper content for its catalogs from 20 percent to 30 percent. This earned the company Forest Stewardship Council certification. From 2008 to 2010 Real Goods lowered its paper and printing impact another 75 percent by reducing paper weight, catalog trim size and reducing the number of catalogs mailed by driving more business to the Internet. Real Goods customers were asked to reduce the number of catalogs they requested, and catalogs were mailed based on past purchase activity. Customers were also encouraged to shop at Real Goods’ website as exemplified by the “Don’t Buy From This Catalog” campaign the company ran in its Spring/Summer 2010 and Fall/Holiday 2010 catalogs.[16]
Go Zero[edit]
In 2006, Real Goods and Gaiam partnered with The Conservation Fund to introduce the world’s first carbon-neutral product shipping program called Go Zero. Gaiam Real Goods made a contribution that allowed Go Zero to plant nearly 1,500 trees, which offset the company’s operations at its headquarters and fulfillment center for that year.
Company headquarters[edit]
In 2008, Real Goods — with Gaiam as its majority shareholder — moved into new corporate offices in Louisville, Colorado and went solar with a 100 kW solar system installed by Real Goods Solar[17] that provides approximately 20 percent of the company’s energy requirements. In addition, the new headquarters feature low-VOC paints, bamboo flooring and cabinetry, earth-friendly carpet and glue, and recycled office cubicles. In 2008, Real Goods also added composting collection to its comprehensive office recycling program, and some company parties are now zero-waste events.
Awards and accolades[edit]
The company made Inc. magazine’s Top 500 Fastest Growing Companies list and John Schaeffer was the Small Business Administration’s Small Business Person of the Year in 1994. Schaeffer also received the 2007 Green Power Pioneer Award,[18] and was inducted into the International Green Industry Hall of Fame in March 2013.[19] Real Goods has received three Rodale Awards, as well as news coverage in The Wall Street Journal, Fortune, Time and numerous other publications.[3]

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

SOLAR POWER FOR YOUR HOME


Solar energy can actually cost less than what you pay now with low, predictable, locked-in rates.










Save With Solar


How It Works


Is Solar Right For You?









Power For Less


Payment + Financing Options


Rebates + Incentives











Imagine saving thousands of dollars over the next 20 years or more. 


Imagine getting these savings simply by using a different source of electricity. 


Imagine letting an industry-leading energy company handle everything for you. 


Now imagine the source of that electricity is clean, renewable, and sustainable. 












Imagine Clean Power and Bright Savings
RGS Energy helps homeowners lower their electricity bills with solar power. Going solar locks in a fixed electric rate and reduces the cost of the electricity you buy each month. Most RGS Energy customers pay about 25% less than they were paying their old electric company for traditional power.


A locked-in rate means protection from unpredictable electricity bills and utility rate increases. Our customers always know what their energy costs will be, so they can focus on the more important parts of life.
Talk to an expert




















 
A solar loan gives you all the benefits of a lease with the value of ownership. For little up-front, a loan is budget friendly and provides added benefits such as performance guarantees.


						Choose a Solar Power Loan					


 
A system purchase gives you the best long-term savings. You’ll own the solar panels, the power they produce, and their rebates and incentives – the ultimate in energy independence.


						Purchase a Solar System					


 
$500 instant rebate for all servicemen and women! When a Hero goes solar with RGS Energy, we’ll take $500 off the system cost.


						Special Offer: Solar for Heroes

Alexander N. – Annandale, NJ

			We decided to give ourselves the gift of solar energy. I’m excited about this cool green project, and am happy to be doing something to preserve this planet for my small son.		

			—Alexander N., Annandale, NJ		





Bob + Lori (and son) – Visalia, CA

			Electricity without solar? Yuk. Even if SCE rates DON’T rise (and pigs fly), we would have paid Edison between $130K and $140K over 20 years.		

			—Bob + Lori (and son), Visalia, CA		





Brooke + Ryan – Kingsburg, CA

			RGS Energy made the process completely comfortable by being accommodating and by using a no-pressure approach. We decided on the power purchase agreement and are very excited about the tens of thousands of dollars that we’ll be saving over the years to come.		

			—Brooke + Ryan, Kingsburg, CA		





Dan + Laurie – Holyoke, MA

			Hopefully, this will help our whole community. Wouldn’t it be great if Holyoke, MA went down in history as a town that had a minimal carbon footprint because of our harnessing of the sun?

A Top Rated National Solar Company Solar Installation Experience Since 1978 Solar power can actually cost less than what you pay now with a low, predictable, locked-in electricity rate. Over 25,000 customers have chosen us to bring more than 260 MW of clean, affordable solar to their homes and businesses.  





Top of the line products: More than 35 years ago, RGS Energy – a Real Goods Solar Company – sold some of the very first solar panels to the public out of a small general store in Northern California. Since then, we’ve installed over 25,000 solar energy systems for homes, businesses, schools, government facilities, and utilities across the country, totaling more than 260 megawatts of clean energy.









Unrivaled Customer Service: Ensuring the satisfaction of our customers is our top priority. If you’ve had an issue with any aspect of your solar installation, please let us know ASAP. We bring a local focus backed by decades of knowledge and experience, and we pride ourselves on acting as a community-minded solar service provider. 









Official RGS DOW Warranty: DOW announced on June 28, 2016, that it will cease manufacturing POWERHOUSE™ modules. As part of the transition to cease POWERHOUSE™ operations, DOW will no longer be providing design services or material for new projects. RGS Energy has been selected by DOW Solar to be the official warranty servicer for DOW POWERHOUSE™ systems and will continue to fully support warranties on existing POWERHOUSE™ systems.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.

Green Living




Green living - whether off-grid or on - is a lifestyle more and more people are embracing. As the realities of climate change and resource depletion continue to affect real lives, it's clear that many of the systems that sustain us now - food, water, energy, medicine, community, and others - are not sustainable as the ever-increasing population continues to push the Earth's natural limits.Green living means adopting ways to reduce your personal demand on these system, your waste stream, and your carbon footprint. But how? Start gardening and composting. Begin  harvesting rainwater. Switch to non-electric appliances. It's easier (and far more satisfying) than you think. We have the solutions to get you confidently self-sufficient.

"Green living isn't just about moving back to the land anymore - it's about tending to the land where you live. Picking up the shovel and hoe, turning the closets, roof, deck, or yard into places to grow food or raise chickens."

Alexander N. – Annandale, NJ

			We decided to give ourselves the gift of solar energy. I’m excited about this cool green project, and am happy to be doing something to preserve this planet for my small son.		

			—Alexander N., Annandale, NJ		





Bob + Lori (and son) – Visalia, CA

			Electricity without solar? Yuk. Even if SCE rates DON’T rise (and pigs fly), we would have paid Edison between $130K and $140K over 20 years.		

			—Bob + Lori (and son), Visalia, CA		





Brooke + Ryan – Kingsburg, CA

			RGS Energy made the process completely comfortable by being accommodating and by using a no-pressure approach. We decided on the power purchase agreement and are very excited about the tens of thousands of dollars that we’ll be saving over the years to come.

A Top Rated National Solar Company Solar Installation Experience Since 1978 Solar power can actually cost less than what you pay now with a low, predictable, locked-in electricity rate. Over 25,000 customers have chosen us to bring more than 260 MW of clean, affordable solar to their homes and businesses.  





Top of the line products: More than 35 years ago, RGS Energy – a Real Goods Solar Company – sold some of the very first solar panels to the public out of a small general store in Northern California. Since then, we’ve installed over 25,000 solar energy systems for homes, businesses, schools, government facilities, and utilities across the country, totaling more than 260 megawatts of clean energy.









Unrivaled Customer Service: Ensuring the satisfaction of our customers is our top priority. If you’ve had an issue with any aspect of your solar installation, please let us know ASAP. We bring a local focus backed by decades of knowledge and experience, and we pride ourselves on acting as a community-minded solar service provider. 









Official RGS DOW Warranty: DOW announced on June 28, 2016, that it will cease manufacturing POWERHOUSE™ modules. As part of the transition to cease POWERHOUSE™ operations, DOW will no longer be providing design services or material for new projects. RGS Energy has been selected by DOW Solar to be the official warranty servicer for DOW POWERHOUSE™ systems and will continue to fully support warranties on existing POWERHOUSE™ systems.
