Supporting unbridled business growth of clients, it is our steely commitment~Delivering the simplest solution~
It is our great honor to be recognized as a leading system integrator and solution provider in Japanese manufacturing industry today. What led us to such achievement is our capability of developing and delivering the best suitable solution to accelerate clients’ performance; so that they are able to focus on their primary business and business growth.
Growing out of the Information System Division of Nippon Steel, NSSOL had developed and implemented Computer Integrated Manufacturing System in 1960s for the first time in Japan which sustainably runs and produces steel products for 24 hours a day, 365 days.Steelmaking is known as the most complicated and delicate manufacturing process; more than 50,000 kinds of steel is made out of iron ore depending on different chemical additives, precise temperature control and wide variety of rolling process. Our capability and expertise were forged through such environment.
With principle of manufacturing and operation knowledge imprinted, we had been providing optimized, leading-edge yet the simplest system solution to diverse clients to support raising their business value.
Not only in manufacturing industry, but also for the past quarter of century, our innovative IT system solution is employed by retail service, finance, telecommunication, public and academic service and many other sectors.
The goal is not to meet with client’s expectation but to go beyond.  Supporting unbridled business growth of clients is our steely commitment, and to become a reliable partner, that is our goal.


Link to the future, link from Asia~Taking the lead to make changes~
Being in ever-changing business environment, it is imperative to continue improving ourselves to deliver the most innovative solution to our clients at all time.  Pioneering advanced technology may not be adopted instantly sometimes; however, true risk lies in remaining at the present position.
NSSOL is the first company in Japan proactively implemented Oracle database system in 1991 foreseeing the potential of the technology. Whereas Oracle was rather advanced concept at that time and some were reluctant to employ the technology, NSSOL believed that the era of modern industrial production of software was about to come. Today, out of Fortune 100 companies each one of them is utilizing Oracle database.  Eyes looking ahead and foot on the ground, we strive to provide solution which secures client’s advantage in their business environment.
We consider researching technology trends for next decades and transform them into practical applications as our duty.  To name few, cloud-computing and AR-Augmented Reality had been research objectives for about 10 years.  Utilizing such technology, we found not only productivity will be accelerated, but also it could assist people in needs.  Co-developed award winning AR glasses with our advanced application would provide evacuation assistance for deaf and hard-of-hearing people in case of emergency, for instance.
With unflagging commitment to evolve ourselves, we are determined to link present to better future, and take the lead in Asia to make positive changes in the society.


Be the bridge of the world~Human capital, the best asset of ours~
What is behind extraordinary IT system is extraordinary human resources.  NSSOL has established subsidiaries in the U.S. in 1997, Shanghai, China, in 2002, and Singapore in 2011. We have been providing advanced IT solutions to respective market flawlessly, and in order to continue to do so, we must evolve ourselves in time.
We have founded an institute within NSSOL – The Systems Research & Development Center to pursue leading-edge research concerning from IT infrastructure to application services to generate actual business from it.  What were the objectives of research some years ago are often new solutions to clients today.
Overseas staffs too, have opportunity to research and develop the most advanced technology in the world at the center.  Every year, several staffs are transferred to deepen knowledge and sharpen skills; we are certain that they will become the bridge to the world and make the great contribution to business clients as well as society.
Many times, our evolving innovative technology is focused as asset; however, behind the scene, there are layers of evolving innovative human being – Human capital, which we consider as the best asset of ours.

Vuzix and NS Solutions Corporation Partner to Deliver Augmented Reality Solutions for ManufacturingHomeMailFlickrTumblrNewsSportsFinanceCelebrityAnswersGroupsMobileMoreYahooSearchSearchSkip to NavigationSkip to Main ContentSkip to Related Content0Vuzix and NS Solutions Corporation Partner to Deliver Augmented Reality Solutions for ManufacturingMarketwireFebruary 24, 2011ReblogShareTweetShareROCHESTER, NY--(Marketwire - 02/24/11) - Vuzix Corporation (TSX-V:VZX - News) (OTC.BB:VUZI - News) ("Vuzix" or the "Company") announced today that it has partnered with NS Solutions Corporation (NS SOL) to develop an Augmented Reality (AR) solution based on Vuzix' see-through AR glasses. The solution uses AR to refine and systematize the transfer of knowledge about manufacturing tasks so that these skills can be easily passed-on to the next generation of manufacturing worker. The two organizations will commence commercial production of the solution, which combines Nippon Steel's knowledgebase of manufacturing tasks and Vuzix' see-through AR glasses, the same glasses, code named 'Raptyr,' that recently earned an innovation award at the 2011 Consumer Electronics Show.According to industry analysts, Japan's manufacturing industry faces increasing labor shortages as their skilled baby-boomer work force retires. As a result NS SOL has developed AR software solutions that helps transfer knowledge in a consistent way, anywhere and anytime. Vuzix' advanced AR see-through glasses provide a mobile, hands-free deployable platform that enables such a transfer. With the combined solution new manufacturing workers are able to view images, instructions and information that are super-imposed onto the real world, without consulting a manual or contacting a supervisor. This provides a learning context that would take hundreds of hours to duplicate in the class room. It ensures NS SOL's ability to maintain a high standard amongst its work force and a high level of quality control at a lower cost.NS SOL tested a number of AR projection system alternatives and found that, except for Vuzix' see-through glasses, they were inadequate for actual use in the field. The alternatives did not provide sufficient brightness or resolution, and they were too heavy and difficult to use.Paul Travers, President of Vuzix, said, "We are very pleased to be working with NS SOL to deliver this AR solution. It is applications such as this that bring tangible results and savings to organizations helping to drive growth of the AR marketplace. We believe that this solution, enabled through Vuzix software developer kit and AR see-through Video Eyewear has wide spread application among a broad range of industries around the world."NS SOL and Vuzix will work together to complete commercial implementation of the knowledge transfer application in 2011. It will be deployed first at Nippon Steel where several thousand systems are expected to be put to use. The two organizations will continue to collaborate in a co-marketing and sales relationship to identify other commercial customers for the solution in Japan.About Vuzix CorporationVuzix is a leading supplier of Video Eyewear products in the defense, consumer and media & entertainment markets.

Common questions

What's the difference between a C corporation and an S corporation?
The IRS allows corporations to choose to be taxed as either a "C corporation" or an "S corporation." Income from C corporations are subject to double taxation; that is, the corporation pays taxes on its net income and then the shareholders also pay taxes on the income that they receive from the corporation.S corporations have only one level of taxation. The shareholders still have to pay taxes on money that they receive from the corporation, but an S corporation does not pay taxes on its net income. While the S corporation is popular among small business owners, C corporations have greater tax planning flexibility.


How does a corporation protect my personal assets?
If a business operates as a corporation, the business owners, called shareholders, are not personally liable for debts or other claims against the corporation. That's because the corporation is a separate legal entity from its owners. If a corporation complies with the formalities required for it to be treated as a separate legal entity, then anyone seeking to collect a debt from, or enforce a claim against, a corporation, would not be able to collect from the shareholders themselves. They would only be able to pursue the assets held in the name of the corporation.


Why do many people choose to form their corporation in Delaware?
Delaware is a very popular place in which to form corporations. However, the primary benefits apply to larger public corporations or those planning to go public. Delaware's laws provide heightened protection for board members against lawsuits brought by shareholders, and Delaware has a court exclusively dedicated to resolving corporate disputes. These benefits don't mean much to smaller corporations. Keep in mind that if a corporation forms in Delaware and does business in another state, the corporation would be required to file additional paperwork, and pay any taxes and/or fees required to do business in that state. Given those factors, many smaller corporations keep it simple and form in the state in which they plan to do business.


What is an EIN?
An employer identification number (EIN), also known as a federal tax identification number, is used to identify a business entity for tax purposes. It's like a Social Security number, but for a business. In general, most businesses need an EIN. The only reason a business would not get an EIN is if it has only one owner, elects to be treated as a sole proprietor for tax purposes, and does not want to open a separate business bank account. In this case, the owner would use their Social Security number as the business identifier. However, there are disadvantages to this approach, namely the risk of liability.


How are LLCs taxed?
Unlike a corporation, LLCs have some flexibility in how they're taxed. Depending on how many members and the type of tax treatment the owner selects, the LLC can be taxed as either a corporation, partnership or as part of the owner's personal tax return (called a "disregarded entity"). By default, an LLC with two or more members are taxed as a partnership, unless they file an IRS Form 8832 to elect to be treated as a corporation. If the LLC has only one owner, it will be taxed as a sole proprietor, unless the owner files Form 8832. It's not necessary to decide which tax treatment until after your business is formed. You have up to 12 months to decide and can speak to an accountant if you need help making this decision.


What is a registered agent?
A registered agent (sometimes called a resident agent or statutory agent) is a person or business authorized to accept important legal documents on behalf of a business. States require businesses to provide the name of their registered agent at the time they form their business entity. While you can be your own registered agent, there are disadvantages. You have to be available during regular business hours and your information goes on the public record. If you miss a filing deadline, you risk being fined or shut down. Our registered agent service can ensure you receive important business documents, sort through junk mail and keep your information private.


Is a corporation right for me?
It depends on many factors. Get help deciding by answering a few questions here.

The LegalZoom 3-step process was developed by attorneys from some of the most prestigious law firms in America. There are no complex instructions to follow and nothing to download or print. Simply answer a few questions and get started on
              setting up your corporation.

Here's how it works:

We Create and File Your Incorporation Papers

We even create company-specific bylaws and organizational minutes.
Final Wrap-Up
						When we receive your filed Articles of Incorporation back from the state, we send them to you along with the rest of your formation documents, as well as easy instructions regarding next steps.

Common questions

What's the difference between a C corporation and an S corporation?
The IRS allows corporations to choose to be taxed as either a "C corporation" or an "S corporation." Income from C corporations are subject to double taxation; that is, the corporation pays taxes on its net income and then the shareholders also pay taxes on the income that they receive from the corporation.S corporations have only one level of taxation. The shareholders still have to pay taxes on money that they receive from the corporation, but an S corporation does not pay taxes on its net income. While the S corporation is popular among small business owners, C corporations have greater tax planning flexibility.


How does a corporation protect my personal assets?
If a business operates as a corporation, the business owners, called shareholders, are not personally liable for debts or other claims against the corporation. That's because the corporation is a separate legal entity from its owners. If a corporation complies with the formalities required for it to be treated as a separate legal entity, then anyone seeking to collect a debt from, or enforce a claim against, a corporation, would not be able to collect from the shareholders themselves. They would only be able to pursue the assets held in the name of the corporation.


Why do many people choose to form their corporation in Delaware?
Delaware is a very popular place in which to form corporations. However, the primary benefits apply to larger public corporations or those planning to go public. Delaware's laws provide heightened protection for board members against lawsuits brought by shareholders, and Delaware has a court exclusively dedicated to resolving corporate disputes. These benefits don't mean much to smaller corporations. Keep in mind that if a corporation forms in Delaware and does business in another state, the corporation would be required to file additional paperwork, and pay any taxes and/or fees required to do business in that state. Given those factors, many smaller corporations keep it simple and form in the state in which they plan to do business.


What is an EIN?
An employer identification number (EIN), also known as a federal tax identification number, is used to identify a business entity for tax purposes. It's like a Social Security number, but for a business. In general, most businesses need an EIN. The only reason a business would not get an EIN is if it has only one owner, elects to be treated as a sole proprietor for tax purposes, and does not want to open a separate business bank account. In this case, the owner would use their Social Security number as the business identifier. However, there are disadvantages to this approach, namely the risk of liability.


How are LLCs taxed?
Unlike a corporation, LLCs have some flexibility in how they're taxed. Depending on how many members and the type of tax treatment the owner selects, the LLC can be taxed as either a corporation, partnership or as part of the owner's personal tax return (called a "disregarded entity"). By default, an LLC with two or more members are taxed as a partnership, unless they file an IRS Form 8832 to elect to be treated as a corporation. If the LLC has only one owner, it will be taxed as a sole proprietor, unless the owner files Form 8832. It's not necessary to decide which tax treatment until after your business is formed. You have up to 12 months to decide and can speak to an accountant if you need help making this decision.


What is a registered agent?
A registered agent (sometimes called a resident agent or statutory agent) is a person or business authorized to accept important legal documents on behalf of a business. States require businesses to provide the name of their registered agent at the time they form their business entity. While you can be your own registered agent, there are disadvantages. You have to be available during regular business hours and your information goes on the public record. If you miss a filing deadline, you risk being fined or shut down. Our registered agent service can ensure you receive important business documents, sort through junk mail and keep your information private.

It depends on many factors. Get help deciding by answering a few questions here.
