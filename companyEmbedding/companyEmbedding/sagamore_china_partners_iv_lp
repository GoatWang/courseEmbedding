Date: 2016-02-01
Pageview: 18261


  

BEIJING, February 1, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Sinovac Biotech Ltd. ("Sinovac" or the "Company") (NASDAQ: SVA), a leading provider of biopharmaceutical products in China, today announced that its board of directors (the "Board") has received a preliminary non-binding proposal letter, dated January 30, 2016, from Mr. Weidong Yin, chairman, president and chief executive officer of the Company, SAIF Partners IV L.P. and/or its affiliates, to acquire all of the outstanding common shares of the Company not owned by them or their affiliates for $6.18 in cash per common share. A copy of the proposal letter is attached hereto as Exhibit A.
The Board has formed a special committee consisting of three independent directors (the "Special Committee"), Mr. Simon Anderson, Mr. Yuk Lam Lo and Mr. Meng Mei, to consider the proposal. Mr. Simon Anderson is appointed as the chairman of the Special Committee. The Company expects that the Special Committee will retain independent advisors, including independent financial and legal advisors, to assist it in this process.
The Board cautions the Company’s shareholders and others considering trading the Company’s securities that the Board has just received the proposal letter and has not had an opportunity to carefully review and evaluate the proposal or make any decision with respect to the Company’s response to the proposal. There can be no assurance that any definitive offer will be made, that any definitive agreement will be executed relating to the proposed transaction or that this or any other transaction will be approved or consummated. The Company does not undertake any obligation to provide any updates with respect to this or any other transaction, except as required under applicable law.

EXHIBIT A
 
January 30, 2016
 
The Board of Directors
Sinovac Biotech Ltd.
No. 39 Shangdi Xi Road,
Haidian District, Beijing 100085
People’s Republic of China
 
Dear Members of the Board of Directors,
The undersigned, Mr. Weidong Yin (“Mr. Yin”), chairman, president and chief executive officer of Sinovac Biotech Ltd. (the “Company”) and SAIF Partners IV L.P. (together with Mr. Yin, collectively, the “Buyer Group”) is pleased to submit this preliminary non-binding proposal (the “Proposal”) to acquire all of the outstanding common shares of the Company that are not already owned by the Buyer Group on the principal terms and conditions described in this letter (the “Transaction”). 
We believe that our Proposal provides a very attractive opportunity to the Company’s shareholders. Our Proposal represents a premium of approximately 23.11% to the closing price of the Company’s common shares on January 29, 2016, and a premium of approximately 16.62% to the volume-weighted average closing price of the Company’s common shares during the last 90 trading days.
Set forth below are the key terms of our Proposal.
1.  Consortium. We will form an acquisition vehicle for the purpose of implementing the Transaction. Please also note that the Buyer Group is currently interested only in pursuing the Transaction and are not interested in selling their shares in any other transaction involving the Company.
2.  Transaction and Purchase Price. We propose to acquire all of the outstanding common shares of the Company not already owned by us at a purchase price equal to US$6.18 per common share in cash through  an acquisition vehicle newly formed by the Buyer Group with and into the Company.
3.  Financing. We intend to finance the Transaction with a combination of debt and equity capital.  Equity financing will be provided by the Buyer Group in the form of cash and rollover equity in the Company. Debt financing is expected to be provided by loans from third party financial institutions.  We are confident that we can timely secure adequate financing to consummate the Transaction.
4.  Due Diligence. We believe that we will be in a position to complete customary due diligence for the Transaction in a timely manner and in parallel with discussions on definitive agreements.
5.  Definitive Agreements.  We have engaged Kirkland & Ellis International LLP as our international legal counsel and are prepared to promptly provide and negotiate definitive agreements for the Transaction (the “Definitive Agreements”). The Definitive Agreements will provide for representations, warranties, covenants and conditions which are typical, customary and appropriate for transactions of this type. 
6.  Process. We believe that the Transaction will provide superior value to the Company’s public shareholders. We recognize of course that the board of directors of the Company will evaluate the Transaction independently before it can make its determination whether to endorse it. Given our involvement in the Transaction, we would expect that the independent members of the board of directors will proceed to consider our Proposal and the Transaction.  
7.  Confidentiality. The Buyer Group will, as required by law, promptly file a Schedule 13D with the Securities and Exchange Commission to disclose this letter.  We are sure you will agree, however, that it is in all of our interests to ensure that we otherwise proceed in a strictly confidential manner, unless otherwise required by law, until we have executed definitive agreements or terminated our discussions.  
8.  No Binding Commitment. This Proposal is not a binding offer, agreement or agreement to make a binding offer or agreement at any point in the future. This letter is a preliminary indication of interest by the Buyer Group and does not contain all matters upon which agreement must be reached in order to consummate the proposed Transaction, nor does it create any binding rights or obligations in favor of any person. The parties will be bound only upon the execution of mutually agreeable definitive documentation.
9.  Governing Law. This letter shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the internal laws of the State of New York.
*     *     *     *     *



In closing, we would like to express our commitment to working together to bring this Transaction to a successful and timely conclusion. Should you have any questions regarding this Proposal, please do not hesitate to contact us. We look forward to hearing from you. 
 
Sincerely,
 





/s/ Weidong Yin

HONG KONG and SHANGHAI, Oct. 29, 2013 /PRNewswire/ -- Hong Kong-based private equity real estate firm Gaw Capital Partners today announced the final close of its fourth China real estate fund, Gateway Real Estate Fund IV, bringing total equity raised for this fund to its hard cap size of US$ 1.025 billion - Gaw Capital Partners' largest fund ever. Gateway Fund IV will employ an opportunistic investment strategy - targeting real estate assets that have favorable risk-return profiles in the Greater China and Asia Pacific region.
(Photo: http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20131029/CN06211)
Goodwin Gaw, Chairman and Managing Principal, said, "The success of our fundraising efforts is a vote of great confidence in our successful track record of returns for our investors and in our unique investment strategy – opportunistic real estate investments in the Greater China and Asia Pacific." 
Gaw Capital Partners currently manages four real estate funds targeting the Greater China and Asia Pacific region and recently launched Gaw Capital Partners USA, which provides services for separate account direct investment and private equity real estate fund management in the US and UK markets.  Gaw Capital Partners has raised equity in excess of US$3.387 billion since 2005 and currently commands assets of US$ 7.1 billion under management encompassing residential developments, retail centers, hotels and commercial properties.
Investors in Fund IV include sovereign wealth funds, endowments, pension funds and other top-tier institutional investors. The global institutional investors in Gateway Fund IV are truly a global mix: 40% of the investors come from Asia, 30% North America and 30% from Europe. The successful fundraising for Gateway Fund IV speaks to the slightly improved sentiment toward Asian real estate among global institutional investors. Global institutional investors favor investments that offer value and potential for capital growth as global economies continue to improve. Real estate assets maintain a special appeal - they are tangible and it's an increasingly important asset class amongst global investors who are diversifying their investment portfolios.
"We are very pleased that many of our LPs from our previous funds again invested with us, showing their continuing support and trust," said Christina Gaw, Managing Principal and Head of Capital Markets who spearheads the firm's global fund raising efforts. "We also managed to attract new LPs from around the world and we look forward to building upon the success of our earlier real estate funds and providing exceptional returns to our global investors," she said.
Geographically, Gateway Fund IV's focus will be on gateway primary cities such as Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Hong Kong, Macau and Taipei, as well as secondary cities in the Greater China which Gaw Capital believes demonstrate strong economic fundamentals and long-term real estate demand, such as China's Jiangsu Province. 
The Fund will also focus on city-center retail assets with high pedestrian traffic as well as centrally located commercial assets in Tier I and Tier II cities in China where the government's tightening policy has taken effect and created attractive pricing. Gateway Fund IV plans to invest at least 80% of its equity in the Greater China and 20% in Asia Pacific region such as Japan, Korea, Singapore, Malaysia and elsewhere.
Gateway Fund IV will employ an opportunistic strategy, targeting assets that have favorable risk-return profiles; these assets should display strong growth potential and value-added / repositioning opportunities.
The specific strategy for each target market will be developed based on local economic, demographic, and market conditions. Gaw Capital also believes that its in-house operating platforms will provide a significant competitive advantage over local market participants.
Gateway Fund IV intends to hold its investments for four to seven years. Gaw Capital will seek to add value during the holding period by improving occupancy, increasing rent, strengthening tenant mix, monitoring current market trends, and ultimately determining optimal exit time.
About Gaw Capital Partners 
Gaw Capital Partners is a uniquely positioned private equity fund management company that focuses in real estate markets in greater China and other high barrier-to-entry markets globally. 
Specializing in adding strategic value to under-utilized real estate through redesign and repositioning, the firm's investments span the entire spectrum of real estate sectors, including residential development, commercial offices, retail malls, serviced apartments, and hotels. Gaw Capital Partners runs an integrated business model with its own in-house asset management operating platforms in commercial, hospitality and development.
Gaw Capital Partners currently manages four real estate funds targeting the Greater China and Asia Pacific region, while Gaw Capital US provides services for separate account direct investment and private equity real estate fund management in the US and UK markets. Gaw Capital Partners has raised equity in excess of US$3.387 billion since 2005 and currently commands assets of US$ 7.1 billion under management encompassing residential developments, retails centers, hotels and commercial properties.
