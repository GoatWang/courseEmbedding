Name: Deb Schoneman
Title: Chief Financial Officer
Years at Piper Jaffray: 25
Years in Industry: 25






Debbra L. Schoneman is the chief financial officer for Piper Jaffray Companies. She joined Piper Jaffray in 1990 in the firm’s accounting department, and has held several senior finance management positions, including finance director of both equity and fixed income capital markets and, most recently, treasurer. Schoneman is on the Allina Health board and finance and audit committees and serves as chair of the board of BestPrep, a nonprofit focused on business, career and financial literacy skills. She has completed two mission trips to Haiti through the organization, Healing Haiti and was awarded CFO of the Year by the Minneapolis-St. Paul Business Journal in 2014. Schoneman earned a bachelor’s degree in finance from Minnesota State University Mankato in Mankato, Minn., and a Master of Business Administration degree from the University of St. Thomas in Minneapolis.
 
What is your role at Piper Jaffray and what ideas have you brought to the firm?
I am currently the CFO. When I started at Piper Jaffray 25 years ago the firm didn’t have a dedicated finance function. Over the years, I partnered with the business lines to build a finance function and deliver the reporting, analytics and modeling capabilities that could drive improved results. 
The specific idea that I am most proud of is the creation of a product profitability model five years ago as I moved into the CFO role that allows us to understand the fully allocated profitability of our products and business lines, as well as the return on allocated capital. It has been a meaningful tool for strategic decision making.
Describe the career path that led you to your current position.
My career at Piper Jaffray started as an intern in the accounting department which led to a full-time role in accounting. As I mentioned above, I spent many of my early years at the firm building a finance function in partnership with the business lines. That ultimately led to a capital markets finance director role, then treasurer and ultimately CFO.  
As I look back on my career, I feel very blessed that the firm supported me and encouraged me when I had an idea to create something new, which included many of the positions I moved into along the way.
What challenges have you faced as part of a male-dominated industry, and how have you overcome them?
The biggest challenge that I have faced being a part of a male-dominated industry was my own lack of confidence. As I gained self-awareness around this issue, through the advice and support of others, I have increased my confidence and learned to embrace those skills that make me unique such as a desire to collaborate and my natural tendency to be empathetic. 
What advice would you give younger women looking to pursue a career in finance?
That is an easy one for me… BE CONFIDENT! This is a key attribute for success and tends to be more challenging for women. Women, you don’t need to be 100% ready to take that next step, go for that promotion or take on that project before you do it. Many studies have shown that women will miss out on opportunities because they just don’t feel ready, when at the same time a man will say “I know 60% of what I need to know and I can learn the rest” and then go for it. Luckily I was fortunate to have supporters who pushed me along my path, but that won’t always happen. 
Women just need to take a deep breath and go for it! A quote I love from Neale Donald Walsch is “Life begins at the end of your comfort zone.” I have found great satisfaction and energy from pushing myself out of my comfort zone and into my “learning zone.”
What do you like best about working for Piper Jaffray? 
Although it may sound a bit cliché, it is absolutely the people that make Piper Jaffray a great company to work for. This firm is filled with incredibly smart people who challenge me and make me better. We are one team, sharing common values, working together to create success and having fun along the way.
Who, if anyone, has had an influence on your career and why?
While there have been so many people in my life who have supported me and taught me, the one person who has had the biggest influence on my career is my husband. He has always encouraged me to push myself. He always had confidence in me when I lacked it myself.
How do you balance work with personal life? What do you enjoy doing in your spare time?
The key for me is to stay away from drawing too much of a distinction between work and personal life. Everything I do is “my life.” This starts with doing a job that I am passionate about. I focus on trying to integrate my roles as a CFO, mom, wife, friend, etc. This may mean that I leave work early to go to my daughter’s sporting events or use FaceTime helping my kids with homework when I’m traveling for work, but it also may mean that I need to respond to e-mails later in the evening. It is always important for me to prioritize those things that mean the most to me and not be afraid to ask for help! 
Lastly, I believe that it is the quality of time I spend truly being present in each role, rather than the quantity. Outside of Piper Jaffray, I love spending time watching my daughters play sports, relaxing at our cabin, baking and entertaining friends.
