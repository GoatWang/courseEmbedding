The Pet Healthy Family of premium products for cats and dogs appeal to pet parents who purchase the very best in pet supplies and treats







Before we introduce a new treat we gauge interest  from all breeds of felines and canines, with >90% acceptance as our standard to move into production and distribution. 







We continuously improve our award-winning litter's performance in three key areas: odor control, ease of use and health monitoring. Perfect Litter saves cats' lives: we take this responsibility seriously. 


























Our Story














Our Story












































































History
Pet Healthy Holdings, LLC. (PHH) was formed in 2013 for the purpose of acquiring two of the key products presently comprising the ten (10) products marketed under the Pet Healthy Family™ brand. At the top of the list was Perfect Litter™, a winner of four national awards for innovation and excellence; and the second product was K-9 Fat Free Treats™, created and first manufactured in 2005 by one of today’s national leaders in pet food manufacturing.  Neither saw any meaningful national distribution until 2015 when Perfect Litter rose from page 655 on Amazon.com in August of 2014 to page ONE (1) on Amazon, #3 of all cat litters, within 7 months; and K9 Fat Free Treats went from page 879 on Amazon.com to become, within 75 days of introduction, one of fastest selling brands (out of over 22,000 dog treat products), garnering 90%+ 4&5 star-consumer reviews. On July 1, 2014, the PHH senior management team implemented an ambitious 5-year, 4-stage strategic business plan: stages 1 & 2 have been devoted to expanding the Pet Healthy Family product line, creating consumer brand recognition of the brand and implementing a best-in-class manufacturing quality control process.  Three years to the day later, July 1 of 2107, we are entering the 3rd stage of this 5-year plan as we begin to introduce our 31 SKU product line within various regional and national retail distribution channels both domestically and internationally.
On December 30, 2016, the PHH management team acquired the company from its non-pet industry investment partners.

We believe every sheltered pet deserves a treat every day.  Do you?

Every Sheltered Pet Deserves a Treat
Each year, 7.6 million companion pets enter 13,600 animal shelters throughout the U.S.  Of those, almost 3 million are euthanized because the shelter cannot feed and house these pets awaiting adoption.   Approximately 2.7 million sheltered pets are adopted each year, equally split between cats and dogs. 
Pet ownership in the U.S. is at an all-time high.  Today, approximately half of all households own a cat and/or a dog, which by the latest count totaled 71 million dogs and 91 million cats[ Source: AAPA]  According to the American Veterinary Medical Association, approximately 40% of pet owners learned about their pet through word of mouth. Less than a third of all pets are adopted from shelters and rescues. 
It the aforementioned facts and our love of dogs and cats that have driven us to create the Caring & Sharing initiative.  Our sole goal is to create awareness of the plight of sheltered animals, which we believe will stimulate interest in adopting a cat, dog or both from a local shelter.    As we manufacture two of the best treats on the market for cats and dogs…Kitty Kaviar™ and K9 Fat Free Treats™…..we thought that providing these treats to thousands of animal shelters would be viewed as a somewhat unusual donation…..so unusual, our Click & Feed A Treat icons it would attract tens of thousands of pet owners who will welcome the opportunity to become a small but critical part of our noble cause.
Every time a pet owner purchases one of the Pet Healthy Family products, we donate 6 treats to an animal shelter; and every time you click on a CLICK & FEED icon, we donate treats to an animal shelter.
Would you be kind enough to join us by clicking and feeding a dog and cat a treat today???

Introduces Enhanced Product Line Utilizing Patented TechnologyMarketwireJune 6, 2011ReblogShareTweetShareHENDERSON, NV and LAS VEGAS, NV--(Marketwire - 06/06/11) - LoCatI Global Holdings, LLC / Broadcast Marketing Group, Inc. (Pinksheets:BDCM - News), in an advanced marketing effort, introduces an enhanced product line utilizing patented technology. CEO/ President Dwight Jory has announced the introduction of an enhanced product line developed from innovative patented technology. With state of the art equipment and backdoor technology the marketing of the devices will drive record sales of the Global Positioning Satellite (GPS) Based Recovery Device and Risk Management System for Portable Computing Devices and Data. The specific intellectual property covered in this patent provides an advanced and comprehensive basis for controlling tracking and recovery processes necessary for an entity choosing to use GPS as a means to locate specific objects. Further, the ability to destroy data on a device such as computers, cell phones, and electronic notebooks remotely, whether in the on or off position, creates an enhanced ability and raises the bar for the industry standard in GPS Tracking Devices.The Automotive Tracking and Recovery Device - Our automobile tracking and recovery device, offers a suite of solutions including tracking of location and speed, setting of geographic fencing, 24/7 access via cell or computer, remote locking and unlocking of vehicle, pinpoint road mapping, and instant notification. We provide the only device on the market that does not require a purchase of a unit.Asset Protection Loss Device is a compact self-contained GPS tracking device, which has its own power source, and offers all of the benefits of the automotive recovery and tracking device. Unlike the automotive tracking and recovery device it simply has to be affixed to the asset it is monitoring. This unique product offers a cost effective mechanism for businesses to provide real time access to physical inventory. The company currently has an ATM provider as a customer, using the Sky Sheppard to 24/7 monitor locations of mobile ATMs. The market for this product includes any equipment of value, especially items that are transported.Recreation GPS Tracking Device is a device designed for motorcycles and all-terrain vehicles; the device offers a fully waterproof independent battery source for an additional 90 minutes, in the event of loss of power. It also features an accelerometer, in the event the motorcycle is moved and it immediately notifies owner.Boat and Vessel Tracking/Monitoring Device is designed for aquatic devices, and offers a fully waterproof independent battery source, for an additional 90 minutes in the event of loss of power. This GPS tracking device is designed to monitor boats and locations, as well as have onboard panic button requirements. Boats frequently experience breakdowns and malfunctions, which usually occur while underway. With an installed panic button, the device provides real time notification of distress and can activate a bilge pump.Pet Tracking and Recovery Device is a device that was developed for the use of monitoring pets, and is slightly larger in size than a fifty cent piece. It attaches to the pet's collar, and allows setting up geofencing. The device will contact you immediately upon your pet's movement beyond a predetermined area, or if they go missing. In most cases, your recovery is immediate as all of the information regarding your lost pet is based upon real time information.The Company is currently working on a personal tracking device which will allow the monitoring of people in real time. The advantages and applications of this device are many with the consideration of senior care and child development. CEO and President Dwight Jory expressed enthusiasm in the development of devices that have applicability in everyday life of the customer.

If you want to be the next big video on YouTube or any other video sharing site, invest in a cat camera collar. With the right camera, this type of collar can be an incredible investment in your own entertainment. It can also give you a cat-perspective on a day in the life of your pet. To ensure you purchase the right type of product, there are a few things to keep in mind.
What type of collar is best for capturing a cat in action? When choosing a collar for your cat, start with sizing and durability. The collar itself needs to be strong enough to hold the weight of the camera while also providing plenty of room for the animal to move. It should create a very light, snug feeling. It also should be as lightweight as possible not to weigh down the animal from running, jumping, and just having fun.
What type of camera should you use to capture cat videos? When selecting a cat collar camera, look for a small, hand-held size. Choose one that is very durable. For even better function, choose a shockproof camera that’s housed inside a waterproof case. If the cat is likely to get wet, whether from drinking water or from running in the rain, this waterproof feature can be very important. There is no doubt the animal will move around and knock into things. Durability is just as important as the specs of the camera.
How can you ensure a great video? Unless the animal does nothing but sleep all day, the collar and camera combo will create an interesting and fun video. Ensure the camera offers outstanding resolution to ensure it can capture clear video and still shots. Also look for a camera that makes downloading and sharing the captured video easy. Those with a 2.0 USB port are ideal for this.

To ensure the process works, invest in a quality camera like the Polaroid Cube, place it inside a protective display, and fit it to a collar. Position it properly and be patient. Once it’s in place, it’s likely you can watch what your animal does on a regular basis. Cameras and collars like this shouldn’t interfere with the animal’s ability to function normally, though. Choosing the right size collar and a lightweight camera can make all of the difference in your results.
