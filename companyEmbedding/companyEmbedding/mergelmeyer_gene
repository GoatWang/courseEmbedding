Assurant Names Gene Mergelmeyer Chief Operating Officer to 
Increase Alignment Across Business Lines and Drive Profitable Growth

NEW YORK, Feb. 16, 2016 -- As part of its ongoing strategic realignment, Assurant, Inc. (NYSE: AIZ) today announced that Gene Mergelmeyer will be appointed to the role of chief operating officer, effective July 1, 2016. In his new role, he will be responsible for overseeing the operations of Assurant’s business lines worldwide, ensuring a coordinated approach across the Housing and Lifestyle markets and improving execution to drive long-term, profitable growth.
Mergelmeyer is an 18-year veteran of Assurant and since 2007 has served as president and chief executive officer of Assurant Specialty Property. In 2014, he assumed the additional roles of executive vice president and chief administrative officer for Assurant, overseeing the company’s enterprise transformation initiatives to optimize customer service, technology and procurement operations.
“Assurant has significant opportunities to grow and deliver superior returns to our shareholders. As our new COO, Gene will drive our competitive advantage to ensure we seize these opportunities by capitalizing on market trends and meeting consumer demands,” said Assurant President and CEO Alan B. Colberg. “Gene’s strong leadership has been critical to growing the Assurant Specialty Property business, where he has consistently delivered solid results and driven its expansion into attractive adjacent markets such as multi-family housing and mortgage solutions. I look forward to working with Gene in his new role.”
In addition to Mergelmeyer’s appointment, Assurant also named Mike Anderson to the role of interim president of Assurant Solutions, effective immediately. Anderson succeeds Assurant Solutions President and CEO S. Craig Lemasters who will retire on July 1, 2016 following more than 25 years of distinguished service.  
“All of us at Assurant are grateful for Craig’s dedicated service and wish him the very best. Craig has been a strong contributor to Assurant’s growth, helping us to drive digital innovation, expand our global footprint and cement the company’s position as a market leader in Connected Living,” said Colberg. “Mike has worked side-by-side with Craig during the past 18 years and his appointment will allow for a smooth transition as we evaluate our go-forward operating structure for our businesses.” 
Anderson joined Assurant in 1998 through the acquisition of MS Diversified Inc. In 2013, he was named COO of Assurant Solutions to strengthen the business segment’s global platform. Under his leadership, Assurant Solutions has become a leading independent provider of vehicle service contracts and related products and services to U.S. auto and recreational vehicle dealers.

CEO Gene Mergelmeyer Pledges Support to California Wildfire Victims
Last weekend I experienced firsthand the devastation wrought by the California wildfires. Although I have been watching the fires from a distance, as have other residents of Southern California, I was unprepared for the impact of actually seeing so many homes destroyed beyond recognition.  I think the strong smell of smoke added to the impact. While the news media has done an excellent job reporting on the destruction, there is nothing like standing next to a homeowner, gazing at their home that has been reduced to rubble.
I was humbled at the composure of our customers as they described their fire experience and what their homes looked like before the fire.  I was honored that I was there to express our company’s sympathy and our pledge to help get them on their way back to their normal life.
Insurance is a promise; the promise that our company will be there to help in the event our customers need us.  We at Assurant Specialty Property will deliver on our promise.
Teams of catastrophe adjusters are already on the ground in California handling claims quickly and effectively and our inside staff is working with our clients over the phone answering questions and putting the claim in process.  Our goal is to handle 90% of the dwelling portion of all these claims in the first 30 days of the claim being reported.  We want to provide exceptional service to our customers and will do everything we can to make this happen.
We have also been working with our clients to get them information that they can use to assess the impact to their loans and customers.  Our loss draft department is gearing up for an increase in calls dealing with the insurance settlement process for our clients and their customers.
Southern California is home to some of the most beautiful country in America. As a proud Californian, I promise to do everything I can to help our citizens rebuild, and restore this area to it’s former beauty. I’m speaking for everyone at Assurant Specialty Property when I say that this is not just our job. It’s personal.
Best Regards, 

Gene Mergelmeyer
          President and CEO, Assurant Specialty Property
