Convent Garden reports rise in net rental income




Prachi Singh |



Friday, July 21 2017 


During the six months ended June 30, 2017, Capco said that the company
further strengthened its financial position reducing loan to value to 18
percent and increasing available liquidity to 577 million pounds (749
million dollars). The total property value of the group increased 0.2
percent like-for-like to 3.5 billion pounds (4.5 billion dollars). The
valuation of Covent Garden rose by 1.5 percent like-for-like to 2.4 billion
pounds (3.1 billion dollars), driven by rental growth of 2.8 percent
achieved over the period. 
Commenting on the H1 update, Ian Hawksworth, Chief Executive of Capco,
said in a media release: “Covent Garden which now represents two thirds of
our business is established as a world class retail and dining destination
and continues to deliver positive rental and value growth. There has been
strong operational progress across the estate with 43 new leasing
transactions signed during the period, including brands such as Kent &
Curwen. Our ERV target of 125 million pounds by December 2020 remains in
place, reflecting the positive growth prospects of the estate.”
Convent Garden performs well during H1
In the six months, Covent Garden’s ERV increased 2.8 percent
like-for-like to 98.8 million pounds (128 million dollars) and the company
said, ERV target of 125 million pounds (162 million dollars) by December
2020 remains in place. Capco said, Covent Garden’s rental growth prospects
remain strong and the estate is well placed to outperform the wider central
London market due to its innovative repositioning strategy, its
experiential approach to place-making and its global reputation.
During the period to 30 June 2017, 43 leasing transactions including new
leases and renewals representing 6.6 million pounds (8.5 million dollars)
of rental income per annum were transacted at 3.9 per cent above 31
December 2016 ERV. A new Zone A rent of over 700 pounds (909 dollars) per
square foot for The Market Building was achieved this period. Net rental
income was 23.4 million pounds (30.4 million dollars) for the first half of
the year, up 7.4 percent like-for-like compared to the first half of
2016.
Convent Garden welcomes new luxury labels
Capco added that occupancy on the estate remains high at 97 percent.
Building on the success of the gifting and luxury accessories strategy
introduced last year, Capco has further strengthened its offering at the
Royal Opera House Arcade through the signing of luxury sunglasses brand
Linda Farrow which will offer a range of timeless frames, including a pair
exclusive to Covent Garden. This addition joins the curated line-up of
premium retailers already in the Arcade, including Mulberry, The Watch
Gallery as well as N.PEAL and Tom Davies which are due to open shortly.
The latest signing to the Market Building is premium watch brand Daniel
Wellington, who have chosen Covent Garden as the location for their first
UK store. British heritage sportswear brand, Kent & Curwen, will open the
brand’s first store under the partnership of Creative Director, Daniel
Kearns and Business Partner, David Beckham later this year at 12 Floral
Street. The place is anchored by both Paul Smith and British lifestyle
concept Petersham Nurseries who will open within the Floral Court
development.
Capco further said that the transformation of Henrietta Street continues
with a strategy to create a new menswear and dining destination in London.
Luxury men’s shoe brand, Cheaney and Parisian outerwear clothing concept
K-Way opened stores at the beginning of the year. In addition, the latest
signing to the street is eyewear brand Bailey Nelson.

Swatch says profits up in first half 2017




AFP |



Friday, July 21 2017 


 Swiss watchmaker Swatch said Friday that its
profits rose in the first six months, but its performance was dampened by
the
strength of the Swiss franc.

​
"The overvalued Swiss franc dampened growth in the first half of the
year,"
Swatch said in its first half report.
"As in the previous year, the first half of 2017 was characterised by
worldwide turbulence," the report said.


"However, the Swatch Group, with its 20 strong brands and its own retail
network, is very well represented worldwide, and was therefore able to
generate net sales of 3.7 billion Swiss francs (3.3 billion euros, $3.9
billion)."


That represented a fractional decline of 0.3 percent compared with the
corresponding period a year earlier.
At constant exchange rates, sales would have risen by 1.2 percent.
Net profit grew by 6.8 percent to 281 million Swiss francs (254 million
euros), slightly short of analysts' expectations.


Looking ahead, Swatch said it "anticipates very positive growth in local
currency in the second half of the year. In addition to its already strong
own
retail business, wholesale should also develop positively."

Myer cuts profit outlook, deputy CEO steps down




Prachi Singh |



Friday, July 21 2017 


In its May update, Myer Holdings anticipated EBITDA growth to exceed
sales growth in FY2017 and NPAT to be higher than 69.3 million Australian
dollars (54.7 million dollars). However, on the back of continued weakness
in retail trading conditions, particularly in July, the company now
anticipates FY2017 NPAT to be between 66 million and 70 million Australian
dollars (52 to 55 million dollars). Myer anticipates FY2017 implementation
costs (pre-tax) to be between 18 million and 20 million Australian dollars
(14 to 15 million dollars).
Commenting on the update, Myer’s Chief Executive and Managing Director,
Richard Umbers said in a press release: “The period of June – July
stocktake sale has traditionally been an important period of profit
generation for Myer. We are responding to the challenging external
environment in a way that preserves the integrity of the new Myer strategy,
while continuing our focus on efficiency and productivity.”
Myer also announced that the company has decided to write down the full
carrying value of Myer’s 20 percent stake in Austradia, the Australian
franchisee of Topshop Topman of 6.8 million Australian dollars (5.3 million
dollars) and it has been unable to secure a deal on acceptable commercial
terms with UK based brand owner Arcadia Group to allow for the continuation
of Topshop Topman concessions in Myer.
Myer further added that as previously outlined in 1H 2017 and Q3 2017
results, the performance of sass & bide has been challenged during the past
year, so the board has assessed the carrying value and there will be an
impairment charge of 38.8 million Australian dollars (30.7 million
dollars).
Deputy CEO Daniel Bracken leaves Myer
After over two and half years in the role, Daniel Bracken, chief
merchandise and customer officer and deputy CEO has decided to step down
from his position with Myer. The company said, in addition to his line
responsibilities, Bracken played an instrumental role in developing new
Myer, and in particular with the introduction of new brands to Myer.

release.

From July 2010 to November 2012, Kempster was group finance director

Mothercare's UK like-for-like sales rise 1.9 percent in Q1




Prachi Singh |



Thursday, July 20 2017 


UK like-for-like sales at Mothercare, for the 15 week period to July
8 2017 increased 1.9 percent. The company said, it entered the end of
season sale with lower stocks and are achieving a higher sell through rate.
The company’s online sales grew by 3.3 percent but total UK sales were
lower than last year, reflecting on-going store closure programme. Retail
space at the end of the quarter reduced to 1.4m sq. ft., with 147 stores
including 143 Mothercare and four ELC.
Commenting on the first quarter trading update, Mark Newton-Jones, Chief
Executive Officer of Mothercare said in a press release: “We have continued
to make progress in the UK during the period. Whilst online sales recorded
a lower growth, in contrast to higher sales growth in store, we don’t
believe this represents an underlying permanent shift in customer
behaviour. In our international business, the challenging economic
conditions in the Middle East continue and are impacting overall
performance, and so the outlook remains volatile.”
International retail sales were down 8.3 percent in constant currency
and up 2.2 percent in actual currency, primarily driven by continued
weakness in the Middle East. Online sales growth was 53 percent in constant
currency and 78 percent in actual currency.
The company opened 26 stores and closed 43 during the period, mainly
driven by market exits as it consolidated partners, including Kazakhstan,
ending the quarter with 1,133 stores.

customers, according to chief executive Luke Grana, informs the ‘South
China Morning Post’. 
According to the company, their revenue is growing at speed: circa 15
percent every month, with 60 percent of sales coming from its existing
customers, who on average order from Grana three times a year. 
Sources close to the company highlight that Grana is expecting its
appeal with U.S. consumers to help it gain traction in the mainland Chinese
market. The label counts Gigi Hadid, Jessica Alba and Lily Collins among
its early fans in the U.S.
