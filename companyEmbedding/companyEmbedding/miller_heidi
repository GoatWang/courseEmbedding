Why is this contact information displayed? [Close]
The USPTO makes this data available for search by the public so that individuals can locate ownership information for intellectual property, much the same way a county might make real estate property ownership information available.
Since our website is synchronized with the USPTO data, we recommend making any data changes with the USPTO directly. Our website will auto-update when the USPTO data is updated.
You may also contact Trademarkia to make a request for the removal of your personally identifiable information or trademark data.  Such requests must be made in writing and will be subject to verification of ownership.  This policy allows verified trademark owners to specify: (A) that their identifiable information be masked, or (B) that their trademark pages permanently deleted from Trademarkia.com.  
                                                Requests may be made directly to customer.service@trademarkia.com and every effort will be made to honor them within 48 hours.

                        About
                        Heidi Lee Miller                      

                        After looking over Ryan's shoulder and telling him what I want him to design the past 10 years at Mango Ink, I realized it's finally time I start designing myself. I am having a blast and I am so exited to be a part of the Minted Community. I am a mama of three and married to my best friend.

Artist Overlay Cover Image

 
                      (.jpeg, .gif, or .png, must be 1920px x 420px)
                    

                      This photo will appear at the top of your artist
                      overlay, which appears when customers click on your
                      name. Please upload a "cover photo" that reveals your
                      workplace, tools, or a detail or pattern from your work.
                      We'll apply a transparent overlay on top of your image
                      to ensure legibility of your hand-written name and
                      artist information.
                    





Hand-written Name: Black

 
                        (Upload a transparent .png that's 415px x 120px)
                      


                      Please upload a hand-written image of your full name (first and
                      last) on a 100% transparent background. This image will
                      appear on
                      your category page and on the
                      certificate of authenticity for art prints. Your
                      hand-written name will express your identity as an
                      artist and should not use fonts or logos, but can
                      definitely incorporate whimsy.
                      See here for more information on
                      preparing the file and view some examples.
                    





Hand-written Name: White


 
                        (Upload a transparent .png that's 600px x 160px)
                      


                      Please upload a second, white version of your hand-written name.
                      The background should be 100% transparent.
                      See here for more information on
                      preparing the file.
                    





Category Page Image


 
                        (.jpeg, .gif, or .png, must be 450px x 210px)
                      


                      This photo will appear at the top of the category page
                      when customers search for you on the site. Please upload
                      a photograph of yourself, not a logo.
                    






Thank You Note

                    Please write a short note to customers who purchase your
                    designs. This note will be displayed to customers after

                    special personal touch that helps customers remember you.
                    Please do not include your contact info or a URL. This
                    information could create confusion for follow-up customer
                    service.
