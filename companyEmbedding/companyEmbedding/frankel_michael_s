M&A, equity investing and other Strategic Transactions are powerful tools for corporate growth and investment.  As acquisitions become an ever more common tool of corporate growth, and equity investments of various sorts become a more important asset class for investors, it becomes more and more important for corporate executives and investing professionals to hone their skills in identifying and executing these Strategic Transactions.
 
My writing seeks to provide both business executives and developing M&A professionals with the expertise and knowledge to execute Strategic Transactions successfully and effectively.
