Our Values, Mission and VisionOur Values

At the very heart of our company lies the shared values of our team. Working in harmony, our values shape our goals, focus our thoughts, unite our efforts and inspire us to realize our vision and achieve our mission. 

Think Planet We love it … it’s ours and it’s the only one we’ve got. So we better darn well take better care of it! And we plan on doing just that … please feel free to join us! 

Think Business We think of business as a collection of people. Not employees, not users, not managers nor owners. This comes from our desire to see business, like we see the world … people, people, people … and all living things of course. It requires us to be open, compassionate and a global citizen. 

Think Bold The greatest change comes from passion and inspiration, neither of which are dull things. Wild, “out there” ideas can be made reasonable much easier that a tame, uninspired idea can be made great. The likelihood of scoring a touchdown is far greater than falling short of the end zone. 

Think Team Our work is just too complex and multifaceted for any single being to “go it alone”. The Aroga Team is our inner strength. Each team member journeys towards their greatest potential through the help and challenges each other provide. 

Think Long-Term Creating a roadmap for sustainable competitive advantage gives you a better chance of succeeding in the long run. Addressing enduring needs, changes in conditions down the road, and focusing on where you want to end up result in lasting solutions and sustainable success. 

Think Actionable Knowing what to do about something is inexplicably more helpful than merely knowing something. A compelling call to action, followed with clear direction of what comes next, is what people depend on to succeed.

Aroga Starnix is a 18 year old technology company that has been a leading supplier of Linux and open source solutions for mid and large-cap businesses. Our primary line of product offerings includes secure, Linux-based firewall & VPN servers, mail servers, database servers, and backup servers. Starnix continued to realize sustained growth in 2015 with its existing client base, as well as a number of notable additions.
  
For the eighth year in a row, Starnix has renewed maintenance and support contracts with every one of its clients. Of particular note, Starnix has entered into a three year agreement with the Linux Professional Institute - the world's leading vendor-neutral Linux certification body – to continue to maintain the organization's entire exam and certification track. We're pleased with the evolution of our relationship with LPI, enhancing and furthering lifelong professional careers in Linux and source technologies.
 
Of the many projects Starnix completes for its clients every year, a few always stand out due to their impact on the customer's business as a whole as well as the end user. Starnix' projects and clients include:

 
 
Education is a critical path to changing culture and gaining knowledge -- which leads to a greater quality of life. Having worked with education departments across Canada for over 20 years we identified a serious need to provide alternative methods to gaining an education.

In 2015 Aroga -- through its extensive commitment to education and working with the education departments, schools, educators and students -- established the Aroga Academy. Our goal is to support those with disabilities, be it physical, mental or restrictive due to remote locations. There is no other company better situated and understanding of the need for increased education requirements than Aroga Academy.

The Academy, is working with the Durham District School Board (Ontario, Canada) and has obtained over 70 courses that over the next few years will be fully implemented, developed and made available to those seeking an education that otherwise would not be possible.

The Academy will continue to develop over the 2016 & 2017 school years  - adding course content and additional clients (school boards) to provide educational access to more students.

 
 
Aroga Media is a fully certified Google Apps reseller for both Business and Education. The Media division continues to support, promote and build on the Google Apps for Work platform focusing on the products, services available in this incredibly versatile and powerful suite of applications. As a Google Apps reseller, our business plan calls for a focus in both the commercial and educational markets.  We are expanding our offering to offer sell and deploy Chromebooks to further support the educational market. Early in 2016 we completed the process to become authorized to sell Google Apps for Education as well as our present certification for businesses. Although the revenue and margin projections for this line of business are small relative to some of the other companies, we see enormous benefit in having Aroga Media partner with the other Aroga companies for shared services.

 
 
Last year, Aroga identified the need for global expansion and targeted an opportunity to acquire a Google Apps Reseller in Costa Rica. The addition of Proximita not only provides us with a Google Reseller Agreement in Latin America, but we are also excited to be able to explore providing our Assistive Technology products from Aroga Technologies to the Central American marketplace. From Costa Rica we can plan a controlled expansion for Aroga Technologies into the South American market. We are currently evaluating if Proximita can provide us this opportunity for expansion.

Our focus in 2015 was to complete the transaction and work with the existing clients of Proximita. In 2016  we will continue to assess the operations and customer base while ensuring we have the ability to improve the Google Services they experienced with previous ownership.

We will continue to assess Proximita's offerings and market opportunities in 2016 and beyond.

Travel Industry Pros (TIP) Launches New Booking Engine Allowing Subscribers To Save On Hotel Stay At 350,000 Hotels And Resorts



Travel Industry Pros (TIP) is launching a new Hotel and Resort Booking Engine, offering huge savings on Hotels around the world, with a low-price guarantee, and a 30-day free trial subscription offer.

TIP_Hotels BeachSeattle, WA, USA - September 16, 2016 /MarketersMedia/ — Travel Industry Pros (TIP), based out of Florida, USA is about to create a major shakeup in the Hotel and Travel Industry. Everybody likes to travel, but for many traveling on a budget, it can be challenging to find affordable accommodations at 4 and 5 star resorts. Many travelers are relinquished to stay at lower quality hotels, making the vacation and travel experience, less enjoyable, and sometimes even downright disappointing. Everybody likes to save, so even those who are used to staying at 4 and 5 Star Hotels will be able to enjoy savings from hundreds, to even thousands of dollars while on vacation, by booking through TIP’s Booking Engine.

TIP, promises to match subscribers with 4 and 5 Star Hotels and Resorts, at prices that are even lower than those found on some of the major online booking engines. In fact, TIP even offers a price guarantee, and will refund up to $50, if a subscriber finds the exact same accommodation, at a lower price within 24 hours.

While subscription based discount and rewards plans are not a new concept, TIP has reinvented the model to provide something for everyone, and at a much lower subscription cost than other companies. Travel Industry Pros, believes so much in their product, that they are even offering subscribers to try it out for free. Those interested in saving money on Hotel and Resort stay can try out TIP’s Hotel and Resort Booking Engine for free for the first 30 days. During that time, free subscribers can book an unlimited amount of discounted Hotel and Resort accommodations. After the 30 day free trial, if a member decides to continue using the Booking Engine, there will be a monthly subscription of $20.

According to TIP, CEO, Fernando Laguda,TIP fulfills for its distribution network and customers through Airline Promotions, Inc. (API).API, is a full-service ARC and IATA accredited travel agency. At its Fort Lauderdale, Florida, headquarters it maintains its Sabre equipped reservations and in-house customer service. With TIP’s Executive Team’s International leadership and management experience, combined with the API infrastructure and customer service platform, TIPPros will have the ability to support and add over one million customers and affiliates over the coming months.

“We are not just offering a sample of savings on Hotel and Resorts. Our subscribers can actually have unlimited access to our Booking Engine for free, for 30 days, and book as many Hotel and Resort stays as they wish. We are so confident in our ability to save our subscribers considerable money, and we know that they will become lifelong subscribers to our service after their savings experience with TIP.” ~Fernando Laguda, TIP CEO

With his background in creating online affiliate and tracking systems, Fernando Laguda wanted to provide a way for ordinary people to get rewarded for sharing TIP with their friends and family. That led Laguda to develop a social media sharing system, called TipPros that allows subscribers to “click and share” the TIP Booking Engine on Social Media. The system tracks where the shared link originated, and rewards the person who shared the link. Laguda says; “When you tell someone about a great deal at a store, or talk up a great movie, or send your online friends a pic of the wonderful meal you’re eating at a restaurant, none of those businesses reward you for helping them grow. My goal was to create the perfect model that would benefit those looking for savings, and reward those that are responsible for sharing TIP. I believe that we have created the perfect model with our TipPros System.

Travel Industry Pros, and the TipPros platform, have caught the attention of Veteran Internet Marketers like Eric Grant and Chris Cartmill, who co-founded the Technology and Home Business Blog, www.Qastme.com (pronounced: Cast-Me). Eric Grant, an entrepreneur with a 20 year background in marketing and building Global Sales Networks, and Chris Cartmill with an extensive background in SEO and SEM, teamed up several years ago to create a better way to reach out to networkers and individuals interested in making money from home. They’ve built several sales networks into multiple thousands of individuals, utilizing their online skills and methods.
Connect with Eric and Chris

“TIP is a perfect fit for our partners and networks. With the Hotel discounts offered by TIP and the click-and-share platform, everything is much simpler. I don’t have to spend months putting together my own system. Thanks Fernando!” ~Eric Grant, Co-Founder, QastMe.com

There is no other company better situated and understanding of the need for increased education requirements than Aroga Academy.

The Academy, is working with the Durham District School Board (Ontario, Canada) and has obtained over 70 courses that over the next few years will be fully implemented, developed and made available to those seeking an education that otherwise would not be possible.

The Academy will continue to develop over the 2016 & 2017 school years  - adding course content and additional clients (school boards) to provide educational access to more students.

 
 
Aroga Media is a fully certified Google Apps reseller for both Business and Education. The Media division continues to support, promote and build on the Google Apps for Work platform focusing on the products, services available in this incredibly versatile and powerful suite of applications. As a Google Apps reseller, our business plan calls for a focus in both the commercial and educational markets.  We are expanding our offering to offer sell and deploy Chromebooks to further support the educational market. Early in 2016 we completed the process to become authorized to sell Google Apps for Education as well as our present certification for businesses. Although the revenue and margin projections for this line of business are small relative to some of the other companies, we see enormous benefit in having Aroga Media partner with the other Aroga companies for shared services.

 
 
Last year, Aroga identified the need for global expansion and targeted an opportunity to acquire a Google Apps Reseller in Costa Rica. The addition of Proximita not only provides us with a Google Reseller Agreement in Latin America, but we are also excited to be able to explore providing our Assistive Technology products from Aroga Technologies to the Central American marketplace. From Costa Rica we can plan a controlled expansion for Aroga Technologies into the South American market. We are currently evaluating if Proximita can provide us this opportunity for expansion.

Our focus in 2015 was to complete the transaction and work with the existing clients of Proximita. In 2016  we will continue to assess the operations and customer base while ensuring we have the ability to improve the Google Services they experienced with previous ownership.

We will continue to assess Proximita's offerings and market opportunities in 2016 and beyond.

"The leadership skills, recruiting, sales, training and team building capabilities that Steven and his team (Douglas Yates and Ray Stickles) bring to OXO Worldwide and Aroga MLSS ensure our ultimate success. I am thrilled to be working with Steven and the OXO Worldwide Team" stated Grove Bennett, Chairman and CEO of Aroga."This agreement with Aroga is a synergistic and strategic opportunity for OXO Worldwide, allowing us to work with a well-established market leader with over 28 years history in education, sales, marketing and distribution.  It will increase our global customer reach, as the leader in NWM.

Common questions

What's the difference between a C corporation and an S corporation?
The IRS allows corporations to choose to be taxed as either a "C corporation" or an "S corporation." Income from C corporations are subject to double taxation; that is, the corporation pays taxes on its net income and then the shareholders also pay taxes on the income that they receive from the corporation.S corporations have only one level of taxation. The shareholders still have to pay taxes on money that they receive from the corporation, but an S corporation does not pay taxes on its net income. While the S corporation is popular among small business owners, C corporations have greater tax planning flexibility.


How does a corporation protect my personal assets?
If a business operates as a corporation, the business owners, called shareholders, are not personally liable for debts or other claims against the corporation. That's because the corporation is a separate legal entity from its owners. If a corporation complies with the formalities required for it to be treated as a separate legal entity, then anyone seeking to collect a debt from, or enforce a claim against, a corporation, would not be able to collect from the shareholders themselves. They would only be able to pursue the assets held in the name of the corporation.


Why do many people choose to form their corporation in Delaware?
Delaware is a very popular place in which to form corporations. However, the primary benefits apply to larger public corporations or those planning to go public. Delaware's laws provide heightened protection for board members against lawsuits brought by shareholders, and Delaware has a court exclusively dedicated to resolving corporate disputes. These benefits don't mean much to smaller corporations. Keep in mind that if a corporation forms in Delaware and does business in another state, the corporation would be required to file additional paperwork, and pay any taxes and/or fees required to do business in that state. Given those factors, many smaller corporations keep it simple and form in the state in which they plan to do business.


What is an EIN?
An employer identification number (EIN), also known as a federal tax identification number, is used to identify a business entity for tax purposes. It's like a Social Security number, but for a business. In general, most businesses need an EIN. The only reason a business would not get an EIN is if it has only one owner, elects to be treated as a sole proprietor for tax purposes, and does not want to open a separate business bank account. In this case, the owner would use their Social Security number as the business identifier. However, there are disadvantages to this approach, namely the risk of liability.


How are LLCs taxed?
Unlike a corporation, LLCs have some flexibility in how they're taxed. Depending on how many members and the type of tax treatment the owner selects, the LLC can be taxed as either a corporation, partnership or as part of the owner's personal tax return (called a "disregarded entity"). By default, an LLC with two or more members are taxed as a partnership, unless they file an IRS Form 8832 to elect to be treated as a corporation. If the LLC has only one owner, it will be taxed as a sole proprietor, unless the owner files Form 8832. It's not necessary to decide which tax treatment until after your business is formed. You have up to 12 months to decide and can speak to an accountant if you need help making this decision.


What is a registered agent?
A registered agent (sometimes called a resident agent or statutory agent) is a person or business authorized to accept important legal documents on behalf of a business. States require businesses to provide the name of their registered agent at the time they form their business entity. While you can be your own registered agent, there are disadvantages. You have to be available during regular business hours and your information goes on the public record. If you miss a filing deadline, you risk being fined or shut down. Our registered agent service can ensure you receive important business documents, sort through junk mail and keep your information private.


Is a corporation right for me?
It depends on many factors. Get help deciding by answering a few questions here.

The LegalZoom 3-step process was developed by attorneys from some of the most prestigious law firms in America. There are no complex instructions to follow and nothing to download or print. Simply answer a few questions and get started on
              setting up your corporation.

Here's how it works:

Complete the Incorporation Questionnaire
						Complete our simple questionnaire. With LegalZoom, you can choose to form a new corporation or incorporate an existing business. You can also select provisions to help you guard against personal liability.
We Create and File Your Incorporation Papers
						We create and file the Articles of Incorporation (or, in some states, the "Certificate of Formation" or "Certificate of Incorporation") with the Secretary of State (or in some states, the "Department of State" or "Corporation Commission"). We even create company-specific bylaws and organizational minutes.
Final Wrap-Up
						When we receive your filed Articles of Incorporation back from the state, we send them to you along with the rest of your formation documents, as well as easy instructions regarding next steps.

Common questions

What's the difference between a C corporation and an S corporation?
The IRS allows corporations to choose to be taxed as either a "C corporation" or an "S corporation." Income from C corporations are subject to double taxation; that is, the corporation pays taxes on its net income and then the shareholders also pay taxes on the income that they receive from the corporation.S corporations have only one level of taxation. The shareholders still have to pay taxes on money that they receive from the corporation, but an S corporation does not pay taxes on its net income. While the S corporation is popular among small business owners, C corporations have greater tax planning flexibility.


How does a corporation protect my personal assets?
If a business operates as a corporation, the business owners, called shareholders, are not personally liable for debts or other claims against the corporation. That's because the corporation is a separate legal entity from its owners. If a corporation complies with the formalities required for it to be treated as a separate legal entity, then anyone seeking to collect a debt from, or enforce a claim against, a corporation, would not be able to collect from the shareholders themselves. They would only be able to pursue the assets held in the name of the corporation.


Why do many people choose to form their corporation in Delaware?
Delaware is a very popular place in which to form corporations. However, the primary benefits apply to larger public corporations or those planning to go public. Delaware's laws provide heightened protection for board members against lawsuits brought by shareholders, and Delaware has a court exclusively dedicated to resolving corporate disputes. These benefits don't mean much to smaller corporations. Keep in mind that if a corporation forms in Delaware and does business in another state, the corporation would be required to file additional paperwork, and pay any taxes and/or fees required to do business in that state. Given those factors, many smaller corporations keep it simple and form in the state in which they plan to do business.


What is an EIN?
An employer identification number (EIN), also known as a federal tax identification number, is used to identify a business entity for tax purposes. It's like a Social Security number, but for a business. In general, most businesses need an EIN. The only reason a business would not get an EIN is if it has only one owner, elects to be treated as a sole proprietor for tax purposes, and does not want to open a separate business bank account. In this case, the owner would use their Social Security number as the business identifier. However, there are disadvantages to this approach, namely the risk of liability.


How are LLCs taxed?
Unlike a corporation, LLCs have some flexibility in how they're taxed. Depending on how many members and the type of tax treatment the owner selects, the LLC can be taxed as either a corporation, partnership or as part of the owner's personal tax return (called a "disregarded entity"). By default, an LLC with two or more members are taxed as a partnership, unless they file an IRS Form 8832 to elect to be treated as a corporation. If the LLC has only one owner, it will be taxed as a sole proprietor, unless the owner files Form 8832. It's not necessary to decide which tax treatment until after your business is formed. You have up to 12 months to decide and can speak to an accountant if you need help making this decision.


What is a registered agent?
A registered agent (sometimes called a resident agent or statutory agent) is a person or business authorized to accept important legal documents on behalf of a business. States require businesses to provide the name of their registered agent at the time they form their business entity. While you can be your own registered agent, there are disadvantages. You have to be available during regular business hours and your information goes on the public record. If you miss a filing deadline, you risk being fined or shut down. Our registered agent service can ensure you receive important business documents, sort through junk mail and keep your information private.


Is a corporation right for me?
It depends on many factors. Get help deciding by answering a few questions here.
