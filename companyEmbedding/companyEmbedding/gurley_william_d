They complete four years of training in a podiatric medical school and three years of hospital residency training. This training is similar to that of other doctors. Podiatrists can specialize in many fields, including surgery, sports medicine, wound care, pediatrics, and diabetic care. Feet are complex anatomical structures, all-in-one stabilizers, shock absorbers, and propulsion engines that are instrumental to overall health and well-being. They require expert care. Be sure you’re seeing the most qualified health-care professional to treat your feet by a Doctor of Podiatric Medicine (DPM). The DPM means a physician has completed years of extensive foot and ankle medical and surgical training in podiatric medical school and hospital-based residency training, making him uniquely qualified to care for your specialized needs. Both Podiatrists at Orthopedic Associates are Board Certified by the American Board of Foot and Ankle Surgery.Primary Care*Please be aware that many insurance carriers require you to have a referral (authorization from your primary care physician) before treatment is provided by a specialist, such as an orthopedist. Please check with your insurance carrier if you have any questions about your plan.Diabetic Foot CareNeurologistsCarpal Tunnel SyndromeRadiologistX-RaysComputed TomographyMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a test that uses a magnetic field and pulses of radio wave energy to make pictures of organs and structures inside the body. In many cases, MRI gives different information about structures in the body than can be seen with an X-ray, ultrasound, or computed tomography (CT) scan. MRI also may show problems that cannot be seen with other imaging methods.UltrasoundMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is done for many reasons. It is used to find problems such as tumors, bleeding, injury, blood vessel diseases, or infection. MRI also may be done to provide more information about a problem seen on an X-ray, ultrasound scan, or CT scan. Contrast material may be used during MRI to show abnormal tissue more clearly. An MRI scan can be done for the...MRIFor an MRI test, the area of the body being studied is placed inside a special machine that contains a strong magnet. Pictures from an MRI scan are digital images that can be saved and stored on a computer for more study. The images also can be reviewed remotely, such as in a clinic or an operating room. In some cases, contrast material may be used during the MRI scan to show certain structures more clearly.SurgeonsGeneral SurgeryPhysician Assistants (P.A.s) are licensed healthcare professionals who practice medicine with physician supervision. As part of the physician/P.A. team, P.A.s diagnose and treat illnesses and injuries. They deliver a broad range of medical and surgical services to diverse populations in both rural and urban settings throughout the United States. Their focus is patient care, which may include education, research, and administrative activities. P.A.s can treat patients when the physician is away from the practice and can write prescriptions.OrthopedicsOrthopedics is the branch of medicine that deals with the prevention and correction of injuries or disorders of the skeletal system and associated muscles, joints, and ligaments.ArthroscopyArthroscopy (also called arthroscopic surgery) is a minimally invasive surgical procedure on a joint in which an examination and sometimes treatment of damage is performed using anarthroscope, an endoscope that is inserted into the joint through a small incision. Arthroscopic procedures can be performed to evaluate or treat many orthopaedic conditions including torn cartilage (known by doctors as "meniscus"), torn surface (articular) cartilage, ACL reconstruction, and trimming damaged cartilage. The advantage over traditional open surgery is that the joint does not have tobe opened upfully. For knee arthroscopy only two small incisions are made, one for the arthroscope and one for the surgical instruments tobe used in the knee cavity. This reduces recovery time and may increase the rate of success due to less trauma to the connective tissue. Itis especially useful for professional athletes, who frequently injure knee joints and require fast healing time. There isalso less scarring, because of the smaller incisions. Irrigation fluid is used to distend the joint and make a surgical space. Sometimes this fluid leaks (extravasates) into the surrounding soft tissue, causing edema.Wound CareAnkle SurgeryJoint ReplacementTotal joint replacement means replacing both sides of the surface of a joint. In the knee it means replacing both the thin cartilage surface on the lower joint surface which is the tibia, and the upper joint surface which is the femur. Also, the joint surface under the kneecap is replaced. This requires removing the thin cartilage surface and a thin surface of bone for replacement with a metal and plastic surface. This allows all movement of the joint to occur between the metal and plastic parts rather than the raw bone left by arthritis.Orthopedic SurgerySport and exercise medicine doctors are specialist physicians who have completed medical school, appropriate residency training and then specialize further in sports medicine or 'sports and exercise medicine' (the preferred term). Specialization in sports medicine may be a doctor's first specialty (as in Australia, Netherlands, Norway, Italy). It may also be a sub-specialty or second specialisation following a specialisation such as physiatry or orthopedic surgery. The various approaches reflect the medical culture in different countries.ArthroscopyKnee ReplacementRaymond Reeves has a story that had to be told.

It can be injected into areas of the body that have become inflamed from overuse, injury, or arthritis, with significant relief of symptom. Common areas for injection include the major joints such as hips, knees, or shoulders for arthritis or bursitis. Other problem areas such as tennis elbow, trigger finger, carpal tunnel syndrome or plantar fasciitis in the foot are common sites for injection. Cortisone injections usually work within a few days and the effects can last for several weeks. Often physicians do not want to give more than three cortisone injections at least 3 months apart. If the response is not helpful, repeating it may not be worthwhile.EndocrinologistDiabetes CarePhysical TherapistsSports Medicine» Orthopedic Associates PA Farmington New Mexico - Providing Total Joint Replacement and Revision, Sports Medicine, and Foot and Ankle ReconstructionOrthotics and Prosthetic TherapyFlatfoot CorrectionAnkle SprainPhysical TherapySynvisc is a different kind of treatment for patients with OA (OsteoArthritis) of the knee that actually replaces damaged knee fluid in the knee joint. Only your doctor can decide if Synvisc is a good option for you if mild exercise and physical therapy or simple pain relievers like acetaminophen or other anti-inflammatory medications haven’t given enough relief. It is administered directly into the knee, one injection a week for three weeks. It may reduce OA knee pain for up to 6 months, with maximum relief usually 6-8 weeks after the series. Some people may begin to experience pain relief after the first injection of Synvisc, however all three injections are recommended for maximum benefit.Tennis ElbowSend to PhoneGurley, William D, MD2300 E 30th St, Farmington, NM 87401(505) 327-1400Send this business listing as a text message to a mobile phone.I agree to the Terms and ConditionsCancelSendYour text message was sent.To opt out at anytime, send the word STOP to YP411.To get a help message, send the word HELP to YP411.There was an error sending your text.Please try again.E-MailGurley, William D, MD2300 E 30th St, Farmington, NM 87401(505) 327-1400Send this business details to yourself or up to 5 friends.Up to 5 email addresses, separate addresses with a commaSend Yourself a CopyCancelSend

Orthopedic Surgery 

                                Being an orthopedic surgeon in New Mexico, Dr. Gurley is qualified to treat and diagnose all forms of damage to the musculoskeletal system, such as the bones, ligaments, tendons, muscles, and joints. Following a diagnosis, Dr. Gurley will typically prescribe surgery when less-invasive treatments have failed to produce the desired results or have been ruled out. Patients might need the care and attention of an orthopedic surgeon for sports injuries, sprains, torn ligaments, fractures, and more.
