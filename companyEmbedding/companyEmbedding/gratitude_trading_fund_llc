About Us
Gratitude Trading Fund, LLC and Gratitude Trading Management, LLC are both start-up companies.  The Gratitude ownership team is comprised of both Ethiopian and American citizens and is sister company to, Edel Import & Export, PLC, located in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.  The ownership of Edel Import & Export, PLC is comprised of Ethiopian American citizens.
Gratitude Trading and Edel are in the business of exporting agricultural and agricultural-related products from Ethiopia to the United States, Asia and Middle Eastern markets.  Specifically, the company is focused first on the purchase, transport and sale of sesame seed to the Ethiopian Commodities Exchange (ECX) during the six-month growing season from October through March.  Additionally, the company is focused on sales and export of coffee to the U.S. and other markets.
Gratitude Trading and Edel are also exporting household products from the U.S. to Ethiopia for sale in retail outlets, starting initially in Ethiopia’s capital, Addis Ababa. Over the medium term, the companies – working closely with the Ethiopian government – are building coalitions with other U.S.-based companies for the purpose of determining the feasibility of processing and packaging of food for use inside and outside Ethiopia.

These companies were all born of the original idea of Aderajew “Eddie” Yeshiwas of developing leadership in the youth of Ethiopia and a desire to fund that humanitarian effort. To this end, 10% of company profits will eventually go towards funding Ethiopian Journey, which will be a non-profit 501-c3C corporation.
The primary Management Team of Gratitude consists of:
Aderajew “Eddie” Yeshiwas, CEO, was born in Gonder, Ethiopia, in an area of Ethiopia that grows high quality sesame. He immigrated to the United States in 2005 after winning a Diversity Visa lottery.  After arriving in the U.S., Eddie enrolled in Colorado Christian University in Denver, Colorado, graduating with a B.A. in Organizational Management in Christian Leadership. He founded a transportation company, Mirus Limousine Service, LLC, in 2010. He led the Ethiopian Christian Young Adult Association (ANDLEB) for 6 years. During these years, Eddie formed the concept of Ethiopian Journey, a non-profit organization for developing leadership qualities in Ethiopian youth.   The ultimate goal of Ethiopian Journey is “Raising a Generation with a Purpose”. One of the goals of Gratitude Traders, LLC is to fund Ethiopian Journey.
Lance Fenske, President is Co-Owner of Empowered Global Solutions, INC., an employment company that specializes in placing employees with government agencies. He is a retired manager of Data Centers for IBM and the regional telephone company USWest. Lance is past President of several church boards and met Eddie at a Leadership Training Seminar in 2011.
Duane Reed is President of CEO Focus, a consulting and training firm that specializes in working with executives in developing and established businesses. He is also board member of the Global Food Initiative, a company devoted to placing emergency food and survival resources in 86 locations all over the world, positioning them for disaster response.
David S. Banks was most recently Vice President of Investor Relations for DigitalGlobe, Inc., the leading provider of earth imagery and analysis, sourced from a proprietary constellation of earth-observation satellites, a role he held since 2010. Prior to joining DigitalGlobe, he was Vice President of Investor Relations at Fiserv, Inc. in Brookfield, Wisconsin. He led Investor Relations and Corporate Communications activities for First Data, Corp. from 2000-2005, and spent 13 years with US WEST in both Investor Relations and Corporate Communications.
David is currently serving in his second term as President of the Rocky Mountain Chapter of NIRI, a role he has held since May of 2014. David is a graduate of the University of Northern Colorado.
