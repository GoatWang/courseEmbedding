Testimonials




“I noticed a rough quarter-inch patch of skin on my forehead that would not go away. The texture felt different enough to visit a dermatologist. The doctor told me the skin had a 10% chance of being cancerous and suggested freezing it off. I was warned that the procedure would cause pain and sensitivity for a week, then develop into a bump for the next ten days, and finally turn into a month-long scab. I went ahead and told the doctor to freeze it off that day. 

When I returned home, I immediately put CellerateRX gel on the wound. Using my finger I applied the gel and noticed the pain went away in a very short period of time.  I did this every morning when I woke up. The gel stayed on open and uncovered for the entire day. The area never got red or had any inflammation and in two days a very reasonable scab formed that was nowhere near as ugly as the doctor suggested. In just two weeks the scab fell off in the shower with absolutely no scarring. CellerateRX made a normal six-week healing process last just two weeks. 

Without getting into a long, drawn out story, I heard about Wound Management 
Technologies and CellerateRX at a conference in San Francisco, listened to the story, and went online and bought some product. After my experience I believe CellerateRX can fix it all!”


Steve Handy, CFO and CTO of Elite Financial Communications Group, LLC


”I have been using CellerateRx since 2005.  I can say for certain, that this one product revolutionized my wound healing to a cost-effective and patient compliant model from one of high-end product use and low-cost effectiveness.  The ease and use of the product mandates that every wound clinician have this as part of their own arsenal against every violation of the skin, from head to toe.  I can also say that without CellerateRX on some of my patients, I am not sure if they would have healed the way they did.”


Eric J. Lullove, DPM FACCWS, FAPWCA


“About a year ago I was trying to deal with a wound on my foot that refused to heal. As the weeks went by with no improvement I began to lose hope. An acquaintance who is an R.N., who’s specialty has been advanced wound care for the last 40 years heard about my wound, and suggested I mention CellerateRX to my doctor. The way she described her experiences with it sounded to good to be true; but at the point it was added to my regimen everything began to improve. Every time the bandage was changed I could see improvement, and finally, complete healing. A few months ago a nearby area sustained a new wound. This time CellerateRX was was part of the treatment from the beginning. In little more than a week I observed the wound fill and close. Phenomenal! I’ve told every doctor I know about CellerateRX. I’ve never done that before, but real miracles in medicine are few and far between. Please feel free to use this to to tell other people about this great product.”


Charles Silbert
				Consumer


“I think that CellerateRX® is a fantastic  product! I have a patient that I have treated five times in the last two years  for skin tears. When she gets one she always manages to do the job well. The  first skin tear was on her leg and was 8cm long and 2 - 3cm wide. It was almost  1cm deep. On this little 100 lb lady that is pretty large. Thanks to CellerateRX®  it healed within two 1/2 weeks. This is a 104 year old lady with skin that is  so frail and fragile that you can hardly tell if she has any subcutaneous  tissue, as well as any adipose tissue. Healing any skin tear on this patient is  a challenge. Fortunately for us we have CellerateRX® on our formulary. Great  product!!”


Ramona Maldonado LVN
				Treatment Nurse


"We have found CellerateRX® to be an excellent wound healing modality and use it regularly in our practice.  The clinical results we have observed have validated the science behind the product.  I would highly recommend CellerateRX® to any conscientious wound care provider."
Desmond P. Bell, Jr., DPM, CWS, FACCWS, FAPWCA
				Director of First Coast Diabetic Foot & Wound Management Center, Jacksonville, FL;
				Co-Founder & President of Save a Leg - Save a Life (SALSAL) Foundation

"I have been using CellerateRX® in my wound care protocols for over 5 years now and it is an essential part of my wound care treatments for success. I am excited to be able to show practitioners the many ways CellerateRX® can be used in their wound care practice, especially with difficult or challenging wounds such as diabetic ulcers."
Jane Fore, MD, FAPWCA, FACCWS
				Medical Director, Tri-State Wound Care & Hyperbaric Center, Clarkston, WA

"I was impressed by the speed and efficacy of CellerateRX®. Diabetic ulcers remain one of the biggest problems and challenges that we face in healthcare today, both in terms of economic expenditures and patient welfare. Most amputations begin with an ulcer, so having a product that can help manage these wounds more effectively will save limbs and resources."
Matt Regulski, DPM
				Ocean County Foot & Ankle Surgical Associates & Director of the Wound Care Center of Ocean County, Toms River, NJ

"I just want to let you know how pleased we are having your product CellerateRX® available to use in our clinic. We have seen excellent success with both the gel and powder when treating the most complicated wounds among our veterans. It is a product that I have found to be cost effective, clinically effective and patient friendly. Certainly a unique product in the market."

CellerateRX & Burns

A burn is an injury caused by heat, electricity, light, radiation, or friction.  1st and 2nd degree burns may be managed at home or in a healthcare facility.  Proper management of burns is important as they are painful, can result in scarring, and can lead to serious complications.

CellerateRX gel is ideal for management of 1st and 2nd degree burns.  It has been shown to occlude nerve endings which results in a reduction in wound pain.1  Collagen has also been shown to minimize the potential for scarring.

Suggested application for burns:

Apply the gel to cover the burn
Cover with a non-stick dressing if desired.  It is not necessary to use a cover dressing.  As the aqueous component of the gel evaporates, it cools the site.  The remaining hydrolyzed collagen film forms an occlusive barrier that protects the wound.


Re-application: (every 2-3 days or as desired)

Apply more gel to the burn.  CellerateRX is biodegradable and does not need to be removed from the wound.

WOUND MANAGEMENT TECHNOLOGIES, INC.   WNDM     Wound Management Technologies, Inc. is an emerging commercial stage company with its primary products in the $5B worldwide advanced wound care market. Wound Management's primary focus is the distribution of its unique, patented collagen product, CellerateRX®, which is FDA cleared and reimbursable under Medicare Part B. Wound Management has other advanced biotech products in development including a patented resorbable bone wax line that is in late stages of development, as well as a subsidiary focused on technology for secure healthcare communications, data collaboration and storage.  Rapid revenue growth is projected from our leading FDA cleared CellerateRX wound care products, which recent market and clinical validations show to be clinically cost effective with broad uses. CellerateRX has a competitive proprietary feature and performance advantages over other collagen-based products. It is available in powder (95% collagen) and gel (65%) forms that don't need special handling (like refrigeration). It is active in all 4 phases of wound healing. As CellerateRX revenues grow, the company is positioned to become cash flow positive and profitable in 12-18 months.   CellerateRx Activated Collagen targets a multi-billion dollar domestic and international wound care market with over 60% profit margins. A large part of the growth in the wound care markets is from diabetic ulcers.  In people with compromised health or circulation, the difference in wound healing can be significant. You can read through numerous evidence-based studies on the www.celleraterx.com website.    Wound Management Activates Orthopedic Business; Partner Chosen to Develop Products Based on its Patent; Initial License Fee Received  FORT WORTH, Texas, November 11, 2011 PRNewswire-FirstCall - Wound Management Technologies, Inc., (OTCQB: WNDM | WNDM.PK) a leading innovator in advanced wound care solutions, today announced that its subsidiary, Resorbable Orthopedic Products, LLC, has entered into a Development and License Agreement with Newport Beach, CA-based BioStructures, LLC to develop products for bone remodeling in the human skeletal system based on ROP's patent.  BioStructures has paid ROP an initial $100K licensing fee and the agreement calls for ROP to receive additional license fees as well as royalties on sales throughout the life of the patent.  Under this contract, minimum royalties will begin in 2013 and last until 2023. Initial commercial sales from this business are expected in 2013. "This transaction allows us to combine our portfolio of proprietary biomaterials with a patented resorbable wax carrier.  The combination of these products will further enhance the dynamic product lineup of BioStructures," said Russell Cook, CEO of BioStructures, LLC. "We are pleased to have reached a license agreement with BioStructures to develop many of the orthopedic products related to Resorbable Orthopedic Products' patent on resorbable bone wax and bone void fillers. This agreement is the first commercial agreement for our subsidiary ROP and marks the start of a second product line for WNDM," said Deborah Hutchinson, president of Wound Management Technologies.  "We believe that BioStructures is the right partner to develop and market these important orthopedic products and we look forward to strong success of these products in the marketplace." ROP's patent was developed by WNDM advisor Barry Constantine and his associates and was acquired by WNDM in 2009. Mr. Constantine will oversee ROP's development responsibilities with BioStructures.  "Commercialization of the BioStructures product containing the ROP technology in addition to the development and commercialization of other embodiments within the ROP patent advances the practice of orthopedic surgery," said Barry Constantine. "We are excited to see our technology move into product development with BioStructures." Resorbable Orthopedic Products may commercialize additional products covered by the patent, including a resorbable orthopedic hemostat (resorbable bone wax), a resorbable orthopedic hemostat antimicrobial dressing and products for the veterinary market.

CellerateRX & Skin Care

There are approximately 39 million people in the United States over the age of 65 and this number is projected to grow to 86.7 million by 2050.1  This age group has specific challenges as related to wound care, one of which is skin tears.
The skin is the largest organ of the body and has many important functions.  It protects from the environment, helps control body temperature, assists in controlling fluid and electrolyte imbalance, and contains nerve receptors.  Skin changes are among the most visible signs of aging and also among the most problematic for the elderly.
With aging, the outer skin layer thins and changes in the connective tissue reduce the skins' strength and elasticity.  This increases the risk for a skin tear, which is a traumatic wound resulting from the separation of the skin layers.  Rubbing, pulling, or even the simple act of removing a band aid may result in a skin tear.
Tears can be problematic as aging skin repairs itself more slowly and wound healing may be much slower.  This can contribute to pressure ulcer and infections.  Diabetes, cardiac conditions, poor nutritional status, and lowered immunity can also affect healing.
CellerateRX®, advanced wound collagen powder or gel, has been shown to be a very effective product in managing these challenging skin tears in the elderly as evidenced by a study in this population, "CellerateRX® (Activated Collagen) Skin Tear Study: Completed Evaluation".1    It included skin tears as well as severe skin flaps.  A majority were resolved within a week, with just one treatment.  This study supports the role of CellerateRX in the resolution of skin tears.
Here is what a treatment nurse in a long term care facility who deals with these challenges on a regular basis had to say,





"I think that CellerateRX is a fantastic product! I have a patient that I have treated five times in the last 2 years for skin tears. When she gets one she always manages to do the job well. The first skin tear was on her leg and was 8cm long and 2 - 3cm wide. It was almost 1cm deep. On this little 100 lb lady that is pretty large. Thanks to CellerateRX it healed within 2 1/2 weeks. This is a 104 year old lady with skin that is so frail and fragile that you can hardly tell if she has any subcutaneous tissue, as well as any adipose tissue. Healing any skin tear on this patient is a challenge. Fortunately for us we have CellerateRX on our formulary. Great product!"
CellerateRX is ideal for management of these difficult and challenging tears for people both in facilities and for those who are at home managing their own care.
