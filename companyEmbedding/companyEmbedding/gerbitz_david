Mr. Gerbitz will lead Pandora’s Revenue Operations team, which includes Sales Operations, Pricing & Yield Management and Advertising Operations. He joins Pandora after successful stints with several major technology leaders, including Microsoft and Amazon, and was most recently Vice President of Global Mid-Market and Small Medium Business Sales at Yahoo. Mr. Gerbitz is an expert at managing complex and fast-growing sales operations at scale, and his addition will further deepen Pandora’s strong expertise and experience in this area.
