Company History: 
Safety Components International, Inc. (SCI) is a major supplier of components for automotive airbags. SCI sells airbag fabric in the United States and sells cushions to airbag module integrators around the world. The company's products, which include cushions for passenger, driver, and side impact airbags and knee protection curtains, are found in over 200 models of cars and trucks. Airbag products account for about 90 percent of sales. 
The company also produces a variety of specialized synthetic fabrics for use in defense, aerospace, oil, and other industries. Applications include filtration, military tents, high-end luggage (used in Hartman and Tumi brands), and clothing for firefighters. 
U.S. manufacturing facilities account for half of sales; Safety Components also has plants in Mexico, the United Kingdom, Germany, and the Czech Republic, and farms out some work to contractors in Germany and Romania. It produces about two million airbag cushions per month. The company maintains technical centers in South Carolina, Mexico, and Germany. Safety Components underwent a prearranged Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 2000, selling off ammunition supplier Valentec Systems, Inc. 
Origins 
Safety Components International, Inc. (SCI) was formed on January 12, 1994, as a wholly owned subsidiary of Valentec International Corporation, a contractor for the defense, aerospace, and automotive industries. Valentec CEO Robert A. Zummo became SCI's first chairman, president, and CEO. 
Zummo had in 1993 bought Valentec International Corp. from Insilco Corp., a Big Board-listed U.S. defense contractor based in Meriden, Connecticut, that had acquired Valentec eight years earlier. Based in St. Louis with subsidiaries in Florida and Ohio, Valentec produced metal components such as ammunition cartridges, link belts, and projectiles used by the military, mostly for target practice. 
Valentec also made miniature parachutes for ordnance. This experience led to a contract supplying TRW with fabric for automotive airbags. After Zummo acquired the company, the airbag business was spun off as Safety Components International. The company completed an initial public offering on the NASDAQ (ticker: ABAG) in May 1994. 
SCI was based in Costa Mesa, California. It produced projectiles and other ammunition components at a factory in Galion, Ohio. In September 1994, SCI won a two-year, $65 million contract to supply the U.S. Army with 120 mm mortar cartridges as a prime contractor. 
SCI grew rapidly. Eventually the company began sewing the airbag fabric into airbag cushions itself. Sales were $7 million in 1992. For an 11-month fiscal year ended March 31, 1994, they were up to $22.4 million. Sales reached $51.8 million in 1995, with net income of $2.1 million. Sales for the automotive division nearly tripled to $43 million. 
Although SCI faced increasing competition, demand for airbags was growing considerably in world markets. The introduction of side impact airbags produced more demand for SCI's components. TRW was the company's only automotive airbag customer until September 1995, when SCI won a large contract to supply airbag material to Delphi Interior and Lighting for passenger side airbags in GM trucks. Neither of these were exclusive arrangements; both TRW and Delphi supplied a portion of their own airbag fabric. 
Growing Globally in the Mid-1990s 
The company's Mexican plant was producing 2.6 million airbag cushions a year. A research and development center was set up there in 1995. A joint venture was established in China in 1995 but was ended after four years. SCI also had a U.K. facility in Gwent, Wales, which subcontracted work to a plant in the Czech Republic; these operations produced 800,000 airbags a year. 
In 1996 the company established its own direct sales force. It had retained an outside marketing firm, Champion Sales & Service Co., since 1992. At this time, SCI had nearly 800 employees in the Automotive Division and 100 in the Defense Division. 
An 80 percent share of Phoenix Airbag GmbH, based in Hildesheim, Germany, was acquired in 1996 for about $22 million, plus up to an additional $7.5 million if it met certain financial targets. The remaining shares were to be acquired later. Phoenix had sales of $30 million a year. 
The deal made SCI Europe's leading independent airbag producer. Building its low cost manufacturing capacity, in April 1996 the company began work on a 100,000-square-foot office and manufacturing facility in the Czech Republic. 
Valentec International Corporation, SCI's largest shareholder since its founding, was acquired in May 1997. Valentec made stamped and machined metal parts used in airbag inflators as well as in ammunition for the military. 
Later in 1997, SCI bought the airbag fabrics business of Collins & Aikman Corp.'s JPS Automotive L.P. Unit for $56.3 million plus assumption of $650,000 in debt. Collins & Aikman had acquired JPS only a few months earlier. JPS's Air Restraint and Technical Fabrics Group dominated the airbags fabric business in North America, with 40 percent of the market; chief customers included TRW (which accounted for 47 percent of fiscal 1997 sales), AlliedSignal, and AutoLiv Inc. It was renamed Safety Components Fabric Technologies after the purchase. 
SCI also bought a 350,000-square-foot building next to the JPS site in Greenville, South Carolina, for about $1.25 million. The company also relocated its headquarters to Greenville from Costa Mesa, California. 
Bolstered by the JPS buy, SCI's sales rose from $84 million in 1997 to more than $200 million in 1998. SCI claimed about 50 percent of the North American market for both outsourced airbag fabric and outsourced airbag cushions. 
Research firm Tier One reported that 87.7 million airbag modules were sold worldwide in 1997, versus 3.6 million in 1991. Increasing airbag use in Europe and Asia was expected to push demand to 158 million modules by 2000. In addition, U.S. legislation required the installation of driver and passenger side airbags in all new passenger cars by model year 1998, and in light trucks and other vehicles by model year 1999. 
The market was also growing increasingly competitive, however, and the company began to lose money--$48.7 million in the 1999 and 2000 fiscal years. SCI's common stock was delisted from the NASDAQ in February 2000. The company then began trading shares over the counter. 
Reorganized 2000 
Safety Components filed for bankruptcy protection in April 2000 and emerged from the prearranged Chapter 11 reorganization six months later. In September 2000, the company sold defense contractor Valentec Systems, Inc. to an investor group led by its president, Victor Guadagno, for $4.15 million. Valentec Systems, picked up in the 1997 purchase of Valentec International, had been SCI's only non-automotive unit. 
SCI resolved to dispose of its metal and defense businesses in October 2000. Valentec Wells, LLC, a metal belt link business, was sold to an Alliant Techsystems ((ATK) subsidiary in September 2001 for about $5 million. Valentec Wells had earlier in the year relocated from Costa Mesa, to plants in Ohio and Missouri, partly due to problems with California's power supply. Galion, Inc., an Ohio-based defense business, was sold to an affiliate of The Diversified Group Incorporated in December 2002 for $454,000. 
In November 2001, Safety Components, through its U.K. subsidiary Automotive Safety Components International Limited, acquired Woodville Airbag Engineering from Smiths Group plc subsidiary TISPP UK Limited in November 2001. SCI paid £3 million for it. Woodville, based in South Derbyshire, England, was losing more than £1 million a year but had a large backlog. SCI soon transferred much of Woodville's work to the Czech Republic and other locations with lower wage costs. A plan to close SCI's plant in Crumlin, Wales, was announced in August 2002. 
SCI then had two main divisions. The North American Automotive Group was made up of Safety Component Fabric Technologies, Inc. (SCFTI) and Automotive Safety Components International, Inc. (ASCI). The European Automotive Group included Automotive Safety Components International Limited (Wales, U.K.), Automotive Safety Components International GmbH & Co. KG (Hildesheim, Germany), and Automotive Safety Components International s.r.o. (Jevicko, Czech Republic). 
SCI reported sales of $244.3 million for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2003. Holding company Zapata Corporation accumulated an 83 percent interest in Safety Components in 2004. SCI subsequently changed its fiscal year to coincide with that of Zapata, ending December 31.

Armor AP

For decades, fire departments choosing outer shells made of 40% DuPont™ 
Nomex®/60% DuPont™ Kevlar® have been limited to stiff and uncomfortable gear. 
Utilizing the groundbreaking Filament Twill Technology™ used in PBI Max, Safety 
Components developed Armor AP™ to fill the needs of firefighters who prefer 
improved mobility, improved durability, and lightweight protection at an 
economical price. 




Twill Weave Design

Our innovative Twill Weave allows us to deliver lighter, stronger and more flexible 
flame resistant fabrics with enhanced ergonomics. These next generation personal 
protective fabrics, woven with filament and spun yarns in a unique twill design 
are making traditional fabrics made of 90 - 100% spun yarns, in a rip-stop 
weave a thing of the past.




PBI Max

Safety Components developed the world-renowned, industry leading PBI outer 
shell fabric: PBI Max™. The PBI Max patented design offers firefighters the 
best combination of break open and thermal protection, the strongest outer shell 
fabric in the world, and the most flexible and comfortable outer shell fabric the fire 
service has ever seen. PBI Max is the only outer shell that delivers triple-threat 
performance – unmatched protection, unmatched durability, and unmatched comfort.




Filament Twill Technology

Filament Twill Technology™, developed and patented by Safety Components, 
combines solution dyed DuPont Nomex® and DuPont Kevlar® to form a new 
breed of lightweight, flexible fabrics. Filament Twill Technology can be found in
outer shells like PBI Max™ and Armor AP™ and in thermal liners like Glide™. 



Kevlar Filament

DuPont™ Kevlar® filament was used to provide Americas’ troops with the best 
in body and hard armor, including ballistic vests, helmets, plates and armored 
vehicles. Safety Components was the first to employ this same ballistic grade 
Kevlar filament in outer shell fabrics. This revolutionary blend of military grade 
filament Kevlar and producer dyed Nomex/Kevlar fibers came together to deliver 
higher reinforcements against rips, tears and abrasion. 


Solution Dyed Fabric

We pioneered the use of solution dyed technology in high performance fibers for 
long-lasting, consistent color and strength performance against ultraviolet and 
radiant heat damage. Better strength and better color. Solution dyed fibers have 
color inserted through the fiber bundle maintaining the fiber strength rather 
than traditional fabric dyeing, which puts color on the outer layers using heat 
and pressure which damages the fibers and weakens the fabric.


Water, Chemical & Fuel Repellency

Patented and globally recognized Teflon® F.P.P.E. is another protective 
innovation from the fire service technology leaders at Safety Components. 
We were first to recognize, first to develop, first to market, first to patent and 
first to perfect water repellent technology. Less water absorption means you have 
less weight to carry and reduced heat stress. The result is drier, lighter, more 
abrasion resistant gear.

National Fallen Firefighters Foundation

The United States Congress created the National Fallen Firefighters Foundation
to lead a nationwide effort to honor America's fallen firefighters. Since 1992, the
non-profit foundation has developed and expanded programs that fulfill that mandate.
Their mission is to honor and remember America's fallen fire heroes and to provide
resources to assist their survivors in rebuilding their lives.

Southeastern Firefighters’ Burn Foundation

The Southeastern Firefighters’ Burn Foundation, Inc. provides assistance to the families
of patients being treated at the Joseph M. Still Burn Center. Annually, more than
3000 burn victims from all over the US arrive at the Joseph M. Still Burn Center in
Augusta, GA. Augusta’s Burn Center is recognized as one of the top burn centers
in the world. The Burn Center has realized a 97% survival rate with their
patients, and their focus is returning burn victims to quality lives.








Wounded Warrior Project

This nonprofit organization began when a group of veterans and brothers were
moved by the stories of the first wounded service members returning home from
Afghanistan and Iraq. They realized that something needed to be done for these brave
individuals. The objective was to provide tangible support for the severely wounded
and help them on the road to healing, both physically and mentally. What had been
initially viewed, as a small contribution has become WWP's signature program; backpacks
delivered bedside to wounded warriors.

Safety Components International Inc.

		Posted  by admin on Jan 25, 2017 in Claims, Liquid Claims News 

Safety Components International Inc. Securities Settlement
The class action lawsuit was settled for $10 million in cash. The derivative lawsuit was settled for $26 million in cash and $45 million in non cash benefits to be paid to the new International Textile Group Inc. The following is a summary of the proceedings in this lawsuit: ‘This matter (the Action) is pending before the Court of Common Pleas for Greenville County, South Carolina (the Court). The Action involves the merger (Merger) on October 20, 2006, of two companies, SCI and the former International Textile Group, Inc. (FITG), that Plaintiffs allege were controlled by Wilbur L. Ross, Jr., his investment company, W.L. Ross & Co., LLC, and his affiliates. After the Merger, SCI was renamed the new International Textile Group, Inc. (or NITG; ticker: ITXN). Plaintiffs allege that, among other things, the Merger was not entirely fair to the SCI minority shareholders, that Mr. Ross and his affiliates breached their fiduciary duties to SCI minority shareholders, and/or aided and abetted others in breaching their fiduciary duties to SCI minority shareholders. Plaintiffs also allege gross negligence and aiding and abetting breach of fiduciary duty against RSM EquiCo Capital Markets LLC (now known as McGladrey Capital Markets LLC, but referred to herein as RSM), which served as the financial advisor to SCI special committee charged with determining that the Merger was fair. Plaintiffs further allege that certain defendants were unjustly enriched by the Merger. The same claims are also made on behalf of NITG itself. The portion of the Action involving these claims on behalf of the SCI minority shareholders as of the date of the Merger is the Class Action. The portion of the Action involving these claims on behalf of NITG is the Derivative Action. Defendants have denied all material allegations against them, and have asserted various affirmative defenses in the Action. The Plaintiffs are FURSA Alternative Strategies LLC, FURSA Master Global Event Driven Fund, LP, and FURSA Company, Ltd. (collectively, FURSA), Ramius Securities, LLC, Ramius Credit Opportunities Master Fund Ltd. (collectively, Ramius), Brian P. Menezes (Mr. Menezes), Joseph and Marilyn Asiaf (together, the Asiafs), and Juanita Marett (Mrs. Marett). The Plaintiffs other than Mr. Menezes represent the Class of all minority shareholders of SCI as of the Merger with damages in excess of $100. As such, they are referred to as Class Representatives. In addition, the Plaintiffs, with the exception of the Asiafs (because they do not currently own NITG stock), represent NITG in connection with the Derivative Claims. In that capacity they are referred to as Derivative Representatives. The Defendants (Defendants) are Wilbur L. Ross Jr., WL Ross & Co. LLC, WLR Recovery Fund II, L.P., WLR Recovery Associates II, LLC, WLR Recovery Fund III, L.P., WLR Recovery Associates III, LLC, Michael J. Gibbons, David H. Storper, David L. Wax, Joseph L. Gorga, Gary L. Smith, Stephen B. Duerk, Dr. Daniel D. Tessoni, and McGladrey Capital Markets, LLC (f/k/a RSM EquiCo Capital Markets, LLC) (RSM). This case is a consolidation of three separate lawsuits, the first of which was filed in April 2008 and the last of which was filed in August 2009 (which together are referred to as the Actions). The matter has been extensively litigated. Counsel for the parties have conducted nearly 100 days of depositions and more than one million pages of documents (over 152 gigabytes) were produced in the action. More than thirty-five separate expert reports have been submitted on behalf of the parties. The Court certified the claims by the Class Representatives as a Class Action by an Order dated January 10, 2013. In the same Order, the Court denied a motion to disqualify the Derivative Representatives from bringing the Derivative Action on behalf of NITG. Potential Class Members were previously notified of the Class Action pursuant to that Order, and given the opportunity to not participate in the case. No potential Class Members elected to not participate. The Court has ruled on various motions related to the discovery of facts surrounding the Merger, and substantive issues involving the legal claims. The parties were not able to reach a settlement after two days of mediation in 2011, nor after additional negotiations in 2012. Negotiations were re-started in 2013, and the Settlement was the product of an arm-length negotiation process that lasted for several months, settling just before trial was to begin in September 2013. The proposed Settlement involves a compromise of disputed claims and does not mean that the Defendants have admitted liability as alleged in the Action. Class Counsel have, since 2008, investigated and evaluated the claims asserted in the Action and have determined that the proposed Settlement is fair, reasonable, and adequate for the Class as a whole and for NITG. If approved, the Settlement will result in cash payments to Class Members to the extent provided herein and consideration for the benefit of NITG as provided in the Notice of Derivative Action Settlement (below). The Settlement also avoids the risks and delays of continuing the Action, including the risk that the Defendants would prevail either at trial or on appeal, in which case Class Members and NITG could receive nothing. The Settlement also avoids disputes regarding whether the case should proceed as a Class Action and/or a Derivative Action, whether the Class Representatives were subject to unique defenses that would defeat their claims or disqualify them from being Class Representatives and thus end the Class Action, whether certain of the Defendants were controlling shareholders of both SCI and FITG, whether and to what extent the entire fairness standard of review applies, whether Defendant Dr. Daniel D. Tessoni was an independent director of SCI, whether RSM was grossly negligent, whether the Merger caused the decline of NITG stock price after the Merger, whether Class Members have legally compensable damages or only the company does, and, if so, the amount of legally compensable damages suffered by individual Class Members. Judge D. Garrison Hill of the Circuit Court for the State of South Carolina has preliminarily approved the Settlement as fair and reasonable for the Class and NITG and authorized the sending of this Notice of Settlement to you. A final review of the proposed Settlement will be conducted by the Court at the Settlement Hearing to assure it is fair, reasonable, and adequate for the Class and NITG. The Settlement will go forward if the Court gives final approval to the Settlement (both the Class Action Settlement and the Derivative Action Settlement portions), and if any appeals that may be filed are resolved in favor of Settlement.’
