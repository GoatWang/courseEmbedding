Ask it questions. Tell it to do things. It's your own Google, always ready to help.“Ok Google, what’s ‘good morning’ in French?”Get answers when you need them most. Ask, “Ok Google, what is 18% of 92?” to finish up last-minute homework, or “Ok Google, how many teaspoons in a cup?” when you have flour-covered hands in the kitchen.“Ok Google, play music by Sia”Ask Google Home to play tunes from services like Spotify, YouTube Music, Pandora and more. You can also stream music from your phone to Google Home from 100+ Chromecast-enabled audio apps.“Ok Google, how long will it take to get to work?”Manage your everyday tasks with Google Home — get your daily schedule, traffic, and flight info. Set an alarm by saying, “Ok Google, wake me up tomorrow at 6:30am,” or tell it to add things to your shopping list, start a timer, and more.“Ok Google, set the thermostat to 68 degrees”Google Home seamlessly connects with smart home technologies like Nest thermostats, Philips Hue, and Samsung SmartThings. So you can say things like, “Ok Google, dim the lights in the kitchen” without interrupting what you’re doing. You can also tell it to stream entertainment to your TV with Chromecast.Compatible partnersGoogle Home plays nice with products and services you already know and love — and more new integrations are being added all the time.Superior sound and voice technologyGoogle Home works over Wi-Fi and its integrated high-excursion speaker delivers crystal-clear highs and rich bass for hi-fi sound.

Google Inc., American search engine company, founded in 1998 by Sergey Brin and Larry Page that is a subsidiary of the holding company Alphabet Inc. More than 70 percent of worldwide online search requests are handled by Google, placing it at the heart of most Internet users’ experience. Its headquarters are in Mountain View, California.Larry Page (left) and Sergey Brin.© Google Inc. Used with permission.Google began as an online search firm, but it now offers more than 50 Internet services and products, from e-mail and online document creation to software for mobile phones and tablet computers. In addition, its 2012 acquisition of Motorola Mobility put it in the position to sell hardware in the form of mobile phones. Google’s broad product portfolio and size make it one of the top four influential companies in the high-tech marketplace, along with Apple, IBM, and Microsoft. Despite this myriad of products, its original search tool remains the core of its success. In 2011 Google earned 97 percent of its revenue through advertising based on users’ search requests.Searching for businessBrin and Page, who met as graduate students at Stanford University, were intrigued with the idea of extracting meaning from the mass of data accumulating on the Internet. They began working from Page’s dormitory room at Stanford to devise a new type of search technology, which they dubbed BackRub. The key was to leverage Web users’ own ranking abilities by tracking each Web site’s “backing links”—that is, the number of other pages linked to them. Most search engines simply returned a list of Web sites ranked by how often a search phrase appeared on them. Brin and Page incorporated into the search function the number of links each Web site had; i.e., a Web site with thousands of links would logically be more valuable than one with just a few links, and the search engine thus would place the heavily linked site higher on a list of possibilities. Further, a link from a heavily linked Web site would be a more valuable “vote” than one from a more obscure Web site.

In mid-1998 Brin and Page began receiving outside financing (one of their first investors was Andy Bechtolsheim, a cofounder of Sun Microsystems, Inc.). They ultimately raised about $1 million from investors, family, and friends and set up shop in Menlo Park, California, under the name Google, which was derived from a misspelling of Page’s original planned name, googol (a mathematical term for the number one followed by 100 zeroes). By mid-1999, when Google received a $25 million round of venture capital funding, it was processing 500,000 queries per day. Activity began to explode in 2000, when Google became the client search engine for one of the Web’s most popular sites, Yahoo!. By 2004, when Yahoo! dispensed with Google’s services, users were searching on Google 200 million times a day. That growth only continued: by the end of 2011 Google was handling some three billion searches per day. The company’s name became so ubiquitous that it entered the lexicon as a verb: to google became a common expression for searching the Internet.To accommodate this unprecedented mass of data, Google built 11 data centres around the world, each of them containing several hundred thousand servers (basically, multiprocessor personal computers and hard drives mounted in specially constructed racks). Google’s interlinked computers probably number several million. The heart of Google’s operation, however, is built around three proprietary pieces of computer code: Google File System (GFS), Bigtable, and MapReduce. GFS handles the storage of data in “chunks” across several machines; Bigtable is the company’s database program; and MapReduce is used by Google to generate higher-level data (e.g., putting together an index of Web pages that contain the words “Chicago,” “theatre,” and “participatory”).

The extraordinary growth of Google led to internal management problems. Almost from the beginning, investors felt that Brin and Page needed an experienced manager at the helm, and in 2001 they agreed to hire Eric Schmidt as chairman and chief executive officer (CEO) of the company. Schmidt, who previously had held the same positions at the software company Novell Inc., had a doctorate in computer science and melded well with the technocratic impulses of the founders. During Schmidt’s reign as CEO, Page served as president of products, and Brin was president of technology. The trio ran the company as a “triumvirate” until Page took on the CEO role in 2011, Schmidt became executive chairman, and Brin adopted the title of director of special projects.

The company’s initial public offering (IPO) in 2004 raised $1.66 billion for the company and made Brin and Page instant billionaires. In fact, the IPO created 7 billionaires and 900 millionaires from the early stockholders. The stock offering also made news because of the unusual way it was handled. Shares were sold in a public auction intended to put the average investor on an equal footing with financial industry professionals. Google was added to Standard and Poor’s 500 (S&P 500) stock index in 2006. In 2012 Google’s market capitalization made it one of the largest American companies not in the Dow Jones Industrial Average.Google reorganized itself in August 2015 to become a subsidiary of the holding company Alphabet Inc. Internet search, advertising, apps, and maps, as well as the mobile operating system Android and the video-sharing site YouTube, remained under Google. Separate Google ventures—such as longevity research company Calico, home-products company Nest, and research lab Google X—became separate firms under Alphabet. Page became CEO of Alphabet, Brin its president, and Schmidt its executive chairman. Sundar Pichai, senior vice president of products, became Google’s new CEO.Advertising growthGoogle’s strong financial results reflected the rapid growth of Internet advertising in general and Google’s popularity in particular. Analysts attributed part of that success to a shift in advertising spending toward the Internet and away from traditional media, including newspapers, magazines, and television. For example, American newspaper advertising fell from a peak of $64 billion in 2000 to $20.7 billion in 2011, while global online advertising grew from approximately $6 billion in 2000 to more than $72 billion in 2011.

Since its founding, Google has spent large sums to secure what it has calculated to be significant Internet marketing advantages. For example, in 2003 Google spent $102 million to acquire Applied Semantics, the makers of AdSense, a service that signed up owners of Web sites to run various types of ads on their Web pages. In 2006 Google again paid $102 million for another Web advertisement business, dMarc Broadcasting, and that same year it announced that it would pay $900 million over three and a half years for the right to sell ads on MySpace.com. In 2007 Google made its largest acquisition to date, buying online advertising firm DoubleClick for $3.1 billion. Two years later the company responded to the explosive growth of the mobile applications market with a $750 million deal to acquire the mobile advertising network AdMob. All of these purchases were part of Google’s effort to expand from its search engine business into advertising by combining the various firms’ databases of information in order to tailor ads to consumers’ individual preferences.Other servicesGoogle Video and YouTubeGoogle’s expansion, fueled largely by keyword-based Web advertising, provided it with a sound footing to compete for dominance in new Web services. One of these was the delivery of video content. In January 2005 Google launched Google Video, which enabled individuals to search the close-captioned text from television broadcasts. A few months later Google began accepting user-submitted videos, with submitters setting the prices for others to download and view the videos. In January 2006 Google Video Store opened, featuring premium content from traditional media companies such as CBS Corporation (television shows) and Sony Corporation (movies). In June 2006 Google began offering premium content for free but with ads.For all of its marketing advantages, however, Google was unable to overtake the upstart leader in online videos, YouTube. Following its introduction in 2005, YouTube quickly become the favourite site for users to upload small video files, some of which attracted millions of viewers. Unable to generate anything close to the same number of uploads and viewers, Google bought YouTube in 2006 for $1.65 billion in stock. Rather than merge the Web sites, however, Google continued YouTube’s operation as a separate entity. Despite estimated revenues of more than $1 billion by 2012, Google said YouTube remained an “investment” and has not said whether the division was profitable.Gmail

In 2004 Google began offering a free Web-based e-mail account to select “beta” testers (a beta product being a product not yet in its final form). The service, known as Gmail, was opened to the general public in 2007 while still officially in its beta stage. One of the main appeals of Gmail was that it gave users an e-mail address that was independent of any particular Internet service provider (ISP), thus making it easier to maintain a permanent address. In addition, the service offered an unprecedented one gigabyte (one billion bytes) of free e-mail storage space, though users were also presented with advertisements based on keywords that the Google search engine found in their messages. Google later expanded the amount of free storage space given to users to seven gigabytes and allowed users to rent additional space. In 2007 the company acquired Postini, an e-mail services firm, for $625 million in order to improve Gmail’s security, especially in Google’s efforts to sign up businesses. In 2009 Google removed the beta status of Gmail, increasing its appeal to business users.In January 2010 Google announced that it had detected a series of sophisticated hacking attacks, originating in China, that were directed at the Gmail accounts of Chinese human rights activists and foreign journalists working in China. In some cases the accounts had been reconfigured to forward all incoming and outgoing e-mail to unfamiliar addresses. Google’s immediate response was to change Gmail’s protocol from the Web standard HTTP to the encrypted HTTPS, which increased security at the expense of speed. The attacks also led Google to threaten to reverse its stance, which allowed the Chinese government to censor its Google.cn site and allow Chinese users to receive unfiltered search results. This brought the company into conflict with the Chinese government and raised the possibility of Google’s exiting the Chinese market altogether. In March, Google avoided direct conflict by automatically redirecting Chinese users of Google.cn to its unfiltered Hong Kong site, Google.com.hk. This arrangement continued until Google’s government-issued license to operate in China came up for annual renewal at the end of June. At that time Google changed Google.cn so that users could either use the censored Chinese site for services such as music search or manually click on a link to Google.com.hk for Web search. This move conciliated the Chinese government, which renewed Google’s license in July 2010.Google Books

Before Google was even launched as a company, its founders had worked on digital book projects at Stanford and had always envisioned the day when Internet users would be able to search content in books. In 2004 the company announced Google Print, a project with several major libraries around the world that would begin to make their holdings freely available on the Internet. The company began by scanning public-domain books from the libraries’ collections, using sophisticated equipment. The digital files were then converted into portable document files (PDFs) that were fully searchable, downloadable, and printable. Works still in copyright appeared only in fragmented “snippet” form. In 2005 the company changed the name of the project to Google Books, and about one million books per year were scanned in its initial years of operation. As of 2012, Google had scanned more than 15 million books.Meanwhile, groups of authors and publishers filed suit to stop the company from making passages from their copyrighted books available over the Internet. In 2008 Google reached a legal settlement in which the company agreed to pay the groups $125 million for past transgressions, though users could continue to read for free up to 20 percent of each work scanned by Google. In exchange for allowing parts of their works to be read online, the authors and publishers would receive 63 percent of all advertising revenue generated by page views of their material on Google’s Web site.Google EarthIn 2004 Google bought Keyhole Inc., which was partially funded by the Central Intelligence Agency’s venture capital arm, In-Q-Tel. Keyhole had developed an online mapping service that Google rebranded in 2005 as Google Earth. This service let users find detailed satellite images of most locations on Earth and also create combinations (known as “mashups”) with various other databases, incorporating details such as street names, weather patterns, crime statistics, coffee shop locations, real-estate prices, and population densities into maps created by Google Earth. While many of these mashups were created for convenience or simple novelty, others became critical lifesaving tools. For instance, in the wake of Hurricane Katrina in 2005, Google Earth provided interactive satellite overlays of the affected region, enabling rescuers to better understand the extent of the damage. Subsequently, Google Earth became a vital tool in many disaster recovery efforts.Google Earth OutreachAPScreenshot of Google Earth.© Europa Technologies; © Tele Atlas; US Dept of State Geographer; © 2010 GoogleGoogle’s commitment to privacy was questioned, however, after it introduced a related mapping service, called Street View, that showed street-level photographs first from around the United States and later from other countries that were searchable by street address. Some photographs provided a view through house windows or showed persons sunbathing. Google defended the service by saying that the images showed only what a person could see if walking down the street. In response to privacy concerns in Germany, in 2010 Google allowed people to opt out of having their homes and business included in Street View, and 244,000 people (3 percent of the country) did so. However, even though a German court ruled in 2011 that Street View was legal, Google announced that it would not add new photographs to the service.Google employee Arthur Poirier, on a camera-equipped tricycle, recording images for Google’s Street …Jacques Brinon/APGoogle Apps and ChromeIn 2006, in what many in the industry considered the opening salvo in a war with Microsoft, Google introduced Google Apps—application software hosted by Google that runs through users’ Web browsers. The first free programs included Google Calendar (a scheduling program), Google Talk (an instant messaging program), and Google Page Creator (a Web-page-creation program). In order to use these free programs, users viewed advertisements and stored their data on Google’s equipment. This type of deployment, in which both the data and the programs are located somewhere on the Internet, is often called cloud computing.Screenshot of a Web page at Google.com describing the Google Apps computer application.© 2011 GoogleBetween 2006 and 2007 Google bought or developed various traditional business programs (word processor, spreadsheet, and presentation software) that were eventually collectively named Google Docs. Like Google Apps, Google Docs is used through a browser that connects to the data on Google’s machines. In 2007 Google introduced a Premier Edition of its Google Apps that included 25 gigabytes of e-mail storage, security functions from the recently acquired Postini software, and no advertisements. As the components of Google Docs became available, they were added to both the free ad-supported Google Apps and the Premier Edition. In particular, Google Docs was marketed as a direct competitor to Microsoft’s Office Suite (Word, Excel, and PowerPoint).In 2008 Google released Chrome, a Web browser with an advanced JavaScript engine better suited for running programs within the browser. The following year the company announced plans to develop an open-source operating system, known as Chrome OS. The first devices to use Chrome OS were released in 2011 and were netbooks called Chromebooks. Chrome OS, which runs on top of a Linux kernel, requires fewer system resources than most operating systems because it uses cloud computing. The only software running on a Chrome OS device is the Chrome browser, all other software applications being supplied by Google Apps.Android operating systemGoogle’s entry into the lucrative mobile operating system market was based on its acquisition in 2005 of Android Inc., which at that time had not released any products. Two years later Google announced the founding of the Open Handset Alliance, a consortium of dozens of technology and mobile telephone companies, including Intel Corporation, Motorola, Inc., NVIDIA Corporation, Texas Instruments Incorporated, LG Electronics, Inc., Samsung Electronics, Sprint Nextel Corporation, and T-Mobile (Deutsche Telekom). The consortium was created in order to develop and promote Android, a free open-source operating system based on Linux. The first phone to feature the new operating system was the T-Mobile G1, released in October 2008, though Android-based phones really required the more capable third-generation (3G) wireless networks in order to take full advantage of all the system’s features, such as one-touch Google searches, Google Docs, Google Earth, and Google Street View.The G1 smartphone, based on Google’s Android operating system, displayed in 2008.Dan Steinberg/APIn 2010 Google entered into direct competition with Apple’s iPhone by introducing the Nexus One smartphone. Nicknamed the “Google Phone,” the Nexus One used the latest version of Android and featured a large, vibrant display screen, aesthetically pleasing design, and a voice-to-text messaging system that was based on advanced voice-recognition software. However, its lack of native support for multi-touch—a typing and navigation feature pioneered by Apple that allowed users more flexibility in interacting with touchscreens—was seen as a drawback when compared with other handsets in its class. Despite Android’s perceived drawbacks compared with Apple’s smartphone iOS, by the end of 2011, Android led the mobile phone industry with a 52 percent global market share, more than triple that of iOS.A smartphone, such as the Google Nexus One (left) or the Apple iPhone (right), may be thought of as …Paul J. Richards—AFP/Getty ImagesIn 2010 Google’s hardware partners also began releasing tablet computers based on the Android operating system. The first product was criticized for poor performance, but by the end of 2011 Android-based tablets had gained ground on the hugely popular Apple iPad. Of the 68 million tablets estimated to have shipped in that year, 39 percent ran Android, compared with nearly 60 percent being iPads.Google was obliged to battle competitors over Android in the courts as well as in the marketplace. In 2010, for example, Oracle Corporation sued Google for $6.1 billion in damages, claiming Android had violated numerous patents relating to Oracle’s Java programming language. (After two years in court, Google eventually won the lawsuit.) Instead of attacking Google directly, Apple Inc. sued makers of Android smartphones, such as HTC, Motorola Mobility, and Samsung, over alleged patent violations. Apple CEO Steve Jobs was said to have claimed, “I’m going to destroy Android, because it’s a stolen product. I’m willing to go to thermonuclear war on this.” The patent wars over mobile operating systems seemed unresolvable, as suits and countersuits were filed with each release of a new version.Social networks and Google+Google was late to recognize the popularity and advertising potential of social networks such as Facebook and Twitter. Its first attempt to create a social network, Google Buzz, started in 2010 and closed less than two years later. Among several problems, the network was limited to users who had Gmail accounts, and it created privacy issues by featuring a default setting that showed a user’s profile to anyone. Even before Google Buzz had shut down, the company launched Google+ in June 2011, at first to a limited audience and then to anyone. Within a year of its start, the social network service had attracted more than 170 million users. Facebook, by contrast, had taken five years to reach 150 million users.Nevertheless, Google+ faced a formidable competitor in Facebook, which by mid-2012 had some 900 million users. Facebook users spent far more time on their site, clocking six to seven hours per month, while Google+ users averaged a little more than three minutes per month. Because Facebook did not permit Google’s Web indexing software to penetrate its servers, Google was unable to include the giant social network in its search results, thus losing potentially valuable data from one of the most-trafficked networks on the Internet. Still, the company appeared to be fully supportive of Google+. Seeing the value of games in retaining users on social networks, it quickly released a games area for the service. It also developed innovative features that were not available on Facebook. For example, with Hangouts, users could instantly create free video conferences for up to 10 people. The company also added Google+ pages for businesses to market their products and brands.William L. HoschMark Hall

Description



Access to case studies expires six months after purchase date.



Publication Date: January 28, 2010

 The case 'Google Inc.' describes Google's history, business model, governance structure, corporate culture, and processes for managing innovation. It reviews Google's recent strategic initiatives and the threats they pose to Yahoo!, Microsoft, and others. It also asks what Google should do next. One option is to stay focused on the company's core competence, i.e., developing superior search solutions and monetizing them through targeted advertising. Another option is to branch into new arenas; for example, build Google into a portal like Yahoo! or MSN; extend Google's role in e-commerce beyond search, to encompass a more active role as an intermediary (like eBay) facilitating transactions; or challenge Microsoft's position on the PC desktop by developing software to compete with Office and Windows.

Web-based products[edit]
Search tools[edit]

Google Search is a web search engine, which is Google's core product. It receives over 3 billion search queries per day. Google also offers regional search by its 189 regional level domains.

Hummingbird – Expanded query analysis. For example, if you search for 'best pie place in Seattle' Google will also search for 'best pie restaurant in Seattle'.
PageRank – link analysis algorithm.
Snapshots – mechanism that indexes PDFs, Word documents, and more.
Google Search functionality – Google Search includes Boolean logical operators, wildcards, and more, to help users refine their searches.
Multiple languages – Google Search is supported by a large number of different languages.
Google Author Rank – The idea that an online author can have topical authority within Google Search Results.
Experimental Search options for testing new interfaces while searching with Google, including Timeline views and keyboard shortcuts.
Encrypted Search – In May 2010 Google rolled out SSL-encrypted web search.[1] The encrypted search can be accessed at encrypted.google.com [2]


Google Alerts – email notification service, which sends alerts based on chosen search terms, whenever there are new results. Alerts include web results, Groups results news, and video. The system is not functioning correctly beginning in 2013.[3]
Google Books (formerly Print) – search engine for the full text of printed books. Google scans and stores in its digital database. The content that is displayed depends on the arrangement with the publishers, ranging from short extracts to entire books.
Google Custom Search – allows a user to create a customized search experience for his/her own website. Renamed from Google Co-op, which in turn replaced Google Free Search.
Google Finance – searchable US business news, opinion, and financial data. Features include company-specific pages, blog search, interactive charts, executives information, discussion groups and a portfolio.
Google Groups – web and email discussion service and Usenet archive. Users can join a group, make a group, publish posts, track their favorite topics, write a set of group web pages updatable by members and share group files. In January 2007, version 3 of Google Groups was released. New features include the ability to create customized pages and share files.
Google Hotel Finder – Provides searches similar to other Online Travel Agencies (Travel website) that searchers can search for check-in and check-out dates.[4] Now directly available through searching, for example searching 'hotels in Seattle' will result in an info box under advertisements.[5]
Google Flights – a service that allows users to search for flights from many airlines to many destinations, offering tools such as price comparisons and travel recommendations.[6]
Google Image Search – image search engine, with results based on the file name of the image, the link text pointing to the image and text adjacent to the image. You can also make a search by uploading a picture from your computer. When searching, a thumbnail of each matching image is displayed.
Language Tools – Collection of linguistic applications, including one that allows users to translate text or web pages from one language to another, and another that allows searching in web pages located in a specific country or written in a specific language.
Life Search (Google China) – Search engine tailored towards everyday needs, such as train times, recipes and housing.
Google News – automated news compilation service and search engine for news. There are versions of the aggregator for more than 20 languages. While the selection of news stories is fully automated, the sites included are selected by human editors.
Google Patent Search – search engine to search through millions of patents, each result with its own page, including drawings, claims and citations.
Google Recipe View – lets you narrow your search results to show only recipes, and helps you choose the right recipe amongst the search results by showing clearly marked ratings, ingredients and pictures. First mentioned on Google's blog in February 2011.[7]
Google Scholar – search engine for the full text of scholarly literature across an array of publishing formats and scholarly fields. Today, the index includes virtually all peer-reviewed journals available online.

First Published: July 24, 2009; Last Updated: Tuesday, September 20, 2016.
Google may be a synonym for search, but it’s not restricted to that feature alone. If you are not a tech-savvy person then chances are that you are unaware about majority of Google’s products and services.
Anyway, how many Google products and services do you use? The common answers will be Gmail, Google+, Drive, Docs, or an Image Search. But Google is well beyond that.

Over 1 billion Google Search users. Over 1 billion YouTube users. Over 1 billion Gmail users. Over 1 billion Chrome users. Over 1 bilion Maps users. Over 1 billion Android users. Over 1 billion Google Play Store users. That’s the stats of Google.


What are the Top 10 Google Products & Services?
If you check Alexa traffic stats of Google.com then you can see that the 10 most popular Google products are Google Search, Mail, Docs, Plus, Drive, Translate, Maps, AdWords, Play Store, and Google News. However, Google is so much beyond that.

Closing Thoughts
It’s no secret that Google dominated the web post the dot-com bubble. And it was becoming more and and more popular when several other big dot-com companies were struggling (including the Yahoos and the AOLs of the web).
Google never had to look back as it enjoyed a monopoly in the search engine market (just like Microsoft monopolized the operating systems market in the 1990s and 2000s).
The best thing about Google (from the user point of view) is that they launched a ton of other products & services (apart from a search engine) and gave away all of them for free. Because they were able to subsidize all its cost via their highly profitable advertising business.
When Google started launching more and more web products I was super-excited as I saw myself using almost all of them. And that’s what inspired me to publish this listicle.
Please share with me any other interesting Google product/service or even a handy tool that’s not listed here so that I can add it to the list above.
So, how many Google products and services are you using?
Happy Googling! :)

Thats a pretty good collection you have gathered there.
I bet that 99% of the people using the Internet for business aren´t aware of the existence of most of these apps.
I think that if somebody were to take full advantage of these apps it would boost his/her website traffic.
I good assuption would be that the more Google apps somebody is using ,the higher Rankings they will get.
Most places do award you for using their apps , so why not google.

Hi
This is very usefull i like it and i get 10/9 number






Nguyen Van Minh



Half of these services are no longer active, also EVERY item on this list is subject to Google’s spring cleaning, Windows Live offered ”an answer” for ALL (yes, even Orkut and Google + with So.cl) these services, which mostly failed, they put all these services in Windows 8 which is why it’s such bloatware, Google plays their cards better by making them optional downloads.
Scroogle collects your personal information for advertisement, most people think of Google as a search engine, but most of its profits come from ads.






Mahesh Mohan



Yes, unfortunately. Google is shutting down more and more products that don’t contribute money.








angel

Mahesh Mohan



No, I didn’t. Check #53… Google Broadband service is called “Google Fiber”. And their free WiFi access for Mountain View is called “Google WiFi” (#144).

Google Keyword Planner was formerly known as Google AdWords Keywords Tool. That’s why it’s not listed here.. I will include it on the next update of this post.








Mel Schmidt

Bob White



This list needs to be filtered and updated. There are a fair number of items that are not longer supported or exist.






Mahesh Mohan



Hi Bob,
I know it’s been a while since I updated it.. Actually, the upcoming blog post is based on this very blog post and I hope to update the list this time.

About Mahesh (@maheshone)
Hey there, I’m Mahesh (@maheshone). I started learning and doing and experimenting web 2.0 stuff back in 2004 and eventually became a full-time computer nerd after graduation. Minterest is a digital marketing and technology journal that I founded in 2007 to feed my super curiosity (oh yeah, I’m a solo-blogger). I write about tech, marketing, and everything in between that excites me. And I love to work with small businesses to help them get the most out of the web. Outside of that, I'm equally passionate about the financial markets and I also spend a lot of time doing random things (see random facts about me). Say hi: @maheshone. Read More »
