 TARRYTOWN, N.Y. -- Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Nasdaq: REGN)
announced today the appointment of Peter Powchik, M.D., as Senior Vice
President of Clinical Development to lead the Company's clinical
development efforts. Dr. Powchik will report to George Yancopoulos,
M.D., Ph.D, President, Regeneron Research Laboratories.

 "Regeneron's product candidates are being tested in an
expanding number of late-stage clinical trials in cancer, eye disease,
and inflammatory conditions," remarked Dr. Yancopoulos. "Dr.
Powchik has played a key role at major pharmaceutical companies in
guiding important products successfully through the clinical and
regulatory process. His demonstrated expertise and broad experience will
be particularly valuable as our clinical development efforts advance.
Peter will lead our growing clinical team, which includes the recent
addition of an oncologist and an ophthalmologist to senior clinical
positions."

 "Regeneron has exciting drug candidates progressing through
clinical development that address significant unmet medical needs and
the stated goal of advancing two new antibody candidates into the clinic
each year beginning in 2007," added Dr. Powchik. "I look
forward to joining Regeneron's management team and overseeing this
ambitious drug development effort."

 Dr. Powchik joins Regeneron from Chugai Pharma USA, where he was
Senior Vice President and Chief Medical Officer. There he was
responsible for development activities for oncology, cardiology, and
gastrointestinal product candidates. He held senior clinical development
positions with Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation, Sepracor Inc., and
Pfizer, Inc. before joining Chugai. Dr. Powchik brings expertise in
clinical development and in positioning new products for
commercialization in the pharmaceutical industry. He played a
significant role in the development and commercialization of important
new products. Prior to his work in the pharmaceutical industry, Dr.
Powchik was on the faculty of The Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New
York City. He received an M.D. degree from the New York University School of Medicine.

 About Regeneron Pharmaceuticals

 Regeneron is a biopharmaceutical company that discovers, develops,
and intends to commercialize therapeutic medicines for the treatment of
serious medical conditions. Regeneron has therapeutic candidates in
clinical trials for the potential treatment of cancer, eye diseases, and
inflammatory diseases, and has preclinical programs in other diseases
and disorders.

 This news release discusses historical information and includes
forward-looking statements about Regeneron and its products, programs,
finances, and business, all of which involve a number of risks and
uncertainties, such as risks associated with preclinical and clinical
development of our drug candidates, determinations by regulatory and
administrative governmental authorities which may delay or restrict our
ability to continue to develop or commercialize our drug candidates,
competing drugs that are superior to our product candidates,
unanticipated expenses, the availability and cost of capital, the costs
of developing, producing, and selling products, the potential for any
collaboration agreement, including our agreement with the sanofi-aventis
Group, to be canceled or to terminate without any product success, risks
associated with third party intellectual property, and other material
risks. A more complete description of these and other material risks can
be found in Regeneron's filings with the United States Securities
and Exchange Commission (SEC), including its Form 10-K for the year
ended December 31, 2005 and Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30,
2006. Regeneron does not undertake any obligation to update publicly any
forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information,
future events, or otherwise unless required by law.

            Peter Powchik ’79
          






February 08, 2017
On the leadership team at Regeneron Pharmaceuticals and speed chess champion.




    Peter Powchik ’79 (chemistry) has had a successful career in clinical development at a wide range of leading pharmaceutical companies. He is currently senior vice president for clinical development at Regeneron Pharmaceuticals in Tarrytown, NY, a position he’s held since 2006.
  



    He’s played a key role in successfully guiding important products for cancer, eye disease, and inflammatory conditions through clinical and regulatory processes, and has had an impact on the development and commercialization of important new products that have changed the landscape for treatment of many diseases worldwide.
  

    Powchik went on to receive his MD from New York University School of Medicine.
  

    Aside from academics, Purchase had an impact his life in two more important ways. First, he met his wife of 30 years at Campus Center South. He also honed speed chess skills that allowed him to earn pocket money playing chess on various street corners and parks in New York City—substantially reducing his need for student loans in medical school.
  

    Powchik received the Purchase College President’s Award for Distinguished Alumni at the Commencement ceremony on Friday, May 16, 2014.
