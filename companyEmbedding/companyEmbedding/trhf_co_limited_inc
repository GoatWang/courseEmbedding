Style Scores:



NA Value | NA Growth | NA Momentum | NA VGM                


The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.


Value Score
A


Growth Score
A


Momentum Score
A


VGM Score

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.



Value Score
A


Growth Score

Momentum Score

VGM Score

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

    UNITED STATES SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION Washington, D.C. 20549   FORM 8-K   CURRENT REPORT Pursuant to Section 13 OR 15(d) of The Securities Exchange Act of 1934   Date of Report (Date of earliest event reported) July 9, 2015   TRHF COMPANY LIMITED, INC. (Exact name of registrant as specified in its charter)        Nevada     333-197103     80-0952322   (State or other jurisdiction of incorporation)     (Commission File Number)     (IRS Employer Identification No.)    Unit B, 5/F, CKK Commercial Center, 289 Hennessy Road, Hong Kong, China (Address of principal executive offices)    (852) 2845-2283 Registrant's telephone number, including area code   N/A (Former name or former address, if changed since last report.)   Check the appropriate box below if the Form 8-K filing is intended to simultaneously satisfy the filing obligation of the registrant under any of the following provisions:   ¨ Written communications pursuant to Rule 425 under the Securities Act (17 CFR 230.425)   ¨ Soliciting material pursuant to Rule 14a-12 under the Exchange Act (17 CFR 240.14a-12)   ¨ Pre-commencement communications pursuant to Rule 14d-2(b) under the Exchange Act (17 CFR 240.14d-2(b))   ¨ Pre-commencement communications pursuant to Rule 13e-4(c) under the Exchange Act (17 CFR 240.13e-4(c))           SECTION 1 - REGISTRANT’S BUSINESS AND OPERATIONS   ITEM 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.   As previously reported in Form 8-K filed on July 13, 2015:   On July 9, 2015, TRHF Company Limited, Inc. ("TRHF" or the “Company”), entered into a share exchange agreement (the "Exchange Agreement") with Health Plus International Ltd. ("HPIL") and Wang Bo, on behalf of himself and certain other individuals who received shares of TRHF pursuant to the Exchange Agreement. On the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Exchange Agreement, on July 9, 2015, Wang Bo, holding all 50,000 shares of HPIL common stock, sold, assigned, transferred and delivered, free and clear of all liens, pledges, encumbrances, charges, restrictions or known claims of any kind, nature, or description, all of the shares of HPIL held by him to TRHF; the objective of such transfer being the acquisition by the TRHF of all the issued and outstanding shares of HPIL common stock. In exchange for the transfer of such securities by Wang Bo, TRHF is issuing, to the shareholders listed on Composite Exhibit A to the Exchange Agreement (the "Shareholders"), 587,420,000 shares of the Company's common stock, par value $.001 per share, as set forth therein. Wang Bo has surrendered his certificate representing all of the HPIL shares to the Company. The Shareholder have received certificates evidencing their ownership of TRHF.    Prior to the date of the Exchange Agreement, Wang Bo was the majority shareholder of TRHF and a number of the Shareholders were shareholders of TRHF. Prior to the change of control event described in TRHF's Form 8-K filed on June 16, 2015, Wang Bo, the Shareholders and their affiliates had no interaction with TRHF other than the negotiation.    On July 9, 2015, the Company acquired all of the outstanding equity of HPIL.   On September 9, 2015, HPIL entered into agreements with Shenzhen Tian Rui Hui Feng Agriculture Co., Ltd. (formerly known as Shenzhen Branch innovation and Technology Company Limited)(“SZTRHF”), its shareholders: Shenzhen City Hai Zhuo Tian Rui Investment Company Limited and Wang Jing, whereby the Company, through HPIL, controls SZTRHF and receives substantially all of the economic benefits of SZTRHF.   The agreements include an Exclusive Option Agreement allowing HPIL or its nominee to acquire the shares of SZTRHF, a Voting Rights Proxy Agreement that provides HPIL with the voting rights of SZTRHF, and an Equity Pledge Agreement that pledges the shares in SZTRHF to HPIL, and a Entrusted Management Agreement whereby the Company has been entrusted to manage and direct the operations SZTRHF for the all of the economic benefits derived in SZTRHF’s operations. Effective control of SZTRHF was transferred to HPIL through these series of contractual arrangements without transferring legal ownership in SZTRHF. As a result, SZTRHF became a variable interest entity (“VIE”) and, accordingly, its financial position and results of operations have been included in the proforma condensed consolidated financial statements of the Company.   SZTRHF is a limited company incorporated on April 6, 2012 in Shenzhen, People’s Republic of China (“PRC”). The SZTRHF is in the business of design and distribution of close caption television and monitoring products for application in the agricultural sector. The Company is owned by Shenzhen City Hai Zhuo Tian Rui Investment Company Limited and Wang Jing, 75% and 25%, respectively. As of the date of these financial statements, the Company has registered for a maximum authorized capital of RMB 5 million of which RMB 800,000 has been paid up. The Company has submitted an application to the PRC government to expand its scope of business activities to include ecological tourism. In accordance to the agreements detailed above, SZTRHF has been accounted for a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company.   This Current Report contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those discussed in this Current Report. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, the following.            2           Additional Financing Requirements   From time to time, in order to expand operations to meet customer demand, the Company will need to incur additional capital expenditures. These capital expenditures are intended to be funded from third party sources, including the incurring of debt and/or the sale of additional equity securities. In addition to requiring additional financing to fund capital expenditures, the Company may require additional financing to fund working capital, research and development, sales and marketing, general and administrative expenditures and operating losses. The incurrence of debt creates additional financial leverage and therefore an increase in the financial risk of the Company’s operations. The sale of additional equity securities will be dilutive to the interests of current equity holders. In addition, there can be no assurance that such additional financing, whether debt or equity, will be available to the Company or that it will be available on acceptable commercial terms. Any inability to secure such additional financing on appropriate terms could have a materially adverse impact on the business, financial condition and operating results of the Company.   Reliance on Key Personnel    Our success depends to a large extent on the efforts of our key personnel including our executive directors, senior management and key employees. There is no assurance that these key personnel will not voluntarily terminate their employment with our Group. The loss of any of our key personnel could be detrimental to our ongoing operations. Our success will also depend on our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel in order to manage our existing operations as well as our future growth.    Business Combinations    The Company may, in the future, pursue acquisitions of other complementary businesses. The Company may also pursue strategic alliances and joint ventures that leverage its core products and industry experience to expand its product offerings and geographic presence. The Company has limited experience with respect to acquiring other companies and limited experience with respect to forming collaborations, strategic alliances and joint ventures. If the Company were to make any acquisitions, it may not be able to integrate these acquisitions successfully into its existing business and could assume unknown or contingent liabilities. Any future acquisitions the Company makes could also result in large and immediate write-offs or the incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities, any of which could harm the Company’s operating results. Integrating an acquired company also may require management resources that otherwise would be available for ongoing development of the Company’s existing business.   Competition and Market Share    The Chinese tea market in which the Company operates could be considered as highly competitive and fragmented, and the competition is expected to continually increase. Many of the Company’s competitors sell products that are similar to the Company’s products, and the Company’s ability to compete against them is significantly dependent on its ability to distinguish its products from those of its competitors and demonstrate product quality. In addition, consumer preferences and needs may change quickly and frequently, creating opportunities for new competitors to enter the market and for existing competitors to take away the market share of the Company.   Global Economic Conditions May Adversely Affect Our Industry, Business and Results of Operations    Our overall performance depends, in part, on worldwide economic conditions which historically is cyclical in character. The U.S. has largely worked its way out of an economic recession while other key international economies continue to be impacted by a recession, characterized by falling demand for a variety of goods and services, restricted credit, going concern threats to financial institutions, major multinational companies and medium and small businesses, poor liquidity, declining asset values, reduced corporate profitability, extreme volatility in credit, equity and foreign exchange markets and bankruptcies. In markets where our sales occur and which become depressed, these conditions affect the rate of spending and could adversely affect our customers’ ability or willingness to purchase our products, and delay prospective customers’ purchasing decisions, all of which could adversely affect our operating results. In addition, in a weakened economy, companies that have competing products may reduce prices which could also reduce our average selling prices and harm our operating results.            3           Risks Related to Our Capital Stock   The public market for our common stock may be volatile and you could lose all or part of your investment. In the recent past, stocks, specifically those traded on the over-the counter (“OTC”) markets, generally have experienced high levels of volatility. Our common stock is traded on the OTC market under the symbol “TRHF” and is not eligible for trading on any national or regional securities exchange or the NASDAQ National Market. While that status is the Company’s longer term objective, a more active trading market for our common stock may never develop, or if such a market develops, it may not be sustained.   In the past, many companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock have become subject to securities class action litigation. We may be the target of this type of litigation in the future. Securities litigation against us could result in substantial costs and divert our management’s attention from other business concerns, which could seriously harm our business.   The Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) has adopted regulations which generally define a “penny stock” to be an equity security that has a market price of less than $5.00 per share, subject to specific exemptions. The market price of our common stock is less than $5.00 per share and therefore is a “penny stock” and is subject to the “penny stock” rules of the SEC. The trading market in our securities is currently limited and relatively illiquid which status makes transactions in our stock cumbersome and may reduce the value of an investment in our common stock. Brokers and dealers effecting transactions in “penny stock” must disclose certain information concerning the transaction, obtain a written agreement from the purchaser and determine that the purchaser is reasonably suitable to purchase the securities. These rules may restrict the ability of brokers or dealers to sell our common stock and may affect your ability to sell shares.   We Have Not Voluntarily Implemented Various Corporate Governance Measures    Federal legislation, including the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, has resulted in the adoption of various corporate governance measures designed to promote the integrity of the corporate management and the securities markets. Some of these measures have been adopted in response to legal requirements. Others have been adopted by companies in response to the requirements of national securities exchanges, such as the NYSE or The NASDAQ Stock Market, on which their securities are listed. Among the corporate governance measures that are required under the rules of national securities exchanges are those that address board of directors' independence, audit committee oversight and the adoption of a Code of Ethics. The Company has not adopted exchange-mandated corporate governance measures and, since our securities are not listed on a national securities exchange, we are not required to do so. It is possible that if we were to adopt some or all of these corporate governance measures, stockholders would benefit from somewhat greater assurances that internal corporate decisions were being made by disinterested directors and that policies had been implemented to define responsible conduct. For example, in the absence of audit, nominating and compensation committees comprised of at least a majority of independent directors, decisions concerning matters such as compensation packages to our senior officers and recommendations for director nominees may be made by a majority of directors who have an interest in the outcome of the matters being decided. Prospective investors should bear in mind our current lack of corporate governance measures in formulating their investment decisions.    We May Be Exposed to Potential Risks Relating to Our Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.   As directed by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (“SOX 404”), the SEC has adopted rules requiring public companies to include a report of management on the Company's internal control over financial reporting in its annual reports. While we expect to expend significant resources in developing the necessary documentation and testing procedures required by SOX 404, there is a risk that we will not comply with all of the requirements imposed thereby. At present, there is no precedent available with which to measure compliance adequately. In the event we identify significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting that we cannot remediate in a timely manner, investors and others may lose confidence in the reliability of our financial statements and our ability to obtain equity or debt financing could suffer.            4           The Company Does Not Expect to Pay Dividends in the Foreseeable Future.   The Company has never paid cash dividends on its common stock and has no plans to do so in the foreseeable future. The Company instead intends to retain earnings, if any, to develop and expand its business.   Provisions of our Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws May Delay or Prevent Take-over Which May Not Be in the Best Interests of Our Shareholders.   Provisions of our articles of incorporation and bylaws may be deemed to have anti-takeover effects, which include when and by whom special meetings of our stockholders may be called, and may delay, defer or prevent a takeover attempt. In addition, certain provisions of the Nevada Revised Statutes also may be deemed to have certain anti-takeover effects which include that control of shares acquired in excess of certain specified thresholds will not possess any voting rights unless these voting rights are approved by a majority of a corporation's disinterested stockholders.   Any Investment in Our Securities Involves a High Degree of Risk   Investors should consider carefully the risks and uncertainties described above, and all other information in this Form 8-K and in any reports hereafter filed with the SEC before deciding whether to purchase or hold our securities. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also become important factors that may harm our business. The occurrence of any of the risks described in this Form 8-K could harm our business. The trading price of our securities could decline due to any of these risks and uncertainties, and investors may lose part or all of their investment.   SECTION 2 - FINANCIAL INFORMATION   ITEM 2.01 Completion of Acquisition or Disposition of Assets.   As previously reported in Form 8-K filed on July 13, 2015:   On July 9, 2015, TRHF acquired all of the outstanding equity of HPIL.

Through the aforementioned companies, TRHF altered its business plan so that it is now a provider of platforms supporting relaxed and replenishing life in beautiful ecological countryside.

As payment for the Companies, TRHF issued 587,420,000 shares of its common stock to the Shareholders, as directed by Wang Bo. Prior to the date of the Exchange Agreement, Wang Bo was the majority shareholder of TRHF and a number of the Shareholders were shareholders of TRHF. Prior to the change of control event described in TRHF's Form 8-K filed on June 16, 2015, Wang Bo, the Shareholders and their affiliates had no interaction with TRHF other than the negotiation.            5           ITEM 2.02 Results of Operations and Financial Condition.   Business Acquired   The Company was incorporated in 2012 and is a Chinese limited company.   Market Analysis and Distribution   TRHF Limited, Inc. operates the management platform with unique, fashionable and innovative lifestyle as well as membership system of the motor home travel camp for consumption.

This was caused by an increase in production.    General and Administrative Expenses   General and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2014 were $101,808 compared to $17,140 for the year ended December 31, 2013. The increase was the result of the hiring of additional staff.    Net Loss   Net loss for the year ended December 31, 2014 was ($96,033) compared to a net loss of ($7,157) for the year ended December 31, 2013. This increase in the loss was due to increase in general and administrative expenses.   Liquidity and Capital Resources   Cash Flow Activities   Cash of $26,206 at December 31, 2013 compared to cash of $959 at December 31, 2014. This decrease was mainly attributable to cash used in operating activities and investing activities.   Financing Activities   During the year ended December 31, 2013, TRHF received financing of $0, and received no funding during the year ended December 31, 2014.    Six Months Ended June 30, 2015 Compared to Six Months Ended June 30, 2014    Revenue   There was no revenue in the six months ended June 30, 2014 or 2015.            8           Cost of Sales   There was no cost of sales in the six months ended June 30, 2014 or 2015.   General and Administrative Expenses   General and administrative expenses for the six months ended June 30, 2015 were $24,102 compared to $35,666 for the six months ended June 30, 2014.

This increase was mainly attributable to cash received from financing activities.   Financing Activities   During the six months ended June 30, 2015, TRHF received financing of $49,271, but received no funding during the six months ended June 30, 2014.    Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates   The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires our management to make assumptions, estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements, including the notes thereto, and related disclosures of commitments and contingencies, if any. We consider our critical accounting policies to be those that require the more significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of financial statements, including the following:   Use of Estimates   The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.            9           Fair Value of Financial Instruments   The Company’s financial instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents, trade receivables, prepaid expenses, payables and accrued expenses, Fair value estimates are made at a specific point in time, based on relevant market information about the financial instrument. These estimates are subjective in nature and involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment and therefore cannot be determined with precision. We consider the carrying values of our financial instruments in the consolidated financial statements to approximate fair value, due to their short-term nature.   Property and Equipment   Property and equipment are recorded at cost, less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is provided for using straight-line methods over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets, usually three to seven years.   Valuation of Long-Lived Assets   We periodically evaluate long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. If the estimated future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) from the use of an asset were less than the carrying value, a write-down would be recorded to reduce the related asset to its estimated fair value. We do not believe that there has been any impairment to long-lived assets as of December 31, 2013 and 2014 or June 30, 2014 and 2015.   Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements   We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements as defined in Regulation S-K Item 303(a)(4).   Recent Accounting Pronouncements   (See “Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements” in Note 2 of Notes to the Financial Statements.)   SECTION 4 - MATTERS RELATED TO ACCOUNTANTS AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   ITEM 4.01.

There had been no disagreements with Harris on any matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure, or auditing scope or procedure from inception of TRHF on September 24, 2013 to December 31, 2014 nor from December 31, 2014 through June 23, 2015.            10           Newly Appointed Auditor:   On July 6, 2015, the Company engaged Gary Cheng CPA Limited as its independent accountant to provide auditing services for any prior periods audited by Harris that the Company may rely on in the future and going forward for the Company.

These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.   We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.   In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Health Plus International Limited as of December 31, 2014 and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year then ended in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.   The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 1 to the financial statements, the Company had incurred substantial losses in previous years and has a working capital deficit, which raises substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Management’s plans in regards to these matters are also described in Note 1. These financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.         San Mateo, California     WWC, P.C.

ORGANIZATION AND PRINCIPAL ACTIVITIES   Business   Health Plus International Limited (“the Company”) is a limited company registered in BVI, was incorporated on May 13, 2014. No operation was occurred during the period. The Company is wholly owned by TRHF Company Limited, Inc.. The Company has registered capital of US$100. The capital has been paid up in its entirety.   Basis of Presentation   The accompanying financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“US GAAP”).   Going Concern   The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis which assumes the Company will be able to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business for the foreseeable future. The Company has incurred a loss since Inception (May 13, 2014) resulting in an accumulated deficit of $40,620 as of December 31, 2014 and further losses are anticipated in the development of its business. Accordingly, there is substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.    The ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon the Company generating profitable operations in the future and/or to obtain the necessary financing to meet its obligations and repay its liabilities arising from normal business operations when they come due. Management intends to finance operating costs over the next twelve months with existing cash on hand and loans from directors and/or private placement of common stock.        2.  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES        (a)  Method of Accounting   The Company maintains its general ledger and journals with the accrual method of accounting for financial reporting purposes. The financial statements and notes are representations of management. Accounting policies adopted by the Company conform to generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America and have been consistently applied in the presentation of financial statements.            F-8          HEALTH PLUS INTERNATIONAL LIMITED NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AS OF AND FOR THE PERIOD ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2014          (b)  Use of Estimates   In preparing financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, management makes estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements, as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting years. These accounts and estimates include, but are not limited to, the estimation on useful lives of property, plant and equipment. Actual results could differ from those estimates.        (c)  Cash and Cash Equivalents   Cash and cash equivalents include cash in hand and cash in time deposits, certificates of deposit and all highly liquid debt instruments with original maturities of three months or less. As of December 31, 2014, cash and cash equivalents were mainly denominated in USD in Hong Kong.        (d)  Accounting for Impairment of Long-Lived Assets   The Company adopts Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 360, “Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Live Assets”, which addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long-lived assets. The Company periodically evaluates the carrying value of long-lived assets to be held and used in accordance with ASC 360 which requires impairment losses to be recorded on long-lived assets used in operations when indicators of impairment are present and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the assets’ carrying amounts. In that event, a loss is recognized based on the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair market value of the long-lived assets.   The long-lived assets held and used by the Company are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of assets may not be recoverable. It is reasonably possible that these assets could become impaired as a result of technology or other industry changes. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is determined by comparing the carrying amount of an asset to future net undiscounted cash flows to be generated by the assets.   If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets. Assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell. During the reporting periods, there was no impairment loss.        (e)  General & Administrative Expenses   General and administrative expenses include audit fee and legal and professional fee.            F-9          HEALTH PLUS INTERNATIONAL LIMITED NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AS OF AND FOR THE PERIOD ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2014        (f)  Income Taxes   The Company adopts SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, included in the Codification as ASC 740, Income Taxes, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements or tax returns. Under this method, deferred income taxes are recognized for the tax consequences in future years of differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their financial reporting amounts at each period end based on enacted tax laws and statutory tax rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income. Valuation allowances are established, when necessary, to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized.   On January 1, 2007, The Company adopted the provisions of FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes (“FIN 48”), included in the Codification as ASC 740, Income Taxes. The topic addresses the determination of whether tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return should be recorded in the financial statements. Under ASC 740, the Company may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position should be measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. ASC 740 also provides guidance on de-recognition, classification, interest and penalties on income taxes, accounting in interim periods and requires increased disclosures.        (g)  Fair Value of Financial Instruments   For certain of the Company’s financial instruments, including cash and equivalents, accounts and other receivables, accounts and other payables, accrued liabilities and short-term debt, the carrying amounts approximate their fair values due to their short maturities. ASC Topic 820, “Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures,” requires disclosure of the fair value of financial instruments held by the Company. ASC Topic 825, “Financial Instruments,” defines fair value, and establishes a three-level valuation hierarchy for disclosures of fair value measurement that enhances disclosure requirements for fair value measures. The carrying amounts reported in the balance sheets for receivables and current liabilities each qualify as financial instruments and are a reasonable estimate of their fair values because of the short period of time between the origination of such instruments and their expected realization and their current market rate of interest. The three levels of valuation hierarchy are defined as follows:        ·  Level 1 inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.        ·  Level 2 inputs to the valuation methodology include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, and inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the financial instrument.        ·  Level 3 inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to the fair value measurement.   The Company analyzes all financial instruments with features of both liabilities and equity under ASC 480, “Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity,” and ASC 815.   The Company's financial instruments include cash and equivalents, accounts receivable, and accounts payable. Cash and cash equivalents consist deposits financial institutions with original maturities of three months or less. Management estimates the carrying amounts of the non-related party financial instruments approximate their fair values due to their short-term nature.            F-10          HEALTH PLUS INTERNATIONAL LIMITED NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AS OF AND FOR THE PERIOD ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2014        (h)  Recent Accounting Pronouncements   In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers: Topic 606. This Update affects any entity that either enters into contracts with customers to transfer goods or services or enters into contracts for the transfer of nonfinancial assets, unless those contracts are within the scope of other standards. The guidance in this Update supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in Topic 605, Revenue Recognition and most industry-specific guidance. The core principle of the guidance is that an entity should recognize revenue to illustrate the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The new guidance also includes a cohesive set of disclosure requirements that will provide users of financial statements with comprehensive information about the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from a reporting organization’s contracts with customers. This ASU is effective retrospectively for the Company for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years beginning after December 15, 2016. Management is evaluating the effect, if any, on the Company’s financial position and results of operations.   In June 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-12, Compensation-Stock Compensation: Topic 718. This amendment requires that a performance target that affects vesting and that could be achieved after the requisite service period be treated as a performance condition. This ASU is effective for annual periods and interim periods within those annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015. Earlier adoption is permitted. The Company does not expect the adoption of this guidance will have a significant impact on the Company’s financial statements.   In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-15, “Disclosure of Uncertainties About an Entity’s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern” (“ASU 2014-15”), which requires management to perform interim and annual assessments of an entity’s ability to continue as a going concern within one year of the date the financial statements are issued and provides guidance on determining when and how to disclose going concern uncertainties in the financial statements. Certain disclosures will be required if conditions give rise to substantial doubt about an entity’s ability to continue as a going concern. ASU 2014-15 applies to all entities and is effective for annual and interim reporting periods ending after December 15, 2016, with early adoption permitted. The Company does not expect that the adoption of this standard will have a material effect on the Company’s financial statements.   In November 2014, FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-16, Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Determining Whether the Host Contract in a Hybrid Financial Instrument Issued in the Form of a Share Is More Akin to Debt or to Equity (a consensus of the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force).The amendments permit the use of the Fed Funds Effective Swap Rate (also referred to as the Overnight Index Swap Rate, or OIS) as a benchmark interest rate for hedge accounting purposes. Public business entities are required to implement the new requirements in fiscal years (and interim periods within those fiscal years) beginning after December 15, 2015. All other types of entities are required to implement the new requirements in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015, and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2016. The Company does not expect the adoption of ASU 2014-16 to have material impact on the Company's financial statement.            F-11          HEALTH PLUS INTERNATIONAL LIMITED NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AS OF AND FOR THE PERIOD ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2014        (i)  Contingencies   Certain conditions may exist as of the date the financial statements are issued, which may result in a loss to the Company but which will only be resolved when one or more future events occur or fail to occur. The Company’s management assesses such contingent liabilities, and such assessment inherently involves an exercise of judgment. In assessing loss contingencies related to legal proceedings that are pending against the Company or un-asserted claims that may result in such proceedings, the Company’s management evaluates the perceived merits of any legal proceedings or un-asserted claims as well as the perceived merits of the amount of relief sought or expected to be sought.   If the assessment of a contingency indicates that it is probable that a material loss has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be estimated, then the estimated liability would be accrued in the Company’s financial statements. If the assessment indicates that a potential material loss contingency is not probable but is reasonably possible, or is probable but cannot be estimated, then the nature of the contingent liability, together with an estimate of the range of possible loss if determinable and material would be disclosed.   Loss contingencies considered to be remote by management are generally not disclosed unless they involve guarantees, in which case the guarantee would be disclosed.       3.  INCOME TAX   The Company was incorporated in the British Virgin Islands (“BVI”) and has no operation for the period ended December 31, 2014.   The provision for income taxes consists of the following:            2014                  Current:     $ -      BVI       -          $ -      Deferred:               BVI       -             -      The reconciliation of BVI statutory income tax rate to the Company’s effective income tax rate is as follows:            2014                  Income tax at BVI statutory (0%)       -      Provision for income taxes       -           F-12          HEALTH PLUS INTERNATIONAL LIMITED NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AS OF AND FOR THE PERIOD ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2014   Uncertain Tax Positions   Interest associated with unrecognized tax benefits are classified as income tax, and penalties are classified in general and administrative expenses in the statements of operations. For the period ended December 31, 2014, the Company had no unrecognized tax benefits and related interest and penalties expenses. Currently, the Company is not subject to examination by major tax jurisdictions.       4.  CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS    Cash and cash equivalents consisted of the following:            2014                  Cash    $ 180      Bank and other cash equivalents       -          $ 180          5.  RELATED PARTY TRANSACTION   During the period ended December 31, 2014, the Company obtained an advance of USD 700 from a director, who is also an officer of the Company. The loan was unsecured, non-interest bearing and payable upon demand.        6.  SUBSEQUENT EVENTS    The Company has evaluated subsequent events for potential recognition and disclosure through the date of financial statements are issued.    No significant event occurred from December 31, 2014 to the date these financial statements are filed with the Securities Exchange Commission that would have a material impact on the Company’s financial statements.          F-13                   HEALTH PLUS INTERNATIONAL LIMITED CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSAS OF AND FOR THE PERIOD ENDED JUNE 30, 2015 AND DECEMBER 31, 2014 (STATED IN U.S. DOLLARS)                   F-14          HEALTH PLUS INTERNATIONAL LIMITED         CONTENTS     PAGES                  CONDENSED BALANCE SHEETS       F-16                     CONDENSED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS       F-17                     CONDENSED STATEMENTS OF COMPREHENSIVE LOSS       F-17                     CONDENSED STATEMENTS OF STOCKHOLDERS' DEFICIENCY       F-18                     CONDENSED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS       F-19                     NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS       F-20 -

ORGANIZATION AND PRINCIPAL ACTIVITIES   Business   Health Plus International Limited (“the Company”) is a limited company registered in BVI, was incorporated on May 13, 2014. No operation was occurred during the period. The Company is wholly owned by TRHF Company Limited, Inc.. The Company has registered capital of US$50,000. The capital has been paid up in its entirety.   Basis of Presentation   The accompanying financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“US GAAP”).   Going Concern   The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis which assumes the Company will be able to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business for the foreseeable future. The Company has incurred a loss since inception (May 13, 2014) resulting in an accumulated deficit of $54,220 as of June 30, 2015 and further losses are anticipated in the development of its business. Accordingly, there is substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.    The ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon the Company generating profitable operations in the future and/or to obtain the necessary financing to meet its obligations and repay its liabilities arising from normal business operations when they come due. Management intends to finance operating costs over the next twelve months with existing cash on hand and loans from directors and/or private placement of common stock.        2.  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES        (a)  Method of Accounting   The Company maintains its general ledger and journals with the accrual method of accounting for financial reporting purposes. The financial statements and notes are representations of management. Accounting policies adopted by the Company conform to generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America and have been consistently applied in the presentation of financial statements.            F-20          HEALTH PLUS INTERNATIONAL LIMITED NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AS OF AND FOR SIX-MONTH PERIODS ENDED JUNE 30, 2015 AND DECEMBER, 31 2014           (b)  Use of Estimates   In preparing financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, management makes estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements, as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting years. These accounts and estimates include, but are not limited to, the estimation on useful lives of property, plant and equipment. Actual results could differ from those estimates.        (c)  Cash and Cash Equivalents   Cash and cash equivalents include cash in hand and cash in time deposits, certificates of deposit and all highly liquid debt instruments with original maturities of three months or less. As of June 30, 2015, cash and cash equivalents were mainly denominated in USD in Hong Kong.        (d)  Accounting for Impairment of Long-Lived Assets   The Company adopts Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 360, “Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Live Assets”, which addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long-lived assets. The Company periodically evaluates the carrying value of long-lived assets to be held and used in accordance with ASC 360 which requires impairment losses to be recorded on long-lived assets used in operations when indicators of impairment are present and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the assets’ carrying amounts. In that event, a loss is recognized based on the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair market value of the long-lived assets.   The long-lived assets held and used by the Company are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of assets may not be recoverable. It is reasonably possible that these assets could become impaired as a result of technology or other industry changes. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is determined by comparing the carrying amount of an asset to future net undiscounted cash flows to be generated by the assets.   If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets. Assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell. During the reporting periods, there was no impairment loss.        (e)  General & Administrative Expenses   General and administrative expenses include audit fee and legal and professional fee.            F-21          HEALTH PLUS INTERNATIONAL LIMITED NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AS OF AND FOR SIX-MONTH PERIODS ENDED JUNE 30, 2015 AND DECEMBER, 31 2014        (f)  Income Taxes   The Company adopts SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, included in the Codification as ASC 740, Income Taxes, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements or tax returns. Under this method, deferred income taxes are recognized for the tax consequences in future years of differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their financial reporting amounts at each period end based on enacted tax laws and statutory tax rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income. Valuation allowances are established, when necessary, to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized.      The Company adopted the provisions of FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes (“FIN 48”), included in the Codification as ASC 740, Income Taxes. The topic addresses the determination of whether tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return should be recorded in the financial statements. Under ASC 740, the Company may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position should be measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. ASC 740 also provides guidance on de-recognition, classification, interest and penalties on income taxes, accounting in interim periods and requires increased disclosures.             (g)  Fair Value of Financial Instruments   For certain of the Company’s financial instruments, including cash and equivalents, accounts and other receivables, accounts and other payables, accrued liabilities and short-term debt, the carrying amounts approximate their fair values due to their short maturities. ASC Topic 820, “Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures,” requires disclosure of the fair value of financial instruments held by the Company. ASC Topic 825, “Financial Instruments,” defines fair value, and establishes a three-level valuation hierarchy for disclosures of fair value measurement that enhances disclosure requirements for fair value measures. The carrying amounts reported in the balance sheets for receivables and current liabilities each qualify as financial instruments and are a reasonable estimate of their fair values because of the short period of time between the origination of such instruments and their expected realization and their current market rate of interest. The three levels of valuation hierarchy are defined as follows:        ·  Level 1 inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.        ·  Level 2 inputs to the valuation methodology include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, and inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the financial instrument.        ·  Level 3 inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to the fair value measurement.   The Company analyzes all financial instruments with features of both liabilities and equity under ASC 480, “Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity,” and ASC 815.   The Company's financial instruments include cash and equivalents, accounts receivable, and accounts payable. Cash and cash equivalents consist deposits financial institutions with original maturities of three months or less. Management estimates the carrying amounts of the non-related party financial instruments approximate their fair values due to their short-term nature.            F-22          HEALTH PLUS INTERNATIONAL LIMITED NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AS OF AND FOR SIX-MONTH PERIODS ENDED JUNE 30, 2015 AND DECEMBER, 31 2014        (h)  Recent Accounting Pronouncements   In January 2015, The FASB issued ASU No. 2015-01, “Income Statement— Extraordinary and Unusual Items (Subtopic 225-20)”.This Update eliminates from GAAP the concept of extraordinary items. Subtopic 225-20, Income Statement—Extraordinary and Unusual Items, required that an entity separately classify, present, and disclose extraordinary events and transactions. Presently, an event or transaction is presumed to be an ordinary and usual activity of the reporting entity unless evidence clearly supports its classification as an extraordinary item. Paragraph 225-20-45-2 contains the following criteria that must both be met for extraordinary classification:        1.   Unusual nature. The underlying event or transaction should possess a high degree of abnormality and be of a type clearly unrelated to, or only incidentally related to, the ordinary and typical activities of the entity, taking into account the environment in which the entity operates.        2.   Infrequency of occurrence. The underlying event or transaction should be of a type that would not reasonably be expected to recur in the foreseeable future, taking into account the environment in which the entity operates.   If an event or transaction meets the criteria for extraordinary classification, an entity is required to segregate the extraordinary item from the results of ordinary operations and show the item separately in the income statement, net of tax after income from continuing operations. The entity also is required to disclose applicable income taxes and either present or disclose earnings-per-share data applicable to the extraordinary item.    The amendments in this Update are effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2015. A reporting entity may apply the amendments prospectively. A reporting entity also may apply the amendments retrospectively to all prior periods presented in the financial statements. Early adoption is permitted provided that the guidance is applied from the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption. The effective date is the same for both public business entities and all other entities.   The Company adopted ASU No. 2015-01 prospectively and has applied it to the presentation of the financial statements.   As of June 30, 2015, there are no other recently issued accounting standards not yet adopted that would or could have a material effect on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.            F-23          HEALTH PLUS INTERNATIONAL LIMITED NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AS OF AND FOR SIX-MONTH PERIODS ENDED JUNE 30, 2015 AND DECEMBER, 31 2014        (i)  Contingencies   Certain conditions may exist as of the date the financial statements are issued, which may result in a loss to the Company but which will only be resolved when one or more future events occur or fail to occur. The Company’s management assesses such contingent liabilities, and such assessment inherently involves an exercise of judgment. In assessing loss contingencies related to legal proceedings that are pending against the Company or un-asserted claims that may result in such proceedings, the Company’s management evaluates the perceived merits of any legal proceedings or un-asserted claims as well as the perceived merits of the amount of relief sought or expected to be sought.   If the assessment of a contingency indicates that it is probable that a material loss has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be estimated, then the estimated liability would be accrued in the Company’s financial statements. If the assessment indicates that a potential material loss contingency is not probable but is reasonably possible, or is probable but cannot be estimated, then the nature of the contingent liability, together with an estimate of the range of possible loss if determinable and material would be disclosed.   Loss contingencies considered to be remote by management are generally not disclosed unless they involve guarantees, in which case the guarantee would be disclosed.       (j)   Unaudited Interim Financial Information  These unaudited interim condensed financial statements have been prepared in accordance with GAAP for interim financial reporting and the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission that permit reduced disclosure for interim periods. Therefore, certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP have been condensed or omitted. In the opinion of management, all adjustments of a normal recurring nature necessary for a fair presentation of the financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented have been made. The results of operations for the interim periods presented are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the year ending December 31, 2015.   The balance sheets and certain comparative information as of December 31, 2014 are derived from the audited financial statements and related notes for the year ended December 31, 2014 (“2014 Annual Financial Statements”), included in the Company’s 2014 Annual Report on Form 10-K. These unaudited interim condensed financial statements should be read in conjunction with the 2014 Annual Financial Statements.            F-24          HEALTH PLUS INTERNATIONAL LIMITED NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AS OF AND FOR SIX-MONTH PERIODS ENDED JUNE 30, 2015 AND DECEMBER, 31 2014       3.  INCOME TAX   The Company was incorporated in the British Virgin Islands (“BVI”) and has no operation for the six-month periods ended June 30, 2015 and 2014.   The provision for income taxes consists of the following:             Six-month periods ended            June 30, 2015        June 30, 2014                           Current:     $ -       $ -      BVI       -          -          $ -       $ -      Deferred:                           BVI       -          -             -          -      The reconciliation of BVI statutory income tax rate to the Company’s effective income tax rate is as follows:            Six-month periods ended            2015        2014                                $        $      BVI statutory income tax rate (0%)       -          -      Provision for income taxes       -          -      Uncertain Tax Positions   Interest associated with unrecognized tax benefits are classified as income tax, and penalties are classified in general and administrative expenses in the statements of operations. For the period ended December 31, 2014, the Company had no unrecognized tax benefits and related interest and penalties expenses. Currently, the Company is not subject to examination by major tax jurisdictions.            F-25          HEALTH PLUS INTERNATIONAL LIMITED NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AS OF AND FOR SIX-MONTH PERIODS ENDED JUNE 30, 2015 AND DECEMBER, 31 2014        4.  CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS    Cash and cash equivalents consisted of the following:            June 30, 2015        December 31, 2014                           Cash    $ 49,480       $ 180      Bank and other cash equivalents       -          -          $ 49,480       $ 180          5.  RELATED PARTY TRANSACTION   During the period ended June 30, 2015 and December 31, 2014, the Company obtained an advance of USD 700 from a director, who is also an officer of the Company. The loan was unsecured, non-interest bearing and payable upon demand.        6.  SUBSEQUENT EVENTS    The Company has evaluated subsequent events for potential recognition and disclosure through the date of financial statements are issued.    No significant event occurred from June 30, 2015 to the date these financial statements are filed with the Securities Exchange Commission that would have a material impact on the Company’s financial statements.             F-26          UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   The following unaudited pro forma consolidated financial statements give effect to the reverse acquisition transaction (the "Reverse Acquisition") between TRHF and HPIL. In the Reverse Acquisition, TRHF issued 587,420,000 shares of its common stock to the shareholders of HPIL in exchange for all of the issued and outstanding Class A common shares of HPIL, which resulted in HPIL becoming a wholly-owned subsidiary of FNHI. As owners and management of HPIL have voting and operating control of FNHI following the Reverse Acquisition, the transaction is accounted for as a reverse acquisition.   The unaudited pro forma consolidated financial statements presented below are prepared by applying the acquisition method of accounting to a business combination that is a reverse acquisition. Pro forma adjustments which give effect to certain transactions occurring as a direct result of the Reverse Acquisition are described in the accompanying unaudited notes presented on the following pages. The Company has used financial statements reported as of and for the six months ended June 30, 2015 for the entities included in the proforma condensed consolidated financial statements. The Company believes that the results of operations and the financial position of the Company and its subsidiaries approximates those results of operations and financial position of the Company at September 9, 2015.     These unaudited pro forma consolidated financial statements are presented for illustrative purposes only and are not necessarily indicative of the consolidated financial position or results of operations in future periods or the results that actually would have been realized had FNHI and HPIL been a combined company during the specified periods. The unaudited pro forma consolidated financial statements, including the notes thereto, are qualified in their entirety by reference to, and should be read in conjunction with, HPIL's audited financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, HPIL's unaudited interim financial statements for the six month period ended June 30, 2014, TRHF's audited financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2014, TRHF's audited financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2013, as included in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014, TRHF's unaudited interim financial statements for the quarter ended June 30, 2015 as included in its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2014, and TRHF's unaudited interim financial statements for the quarter ended June 30, 2014 as included in its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2014.            F-27                 TRHF COMPANY LIMITED, INC.(f/k/a LAGOON GROUP CORP.) UNAUDITED PRO FORMA FINANCIAL INFORMATION SEPTEMBER 9, 2015 (STATED IN U.S. DOLLARS)               F-28          TRHF COMPANY LIMITED, INC.

(f/k/a LAGOON GROUP CORP.) NOTES TO UNAUDITED PRO FORMA FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AS OF AND FOR THE PERIOD ENDED SEPTEMBER 9, 2015       1.   ORGANIZATION AND BUSINESS COMBINATIONS  Business   TRHF COMPANY LIMITED, INC. (the "Company") was incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on September 24, 2013. On June 15, 2015, as a result of a private transaction, the control block of stock of the Company, represented by 10,000,000 shares of common stock, was transferred from Anastasiia Iurova to Wang Bo, and a change of control of the Company occurred. The Company then altered its business plan so that it is now a provider of platforms supporting relaxed and replenishing life in a beautiful ecological countryside. On June 16, 2015, the Company amended its Articles of Incorporation with the State of Nevada in order to change its name to TRHF Company Limited, Inc. and to increase the authorized shares of common stock from 75,000,000 to 600,000,000 (the "Amendments"). The name change was undertaken in order to more closely align with the operations of the Company going forward. The increase in authorized shares was undertaken to allow the Company to acquire a new operating entity. The board of directors of the Company approved the Amendments on June 16, 2015. The shareholders of the Company approved of the Amendments by written consent on June 16, 2015.   On July 9, 2015, the Company entered into a share exchange agreement (the "Exchange Agreement") with Health Plus International Ltd. ("HPIL") and Wang Bo, on behalf of himself and certain other individuals who received shares of the Company pursuant to the Exchange Agreement. On the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Exchange Agreement, on July 9, 2015, Wang Bo, holding all 50,000 shares of HPIL common stock, sold, assigned, transferred and delivered, free and clear of all liens, pledges, encumbrances, charges, restrictions or known claims of any kind, nature, or description, all of the shares of HPIL held by him to the Company; the objective of such transfer being the acquisition by the Company of all the issued and outstanding shares of HPIL common stock. In exchange for the transfer of such securities by Wang Bo, the Company is issuing, to the shareholders listed on Composite Exhibit A to the Exchange Agreement (the "Shareholders"), 587,420,000 shares of the Company's common stock, par value $.001 per share, as set forth therein. The Exchange Agreement has been filed as an Exhibit to Form 8-K with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on July 13, 2015. Wang Bo has surrendered his certificate representing all of the HPIL shares to the Company. The Shareholder have received certificates evidencing their ownership of the Company.   On July 9, 2015, the Company acquired all of the outstanding equity of HPIL.   On September 9, 2015, HPIL entered into agreements with Shenzhen Tian Rui Hui Feng Agriculture Co., Ltd. (formerly known as Shenzhen Branch innovation and Technology Company Limited)(“SZTRHF”), its shareholders: Shenzhen City Hai Zhuo Tian Rui Investment Company Limited and Wang Jing, whereby the Company, through HPIL, controls SZTRHF and receives substantially all of the economic benefits of SZTRHF.            F-32          TRHF COMPANY LIMITED, INC. (f/k/a LAGOON GROUP CORP.) NOTES TO UNAUDITED PRO FORMA FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AS OF AND FOR THE PERIOD ENDED SEPTEMBER 9, 2015   The agreements include an Exclusive Option Agreement allowing HPIL or its nominee to acquire the shares of SZTRHF, a Voting Rights Proxy Agreement that provides HPIL with the voting rights of SZTRHF, and an Equity Pledge Agreement that pledges the shares in SZTRHF to HPIL, and a Entrusted Management Agreement whereby the Company has been entrusted to manage and direct the operations SZTRHF for the all of the economic benefits derived in SZTRHF’s operations. Effective control of SZTRHF was transferred to HPIL through these series of contractual arrangements without transferring legal ownership in SZTRHF. As a result, SZTRHF became a variable interest entity (“VIE”) and, accordingly, its financial position and results of operations have been included in the proforma condensed consolidated financial statements of the Company.   SZTRHF is a limited company incorporated on April 6, 2012 in Shenzhen, People’s Republic of China (“PRC”). The SZTRHF is in the business of design and distribution of close caption television and monitoring products for application in the agricultural sector. The Company is owned by Shenzhen City Hai Zhuo Tian Rui Investment Company Limited and Wang Jing, 75% and 25%, respectively. As of the date of these financial statements, the Company has registered for a maximum authorized capital of RMB 5 million of which RMB 800,000 has been paid up. The Company has submitted an application to the PRC government to expand its scope of business activities to include ecological tourism. In accordance to the agreements detailed above, SZTRHF has been accounted for a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company.   Basis of Presentation   The accompanying financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“US GAAP”). The financial statements were prepared on a proforma basis whereby it was assumed that the Company has controlled HPIL and SZTRHF from the first period presented. The transactions detailed above, have been accounted for as reverse takeover transactions and a recapitalization of the Company; accordingly, the Company (the legal acquirer) is considered the accounting acquiree and SZTRHF (the acquiree) is considered the accounting acquirer. No goodwill has been recorded. As a result of this transaction, the Company is deemed to be a continuation of the business of SZTRHF.   The Company has used financial statements reported as of and for the six months ended June 30, 2015 for the entities included in the proforma condensed consolidated financial statements. The Company believes that the results of operations and the financial position of the Company and its subsidiaries approximates those results of operations and financial position of the Company at September 9, 2015.   Going Concern   The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis which assumes the Company will be able to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business for the foreseeable future. As of September 9, 2015, the Company has an accumulated deficit of $624,872 and further losses are anticipated in the development of its business. Accordingly, there is substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.    The ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon the Company generating profitable operations in the future and/or to obtain the necessary financing to meet its obligations and repay its liabilities arising from normal business operations when they come due. Management intends to finance operating costs over the next twelve months with existing cash on hand and loans from directors and/or private placements of common stock.            F-33          TRHF COMPANY LIMITED, INC. (f/k/a LAGOON GROUP CORP.) NOTES TO UNAUDITED PRO FORMA FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AS OF AND FOR THE PERIOD ENDED SEPTEMBER 9, 2015      2.   MATERIAL U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES TO OUR STOCKHOLDERS    Management believes that the share issuances under the share exchange agreement between the Company and the shareholders of FDHG should be recognized as a non-taxable event under the U.S. Internal Revenue Code; accordingly, the Company has not withheld any taxes on behalf its shareholders. Shareholders of the Company should consult with their own tax-preparers to determine their own individual tax liabilities.       3.   ADJUSTING JOURNAL ENTRIES TO PRO FORMA FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  The following adjusting journal entry was recorded on July 9, 2015 to record the issuance of 587,420,000 shares of common stock with par value $0.001 to acquire 100% ownership of Health Plus International Limited:       AJE        Account Name        Debit        Credit                                       1        Common Stock – HPIL Common Stocks       $ 50,000          -               Accumulated deficits       $ 537,420                           Common Stock -- TRHF Common Stocks                   $ 587,420      Common Stock – Issuance of TRHF Common Stocks = 587,420,000 shares x $0.001 = $587,420.   The following adjusting journal entry was recorded on September 9, 2015 to record VIE agreement between TRHF and SZTR:       AJE        Account Name        Debit        Credit                                       2        Common Stock – SZTR Common Stocks       $ 131,099          -               Accumulated deficits – TRHF                   $ 3,291               Accumulated deficits – SZTR                   $ 127,808         4.

proceeds in the order of priority assuming the sale of 30%, 50%, 75% and 100%,

          Miscellaneous expenses       $       - $   1,000 $   1,500 $   2,000

The above figures represent only estimated costs. If necessary, Anastasiia
Iurova, our president and director, has verbally agreed to loan the Company
funds to complete the registration process. Also, these loans would be necessary
if the proceeds from this offering will not be sufficient to implement our
business plan and maintain reporting status and quotation on the OTC Electronic
Bulletin Board when and if our common stocks become eligible for trading on the
Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board. Ms. Iurova will not be paid any compensation or
anything from the proceeds of this offering. There is no due date for the
repayment of the funds advanced by Ms. Iurova. Ms. Iurova will be repaid from
revenues of operations if and when we generate substantial revenues to pay the
obligation. We will not be using any proceeds to purchase or manufacture teeth
whitening products product.


The biggest threat to our success is competition due to low barriers of entry in
teeth whitening product distribution market. If other companies start offering
similar or same products, this will result lower revenue. There are many
domestic and international companies that offer different dental and cosmetic
products. If they start to offer same products, we will be in direct competition
with them. Many of these companies have a greater, more established customer
base than us. We will likely lose business to such companies. Also, many of
these companies will be able to offer better prices for similar products than us
which may also cause us to lose potential customers. We also expect to face
competition from new market entrants.  We may be unable to continue to compete
effectively with these existing or new competitors, which could have a material
adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.


Company Description
Lagoon Group Corp. was incorporated in the State of Nevada on September 24, 
2013. We have minimal revenues, have minimal assets and have incurred losses 
since inception. We are a development-stage company formed to commence 
operations in the distribution of teeth whitening products in Ecuador.


 We have 
recently started our operation. Our operations to date have been devoted 
primarily to start-up and development activities, which include: 

1. Formation of the Company; 

2. Development of our business plan; and 

3. Execution a Marketing and Sales Distribution Agreement with Arturo Rodrigo 
   Perea Lozano, dated June 5, 2014. 

Pursuant to the Marketing and Sales Distribution Agreement, we will
non-exclusively sell Crest 3D White Whitestrips to the distributor, the
distributor will market, sell and distribute the Crest 3D White Whitestrips in
Ecuador. The distributor has no obligation to buy any products from us. 
---

We plan to market and distribute an assortment of teeth whitening products in
Ecuador. Our products will be offered at prices marked-up from 20% to 40% of our
cost. Our customers will be asked to pay us 100% in advance. We plan to fill
placed orders and to supply the products within a period of thirty days (30)
days or less following receipt of any written order. We do not intend to offer
any credit terms relating to order payments. Because our customers will be asked
to pay us 100% in advance, we will not be using any proceeds from this offering
to purchase teeth whitening products. Customers will have two options to pay for
products: by wire transfer or by sending a check/money order. If customer
decides to pay by check/money order, then we will apply a certain amount of days
before shipping to have the check/money order cleared. Customers will be
responsible to cover the shipping costs.  Since we anticipate having a 30-day
period to process/fill orders, we do not plan to purchase inventory in advance,
but rather on request basis. We do not intend to store inventory for any period
of time. The orders will be shipped to the customers upon customers’ requests.
Customers will be responsible for the custom duties, taxes, insurance or any
other additional charges that might incur. We never intend to manufacture our
own teeth whitening products. We plan to sell teeth whitening products from
different manufacturers.
