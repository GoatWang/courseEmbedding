History



























In 1984, after having built successful careers in the private client and brokerage arms of several well-regarded investment firms (including Glore Forgan, Loomis Sayles and Bacon Whipple), William J. O. Roberts, CFA and James D. MacDonald, CIC partnered to form their own investment advisory shop, which ultimately became known as Roberts, Glore & Co.
 
From the outset, Bill and J.D.’s aim was to build an advisory firm that provided both client-focused service and top-notch investment ideas—all at a reasonable cost. In the decades that followed, their emphasis on high-quality investments and attentive service attracted a broad client base encompassing high-net-worth individuals and families, endowment funds, and other institutional accounts across the United States and abroad.
 
During the first decade of the new millennium, Bill and J.D. transitioned ownership of Roberts Glore to their associates Clemens P. Ciupke, CPA and Jim L. Calaway, CFA, CIC, both of whom had been steeped in the firm’s hands-on approach to investing. Since that time, our investment team has continued to grow—and client service, investment acumen, and reasonable costs have remained at the core of our DNA.
 
 
William J. O. Roberts, CFACo-Founder (November 19, 1920 – November 17, 2006)
Bill Roberts was the consummate portfolio manager—ever on the hunt for hidden values and dissecting the increasingly complex nuances of the global financial markets. Bill’s career spanned more than six decades, encompassing market booms and busts, bubbles and recessions, and geopolitical storms of all shapes and sizes. He was among the first recipients of the Chartered Financial Analyst designation and a longstanding member of the CFA Society of Chicago. In everything, he strove to maintain—and to inspire in those around him—a relentless focus on long-term growth and tax efficiency. Indeed, he brought to his investing career the same vision, courage, and indomitable spirit that carried him through the D-Day invasion as a young naval navigator off Utah beach.
 
Bill retired from Roberts, Glore & Co. in 1999 (astute market timing on his part!), but his passion for investing and tax matters never faded. He frequented the office throughout his retirement years to lend his insight in whatever ways he could, even though there was no obligation for him to do so—evidence of his character and his commitment to both our firm and our clients.
 
Bill was much more than a portfolio manager, however. He was an unquenchable and lifelong learner whose interests ranged from economics, statistics, and the finer points of estate and income tax law to archaeology and the arts. His breadth of knowledge was formidable and his love of discovery infectious. He traveled extensively, his pursuit of learning drawing him across the globe. He was also a generous philanthropist and supported endeavors academic, artistic, and humanitarian. Above all, Bill was a man of principal. His example of integrity and professionalism will remain a cornerstone of our firm. We are profoundly grateful for his wisdom and friendship, and we look forward to continuing to expand upon the foundation he worked so hard over many years to build.
 
 
James D. MacDonald, CICCo-Founder (February 13, 1930 – April 24, 2014)
After completing his service as an officer in the U.S. Air Force in 1957, J.D. MacDonald launched his investment career with the storied Harriman, Ripley & Co., where he developed a keen eye for investment opportunities and a reputation for client-focused counsel. J.D. subsequently managed Van Strum & Towne's Chicago office and later moved to Loomis Sayles & Co., where he was awarded the Chartered Investment Counselor designation by the Investment Counsel Association of America (now known as the Investment Adviser Association) in 1976. It was also at Loomis Sayles that he first met Bill Roberts.
 
That auspicious acquaintance blossomed into a working partnership after J.D. and Bill moved on to Bacon, Whipple & Co. in the late 1970’s. While there, both men began to suspect that their tailored approach to investment management could be better pursued in an independent environment. In 1984, after Bacon, Whipple was bought by another prominent investment house, J.D. and Bill saw their opportunity, forming the investment advisory firm that would ultimately become known as Roberts, Glore & Co.
 
In the years that followed, J.D. successfully guided his clients’ portfolios through bull and bear markets with a consistent focus on long-term value creation. At each step of the way, he brought to investment management the same traits that marked his life outside the office: poise, integrity, and a dash of style.
 
In 2007, J.D. entered into a retirement agreement with the remaining partners of Roberts, Glore & Co., but he continued to play a consultative role to our portfolio managers—a tribute to his commitment to both our team and our clients. At the same time, retirement gave him greater opportunity to indulge his passions for woodworking, world travel and hunting—pursuits whose rigors and rewards, incidentally, bore a remarkable resemblance to those of investment management. We remain indebted to J.D. for his friendship, his counsel, and his example of integrity and equanimity in the pursuit of excellence.

What Sets Us Apart





























We invest for the long haul.
 
Financial fads and market momentum come and go, but we believe that the key to successful investing is a steadfast focus on the long term.  We have found that the greatest rewards over time come to those who invest with discipline, patience, and courage, and thereby position themselves to exploit the inevitable mood swings of the financial markets.



 





We seek diversification.
 
We work closely with you to determine an appropriate mix of investments for your portfolio, taking into account your long-term wealth management goals, tax status, and risk tolerance.  This approach often calls for a blend of asset classes, which may include domestic or international equities and fixed income, real estate/timber, commodities, or other alternative assets.
 
Diversification does not ensure against market risk. Special considerations are associated with international investing, including the risk of currency fluctuations and political and economic events. Bonds are subject to market and interest rate risk if sold prior to maturity. Alternative investment products involve a high degree of risk, often engage in leveraging and other speculative investment practices that may increase the risk of investment loss, and can be highly illiquid.



 





We are independent thinkers.
 
We have found that investment success often requires a willingness to stand apart from the crowd—to search for opportunity when others are fearful, and to exercise caution when financial markets are euphoric. This contrarian bent is seldom easy and never popular in the short run, but we have found it to be a compelling strategy for the long run.



 





We take a personalized approach.
 
No two investors are exactly alike, and our asset management reflects that fact.  We examine your long-term investment goals, spending or gifting needs, risk tolerance, and other financial considerations and build a customized investment portfolio shaped by those inputs. Of course, as your financial needs and goals change over time, we adapt accordingly.

Where We Invest





























Stocks
 
We seek opportunities to build equity stakes in higher-quality companies (both in the U.S. and abroad) that are still in the growth stage of their operational lifecycle.  These companies may be dynamic small- or mid-cap names or well-established, larger firms with managers who have found innovative ways to stay on top.  We prefer to buy stocks when they are out of favor with the investment community—and are therefore trading at what we feel are more reasonable prices. This requires discipline, patience, and courage.
 
In select cases, we may also pursue modest stakes in companies with the potential to benefit from a turnaround in operational effectiveness, management, ownership structure, and/or market recognition. We generally aim to acquire shares in such companies at a discount to our estimate of their fair value. Moreover, we may use low-cost index funds or exchange-traded funds to gain exposure to sectors or countries where we feel long-term valuations appear attractive.
 
Our investment approach typically produces an annual turnover rate of roughly 20% or lower, which translates to a holding period of five years or longer on average. Low turnover is efficient not only from the standpoint of reducing taxes; it also lowers transaction costs.
 
Investors should consider index and exchange-traded funds’ investment objectives, risks, charges, and expenses carefully before investing. The prospectus, which contains this and other important information, is available from your financial advisor and should be read carefully before investing.



 





Bonds
 
Our approach to bond selection hinges on your tax situation and income needs.  We tend to buy short-to-intermediate-term bonds with an eye to holding them to maturity.  Generally, our preference is for the highest quality investment-grade bonds, including high-grade corporate credit, municipal bonds (both tax-exempt and taxable, as appropriate), U.S. agency issues, and traditional or zero-coupon U.S. Treasury issues.  At times, we also make use of Treasury Inflation Protected Securities (“TIPS”) or other inflation-indexed bond instruments, which help to mitigate inflation’s impact on a bond portfolio’s principal value.
 
When we feel potential interest rate trends warrant it, we are willing to invest in intermediate- to longer-duration bond holdings. We may also employ select foreign sovereign debt instruments to capture attractive inflation-adjusted yields and guard against weakness in the U.S. dollar. Moreover, we may invest in low-cost bond index vehicles or actively managed bond mutual funds to gain diversification and balance where appropriate.
 
Bonds are subject to market and interest rate risk if sold prior to maturity. Bond values and yields will decline as interest rates rise and bonds are subject to availability and change in price.



 




Alternative Assets
 
We search for opportunities to invest in asset classes that exhibit low or negative correlations to traditional stocks or bonds, and thus have the potential to enhance your portfolio’s risk-return profile. Such investments may include timber, commodity-related vehicles, real estate, or other alternative assets. We look for investments with reasonable costs and compelling long-term dynamics, and we place an emphasis on publicly marketable securities.
 
Alternative investment products involve a high degree of risk, often engage in leveraging and other speculative investment practices that may increase the risk of investment loss, and can be highly illiquid.
