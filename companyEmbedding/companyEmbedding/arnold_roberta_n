Council of Michigan Foundations

                    The Council of Michigan Foundations is a community of members committed to growing the impact of Michigan philanthropy through investing in the state's charitable organizations, convening business, government and nonprofit leaders, collaborating on critical issues, seeking innovative solutions, sharing knowledge and advocating. Created in 1972 at the request of Michigan grantmaking organizations, the Council of Michigan Foundations (CMF) was formed as a 501c(3) membership association to represent foundation interests with state and federal officials at a time when private philanthropy was under intense scrutiny by Congress and in response to the 1969 Congressional hearings on private foundations.  The Council of Michigan Foundations has grown to become one of the nation’s largest regional associations of grantmakers, serving more than 330 members - family foundations, corporate foundations and giving programs, independent and community foundations, and public charities of all sizes - representing over 85% of the organized philanthropic assets in the state of Michigan.

    The Practice of
Wisdom:

    
A Contribution to Clinical Philosophy
      by
Arnold Bernstein, Ph.D.



                                         
phi-los-o-phy, n. 1. the rational investigationof the truths and principles of being, knowledge,or conduct. 2. the pursuit of wisdom.
 
 





      
We may insist as often as we like that man's
intellect is powerless in comparison with his instinctual life, and we may be right in this. Nevertheless, there is something peculiar about this weakness.  The voice of the intellect is
a soft one, but it does not rest until it has gained a hearing.  Finally, after a countless succession of rebuffs, it succeeds.

 Sigmund Freud

 
 
 






Without a philosophy, a psychotherapist
is like a navigator without a map or a destination.  This paper offers
such a philosophical approach to some of the issues surrounding the nature
and future of psychoanalysis.  It proposes a philosophy broad enough
in its purview to shift the emphasis of psychoanalysis from its present
focus on the pathological to that of the normal.
Psychoanalysis encompasses far more
than merely a technique of psychotherapy.  It is an exotic mix of
art, science and intuition.  Though it endeavors to be scientific
in its theoretical constructs, it is a performing art in its practices. 
Even the most cursory examination of the titles of Freud’s publications
will reveal the sweep of his interests.  Besides psychopathology and
psychotherapy, Freud applied the psychoanalytic method to the analysis
of dreams, sexuality, human development, character and personality, everyday
life, wit and humor, the family, the human condition, biography, history,
religion, cultural anthropology, civilization, folklore, and countless
other topics.  Indeed, as I hope to show, Freud was hardly just a
psychoanalyst, but he was in addition, what I will identify as a clinical
philosopher.
Strictly speaking, the psychoanalytic
method or what is usually called psychoanalyzing, consists of interpreting.  
Interpreting is a form of thinking that involves the translation of the
symbolic or unconscious meanings of words and deeds into conscious thoughts. 
Such interpretations or thoughts can then be written or spoken or simply
allowed to remain the silent basis of the actions used in the service of
psychotherapy.   Proficiency in the art of interpretation is
the hallmark of a psychoanalyst.
Today we shall be talking about
the formulation of a new discipline, which could be called clinical philosophy.  
Clinical philosophy would be an amalgam of psychoanalysis (which would
remain as its core) augmented by the applicable findings from other related
fields, mainly psychotherapy, psychology and philosophy.
Since its beginnings in the last
century, the theory and practice of psychoanalysis has undergone many changes. 
At the same time it has had to resist certain other changes in order to
preserve its identity.  From a specialized treatment of the symptoms
of psychoneuroses (which were at that time thought to be diseases of the
nervous system), it has gradually grown into a general theory of the mind
that is applicable to understanding the whole range of human emotions and
psychic misery.  This is what Freud meant when he predicted that,
"The future will probably attribute far greater importance to psycho-analysis
as the science of the unconscious than as a therapeutic procedure."
My hope today is to stimulate some
new thoughts about psychoanalysis by looking at some old ideas and placing
them in a new context.  In each instance, although the words and ideas
used by me will be familiar, I hope that by reframing them in a larger
context they will acquire fresh meanings.   For example, take
the word soul.  By a soul I will simply mean a person: - as in the
expression,  “She is a good soul.“   But also notice the
implications of emphasizing that she is a good soul (as contrasted to saying
that she has a good soul).  She is then seen as the person that she
is, rather than as the body that she has: - hence the expression, “body
and soul.”  We will return to the subject of the soul later.
And now we must address another
familiar concept, that of resistance: - first the concept of resistance
in general, and then later the particular kind of resistance shown by analysts,
that though very common, goes largely unnoticed.
I feel obliged to do this because
I intend to introduce a different way of looking at things.  And the
general resistance to which I refer is the one that occurs almost universally
when any new or different idea is introduced, or a change is suggested
in the accepted way of doing things.  It is the resistance to changing
one’s mind.
It was this resistance that greeted
Freud when he first introduced psychoanalysis to the world, and it is this
resistance that continues to be mobilized almost every time a new innovation
in psychoanalytic theory or practice is suggested.  Max Planck, the
great physicist once remarked, not totally with tongue in cheek, that we
never succeed in convincing our contemporaries.  We just have to outlive
them.
But there really isn’t anything
so surprising about this, because resistance-to-change is a universal phenomenon. 
It is evident not only in the world of ideas but in the physical world
as well.
According to physicists, inertia
is a fundamental property of all matter. Inertia is defined as the resistance
that a body presents to a change in its speed or position (upon the application
of a force): or the opposition that an object or a substance presents to
passage through it.   So resistance is in the very nature of
being.   Something in the sensory world is known to “exist” only
when it resists!
Consequently resistance is a fundamental
property of existence.  If something doesn’t resist, it isn’t there. 
In the psychological sphere, identity and character are sources of such
resistances.
In biology, resistance refers to
the self-preservative mechanisms of living creatures by which they defend
themselves against disease: - or the capacity of tissues to withstand the
effects of harmful environmental agents.  In politics, resistance
refers to the forces that oppose oppression.   In a general sense,
a resistance is any defense of the status quo.   It is any opposition
to change.   And it can be either passive or aggressive.
But inertia, force and resistance
have psychological meanings as well.  Thus the term, resistance can
be used to describe any force, physical or psychological, that opposes
or retards motion or change.  In psychology and psychoanalysis the
forces that are at work are described as ideas and urges, impulses and
drives.  We can speak of the force of ideas and the power of words
and the sexual drive and their resistance to changing.
In psychoanalytic treatment, as
in any human interaction, resistance usually refers to behavior, emotion
or thought that interferes with progressive communication.  
Resistance leads to inhibition of words, thoughts and ideas and can be
an impediment to progress in science as well as in treatment.
Freud long ago identified the compulsion
to repeat (also known as the repetition-compulsion resistance) as an “expression
of the inertia inherent in organic life,” which he called Thanatos. 
This led to the paradox that repetition is a resistance, that is to say
a form of staying the same.  What Lewis Carroll described as, “Running
fast to stay in the same place.” Death, the return to the inorganic state,
becoming the ultimate repetition, in which there is no change.  Life
resists death.  And death resists life.  Things in motion tend
to remain in motion and things at rest tend to remain at rest.
One of the least noticed and most
common counter-transference resistances is a therapist’s over commitment
to a particular theory or method of treatment, or a particular belief system. 
An over zealous commitment to a particular theoretical point of view acts
as a resistance to considering any other point of view either from colleagues
or patients.   Freud remarked that, "Whoever is familiar with
the nature of neurosis will not be astonished to learn that even someone
who is very well able to carry out analysis upon others can behave like
any other mortal and be capable of producing violent resistances as soon
as he himself becomes the object of analytic lnvestlgation.”
These resistances get in the way
of analytic progress in and out of treatment.
 But how does one overcome
the resistance presented by what someone believes?  How does one change
a belief, any belief?  The answer proposed by psychoanalysis is that
one must first address and resolve the resistance before a new thought
can emerge.   And resolving resistances to progressive changes
in thought patterns is what the psychoanalytic enterprise is all about.
Obviously an existing belief system
presents an impediment to the acceptance of new ideas
I believe that psychoanalysis will
thrive as a profession separate from medicine, during the next century,
only if it can again offer the world a new way of thinking about human
beings.  Offering the world a new way of thinking was after all, Freud’s
great and ultimate contribution to the history of culture.  To do
this, psychoanalysts will need to shake loose from their fascination with
the nineteenth century paradigm of mental illness that continues to bedevil
their thinking and practices.
  What we need is a new philosophy,
or as it turns out, to improve upon an ancient one.  The notion that
mental illness is the product of biological dysfunction leaves them helpless
to prevail in the face of the discovery and widespread use of psychotropic
medication during the present century.
But important and admirable as
these advances in psychopharmacology may be, they cast no light upon how
human beings can live better and happier lives (without drugs) and how
they can avoid feeling miserable in the first place.
Besides, only the tiniest fraction
of human madness and misery emanates from diseases of the brain and nervous
system.  Moreover, on balance, it must be admitted that psychotropic
drugs, administered either with or without a physician’s prescription,
have probably damaged at least as many lives as they have improved.
Witness also the world wide hidden
as well as not so hidden social and psychological costs and ravages of
chemical substance abuse.
 Since so many varieties of
human suffering cannot be attributed to disorders of the body, any endeavor
to understand human psychological suffering solely in terms of brain neurophysiology
and which attempts to remedy it solely through medical means is bound to
fail.  Both chemotherapy and psychotherapy have their places in the
scheme of things but the role they will continue to play depends largely
upon what therapists and the profession believes about the nature of mental
illness.  This situates the mind-body issue at the very core of the
present philosophical revolution that is unfolding in the field of mental
health.  And this reintroduces the distinction between body and soul,
soma and psyche, the organism and the person.
 Perforce we have to discriminate
between two different universes of discourse: that of the brain and that
of the mind.  The words used to describe the mind are different from
those used to describe the brain.  And the events to which they allude
are different phenomena.
It is unfortunate that Sigmund Freud’s
translators had a resistance to the word soul, because instead of translating
the German word Seele into the English word soul, which it means in German,
they translated it as psyche, which means soul or mind in Greek. 
But in fact Freud had referred to psychoanalysis as Soul Psychology. “Indeed,”
Freud wrote, “the word Seelesorge might well serve as a general formula
for describing the function which the analyst has to perform in relation
to the public.”  The German word Sorgen means "one who cares for."  
So Freud had in mind that a psychoanalyst is a Seelesorge, someone who
cares for the soul.
To the extent possible, James Strachey
avoided the use of the word soul in his translations of Freud and in this
instance elected to translate the German word Seelesorge into English as
“secular pastoral counselor.”  (A designation comparable to our own
term “clinical philosopher.”)   Since translation is a form of
interpretation, to the extent that Strachey mistranslated Freud, he misinterpreted
him.
Interpretation is at the very heart
of classical psychoanalysis.  Classical psychoanalysis was a method
for discovering unconscious meanings in the service of attaining insight
and understanding.  In that sense it was a research tool. An interpreter
is a translator and this is what psychoanalysts have traditionally been. 
They translated dreams.   They translated the unconscious into
the conscious.  But modern psychoanalysis, as you know, has pretty
much abandoned interpretation as its tool.  What used to be the goal
of classical psychoanalysis (which was the understanding of unconscious
meanings) has now become the means employed by modern analysts to attain
the goal of resolving resistances.  The goal of modern analysis is
not to translate the unconscious into the conscious so much as to relieve
suffering.
The objective of all forms of psychotherapy
is to relieve suffering.   The future of modern analysis lies
with helping people to find happiness.  It has gradually moved from
using interpretations of the unconscious for the purpose of curing diseases
to a human enterprise with the purpose of increasing happiness.
So what Freud really thought was
that unlike physicians who are curing bodies, psychoanalysts were curing
souls. That's the message that lies buried in our mostly forgotten past. 
And our message for today is that in our past lies our future.  In
the 21st century, we may finally remember what psychoanalysis is all about.
But it must also be remembered that
Freud was a scientist and an atheist.  So he was not talking about
the soul in a religious sense.  Nor are we talking about the soul
in a mystical sense.  We're talking about the soul as the quintessentially
human, the human being, i.e. the person as contrasted to the organism. 
That part of the individual that we experience verbally, when we ask an
analysand to lie down on the couch, break eye contact and to say everything.
No one has written more eloquently
than Thomas Szasz has about the malignant consequences that follow from
the failure of professionals and society to appreciate the philosophical
implications embedded in matters pertaining to "mental” health.  Particularly
unfortunate are the consequences that follow from confusing so-called mental
illnesses with organic disturbances of the brain and nervous system and
in incorporating their treatment under the rubric of medicine without appreciating
the philosophical and social implications of doing so.
Szasz submits the following fundamental
philosophical proposition.  "Disease... means and should only mean,
a disorder of the body."  And accordingly, his argument goes, medical
"treatment means, and should only mean, a physicochemical intervention
in the structure and function of the body."
Within the framework of this formulation
most forms of so-called “mental” illness and their "treatment" would, strictly
speaking, properly fall outside of the province of medical science. 
As would also the mental suffering normally propagated by the tragic vicissitudes
of everyday life.  This does not preclude recognizing that some psychic
suffering can be alleviated through medical means (i.e., medication) or
that on occasion some physically induced suffering can be relieved through
psychological means (i.e., psychotherapy).  The psychosomatic continuum
is a two way street that can be entered at either end.
It is easy to confuse means and
ends here.  Medical means can sometimes be used to attain psychological
ends, just as psychological means may sometimes be employed to achieve
physical ends.  There is a compelling need for the consistent use
of more precise definitions in fields like psychiatry, psychoanalysis and
psychotherapy in which ambiguities, glib formulations, unsupported speculations
and especially the careless use of undefined terms is so common.
It is misleading, Szasz says, to
think of the actual practice of psychotherapy as if it were a form of medical
treatment.  Indeed, he says, it should be regarded as a form of the
special branch of philosophy that Aristotle called rhetoric (persuasive
speech) rather than as a branch of medicine.
Since the practice of psychotherapy
usually is implemented mainly in the form of an exchange of words and feelings
between persons, as a practice it clearly has more in common with a Platonic
dialogue than a medical treatment.  And in fact, until the philosopher,
William James, wrote his precedent setting textbook, Principles of Psychology,
the whole field of psychology was itself a branch of philosophy and was
taught as such in university departments of philosophy.
Philosophers from the time of Plato
have sought to provide their students with general guidelines to help them
in their search for increased inner peace and happiness: in this world
through personal enlightenment, raised and expanded consciousness, love
and understanding, - and in preparation for the next world, through a belief
in gods and in the fantasy of other lives after death.
So it seems that what we have been
calling psychotherapy is really a new edition of an old discipline which
can now more properly be identified as clinical philosophy.
Clinical philosophy or psychotherapy
can be defined as “the therapeutic practice of wisdom”: - the application
of philosophy to the relief of human suffering.  It would consist
of the development and the application of a general theory of the treatment
and cure of persons (souls, human beings), as contrasted to clinical medicine,
which concerns the treatment and cure of bodies.
The objective of formulating such
a philosophy of psychotherapy would be to provide practitioners of the
various schools of psychotherapy with a common framework within which they
could implement their own particular methods of relieving psychogenic human
suffering.
From a purely philosophical point
of view, what is needed is some kind of lingua franca, a sort of grammar
of general treatment principles, consisting of common definitions sufficiently
operational so that psychoanalysts and psychotherapists of diverse schools
could at least agree as to what it was that they were talking about. 
Because there is actually a considerable body of agreement among mental
health professionals of different schools of thought that is concealed
by their differences in terminology.  The actual practices of experienced
therapists of different schools do not differ as much as their vocabulary
might suggest.
*  *  *  * 
*
A clinical philosopher would be
a special kind of a teacher (doctor) who might also be qualified as a physician,
a psychologist, a pastor, a nurse, a social worker, a philosopher or be
trained in any of the humanities or social sciences.  Many synonyms
and modes of address for such teachers readily come to mind: professor,
master (as Zen master), doctor (from Latin for teacher), rabbi (Hebrew
for teacher), guru (Hindi for teacher), counselor, healer, mentor, spiritual
guide; or psychotherapist and therapist (from classical Greek for helper),
facilitator (from Gestalt therapy), and psychoanalyst.  It is perhaps
somewhat unfortunate that in the United States the medical profession has
preempted the title of doctor.  And though its original meaning (teacher)
is still preserved in academic circles, it is more often than not used
as if it were a synonym for physician for which it is popularly substituted.
Ideally, such teachers would be
highly evolved human beings with a broad background in the liberal arts
and sciences, as well as having had specialized training in one or more
of the various methods and techniques of interpersonal influence. 
They would hopefully have sought and undergone a personal psychotherapeutic
experience and they would also be knowledgeable concerning theories of
human development, especially psychoanalysis, and to have mastered the
art of applying these in clinical situations.  These doctors (teachers)
might also continue to refer to their students as patients, but by this
they would mean “persons who are suffering”.
I prefer the adoption of the appellation
clinical philosopher to that of clinical psychologist or psychoanalyst
because it would not only demystify the true nature of psychotherapy but
would liberate practicing professionals from the strangling network of
licensing laws and state regulations that have frozen our field in a procrustean
tangle of antique paradigms, to satisfy insurance companies and self serving
professional interests.
So our future lies in our past.
You may recall that Freud compared
psychoanalysis to archaeology.  An archaeologist, he said, digs to
find artifacts from the past in order to reconstruct the past from these
artifacts.   But it's very clear that the archaeologist is not
digging in the past.  The archaeologist is digging in the present. 
The artifacts that he uncovers exist in the present.   He reconstructs
the past, in the present, from artifacts that he has in the present. 
Very much the way a psychoanalyst is searching in the present for memories
and associations from which to reconstruct the past.  The “past” is
in the present.
But how does one look into the future? 
In a sense the future is not a place but merely an idea of a place. 
When an astronomer peers into outer space, is she looking at the future
or looking at the past?  Well, the astronomer thinks she's looking
at the past.  But when a space ship is launched into outer space,
is its destination in the past or in the future?  What then, is the
future?  What then, is the present?  What then, is the past? 
Past, present and future become extraordinarily complicated ideas.
One metaphor about life is that
living life can be compared to rowing a boat.  We are backing into
the future.   And that's a way of describing what we're doing
here today.  We're backing into the future.   In the sense
that we are viewing the past, in the present, and extrapolating into the
future.  Moreover the future we refer to is not a place.  It's
an idea.  The future is an idea in the same sense that the past is
an idea.  A memory is an idea about the past.  But a memory is
not itself a past event.  A memory is a current event, taking place
in the brain now.  It's a present idea about the past.  There
is a link between our memory of the past (which is in the present) and
our fantasy of the future (which is also in the present).  How else
can we get to the future except from our present position, rowing into
the future so to speak, backing into the future by looking at the past.

Arnold Greenberg, who began his career selling pickles and herring from a New York City storefront and went on to become a founder of Snapple, the international beverage giant, died on Friday in Manhattan. He was 80.A resident of Delray Beach, Fla., who also had homes in Manhattan and Southampton, N.Y., Mr. Greenberg had been ill with cancer for some time, his family said.In 1972, Mr. Greenberg, who was by then running a health food store in the East Village in Manhattan, joined forces with two old friends, Leonard Marsh and Hyman Golden, to sell fruit juices to health food stores. A part-time concern — Mr. Greenberg retained his store and Mr. Marsh and Mr. Golden kept the window-washing business they ran together — the juice business performed modestly in its early years.Then, in the late ’70s, the three men hit on the idea of producing a soft drink flavored only with natural juice. An early effort by their company, by then known as Unadulterated Food Products, was an explosive failure: they marketed a carbonated apple juice that fermented in its bottles and sent a spate of caps blasting.

But the name they had coined for the drink, Snapple (an amalgam of “snappy” and “apple”), proved so evocative that it was soon adopted by the company as a whole. Continue reading the main story

The Snapple Beverage Corporation became one of the first companies to offer a wide line of juices and carbonated drinks made with natural ingredients. Sales were buoyed by the rising tide of health-conscious consumers in the 1980s; in 1987, after Snapple introduced the first in its line of bottled iced teas, it became an undisputed leader in the New Age beverage market.The company also became known for its offbeat advertising. An early 1990s campaign by Kirshenbaum & Bond was built around a series of television spots featuring the Snapple Lady. A motherly character played by an actual Snapple employee, Wendy Kaufman, the Snapple Lady answered customers’ letters.By 1994, when Snapple was bought for $1.7 billion by the Quaker Oats Company, it was recording annual sales of about $700 million.Mr. Greenberg, Snapple’s executive vice president and chief operating officer, retired after the Quaker Oats sale. Snapple is now owned by the Dr Pepper Snapple Group, based in Plano, Tex.; its product line comprises more than 50 flavors of juice, fruit punches and teas.

Arnold Shepard Greenberg was born in Brooklyn on Sept. 2, 1932, and grew up in the Brownsville neighborhood there. His father owned an appetizing store in the East Village, on First Avenue near St. Marks Place, selling staples like lox, herring and pickles; by the 1950s, Arnold Greenberg was running it.“It was a very traditional operation,” Mr. Greenberg told the newspaper The Jewish Week in 1994. “We made our own sour pickles and wrapped them in newspapers.”By the 1960s, with the East Village becoming decreasingly Jewish and increasingly hippie, Mr. Greenberg converted the business into a health food store. In the early ’70s he went into business with Mr. Marsh, a childhood friend with whom he had attended Samuel J. Tilden High School, and Mr. Golden, who was married to Mr. Marsh’s sister.When the three men coined the name Snapple, they discovered it was already owned by a small company in Texas, which appeared to have little interest in using it. They bought the name for $500.

Mr. Greenberg’s first wife, the former Marilyn Parmet, died in 1993; a son, Michael, also died before him. He is survived by his second wife, the former Roberta Budoff; two daughters from his first marriage, Susan Minster and Robin Nijankin; a brother, Herbert; three stepchildren, Scott Budoff, Gary Budoff and Kim Fields; and 14 grandchildren.As Snapple’s founders often said, one of their greatest pleasures lay in developing and naming new flavors. Not every name passed muster, however. In the 1990s, they produced a guava drink, eventually marketed as Guava Mania.As Mr. Greenberg told “CBS This Morning” in 1994, the three partners also gave serious consideration to Guava Vavoom and Guava Nagila.

 Correction: October 31, 2012  
An earlier version of this obituary misstated the year Arnold Greenberg was born.  Mr. Greenberg was born in 1932, not 1922.

World's best overall value for natural products!


                        Since 1996, iHerb has made great efforts to enhance your online shopping experience.  Initially, our
                        company promoted the benefits of St. John's Wort; hence the name: iHerb.  We carry one of the
                        largest selections of high-quality natural products at the best overall value.  Consider iHerb your own
                        California-based natural products store!
                    










Top 10 reasons to make iHerb your number one choice!




1. Shop directly and save!

            iHerb.com is one of the world's largest online stores for natural products.
            We have been in business since 1996 and have two distribution centers, based
            in California and Kentucky.
        

            Browse our site and you'll find over 1,200 brands and 35,000 brand name products that you may also find at health food stores and natural
            pharmacies -- with one important difference: Our prices are typically 30 - 40% less. Also, don't forget to check our  Specials page for
            additional discounts on some best-selling products.
        


2. Free or discounted shipping

            Every iHerb order is eligible to receive discounted or free shipping! In general, the more products you add to your cart, the greater the likelihood that you will receive free shipping. In some cases you’ll even find that ordering one product alone may result in free shipping. We encourage you to experiment with different product combinations in order to find the best value, and share your cart with others! iHerb is the world's leader in bringing the best overall value in natural products to its customers.
        


3. Honest customer product reviews

            Unlike retailers that display third-party reviews, all of our reviews are written by iHerb customers. In order to write a review, you must
            have ordered the product from iHerb first. This means you receive honest and candid reviews, thereby helping you make a smarter buying decision.
        


4. Assurance of freshness with expiration dates

            Because we have one of the highest product turnover rates in the industry, iHerb is able to offer you the FRESHEST products possible!
            Our inventory turnover rate averages to 8.1 times per year; among the highest turnover rates, if not the highest, in our industry. This means that iHerb products are on the shelf an average of only 45 days!
        

            Plus, most products we carry have expiration or best-by dates, which can be accessed on the product page. It's like holding the real bottle or package in your hand, as you would in a typical "brick and mortar" store.
        


5. Air-conditioned, super clean warehouses

            iHerb’s distribution centers  are entirely climate-controlled, which protects the products from such conditions as humidity, heat and cold. This level of quality control is employed by iHerb to ensure product effectiveness for the customer.
            In addition, our distribution centers are industry certified by NSF International, earning Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) certification.
        


6. Solid personal privacy commitment

            Personal privacy is critically important to us. Since 1996, iHerb has never sold, leased or shared any customer information with third parties. Your personal information remains entirely confidential.
        


7. Enhanced 256-bit encryption with tokenization

            Simply put, we only store the last 4 digits and the expiration date of your credit card, so you can identify what card you are using.
        


8. 24 hour/7 day customer service

            One of the ways iHerb can offer such low prices is by automating the whole ordering process. While our customer service agents don't
            actually take orders, they do offer live  customer support from our California facility, 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. (Pacific Time), Monday - Friday.
            We are also reachable 24 hours per day, 7 days per week, by chat and email to answer questions and resolve issues with your order. Of course,
            nobody's perfect. We may get quite busy at times and we ask for a little patience. We'll do our best to take care of things promptly, efficiently
            and courteously -- this is what our customers deserve!
        


9. Save even more by helping others save!

            As an iHerb customer, share your favorite iHerb products or categories, or even a shopping cart containing multiple products with others via simple Rewards links, and you will save even more!



10. A greener way to shop

            When you shop with us, you're part of a global solution. iHerb uses 100% post-consumer recycled paper for 90% of all shipping boxes. Our bubble wrap is 40% recyclable, and we recycle virtually all packing materials received 
            from manufacturers. All in the interest of a healthier, more sustainable planet!  Read more.
