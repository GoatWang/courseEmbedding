    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion

Data Format: N-Triples RDF

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).

Current operations[edit]
As of September 30, 2016, Ameritrade had 6,950,000 funded customer accounts and client assets of $773.8 billion.[1] In fiscal year 2016, the company executed an average of 462,918 client transactions per day.
In fiscal year 2016, the company derived 41.2% of its revenues from commissions and fees including fees for order flow, 27.8% of its revenues from Toronto-Dominion Bank for investment of idle cash balances, 17.9% of revenues from interest, 11.3% from investment product fees, and 1.8% from other sources.[1]
History[edit]
In 1975, the Securities and Exchange Commission banned the practice of fixed brokerage commissions and J. Joseph Ricketts and 3 partners opened First Omaha Securities, Inc. in Omaha, Nebraska.[2][3]
In 1983, Ameritrade Clearing Inc. was established as a clearing broker.[2][3]
In 1988, the company introduced the first quote and order entry system via the touch-tone phone.[2][3]
In 1995, the company acquired K. Aufhauser & Company, Inc., the first firm to offer online securities trading.[2][3]
In January 1996, TransTerra's Accutrade launched "Accutrade for Windows," which led to a surge in investing online.[4]
In September 1996, TransTerra merged with Ameritrade.[5]
In March 1997, Ameritrade became a public company via an initial public offering.[2][3]
In February 2001, Ameritrade acquired TradeCast, which had approximately 60 broker/dealer, hedge fund and money management customers.[6]
In July 2001, Ameritrade acquired National Discount Brokers Corporation, adding $6.3 billion in client assets.[7]
In September 2002, Ameritrade merged with Datek Online Holdings Corporation.[8]
In June 2003, Ameritrade purchased Mydiscountbroker.com.[9]
In 2004, Ameritrade completed the purchase of Bidwell and Company in January,[10] BrokerageAmerica in February,[11] and JB Oxford and Company in October.[12]
In January 2006, Ameritrade Holding Corporation acquired TD Waterhouse from Toronto-Dominion Bank and was renamed TD Ameritrade.[13][14][15]
In May 2008, CEO Joe Moglia announced he would be vacating the CEO position and would become Chairman. Fredric Tomczyk, the former COO, was named his successor.[16]
In January 2009, TD Ameritrade acquired Thinkorswim, a producer of software for active traders, in a cash and stock deal valued at approximately $606 million.[17]
In 2013, the company opened a new $250 million headquarters in Omaha.[18]
In October 2016, TD Ameritrade announced the acquisition of Scottrade in a $4 billion transaction.[19][20]
Legal actions[edit]
Security breaches[edit]
In November 2007, the company reported that hackers gained access to most of its clients' names, Social Security numbers, dates of birth, addresses, phone numbers and trading activity.[21] In 2011, after being sued in a class action lawsuit, the company settled by agreeing to compensate customers that were victim to identity theft between $50 and $2,500 each.[22] The settlement was criticized for netting the attorneys almost as much money as the victims.[23]
Auction rate securities scandal[edit]
In 2009, TD Ameritrade settled a lawsuit alleging it had marketed auction rate securities as short-term investments. The settlement included a $456 million payment and the buyback of the securities, compensating investors for losses.[24][25][26]
Customer losses in reserve money funds[edit]
TD Ameritrade recommended to its customers to invest cash holdings in a money market fund that was an affiliate of the Reserve Primary Fund and the fund gained approximately $1 billion in assets as a result of such marketing by TD Ameritrade. TD Ameritrade received commissions from the fund for steering customers. In September 2008, during the financial crisis of 2007–2008, as a result of its holdings in securities of Lehman Brothers, the fund broke the buck and $1 billion in cash equivalents of TD Ameritrade clients were frozen. TD Ameritrade was accused of having a conflict of interest as a result of commissions that it received, for having poor marketing ethics, and for misrepresenting the safety of the investment. Fredric Tomczyk, President of TD Ameritrade, argued that the contract with the Reserve Fund was a standard contract and that "an investment firm has to make money in some way." TD Ameritrade was named in class action lawsuits by its customers and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission launched an investigation into its marketing practices. In 2008, TD Ameritrade agreed to reimburse its customers for up to a 3% loss in the Reserve Primary Fund, or up to $50 million. In 2011, TD Ameritrade settled the SEC case and agreed to pay 1.2¢ per share of the Reserve Yield Plus Fund that was held by its customers, or $10 million in total. The Reserve Yield Plus made its final distribution in 2016 and investors received 97 to 98 cents on the dollar in addition to compensation from TD Ameritrade.[27][28][29][30][31][32][33][34][35][36]
Sponsorships[edit]
The company owns the naming rights to TD Ameritrade Park Omaha for which it pays an average of $1 million a year.[37]

The support you need, when you need it.
In this business, trading needs can change at a moment's notice. While one of your clients requires block trades, another might need simple executions. But while trades can vary, our commitment to meeting your needs never will.
Our comprehensive services include:

The execution, clearance and settlement of securities transactions
Preparing and sending monthly statements of your account and transaction confirmations
The custody of funds and securities
Account protection in the event of unauthorized activity 

TD Ameritrade is obligated to seek the best price available for your order, taking into consideration current market conditions, such as the NBBO (National Best Bid and Offer), volume and liquidity. While we seek to get better prices for you, price improvement is not guaranteed and will not occur in all situations. TD Ameritrade acts as agent. Orders are filled by independent third parties.
Market volatility, volume and system availability may delay account access and trade executions. Price can change quickly in fast market conditions, resulting in an execution price different from the quote displayed at order entry. Execution price, speed and liquidity and account access are affected by many factors, including market volatility, size and type of order and available market centers.

What is the fastest way to open an account?


Opening an account online is the fastest way to open and fund an account. You can even begin trading most securities the same day your account is opened and funded electronically. You may also speak with a New Client consultant at 800-454-9272. We're here 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.




How do I transfer my account from another firm to TD Ameritrade?


You may also speak with a New Client consultant at 800-454-9272. We're here 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.

Open your account using the online application.
Once your account is open, you can log in and complete a transfer using the External Account Transfer Wizard.
The name(s)/title on the account being transferred must match the name(s)/title on the receiving TD Ameritrade account.
After your transfer is complete, you can add or remove account owners on your TD Ameritrade account. You can also establish other TD Ameritrade accounts with different titles, and you can transfer money between those accounts.





What are the advantages of using electronic funding?


TD Ameritrade provides Automated Clearing House (ACH) services for the primary purpose of the purchase or sale of securities. Electronic funding is fast, easy, and flexible. Use it within our online application to open and fund your qualified account and trade online the same market day for most account types, eliminating the cost and time delays of wire and overnight fees. You can also use it to add additional funds to your existing account, either as a one-time transfer or a recurring transfer.

Current operations[edit]
As of September 30, 2016, Ameritrade had 6,950,000 funded customer accounts and client assets of $773.8 billion.[1] In fiscal year 2016, the company executed an average of 462,918 client transactions per day.
In fiscal year 2016, the company derived 41.2% of its revenues from commissions and fees including fees for order flow, 27.8% of its revenues from Toronto-Dominion Bank for investment of idle cash balances, 17.9% of revenues from interest, 11.3% from investment product fees, and 1.8% from other sources.[1]
History[edit]
In 1975, the Securities and Exchange Commission banned the practice of fixed brokerage commissions and J. Joseph Ricketts and 3 partners opened First Omaha Securities, Inc. in Omaha, Nebraska.[2][3]
In 1983, Ameritrade Clearing Inc. was established as a clearing broker.[2][3]
In 1988, the company introduced the first quote and order entry system via the touch-tone phone.[2][3]
In 1995, the company acquired K. Aufhauser & Company, Inc., the first firm to offer online securities trading.[2][3]
In January 1996, TransTerra's Accutrade launched "Accutrade for Windows," which led to a surge in investing online.[4]
In September 1996, TransTerra merged with Ameritrade.[5]
In March 1997, Ameritrade became a public company via an initial public offering.[2][3]
In February 2001, Ameritrade acquired TradeCast, which had approximately 60 broker/dealer, hedge fund and money management customers.[6]
In July 2001, Ameritrade acquired National Discount Brokers Corporation, adding $6.3 billion in client assets.[7]
In September 2002, Ameritrade merged with Datek Online Holdings Corporation.[8]
In June 2003, Ameritrade purchased Mydiscountbroker.com.[9]
In 2004, Ameritrade completed the purchase of Bidwell and Company in January,[10] BrokerageAmerica in February,[11] and JB Oxford and Company in October.[12]
In January 2006, Ameritrade Holding Corporation acquired TD Waterhouse from Toronto-Dominion Bank and was renamed TD Ameritrade.[13][14][15]
In May 2008, CEO Joe Moglia announced he would be vacating the CEO position and would become Chairman. Fredric Tomczyk, the former COO, was named his successor.[16]
In January 2009, TD Ameritrade acquired Thinkorswim, a producer of software for active traders, in a cash and stock deal valued at approximately $606 million.[17]
In 2013, the company opened a new $250 million headquarters in Omaha.[18]
In October 2016, TD Ameritrade announced the acquisition of Scottrade in a $4 billion transaction.[19][20]
Legal actions[edit]
Security breaches[edit]
In November 2007, the company reported that hackers gained access to most of its clients' names, Social Security numbers, dates of birth, addresses, phone numbers and trading activity.[21] In 2011, after being sued in a class action lawsuit, the company settled by agreeing to compensate customers that were victim to identity theft between $50 and $2,500 each.[22] The settlement was criticized for netting the attorneys almost as much money as the victims.[23]
Auction rate securities scandal[edit]
In 2009, TD Ameritrade settled a lawsuit alleging it had marketed auction rate securities as short-term investments. The settlement included a $456 million payment and the buyback of the securities, compensating investors for losses.[24][25][26]
Customer losses in reserve money funds[edit]
TD Ameritrade recommended to its customers to invest cash holdings in a money market fund that was an affiliate of the Reserve Primary Fund and the fund gained approximately $1 billion in assets as a result of such marketing by TD Ameritrade. TD Ameritrade received commissions from the fund for steering customers. In September 2008, during the financial crisis of 2007–2008, as a result of its holdings in securities of Lehman Brothers, the fund broke the buck and $1 billion in cash equivalents of TD Ameritrade clients were frozen. TD Ameritrade was accused of having a conflict of interest as a result of commissions that it received, for having poor marketing ethics, and for misrepresenting the safety of the investment. Fredric Tomczyk, President of TD Ameritrade, argued that the contract with the Reserve Fund was a standard contract and that "an investment firm has to make money in some way." TD Ameritrade was named in class action lawsuits by its customers and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission launched an investigation into its marketing practices. In 2008, TD Ameritrade agreed to reimburse its customers for up to a 3% loss in the Reserve Primary Fund, or up to $50 million. In 2011, TD Ameritrade settled the SEC case and agreed to pay 1.2¢ per share of the Reserve Yield Plus Fund that was held by its customers, or $10 million in total. The Reserve Yield Plus made its final distribution in 2016 and investors received 97 to 98 cents on the dollar in addition to compensation from TD Ameritrade.[27][28][29][30][31][32][33][34][35][36]
Sponsorships[edit]
The company owns the naming rights to TD Ameritrade Park Omaha for which it pays an average of $1 million a year.[37]

Current operations[edit]
As of September 30, 2016, Ameritrade had 6,950,000 funded customer accounts and client assets of $773.8 billion.[1] In fiscal year 2016, the company executed an average of 462,918 client transactions per day.
In fiscal year 2016, the company derived 41.2% of its revenues from commissions and fees including fees for order flow, 27.8% of its revenues from Toronto-Dominion Bank for investment of idle cash balances, 17.9% of revenues from interest, 11.3% from investment product fees, and 1.8% from other sources.[1]
History[edit]
In 1975, the Securities and Exchange Commission banned the practice of fixed brokerage commissions and J. Joseph Ricketts and 3 partners opened First Omaha Securities, Inc. in Omaha, Nebraska.[2][3]
In 1983, Ameritrade Clearing Inc. was established as a clearing broker.[2][3]
In 1988, the company introduced the first quote and order entry system via the touch-tone phone.[2][3]
In 1995, the company acquired K. Aufhauser & Company, Inc., the first firm to offer online securities trading.[2][3]
In January 1996, TransTerra's Accutrade launched "Accutrade for Windows," which led to a surge in investing online.[4]
In September 1996, TransTerra merged with Ameritrade.[5]
In March 1997, Ameritrade became a public company via an initial public offering.[2][3]
In February 2001, Ameritrade acquired TradeCast, which had approximately 60 broker/dealer, hedge fund and money management customers.[6]
In July 2001, Ameritrade acquired National Discount Brokers Corporation, adding $6.3 billion in client assets.[7]
In September 2002, Ameritrade merged with Datek Online Holdings Corporation.[8]
In June 2003, Ameritrade purchased Mydiscountbroker.com.[9]
In 2004, Ameritrade completed the purchase of Bidwell and Company in January,[10] BrokerageAmerica in February,[11] and JB Oxford and Company in October.[12]
In January 2006, Ameritrade Holding Corporation acquired TD Waterhouse from Toronto-Dominion Bank and was renamed TD Ameritrade.[13][14][15]
In May 2008, CEO Joe Moglia announced he would be vacating the CEO position and would become Chairman. Fredric Tomczyk, the former COO, was named his successor.[16]
In January 2009, TD Ameritrade acquired Thinkorswim, a producer of software for active traders, in a cash and stock deal valued at approximately $606 million.[17]
In 2013, the company opened a new $250 million headquarters in Omaha.[18]
In October 2016, TD Ameritrade announced the acquisition of Scottrade in a $4 billion transaction.[19][20]
Legal actions[edit]
Security breaches[edit]
In November 2007, the company reported that hackers gained access to most of its clients' names, Social Security numbers, dates of birth, addresses, phone numbers and trading activity.[21] In 2011, after being sued in a class action lawsuit, the company settled by agreeing to compensate customers that were victim to identity theft between $50 and $2,500 each.[22] The settlement was criticized for netting the attorneys almost as much money as the victims.[23]
Auction rate securities scandal[edit]
In 2009, TD Ameritrade settled a lawsuit alleging it had marketed auction rate securities as short-term investments. The settlement included a $456 million payment and the buyback of the securities, compensating investors for losses.[24][25][26]
Customer losses in reserve money funds[edit]
TD Ameritrade recommended to its customers to invest cash holdings in a money market fund that was an affiliate of the Reserve Primary Fund and the fund gained approximately $1 billion in assets as a result of such marketing by TD Ameritrade. TD Ameritrade received commissions from the fund for steering customers. In September 2008, during the financial crisis of 2007–2008, as a result of its holdings in securities of Lehman Brothers, the fund broke the buck and $1 billion in cash equivalents of TD Ameritrade clients were frozen. TD Ameritrade was accused of having a conflict of interest as a result of commissions that it received, for having poor marketing ethics, and for misrepresenting the safety of the investment. Fredric Tomczyk, President of TD Ameritrade, argued that the contract with the Reserve Fund was a standard contract and that "an investment firm has to make money in some way." TD Ameritrade was named in class action lawsuits by its customers and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission launched an investigation into its marketing practices. In 2008, TD Ameritrade agreed to reimburse its customers for up to a 3% loss in the Reserve Primary Fund, or up to $50 million. In 2011, TD Ameritrade settled the SEC case and agreed to pay 1.2¢ per share of the Reserve Yield Plus Fund that was held by its customers, or $10 million in total. The Reserve Yield Plus made its final distribution in 2016 and investors received 97 to 98 cents on the dollar in addition to compensation from TD Ameritrade.[27][28][29][30][31][32][33][34][35][36]
Sponsorships[edit]
The company owns the naming rights to TD Ameritrade Park Omaha for which it pays an average of $1 million a year.[37]

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!

About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
