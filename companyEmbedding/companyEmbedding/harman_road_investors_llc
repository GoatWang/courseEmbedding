Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the HARMAN Fiscal 2017 First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, Thursday, November 3, 2016.
I would now like to turn the conference over Yijing Brentano, VP of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, ma'am.
Yijing Brentano - Harman International Industries, Inc.
Thanks Jennifer. Good morning and thank you for joining our first quarter fiscal year 2017 investor call. I'm joined in Stamford today by Dinesh Paliwal, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and by Sandy Rowland, our Chief Financial Officer.
If you haven't done so already, I invite you to visit the Investors section of our website, where you can download copies of our earnings release and the supporting slide presentation that we will be referencing today.
Before Dinesh and Sandy provide their remarks on the quarter, let me remind you that certain statements during this conference call and question-and-answer session may be forward-looking in nature, as defined in the United States Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements are based on management's beliefs, assumptions and current expectations but are subject to a number of important risk factors and uncertainties, which have been fully described in the press release that we issued this morning.
Also, I would like to announce that on the evening of Wednesday, January 4, 2017, we will be hosting technology demonstrations at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas. We will email further details and post additional information on the Investors section of our website. Many of you attended this event in previous years, for those of you who have not attended in the past, this is an excellent opportunity to better understand our connected technologies and experience some of our solutions firsthand.
Now, let me to the call over to Dinesh.
Dinesh C. Paliwal - Harman International Industries, Inc.
Thank you, Yijing, and good morning, ladies and gentlemen. I am pleased to report that our fiscal year is off to a very good start, with solid results for the first quarter. Net sales increased 8% to $1.8 billion. We expanded our operating margins and delivered a 15% year-over-year improvement in EBITDA. This puts our EBITDA margin at a company record of 12.9% and we achieved 27% year-over-year improvement in earnings per share.
I am particularly pleased with the strong results in our Lifestyle Audio division which posted 19% year-over-year revenue growth and 50% EBITDA growth. Our unmatched brand portfolio and product innovations are paying off.
We're gaining market share against competition for our award-winning consumer audio products, and we're building a lot of momentum in increasing take rates for our car audio and sound management solutions.
I'm very excited to report that we have been successful in keeping up the momentum in new automotive business wins. During the quarter, we secured over $2 billion of awards, complementing our year-end $24-billion order backlog.

In the automotive business, we are witnessing a very interesting trend. HARMAN is not only supplying a compute platform with cutting edge technology, but also a full suite of car audio and sound management solutions. As you all know, we are the market leader in both of these areas, and we are the only company that can deliver this integrated offering.
With our innovation, we have been displacing several competitors over the last few years. As we continue to gain market share, the gap between HARMAN and its competitors has been widening at a faster pace. We have broken this down for you on page six of your slide deck.
If you quickly look at slide deck, you will see, since the first quarter of fiscal 2015, we have recognized over $9 billion in automotive revenues. During the same period, we booked over $13 billion of new awards. This means our awards are growing faster than our revenue, and our book to bill ratio is 1.4:1.
In our most profitable business, that is car audio and sound management, the awards grew even faster with a book to bill ratio of 2:1. Let me talk a little more about our recent wins in the car audio and sound management business.
Following a successful launch of the Revel brand in Lincoln vehicles, I'm pleased to announce the extension of our business with Ford. Under this long-term partnership, we will supply B&O PLAY branded car audio systems to Ford's vehicles cross car line globally.
In the Connected Car division, we had wins across geographies and vehicle categories, including orders for high-end, fully embedded compute platforms to entry-level display audio systems covering wide spectrum of offerings. We are seeing growing demand from our customers for our expanded portfolio of Connected Car solutions, including telematics, cyber security, over-the-air updates and advanced safety features.
We continue to integrate third-party ADAS offerings, while at the same time developing proprietary solutions such as ADAS, object detection, vision algorithms and surround view software solutions to name a few.
In Connected Services, we achieved a new milestone for our over-the-air update software business. As we speak, more than 1 million vehicles on the road are using HARMAN OTA and this number is growing rapidly. Automakers' response for this offering has been overwhelmingly positive. Not only have we already secured awards from over a dozen OEMs across three continents, half of these awards were secured through other Tier 1s. This demonstrates how our OTA solution is on its way to become the industry standard.
These wins are strong evidence that automakers and consumers continue to demand an enhanced in-car experience. We are addressing this trend and winning in the marketplace with a unique portfolio of solutions across Connected Car, Lifestyle Audio, and Connected Services.
Before I talk about divisions in more details, let me briefly discuss our rapid growth in China, which I am extremely proud of. You will recall in 2009, our revenue in China was less than $50 million. Last year, our revenue reached $800 million. That is 50% cumulative annual growth over the last seven years. This quarter, we grew our revenue in China over 40% and we have more than $4 billion of automotive order backlog.
Needless to say, we have been taking market share left and right in China from the competition. We are growing our automotive business through imports and with the Chinese OEMs as well. We have a very strong foundation in China with more than 3,000 people and growing. We have two world-class manufacturing plants, multiple state-of-the-art research and development centers, engineering and design centers. China is an important long-term growth market. We are winning in automotive and our iconic brands are boosting our consumer and professional growth.

Now let me take a closer look at our divisions and review some recent notable achievements. Let's start with our Connected Car division which is highlighted on slide seven of our investor presentation.
During the quarter, we secured new and follow-on awards to provide Connected Car solutions for customers including Audi, Geely, Maruti Suzuki in India, Mercedes Benz, Porsche, and heavy manufacturer MAN of Volkswagen Group. During the quarter, we launched embedded infotainment solutions in Land Rover, Audi, Toyota, Porsche and Skoda vehicles.
We also began delivering embedded infotainment solutions to the commercial truck market, launching solutions in Volkswagen Group's MAN and a Scania trucks.
MAN's infotainment system developed by HARMAN includes expanded telematics features like digital radio; hands free telephony, and truck specific navigations. The HARMAN system for Scania, includes innovations such as dual mobile phone connectivity, real-time navigation, and cloud-based connectivity to fleet management systems.
I'm particularly excited about this potential of growth for HARMAN Solutions in the commercial fleet (9:49) space. This is a growing market and provides us with an enormous growth opportunity globally unlike any other Tier 1.
Building on our momentum and winning telematics business, we entered a strategic partnership with AT&T to support the telematics ecosystem. HARMAN's telematics control units was selected by AT&T for its Mobile Broadband Accelerator program. This pre-certified solution enables rapid deployment of our offering in the industry.
We continue to receive accolades for our industry-leading innovation, winning a CTIA wireless award for our people-based monitoring software and best-in-category awards from Germany's Connect Magazine for our Connected Car systems.
HARMAN was the first company to develop a comprehensive cyber security framework for automakers. We double down on research and development investments and acquisitions in the space over the last two years. We are setting the industry standard in cyber security. And ladies and gentlemen, there will be no autonomous car without the protection of cyber security. You have heard me say that many times.
Validating our leadership, I'm very proud to share with you first time the following extensive third-party evaluations, conducted by NHTSA and the University of Michigan, HARMAN's suite of intrusion detection and mitigation technologies was rated best-in-class. That is incredible news for the whole industry.
Now turning to the Lifestyle Audio division, some of our recent notable achievements are highlighted on slide eight of the investor presentation. Audio and sound management are essential parts of the Connected Car experience and our award winning car audio solutions continue to resonate with drivers leading to another strong quarter of double-digit growth in the car audio business.
OEMs are recognizing the growing importance of audio and sound management solutions both in current vehicle design as well as a critical part of the in-car experience in semi-autonomous and fully autonomous vehicles. This trend is validated by our recent wins and our growing audio backlog. I already mentioned the Ford expansion. On top of that, we secured additional awards with Lincoln, Maserati of FCA Group, and Toyota.
During the quarter, we launched car audio solutions in Toyota, Lexus, and Alfa Romeo vehicles and HALOsonic and Advanced Transducer audio solutions in the Mercedes, AMG Class vehicles.
And now turning to consumer audio, we grew double-digits in the quarter due to strong demand for connected and personalized smart audio products. We continue to take market share. In fact, the most recent data from Futuresource confirms HARMAN added over 300 basis points in market share from early 2015 to summer of 2016. This signals that demand for our award-winning products is growing and our design, technology, brands, and distribution strategies are working.

And we're not stopping here. We continue to bring new award-winning products to the market. At the IFA Conference in Berlin last September, we launched 33 new products including a new wireless headphone lineup and new waterproof portable speaker series. This fall, we also launched JBL, Under Armour cobranded wireless heart rate monitoring headphones. This was the second product introduced as part of the strategic partnership.
Most recently, we announced the JBL playlist audio speaker featuring Google Cast technology. It connects via Wi-Fi and streams directly from the cloud to the speaker without requiring Bluetooth pairing, this obviously simplifies the user experience while dramatically improving the audio quality.
Now turning to the Professional Solutions division highlighted on slide 9 of the investor presentation. Over the last couple of quarters, we have been implementing a series of strategic initiatives. On the cost side, we have completed our European consolidation into Hungary and we're currently executing additional footprint actions in the US.
On the top-line, we are committed to leveraging the strength of our portfolio to better serve our enterprise and entertainment customers through solutions tailored for focused vertical markets. As an example, HARMAN and IBM announced an exciting strategic partnership last week at the World of Watson Conference to bring together HARMAN's end to end solutions with IBM Watson's cognitive computing capabilities.
Together, HARMAN and IBM will integrate artificial intelligence and smart connectivity, enabling IoT in HARMAN's audio, video, and lighting products. We had a successful pilot running at Thomas Jefferson Hospital in Philadelphia that allows patients to use voice commands to alter the temperature in the room, turn out the lights, or even ask whether their test results have come in yet. The voice-activated assistant can address many of their non-medical needs, freeing up medical professionals when they are needed most.
Additional applications for HARMAN and IBM Watson extend to hotel, conference room, education, but you can also imagine the possibilities throughout the enterprise and entertainment markets. It's very exciting. Transformational projects like this are exactly why we reorganized our Professional Solutions division.
Turning specifically to the quarter, HARMAN's entertainment and enterprise solutions were selected by eBay Corporation, Dubai Parks and Resorts, London Business School and the U.S. Presidential Inauguration to be held in January. As a matter of fact we are starting to see some nice order pickup which will convert into revenue in the coming quarters.
Some notable installations during the quarter include the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C., Sky Harbor Airport in Phoenix and the U.S. Naval Command Center in San Diego. HARMAN solutions also powered a wide range of high profile special events including the Tony Award winning musical Hamilton, G20 Gala in China, as well as world tours for bands like Metallica and Coldplay. Yes, hard rock bands, Metallica and Coldplay.
We remain confident in our strategy for the Professional Solutions division. Our integrated vertical market strategy is gaining traction, and we are focused on new product innovation and cost leadership. We expect to return to growth on a sustainable basis starting next quarter.
Now turning to the Connected Services division highlighted on slide 10 of the investor presentation. During the quarter, we secured awards to provide software services for Honeywell, Intel and Microsoft among others. We continue to win business with our cloud-based Over-The-Air software update solutions, including awards from Daimler and LG Electronics. In addition, HARMAN received recognition for its software engineering services capabilities from Cisco, and market advisory from Zinnov.

In summary, we are off to a solid start to deliver on our fiscal 2017 targets. We achieved record EBITDA and record earnings per share in the quarter, added over $2 billion of new automotive and software services awards, and continued to execute on our backlog successfully. We remain focused on innovation, execution, and driving cost leadership which have become hallmark of this company's success. And that is applying to all of our businesses.
Now I will turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Sandy Rowland, who will give you additional color on our financial results for the quarter.
Sandra E. Rowland - Harman International Industries, Inc.
Thank you, Dinesh, and good morning, everyone.
Let me walk you through our financial highlights for the quarter. As a reminder, most of my financial remarks are provided on an operational basis which excludes acquisition related items, restructuring and nonrecurring charges. The full reconciliation of our GAAP to our operational results is included in the press release that we issued this morning.
This quarter, our revenues were $1.8 billion an increase of 8% compared to the prior year. Revenue in our Connected Car division increased 6% versus the prior-year, primarily due to higher take rates and stronger production. Revenue in our Lifestyle Audio division increased 19% compared to the prior year. The increase in net sales was primarily due to higher consumer audio sales driven by continued strong demand for smart audio solutions and higher take rates in car audio.
Revenue in our Connected Services division increased 4% compared to a year ago primarily due to higher demand for automotive services. While revenue in our Professional Solutions division decreased 3% compared to the prior year.
Total company gross margin increased 80 basis points to 30.8% primarily due to the impact of higher sales volume leveraging a more efficient fixed production cost base and productivity initiatives.
Connected Car gross margin increased 110 basis points to 24.8% benefiting from better leverage of fixed costs and manufacturing productivity. Lifestyle Audio gross margin increased 290 basis points to 35.4% primarily due to margin expansion in car audio as a result of operating leverage and manufacturing excellence. Professional Solutions gross margin decreased 240 basis points to 39.2% driven by product mix.
We are seeing manufacturing cost savings from our footprint migration initiatives. However, as we continue to focus on bringing down our inventory levels in this division, we have lower fixed cost absorption impacting gross margin in the near-term.
Connected Services gross margin declined 280 basis points to 31.1% primarily due to higher revenue recognition of high-margin engineering change orders in the prior year. We have started to use percentage of completion accounting for significant new contracts which is expected to reduce some of the volatility.
Our SG&A expense as a percentage of net sales decreased 20 basis points from the prior year to 20.1%. Connected Car SG&A increased 60 basis points to 12.6% to support growth in awarded business. While R&D expense in car audio increased to support our expanding backlog, Lifestyle Audio SG&A decreased 70 basis points to 20.2% due to better leverage on higher sales.
SG&A expense in Professional Solutions increased 20 basis points compared to the prior year. Connected Services SG&A expense decreased 200 basis points to 19.3% as a result of footprint migration initiatives related to the integration of Red Bend. Finally, corporate SG&A as a percentage of net sales increased by 10 basis points to 2.1%.
Putting it all together, our consolidated operating income was $187 million compared to $158 million in the prior year, a 19% increase. Below the line, we had an effective tax rate of 25.2%, which is lower than our guidance of 27.5% to 28% for the full year. Our guidance takes into account potential tax law changes that we are actively monitoring, and at this time, we are maintaining our tax rate guidance. Finally, EPS was $1.87 compared to $1.48 in the prior year, up 27%.

Let me spend a few minutes on cash and capital allocation. We generated $36 million of free cash flow, which we define as cash flow from operations less CapEx, an improvement of approximately $185 million, driven by strong earnings and effective working capital management.
During the quarter, we were active buyers of our stock. We repurchased approximately 450,000 shares in the quarter at a cost of $35 million. We now have approximately $325 million remaining on our board authorized share repurchase program, and we will continue to be opportunistic buyers of our stock.
We are pleased to be off to a good start in fiscal year 2017. We are on track to deliver on our full year guidance, and we look forward to speaking to you about our business at upcoming investor conferences and seeing you in January at our CES technology event.
Thank you for your attention. Dinesh and I are now happy to take your questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of David Lim with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.
David H. Lim - Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Hi, good morning, Dinesh and Sandy. Congratulations on the quarter.
Dinesh C. Paliwal - Harman International Industries, Inc.
Good morning, David.
Sandra E. Rowland - Harman International Industries, Inc.
Thanks. Good morning, David.
David H. Lim - Wells Fargo Securities LLC
First question on Lifestyle, Lifestyle continues to be strong. Can you provide us with a walk from last year relative to revenues and margins, and what were the major factors to the performance this quarter?
Dinesh C. Paliwal - Harman International Industries, Inc.
Sure, David. As you know, we have been investing heavily in software solutions in the division across both business units, whether it's consumer audio or car audio. Our business is really changing quite a bit. It used to be a pure product business. Now we are supplying software solutions. And in fact, interestingly, before I give you a little break down, our Connected Services team has really been teaming up with our Lifestyle division to bring in necessary software competence to change consumer product to cloud-based smart speakers, smart devices. Same thing we are doing in car audio, so back to your question. We have roughly – this division is split pretty much equally in both. But we saw very good development, our consumer audio business grew nearly 25% and our car audio business grew 15% plus in this quarter which we are extremely pleased with.
David H. Lim - Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Got you. Thank you. Can you give us a little more color on premium audio demand in China given – it seems like it's a burgeoning market. Market take rates on both the consumer and the automotive side seems to be really low compared to the developed markets. And also on the order book, the $2 billion that you posted in Q1, a little bit more detail between audio and infotainment would be very helpful.
Dinesh C. Paliwal - Harman International Industries, Inc.
Sure. So, first of all the backlog is sort of split equally 50-50, almost $1 billion and so infotainment and another $1 billion came from car audio which we are very pleased with because our car audio business is our profit leader. When it comes to proliferation of car audio take rates, yes, of course, China, starting points are very low. Low-single-digit penetration, if you look at whole China. So there of course Chinese consumers or I would say Asian consumers are very brand hungry. They want American iconic brands to be in their car and our car company customers continue to find overwhelmingly market research that branded car audio is helping them differentiate their own cars.
Having said that, we are actually seeing the penetration of car audio across the world. I mentioned to you we expanded our relationship with Ford which is a fantastic news. It's a very good business with Ford. Now we replaced a competitor at high-end, Lincoln. We also replaced a competitor for a Cross Carline globally for Ford worldwide with both brands coming from HARMAN.

In addition, we won business with other German and Asian automakers for car audio. And you saw that, I was extremely pleased to share with you our order backlog for car audio. The book and has gone 2:1 ratio which means our future is even better. Margins and our backlogs are getting better every quarter, every year.
David H. Lim - Wells Fargo Securities LLC
And just quickly, can you size the win with Ford on the (27:50)? And any kind of commentary on your infotainment system? Obviously, we have one of your competitors that are launching a new, as they call state-of-the-art, infotainment system I think in the first quarter and they are going to show that at CES. Any idea of how your best infotainment matches up with their new product that they are going to launch? Thank you.
Dinesh C. Paliwal - Harman International Industries, Inc.
Yeah. Thank you, David. First of all our infotainment award is fairly new. That is a competitor replacement. By the time it goes into car production, I think they are sometime away, probably 18 months to 24 months away. So you will see that – and this is for display audio. That's a brand-new category which HARMAN is growing into.
When it comes to car audio win, that's actually a very sizable win for us, one of the largest wins we have ever seen. But there seems to be a trend. We are seeing that Cross Carline, this is almost like a single source solution for car audio whenever car companies are deciding and a stickiness is very high in that business. So all in all very good. And you will also see from us in CES some incredible product launches across compute platform, across telematics, cyber security, ADAS solutions, and of course you will see some sound management cutting-edge technologies.

Our next question comes from the line of Brian Johnson with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.
Brian A. Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.
Yes, good morning, Dinesh and team.
Dinesh C. Paliwal - Harman International Industries, Inc.
Good morning, Brian.
2
Brian A. Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.
A couple of strategic questions. The first is around kind of the take rates in embedded nav and coming back to that. Second, maybe just thinking about that new project in voice, in general.
So on the first question, Chrysler which we do know is (29:48) going away, but interesting what they are doing in the market is offering the big screen Uconnect as we understand it as with or without embedded nav, which could take away some of what we – the question is that. I can see the consumer appeal there for younger people who don't believe in embedded nav and believe in their smartphones especially as now Google lets you preload your local maps reducing data usage. But you know as you think about what they've done, do you see that spreading to other OEMs?
And then also is that good news for HARMAN in terms of maybe increasing the take rates at the high end by taking a way the objection of I don't need embedded nav or bad news because even if that happens, there is loss of markup on the?
Dinesh C. Paliwal - Harman International Industries, Inc.
Good Brian. Let me sort of bring it all together. So first of all what's happening as you have heard before, that if you look at the full pie, the whole market, so nearly 50% of the business, the bottom half of the pie, has been nothing or simple AM/FM radio. Top half of the pie was split equally 25-25 into fully embedded navigation-based infotainment systems, and another one was display audio which means to put simply – simply put, it's full embedded system minus navigation. So you can bring your own kind of thing.
What we're witnessing, the bottom half of the pie is very fast moving into the both quarters of the top pie which means, either going towards display audio or going into embedded audio. My firm belief supported by big OEMs worldwide is that you will see fast migration at equal pace, but very soon in couple of years you will see even display audio consumers will start to migrate towards fully embedded because it's not clear that if cars are going to be autonomous or semiautonomous, you can't run them from a handheld device. This is a post device era we are talking about. Very distributed strong compute platform which HARMAN is leader in would actually be part of the car embedded system with cloud applications. So that's what we are seeing. And we're happy that we are playing on both sides of the display audio as well as embedded audio and winning on both sides.

Then you also know what else is happening is OTA. The over-the-air update technology is something which is just emerging and we have the unique patented technology with 15 years of R&D and we have won more than a dozen OEMs including FCA, every single Cross Carline FCA, we received an order for, our systems as well as non- HARMAN systems to be updated by our OTA technology.
And as far as the large screen Brian, that seems to be sort of personal choice and more and more people are asking for it. Therefore, display unit is becoming a very important part. The user interface, the contextual and smart user interface, the display devices, display units will play a bigger role. Consolidation of industry here is even likely to happen more because nearly one-third of COG, cost of goods sold is getting to a, close to display unit.
We are supplying large display units as you mentioned Uconnect that is a HARMAN system – has been, it won actually in 2016 Best Infotainment System Award by Consumer Report and we are seeing similarly in our Mercedes S Class, BMW 7 series, Audi A8, those cars, we're also seeing large-screen. And I guess Asian consumers would definitely opt for large-screen. So I think that seems to be the trend.
Brian A. Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.
But in terms of the take rates and sort of your CPD (33:46), if a customer – end customer were to come in the showroom and leave with a Uconnect system without embedded nav, does that affect the revenue or EBITDA you would be booking?
Dinesh C. Paliwal - Harman International Industries, Inc.
So interesting you raised that. Let me clarify one more point. Whether you win display audio or full embedded system, the only difference is navigation, which is a component of multiple parts come together to create compute platform. So we are providing choices of using any nav whether you use 3-D high-definition maps, which we supply to our customers or you can use a simple 2-D Google maps or what have you. So choices are there available to you. But imagine it's still the whole multimedia, the tuner technology, the hands-free telephony, the interface with other ECUs in the car, that still has to be done even for display audio and that's what our system for Ford is all about, highly integrated display audio, large-screen, but it still would have a choice and eventually this system can also integrate on board navigation or you can bring it your own.
And we are gaining ground. And as far as the penetration of the take rates, traditionally we have seen about 300 basis point year-over-year improvement in take rate whether it's the display audio or fully embedded. We are playing on both and we are seeing same take rate improvement, in fact, slightly more for us, because we are working with the customers where the take rates are higher. So I think run rate for HARMAN for take rate is pretty strong with nearly a $24 billion, $25 billion of order backlog. I think we have perhaps the fastest opportunity to grow this business in the next 5 to 10 years. Thank you, Brian.

Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Brinkman with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.
Ryan Brinkman - JPMorgan Securities LLC
Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question.
Dinesh C. Paliwal - Harman International Industries, Inc.
Hi, Ryan.
Ryan Brinkman - JPMorgan Securities LLC
I would like to delve a bit deeper into the pre-breakout margins at Lifestyle during the quarter. I know that revenue rose materially and so operating leverage was clearly a big driver, but it seems like the margin rose considerably more than that which would be ordinarily implied by historical incremental at the division. Can you may be shed some more light on the manufacturing excellence that Sandy referred to in her comments, what that is, whether it's sustainable, et cetera? And then if whether were anything of more one-time nature potentially benefiting the quarter.

Sandra E. Rowland - Harman International Industries, Inc.
Yeah. Thanks, Ryan. I think that the good and positive margin expansion that we have see in lifestyle is sustainable. Where we saw the greatest margin expansion this quarter was in our car audio division and I think a lot of it comes from some of the synergies we got from the Bang & Olufsen acquisition last year when we acquired them. We moved their manufacturing out from Denmark into our manufacturing operation in Hungary and now that those operations are running together, we're getting very good synergies there. But if I look at the margin levels, they were right about the same place that they were in Q4, so quarter sequentially for car audio, we've seen the same pattern for the past six months.
Dinesh C. Paliwal - Harman International Industries, Inc.
And also, Ryan, remember the scale is becoming even bigger for us. We are the largest supplier of car audio and we're becoming perhaps the largest, but I would say niche player in consumer audio and we're gaining ground because of the scale and the fast pace of innovation, we're bringing.
Ryan Brinkman - JPMorgan Securities LLC
Okay.
Dinesh C. Paliwal - Harman International Industries, Inc.
So margins are sustainable. I would even feel good about our sustainability of top-line. We're feeling good about what we have in the pipeline.
Ryan Brinkman - JPMorgan Securities LLC
That's great. Thank you. And then just last question again on lifestyle, more about the top-line this time. I know you're doing a lot new on the car audio side, like with Lincoln, et cetera, but just curious if you're able to share at all the relative growth rates between car audio and consumer what I think our home and multimedia, et cetera, as I know you've got some drivers there too with Under Armour, et cetera.
Sandra E. Rowland - Harman International Industries, Inc.
Yeah, Ryan, I think we shared the prepared numbers earlier. The growth in consumer was about 25% in the quarter and the growth in car audio was about 15% in the quarter.
Ryan Brinkman - JPMorgan Securities LLC
Okay. And is there anything to keep in mind as the year progresses about the cadence of the various growth rates?
Sandra E. Rowland - Harman International Industries, Inc.
I think one thing to keep in mind, as we look at the seasonality, Q2 is the largest quarter for our consumer business and we think we're going to have a very strong holiday season.
Ryan Brinkman - JPMorgan Securities LLC
Okay. Very helpful. Thanks a lot.

Our next question comes from the line of Patrick Nolan with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.
Patrick Nolan - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Good morning, everyone. Good quarter.
Dinesh C. Paliwal - Harman International Industries, Inc.
Hi, Patrick. Good morning. Thank you.
Patrick Nolan - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Just a follow-up on Ryan's question about the seasonality. So I'm assuming some of this consumer lifestyle strength is likely driven by you guys talked about in the past some of the upgrade cycles so I'm assuming iPhone 7 maybe drove some of the strength in this quarter, I'm just kind of reinforcing your confidence about the holiday season. So do think – is the second half gross going to be a good deal lower in that business the way you're thinking about it right now?
Dinesh C. Paliwal - Harman International Industries, Inc.
So, the way you should see that business year-over-year, there is a clear seasonality. Second quarter is the strongest quarter in this business, but first quarter this year, we actually were very pleased with incredible growth, 25%. And we expect Q2 to be similar or even better.
Second half is slightly weaker, because – just for seasonality, but we think our strength is not just coming because of what you just mentioned with the company. But we are seeing incredible penetration of smart portables. We actually became number one supplier in the world by GfK, a market tracking agency in smart portable wireless speakers, and we are seeing similar growth now in our smart headphones, some of the headphones are even now updated over-the-air with a firmware, software. So incredible knowledge we are bringing.

So Under Armour is the third piece as an example, the strategic partnerships like Under Armour in consumer audio or IBM Watson in professional audio will continue to bring more momentum. So Under Armour is a great brand. We are developing jointly products. The product, which we just launched called in-ear heart rate monitoring, let me stress that this is one of a kind product. It's a military grade heart rate monitoring, absolutely accurate. So this is designed for athletes, but priced for mass-market, so we expect it to also take off very nicely. And you will see some incredible product launches at CES in January in Las Vegas. So we feel good about the division to continue the great momentum they have.
Patrick Nolan - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Thanks. That's very helpful. And just on the Connected Car division, the growth there was just slightly lower than the full year target, I think it implies, is there going to be any lumpiness of that growth this year that we should be thinking about as we kind of go through the year, or do you expect to kind of to steadily move more towards that kind of 7%-ish growth you're targeting?
Dinesh C. Paliwal - Harman International Industries, Inc.
Yeah. So, first of all, we are actually well within what we guided the market. We guided between 6% to 8% and we are right in there. And when it comes to cyclicity typically our second and fourth quarters are the strongest quarters.
Having said that, we are very pleased that Q1 came in where it came in. And what excites me most is the margin expansion continuation. You might have noticed that we are very margin driven management. We will not negotiate anything but for margins, and for last three years in Connected Car alone, we have added 500 basis points of margin improvement and Q1 is another strong indication of where we're headed. So all-in-all we expect to hit our full-year guidance for this division and very good margin development.

Our next question comes from the line of David Leiker with Baird. Please proceed with your question.
Joe D. Vruwink - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)
Hi, good morning. This is Joe Vruwink for David.
Sandra E. Rowland - Harman International Industries, Inc.
Yes.
Dinesh C. Paliwal - Harman International Industries, Inc.
Hi, Joe. How are you? Morning.
Joe D. Vruwink - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)
Good. You talk about being on track to hit full-year guidance but then there is comments like Pro turning around, Lifestyle margin staying strong being on track within Connected Car, so it seems like you are tracking above where guidance stands as things sit today. Is there a mitigating factor in the equation we need to consider?
Dinesh C. Paliwal - Harman International Industries, Inc.
Joe, first of all a great question. Let me start with this. We are very pleased with our Q1 development. It gives us strong confidence to hit our full year guidance we have provided you in August. Listen, it's still early in the year, for us to review to even increase the guidance. If we were to do that, we need one more quarter. Right now, if I can be honest with you, I feel good about the high-end of our guidance where we are tracking. So that's all I can share. I think all four divisions are developing well.
Professional division, you heard me say that Q2 should be a growth quarter for us and then from there on, we should see sustainable growth development. So we feel good about and Connected Services you also mentioned, for Connected Services typically our Q4 is the most strongest quarter. But we still came in 6% growth in constant currency and we guided 8% for the full-year. So for all four divisions we feel good about but all in all for company, we could be in a better place after Q1.

Joe D. Vruwink - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)
Okay. Great. And then a few questions on your backlog. Sorry, if I missed it. Can you say how much is new or conquest of the $2 billion in new awards versus replacement? And then the 25% step-up in your award activity relative to today's Connected Car revenue base, if I think about 25%, that's probably a three-year future value, if you will, thinking about the timing of when those will launch. If I do a compound growth rate on that that's maybe a high single-digit rate of growth. Is that the right rate of growth to think about for your infotainment business?
Sandra E. Rowland - Harman International Industries, Inc.
So, Joe, let me take the first part of your question. You asked about what part of the new awards that we announced in the quarter were new and which ones were competitive replacements. So if you break it down, if you look at our car audio awards, obviously the Ford award that we announced is a pure competitive replacement. And if you look at the close to $1 billion of new awards in Connected Car, it's split about 50-50.
Dinesh C. Paliwal - Harman International Industries, Inc.
50% competitive replacement, 50% new awards. I don't how – when you say the growth, the way we like you to see, we are running about 1.25:1.3 book and bill which means our orders are ahead of revenue by a factor of – multiplier of 1.3 for infotainment, Connected Car, compute platform. And for car audio book and bill is 2:1. That means the orders are outpacing revenue by a factor of two.
So, all in all, we are running our automotive business the book and bill is 1.4:1. So that gives us tremendous confidence for the next several years as we guided you for three-year and five-year outlook, we feel good about that.

Our next question comes from the line of Tavis McCourt with Raymond James. Please proceed with your question.
Tavis C. McCourt - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Hey, Dinesh and Sandy, it's Tavis.
Dinesh C. Paliwal - Harman International Industries, Inc.
Hi, Tavis. Good morning.
Tavis C. McCourt - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Thanks for taking my questions. Two of them, Dinesh, first, I think this will help kind of get around some of the questions earlier. You won quite a bit of display audio in the last several quarters, Toyota, Ford. I think you mentioned, at least, one of the awards this quarter with display audio. So, based on that knowledge, do you expect any material change in your gross margin or operating margin profile in the Connected Car division as that makes changes towards display audio going forward?
And then secondly, I was wondering if you could discuss a little bit the kind of the sensitivity to the model if we get a decline in auto production next year given investor concerns right now? Maybe a bit of a explanation of how the cost structure has changed since the last recession, if you've done any sensitivity analysis on if you were to get a 5% decline in production, what that would mean for the business and cost structure? Thanks.
Dinesh C. Paliwal - Harman International Industries, Inc.
Sure. Great. Tavis, let me answer the first question and maybe Sandy will give more color on the second. Well, first of all, display audio or embedded audio as a brand, margins continue to improve. As you have heard us say and we have validated, we are very margin driven management team.
We will walk away from business if it does not meet our margin requirements and we have done it, and it won't be the last time. We will do it in future, because there's plenty of business out there. Yes, we are market leader with 25% of the world market and rest 10 sharing 75%. So we win obviously a lot of business but we also walk away from others.
Having said that, display audio is a good business. Yes, it meets our margin requirements. It's not dilutive, actually it's accretive, all in all. When it comes to sensitivity to the market production, as we guided for the full 2017, 2% to 3%. Actually that – the production guidance still holds, because we guided China to be around 3%, 3.5%. China is tracking over 6%. We guided Europe to be right around 0% to 1%, European came in slightly weaker. US is holding. So all in all, global production for our fiscal year is in line and we feel good about our full-year guidance. Hypothetically, if production, it becomes flat or even lower than that, I think that's where the cost advantage and the baseline cost comes in. I'll let Sandy give some color.

Sandra E. Rowland - Harman International Industries, Inc.
Yes, Tavis. Just first on sensitivities for your model. I think the way it could break it down is if you look at our portfolio of businesses, remember that we have business that's outside of the automotive space. So overall about 65% of our revenues across Connected Car and car audio come from automotive, so it's about 65% of our company exposure, which is right around $4.7 billion. So each point of production is worth somewhere between $45 million and $50 million to the top line. And if you look at it from a leverage standpoint, we've typically said that we get about 20% operating leverage on the upside. And it works that way on the downside as well typically between 20% to 25%. And if it stays down longer, we will continue to take cost actions to mitigate any of the erosion.

Our next question comes from the line of Brad Erickson, Pacific Crest Securities. Please proceed with your question.
Brad Erickson - Pacific Crest Securities
Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions.
Dinesh C. Paliwal - Harman International Industries, Inc.
Hi, Brad, good morning.
Brad Erickson - Pacific Crest Securities
Just a couple. First, I know historically I guess the margin flow-through on the Connected Car business has been a little bit lumpy depending on some I guess more random timings of things like R&D, reimbursements et cetera. Can you help us with just I guess the linearity that you're thinking about the margin flow-through as we go through fiscal 2017 here in the Connected Car business?
Sandra E. Rowland - Harman International Industries, Inc.
Yes, okay.
Dinesh C. Paliwal - Harman International Industries, Inc.
Go ahead, Sandy.
Sandra E. Rowland - Harman International Industries, Inc.
No, I was going to say, Brad that we do guided that the upside leverage is about 20% but we do tell you that there is some volatility from quarter-to-quarter and that's partially why we don't give quarterly guidance. From a Connected Car standpoint, we do like to see favorable margins in the first half of the year because you do have the APR impact hitting us in the third quarter. So that's something to keep in mind. But if you look over the past several years, we've been seeing consistent, drop-down of around 20%.
Brad Erickson - Pacific Crest Securities
Got it. That's super helpful. And then just on the professional business, any kind of updated thoughts there. Historically I think you've seemed a bit more open the last few quarters to maybe divesting that asset at some point just given that there are fewer cost synergies versus the OEM business. Can you provide any update as to how you're thinking about the recovery and future of that business within the HARMAN portfolio? Thanks.
Dinesh C. Paliwal - Harman International Industries, Inc.
So consistently what we said in the last couple of quarters, this business is going through some transformation and we are very vigorously taking our strategic actions, three areas. The three buckets which I know how to do well in our company, that is cost leadership, new product introduction, and go to market strategy. All three are totally locked on.
There's a new leader of the division who brings tremendous sense of urgency. We already consolidated our European footprint which is flowing through our bottom-line almost 100 basis point improvement in the margins this year which we confirmed to you last time.
This year we have already announced and we're working on execution of couple of US sites which will also add another 50 basis point to 100 basis point improvement once we are done by end of this year.
On top of that, brand-new, many new products would be launched and you'll see some of them coming out at NAMM which is North America professional audio society, January 2017, so new products being launched to fulfill the solution needs for enterprise and entertainment.

Another great example for that was IBM Watson, the strategic partnership, how we are enabling IoT in professional audio-video lighting, first time any pro company is doing, that's HARMAN.
And third, go to market, sales training for our own people and our channels, distributors, and reps, is undergoing very well. We're seeing traction. In fact the orders we have booked in Q1 are very encouraging to me and the way we see it, October sales is already in so we have little bit of visibility.
Q2 should be a growth quarter and from this point on, you should expect growth. And in the end, I would say this business is a great business, has been good business for HARMAN, and we expect this business to return to a double-digit margin soon and then from there on be a good contributor to the company.

Our next question comes from the line of Joseph Spak with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed.
Jacob Hughes - RBC Capital Markets LLC
Hi. This is Jacob Hughes on for Joe, I just had a couple of strategic questions. NHTSA recently put forth their vehicle cyber security guidance. I wonder if you had any initial take on that and what are the opportunities for HARMAN? And then secondly, how does QNX aiming for Tier 1 status and what happens if other software players get involved. How do you think about that?
Dinesh C. Paliwal - Harman International Industries, Inc.
Wonderful. Let me take the QNX, I mean, the cyber security first than QNX. So cyber security, unless you missed my opening comments, I shared with you one of the breaking news that NHTSA together with University of Michigan conducted a third-party research evaluation of available cyber security intrusion detection and mitigation solutions and HARMAN ranked number one, absolutely, best in class. And this is extremely encouraging for me personally because we actually doubled down two years ago when no one talked about cyber security. We said without cyber security, you should not even dream of autonomous or semiautonomous as soon as you connect a car, you've got bad guys coming in your car.
So we're actually leading that space and just like we did for QNX, making a standard, we're doing for OTA, Red Bend Technology and we think our cyber security will become industry-standard. So we are very happy about it and we have number of customers right now in RFQ phase where our cyber security would be integral part of the offerings.
Turning to QNX, QNX is one of the several operating systems out there and HARMAN used to own QNX and we have incredible competence and we use QNX, it's still in some of our systems. Same time we are also using Linux, we are using Android, and we're using hybrid approaches. So we wanted to be totally agnostic and we feel very good about. We are developing very large multibillion-dollar programs in Android as well as Linux and QNX.
Jacob Hughes - RBC Capital Markets LLC
Okay. Thank you.

Our next question comes from the line of Steven Fox with Cross Research. Please proceed.
Steven Fox - Cross Research LLC
Thanks, good morning. I just had one big picture question. I was just curious, given the pretty big upside in the quarter versus what we all were thinking, and you guys mentioned market share gains across different channels as well as different product categories, is there anything within that you could highlight maybe the top things that drove that, those share gains whether it's roadmap advancements that are picking up steam or channel relationships that are gaining ground? I'm just here where you would see the internal momentum during the quarter. Thanks a lot.
Dinesh C. Paliwal - Harman International Industries, Inc.
Sure. It's a great question and it is a strategic question, which I hope gets asked all the time, because I think we have clearly broken out from the pack of other Tier 1s. So in Connected Car, what is differentiating HARMAN from rest is we're the only company who has the most powerful compute platform with wide integration capability of multiple ECU supplied by various other Tier 1s and we're the one who worked agnostically with all silicon or memory suppliers whether it's a Intel, Samsung, TI, NVIDIA, QUALCOMM, NXP and we have – we create, we work with them, design the unique solution for automotive and then we deploy that.

In addition, we are also the company who has broken out in telematic space, we have been doing telematics for multiple generations in Germany and in the United States. Now we have launched very first order, industry's first, I repeat, gateway-based telematics for a German OEM, which we believe will become another trend.
And the third is cyber security and ADAS solutions. Cyber security, we are doubling down and also OTA we have clear market lead on that. We have one 14 car companies already six or seven of them through directly through HARMAN and others through other competitors.
And ADAS, you heard me say, we integrate. So the best of the best whether it's coming from Mobileye or from somewhere else and we also develop our own object detection, vision algorithms and the camera 360 surround view implementing in Asia as well as the German automakers. So that's the differentiation in Connected Car.
In car audio, our key differentiation is having the access to the world's best brand. That is differentiating the top luxury cars from the other premium cars. And then when it comes to creating next-generation solutions, I mentioned, imagine you're sitting in a shared economy in a car where three other passengers you don't know you are sitting with, you will need to have your own individual sound video zone. That's HARMAN's patented technology.
So we are doing road noise cancellation, we're doing ambient noise cancellation, we're doing engine auto cancellation, we are doing individual sound zone. So combine it with unique market-leading iconic brand and sound management systems that put us apart from anybody – and by the way I repeat, we're the only company who had that power of car audio and sound management and Connected Car. No other Tier 1 can boast that.

And there are no questions – further questions at this time. I'll turn the conference back over to you
Dinesh C. Paliwal - Harman International Industries, Inc.
This has been a great -- great quarter and I'd like to thank you all for your continued interest in HARMAN's story. This is my tenth year and this management team is very stable and take great pride in doing what we do well, that is execution. We don't worry about strategy every day. We have a great strategy, but we execute well. We take great pride in saying, we are margin expansion Company and we take great pride in innovation.
So with that, I would say to our owners, our shareholders, our investors, and our sell side and buy side analyst community, thank you for taking our story and supporting our story and very eloquently extending it to other people who don't quite understand as new customers. And we remain very excited about our story. We are a continued growth story, we have been and we hope we are off to a very good start in fiscal 2017. Thank you all. And we'll be talking and meeting with many of you over the next days or so.

            JOINING MATERIALS
            HANDY & HARMAN's Precious Metal activities include the fabrication of precious metal and their alloys into brazing alloys and the utilization of precious metal in precision electroplating. HANDY & HARMAN's profits from precious metal products are derived from the "value added" of processing and fabricating and not from the purchase and resale of precious metal. In accordance with general practice in the industry, prices to customers are a composite of two factors: (1) the value of the precious metal content of the product and (2) the "fabrication value", which includes the cost of base metals, labor, overhead, financing and profit. Fabricated precious metal brazing alloys are used in many industries including automotive, air conditioning, general industrial and other metal-joining industries. HANDY & HARMAN is engaged in precision electroplating (often using gold, silver, palladium and various base metals) of electronic and electrical components primarily for use for use in the automotive industry.
