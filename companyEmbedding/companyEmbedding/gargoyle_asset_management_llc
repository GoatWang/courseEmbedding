Overview

At Gargoyle we strive to meet the unique needs of each of you - our clients. We believe that every equity portfolio can benefit from disciplined and efficient hedging. Whether you're an Individual Investor or an Institutional Client, we work with you and your financial team to find the product that is right for you.

For Individual Investors, the TCW | Gargoyle Hedged Value Fund, which is advised by TCW and sub-advised by Gargoyle, seeks long-term capital appreciation with lower volatility than a stand-alone stock portfolio. The Fund aims to achieve this outcome through a combination of buying undervalued stocks and selling overpriced index call options. The Fund is available for purchase under the symbol TFHIX and TFHVX on popular platforms. 

For Qualified Investors, our Flagship Gargoyle Hedged Value Fund invests in a portfolio of relative-value stocks using our proprietary stock selection methodology, and utilizes index options to target a 50% net-long market exposure. Our Gargoyle Enhanced Alpha Fund is a market-neutral version of the GHV strategy, which features both an expanded universe for stock selection, and increased reduction of market exposure through the sale of index call options to target a 0% net-long market exposure.

For the Institutional Investor we offer an Options Overlay Service that is custom tailored to meet the needs and investment objectives of each of our Institutional Clients. Through a dynamic index options overlay program we seek to simultaneously reduce the risk and enhance the performance of an Institutional Investor’s existing equity portfolio.

Hedging Strategies

Simple Short Exposure. This strategy effectively shorts the S&P 500 by
        buying shares in the S&P 500 Short ETF.
        Simple Hedging will assume that 100%
        of the backtest's invested principal is always in the backtest's long positions.

        For example, if you choose a 25% hedging rate, then for a $10,000 portfolio,
        you will be long $10,000 and have a $2,500 short on the S&P 500.
        The short position will adjust each rebalancing period to match 25% of the total portfolio.
        Any gains/losses from the short are added to the overall available capital for the long positions in the
        portfolio.
      

Moving Average Hedge.  With this strategy, your portfolio will be hedged
        by shorting the S&P 500 whenever your long portfolio's performance drops below the monthly moving average.
        So if you set a 25% hedge, 25% of your long portfolio will be sold and the funds reallocated to the short
        whenever the hedge is in effect.
        Once your long portfolio performance goes back over the moving average, the short hedge will be removed
        and the funds from the short will be reallocated to your long positions.
      

        When hedging strategies are being used, backtests can only go back as far as 2006.  This is the date
        the S&P 500 Short ETF first appeared.

Stock Sell Buffer

      You can optionally include a stock sell buffer in your backtesting model.
      It works by keeping a stock in your portfolio even when it would otherwise drop out
      during rebalancing as long as it remains within your sell buffer threshold.
      For example, you are backtesting with the top 20 stocks each quarter and set a sell buffer of 50.
      In the first quarter, AAPL is one of the top 20 stocks and is included in the portfolio.
      In quarter 2, AAPL drops down to number 25. Without the sell buffer, AAPL would drop out
      for that quarter, but since it is still within the sell buffer threshold of 50,
      it will remain in the portfolio.
      Your portfolio size remains the same. The stocks that would have fallen out stay in and the
      stocks that would otherwise have been added stay out. Using the sell buffer may
      help produce a lower turnover rate.
    

      Sell Buffer Size (must be greater than # of holdings in portfolio to work):
      
No sell buffer
10
25
35
50
100




Rebalancing Frequency

      By default backtester rebalances quarterly using new 13F filing data. You can
      adjust the rebalancing frequency using the dropdown below. Reasons for
      changing the frequency include lower turnover and possible tax advantages
      by keeping stocks at least one year before selling.
    


        Do not rebalance after each quarter

or rebalance:
        
Every quarter (default)
 Every other quarter
 Once a year




How many days after the end-of-quarter date before doing the backtest? (0 - 60) 

DAYS





      Or use day whenever the filing was submitted to the SEC
      (or the last filing when using a group of funds):
Starting Quarter

      By default backtester will test your strategy using all available dates going back to 2001 (for subscribers only).
      You can optionally adjust when the backtest actually starts.

Individual Investors

 

Gargoyle offers a number of products for the Individual Investor seeking long term exposure to equities in the form of three mutual funds - TCW | Gargoyle Hedged Value Fund, TCW | Gargoyle Systematic Value Fund and TCW | Gargoyle Dynamic 500 Fund - and, for qualified purchasers, two hedge funds - Gargoyle Hedged Value (QP) Fund L.P. and Gargoyle Enhanced Alpha Fund L.P. 

For the Mutual Fund Investor, the TCW | Gargoyle Hedged Value Fund is available in both Retail (TFHVX) and Institutional (TFHIX) share classes. The TCW | Gargoyle Hedged Value Fund seeks long-term capital appreciation with lower volatility than a stand-alone stock portfolio.

For Qualified Purchasers, our Flagship Gargoyle Hedged Value Fund invests in a portfolio of relative-value stocks using our proprietary stock selection methodology, and utilizes index options to target a 50% net-long market exposure. Our Gargoyle Enhanced Alpha Fund is a market-neutral version of the GHV strategy, which features both an expanded universe for stock selection, and increased reduction of market exposure through the sale of index call options to target a 0% net-long market exposure.
