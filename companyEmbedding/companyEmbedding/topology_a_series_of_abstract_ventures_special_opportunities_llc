Whether you’re naming your baby, your boat, or your brand, the process can breed nearly endless deliberation. Keep these principles in mind as you scout the perfect name.
By Matt Gordon and Nick Foley3 minute ReadEven at the best of times, naming is a contentious and emotional business. Whether you’re naming your baby, your boat, or your brand, the process can breed nearly endless deliberation. Keep these principles in mind as you scout the perfect name.advertisementMAKE IT MEMORABLE The search engine has changed everything. Instead of worrying about your spot in the phone book, you need a name that’s relevant and truly compelling. The key to any name–simple or complex, abstract or descriptive–is grabbing attention and staying memorable.Example: Yummy Tummy KoalasIntriguing, irreverent, distinctly Australian: Yummy Tummy Koalas instantly conveys the fun factor of this brand. FILL IT WITH MEANINGChoose a name that tells your brand’s story. Over time, you can expand the meaning of your name and add layers of depth to make it even more powerful–a visual identity, a color, a sound. The more significance your name carries, the more work it will do for you.advertisementExample: VisaFrom a word that initially meant only a stamp on a passport, Visa has surrounded its name with a host of associations–travel, access, opportunities, identity, official status–that allow it to tell the right story at the right time.SAY IT OUT LOUD The best names are the ones that people can’t wait to tell their friends about. Names that roll off the tongue invite customers to become your viral marketing agency. Say, shout, and even sing names you’re considering to see which one will echo for years to come.Example: SchweppesHappy coincidence? In 1783, Johann Jacob Schweppe opted to name his bubbly, effervescent soft drinks after himself. More than 200 years later, consumers still love calling out his name.advertisementDON’T WAIT TO FALL IN LOVEEven the best name may not seem terrific the first time you hear it. As your name evolves into a brand, it will acquire more and richer associations. Give the names you’re considering a chance to grow on you–and try to imagine what they might stand for five or 10 years down the road.Example: GoogleOriginally a variant of googol, the numeral one followed by 100 zeros, Google has come to represent a playful and innovative culture that delivers everything from email to operating systems.LISTEN TO YOUR FEAR Great names grab your attention by breaking the rules–but a name that defies your expectations may also appear scary. Look past the fear and you’ll find  energy and possibility. That buzz of surprise could be telling you that you’ve found a name that stands out.advertisementExample: BlackBerryProMail, an early name candidate for what we know today as the BlackBerry, probably would have been an easier sell in RIM’s executive suite. But once users got their hands on the perfectly sized device, it became obvious which name was the perfect fit.STAND OUT IN A CROWD If you are different, you want to sound different. Use your name to focus on what makes your brand special. Look at your category and where it’s headed. What do customers expect? How can your name signal something new?Example: W HotelsIn a market dominated by the prosaic names of people and places–Hilton, Marriott, Hyatt, and Radisson–W had the nerve to sound young, energetic, and stylish. Today, it’s the premier destination for business travelers who want to balance style with substance.advertisementTOO MUCH IS NEVER ENOUGHThe first hundred names you think of are likely to be the same ones your competitors tossed around. Use naming specialists to develop thousands of alternatives. To arrive at a name that meets all your objectives, you need a list that’s both broad and deep. Example: AccentureThousands of names were created, hundreds were screened, and scores were considered. One name rose to the top, and now countless conversations center around this brand’s “Accent on the future.”EXPECT ITS STORY TO EVOLVEThere are always reasons to dislike a name, but you can’t make the right decision if you never make any decision at all. Remember that names are just one part of your brand, and they’re elastic–you can stretch them to mean what you want. advertisementExample: VirginAs a word, “virgin” brings to mind anything from wool and olive oil to Mary and The Material Girl. But as a brand name, Virgin has come to stand for a provocative attitude that can sell everything from prepaid mobile phones to vacations in orbit. advertisementRelated StoriesLeadershipThe One Question I Ask To Stop Negative Thoughts From Ruining My DayLeadershipFrom Office Footwear To Bad Interview Answers: This Week’s Top Leadership StoriesLeadershipHow To Structure The Week Before Vacation So The Friday Isn’t A NightmareadvertisementVideoIdeasIdeasNight Out For Safety and Liberation Asks How To Go Beyond Policing To Keep Communities SafeIdeasThis App Lets You Request Mental Health Help For A Homeless Person In DistressIdeasHow Sweden Is Fast Tracking Refugees Into The WorkforceEntertainmentEntertainmentNew Absolut Campaign Celebrates The Ongoing Fight For LGBTQ RightsEntertainment7 Times Obama’s Official Photographer Was Trump’s Classiest TrollEntertainment“Stranger Things 2” Thriller, Gucci Goes Trekkie: The Top 5 Ads Of The WeekCo.DesignCitiesThis Woman’s Travel Photos Are Better Than Yours — And She Never Leaves The HouseProductThis Airbnb For Great Architecture Is Curated By Two ArchitectsGraphicsThis Photo Captures Every Color In A Single Twinkling StarFast CompanyIdeasNight Out For Safety and Liberation Asks How To Go Beyond Policing To Keep Communities SafeIdeasThis App Lets You Request Mental Health Help For A Homeless Person In DistressTechnologyInside The ICO Bubble: Why Initial Coin Offerings Have Raised More Than $1 Billion Since January






5 Principles of Convergence: How To Work Better At The Intersection Of Tech, Creativity, And Media

Razorfish CEO Bob Lord outlines 5 ways creative companies can adapt to a converging world and create better brand experiences.
By Bob Lord5 minute ReadThe word convergence has been picking up steam in the marketing world. It may even be the “big data” term of 2013. Yet, the word means different things to different people. At Razorfish, we use convergence to describe the coming together of three irresistible forces–media, technology, and creativity–to create experiences that enrich the consumer’s relationship with the brand.advertisementConvergence is a constant process, not an end point. Technology, creativity, and media are constantly evolving, and so is the converged company. It is a never-ending challenge to adapt a customer experience that, in our digital age, will always be in flux. Too often, businesses are far behind consumers in embracing technological change, a problem that has everything to do with how the organization is set up. My new book, coauthored with Razorfish Global CTO Ray Velez, Converge: Transforming Business at the Intersection of Marketing and Technology, describes in detail how enterprises and teams must adapt for an age of disruption.Here are five key principles:Put the Customer at the Center.Being ready for convergence isn’t about building an innovations lab, spending marketing budget on Facebook and Twitter ads or about hiring a social media “guru” to respond to online complaints. It’s about embracing a customer-centric mind-set and making your entire organization responsive to the customer journey. This isn’t as easy as it sounds, especially for larger, well-established companies where scale has mandated the creation of a complicated organizational chart.

Strategies need to be based on data from actual consumer activity, not abstract gut feeling. That data should dictate not only what experiences you serve consumers but where, when, and how. Brand communications must engage the consumer in social platforms and ecosystems and open APIs. And the retail experience must be made omni-channel, giving shoppers the same experience whether they’re in-store, online, or on the phone.Think of Your Brand as a Service and Experience.You’re no longer in the business of selling stuff; you’re filling consumers’ needs. As a marketer, you’re creating new products and apps and always-on ecosystems, not just a series of campaigns based around a calendar of product launches. Nike is the classic example, with its ecosystem of fitness apparel, gadgets like FuelBand and services like Nike+ that immerse the user in the company’s innovation and create an end-to-end fitness solution. Special K, one of our clients, is still in the cereal game and it sells a ton of it. But it’s also in the health, fitness, and weight-loss games. It took its Special K challenge and turned it into a digital weight-loss platform.To create and maintain this ecosystem, you’ll be investing in marketing operations, not just working media, and bringing in more designers and developers. In the past, marketing ops were largely limited to the maintenance of an internal marketing team and hiring and firing agencies that produced the creative work. People were accountable for spending the dollars, not how effectively they were spent. In a converged world, it will be about those activities, and also about investing in people and systems to ensure that the marketing spending is optimized.advertisementReject Silos.Media, technology, and creativity are no longer discrete problems. Let’s take the most fundamental example of this: the creation of an ad. A few years back, a new ad campaign was simply a creative challenge that was solved by coming up with a new flight of TV spots. These days, a new ad will likely involve some technological and media challenges. Are you tapping into the API of a hot new social media platform? How are you getting your brilliant campaign in front of a demographic that’s no longer watching TV?The traditional, silo-based organization is ill-equipped to answer these questions. So what you need to achieve is better collaboration between marketing and IT. To get there, your C-suite might have senior roles like chief digital officer and chief marketing technologists, filled by experts in both functions catalyzing innovation throughout the organization and fostering collaboration. Or you might try bottom-up solutions like internal account management. In this structure, marketing folks have counterparts in IT and vice versa.Act Like a Startup.There’s a set of common misconceptions about how established enterprises should learn from startups. It’s not about moving into flashy new digs or setting up Ping-Pong tables or having free sushi for lunch.Like customer-centricity, the startup mentality requires much deeper and more meaningful change. It requires uprooting many old assumptions and habits, especially those around tech infrastructure, and doing things the way a newer, leaner company might.Acting like a startup in this sense means the following:–Your enterprise deploys–or at least experiments with–cheap, fast, and flexible tools like cloud computing, social media platforms, and open APIs.advertisement–You employ product managers who are accountable for particular aspects of the consumer experience, just like Facebook has tasked someone with oversight of the newsfeed. As one of our clients describes it, product managers have to understand the customer and constantly prioritize and re-prioritize what’s best for the customer.–You employ Agile methodology and rapid prototyping.And look, no Ping-Pong.

Embrace Diversity.Every organization needs specialists and experts, but in the place of environments where everyone fills one role and thinks about nothing besides that role, there needs to be cross-fertilization, a coming together of various fields, disciplines, personalities, and cultures.In practice, it’s important to get a wide variety of expertise and perspectives around the table—marketing and technology, of course, but also HR, legal, and finance. We call this building a big boat, and it’s vital to building a convergence-ready organization.But there’s more to it than just getting all the right people around the table. You also have to incentivize collaboration, getting multiple functions to rally around a shared set of objectives and a shared method of measuring process–that’s a big change and it has to be tracked cleanly and carefully. This entails getting your systems to feed a dashboard that tracks a manageable set of metrics. Then you have to get the team to check in regularly, or at least pay attention to the readouts they’re receiving.advertisementAdapting your organization for convergence is never over. It’s a constant cycle of testing, learning, building, and destroying. All the more reason you should start now. The winners of this era will be the companies whose main focus is constantly improving on the customer journey. If you follow your customer, you can’t go wrong.Bob Lord is Global CEO of Razorfish.[Image: Flickr users Nic McPhee, NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, Dave Winer, and Patrick Kiteley]advertisementRelated StoriesEntertainmentNew Absolut Campaign Celebrates The Ongoing Fight For LGBTQ RightsEntertainment7 Times Obama’s Official Photographer Was Trump’s Classiest TrollEntertainment“Stranger Things 2” Thriller, Gucci Goes Trekkie: The Top 5 Ads Of The WeekadvertisementVideoIdeasIdeasNight Out For Safety and Liberation Asks How To Go Beyond Policing To Keep Communities SafeIdeasThis App Lets You Request Mental Health Help For A Homeless Person In DistressIdeasHow Sweden Is Fast Tracking Refugees Into The WorkforceEntertainmentEntertainmentNew Absolut Campaign Celebrates The Ongoing Fight For LGBTQ RightsEntertainment7 Times Obama’s Official Photographer Was Trump’s Classiest TrollEntertainment“Stranger Things 2” Thriller, Gucci Goes Trekkie: The Top 5 Ads Of The WeekCo.DesignCitiesThis Woman’s Travel Photos Are Better Than Yours — And She Never Leaves The HouseProductThis Airbnb For Great Architecture Is Curated By Two ArchitectsGraphicsThis Photo Captures Every Color In A Single Twinkling StarFast CompanyIdeasNight Out For Safety and Liberation Asks How To Go Beyond Policing To Keep Communities SafeIdeasThis App Lets You Request Mental Health Help For A Homeless Person In DistressTechnologyInside The ICO Bubble: Why Initial Coin Offerings Have Raised More Than $1 Billion Since January

What People are Saying






Alan Z
University of Washington



"Course Hero is definitely a very accessible resource that college students can use to excel in their classes."




Aksa A
Georgia State University



"Course Hero is the best online education resource I've ever used. On top of that Course Hero makes it so easy to help donate books to children in Africa through the Knowledge Drive. You can study and help a great cause all at the same time!"




Arunava C
University of Oregon



"One of the most useful resources available on Course Hero is 24/7 access to Tutors. Even if I don't feel like waiting for an almost instant response from Tutors, they have a substantial database of questions that have already been addressed, so I simply have to browse and search for an answer."




Jordan K
University of Wisconsin, Madison



"The best part of Course Hero's website is having the ability to preview other people's experiences in a particular class and put them to use during your time in the class. It enables you to be able to practice before quizzes and exams and achieve better scores in a multitude of classes."




Amber W
University of Florida



"The product that I use most frequently is Flashcards because of the benefits they offer me. Often times learning key vocabulary words for a class is essential for its success and the flashcard feature helps to keep me organized."




Manny S
UTSA



"I was worried about a test that I hadn't begun studying for, then I checked the Course Hero Flashcards section and found a set made for almost the exact same concepts and made my studying so much easier. Course Hero saved the day!"

Silicon Valley-based Hippo, a smart home insurance provider, has raised $14 million in Series A funding. Horizons Ventures led the round with participation from other backers that included RPM Ventures, Propel Venture Partners, GGV Capital and Pipeline Capital.
PRESS RELEASE
Mountain View, Calif., December 14, 2016 – Hippo, a company that provides smart home insurance for the modern household, today announced it has closed a $14 million Series A round.
The funding was led by Horizons Ventures, a leading venture capital firm that invests in disruptive technology and startups with previous investments including Facebook, Waze, Spotify and Siri. It was joined in the round by RPM Ventures, Propel Venture Partners, GGV Capital and Pipeline Capital as well as number of high profile FinTech investors and entrepreneurs.
Hippo is taking a fresh approach to the home insurance market, which has seen little innovation in over half a century. As one of the few products and services that cannot be easily purchased online, Hippo is set to disrupt an outdated industry by providing home insurance that is fast and simple to purchase online, offers more transparent coverage that is suited to modern lifestyles and is available at lower prices by going direct to consumers and removing expensive commissioned agents.
“We took everything that’s wrong with the current state of home insurance—the confusing forms, the outdated policy terms, the agent as middleman—and fixed it,” says Assaf Wand, CEO of Hippo. 





“The home insurance industry hasn’t changed in decades and no longer reflects modern lifestyles.
Today, many homeowners do not fully understand what their policies entail or what coverage they really need. Policies still cover old school items like pewter bowls, stock certificates and furs, but only provide $2,000 of coverage for home electronics. At Hippo, we make sure modern homeowners are fully covered through our online, transparent and affordable policies.”
Several FinTech industry veterans, who know the deficiencies of the current state of the market and see the benefits of Hippos’ offerings, have backed the organization as it prepares for its upcoming official launch. This includes Warren Hogarth (former Partner, Sequoia), Jacob Gibson (Founder, NerdWallet), Matt Humphrey (CEO, LendingHome), Josh Stech (Founding Partner, LendingHome), Louis Beryl (Founder & CEO, Earnest), Mark Lefanowicz (CEO, Ethos Lending), Pete Flint (Founder, Trulia & Board of Directors, Zillow Group), Ramtin Naimi (General Partner, Abstract Ventures), Soo Boon Koh (Managing Partner, iGlobe Partners) and Christopher Hill (Founder & Chairman, PerkSpot).
“The insurance ecosystem has been overdue for innovation and disruption. In the days of technology, convenience and accountability, home insurance still isn’t easily available online, is overly complicated and requires people to go through agents,” says Frances Kang of Horizons Ventures.“We believe Hippo will be a force to reconstruct the home insurance market, providing more transparency, efficiency and cost-savings and more importantly, peace of mind to consumers.” 





“Most people purchase home insurance and forget about it, assuming that they will be covered should an issue arise. Unfortunately for many, that hasn’t been the case until now,” said Board Member and RPM Ventures Managing Director Adam Boyden. “We are excited to support the Hippo team on their mission to finally give homeowners a reliable, transparent and simple solution to home insurance.”
Hippo will use the Series A funds for product development and marketing of its official launch in early 2017. The company has already received regulatory approval by the California Department of Insurance to begin selling in California and is currently in the middle of a closed beta program.
