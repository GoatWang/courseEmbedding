Total offering expenses are approximately $8,352.  Of the $8,352, the amounts to
be paid from the proceeds for expenses of the offering are: $5,000 for
accounting fees; $1,500 for filing fees; $800 for legal fees; $52 for
registration fee; and $1,000 for transfer agent fees. We will use the rest of
the funds (net of offering expenses) for paying off our current liabilities,
hiring new personnel and implementation of our business plan. In particular, we
will pay our current accounts payable totaling $7,901 that the company owes to
third party vendors as of June 30, 2014 for incorporation and filing expenses
($675), general and administrative expenses ($3,871) and cost of revenues
($3,355). 

In the future, in addition to equity financing, we may rely on loans from our
Directors and officers to continue our operations; however, there are no
assurances that our Directors will provide us with any additional funds. 
Currently, we do not have any arrangements for additional financing.  If we are
not able to obtain needed financing and generate sufficient revenue from
operations, we may have to cease operations.


The growing demand for imported North American and European products has
resulted in a growing number of export management companies that offer business
expansion services to clients looking to enter Central and South American
markets. J.D. Honigber International (www.jdhintl.com) is an international sales
and export management firm based in Illinois. They focus on providing marketing,
sales and consulting services to Canadian and U.S. manufacturers looking to
export their products globally. Frederick Export (www.frederickexport.com) is a
Colorado based export management firm that provides sales, marketing and trade
show services to consumer based products looking to export to Europe, Asia,
Central and South America and Australia. Business Growth Hub
(www.businessgrowthhub.com is a U.K. based company that offers Overseas Market
Introduction Services that help manufacturers and service-based businesses break
into new markets in Central and South America, as well as Asia and North
America. They focus primarily of U.K. based businesses looking to expand, and
work closely with the U.K. Trade and Investment Agency to get funding and
important government contacts for their clients. Global Development Partners
(gdp-inc.com) work with start-ups, small to medium sized businesses and
non-profit organizations, providing services to facilitate expansion to South
America. They have offices in the, U.S., Mexico and Brazil and offer services
such as market research, growth strategy formulation and marketing strategy
development.

Food and home goods distributors in Central and South America also offer
in-house marketing brand consulting services for North American and European
manufacturers looking to expand. Their in-house branding and marketing experts
provide services, such as brokerage, marketing and sales. For example, Aurora
(www.aurora.com.br) is a distributor of imported food and spirits in Brazil.
Their clients include Haribo, Campbell’s Soups and Celestial Seasonings. They
offer sales, marketing and promotional services for companies looking to begin
exporting their products to Brazil. Mayca, the leading food distributor in Costa
Rica, also offers services such as sales, marketing and brokerage for their
international manufacturing clients. A number of smaller distributors provide
sales services and offer to set up potential clients with brokerage firms and
marketing firms to help facilitate their expansion into Central or South
America.

Marketing agencies also offer product launch services that can help
manufacturers enter new markets. Many marketing and advertising firms offer
market research services as well as marketing strategy services and
implementation. For example, WPP Brazil (wpp.br.com) is a full service
advertising firm in Brazil that provides services such as consumer and market
research services, branding strategy services, marketing and advertising
strategy and implementation, public relations and trade marketing services.
There are numerous advertising and marketing firms in Central and South America
that vary in size and offer similar services.

Our competitors vary in size and in the variety of services they offer. Many of
our current and potential competitors have longer operating histories and
significantly greater financial, technical, marketing and other resources and an
established client base. These competitors may be able to adapt more quickly to
new or emerging food and home goods market changes and changes in customer
requirements. They may also be able to devote greater resources to the promotion
and sales of their services than we can, or may adopt more aggressive pricing
policies. If we fail to compete successfully against our competitors, our
revenue could decline and our business could be harmed.

market consultancy services that facilitate new market penetration in Central 
and South America for small and medium-sized businesses. Frontera Group’s 
services include identification, assessment and contacting of


 potential 
distributors, partners and sales contacts, strategic consulting, market and 
competitor research, translation services, competitive pricing and marketing 
strategy analysis, trade show and other commercial event management, marketing 
plan development and training and administration services.

Our services will include:

Market and Competitor Research

Breaking into new markets is inherently risky due to the unfamiliarity of the
competition and consumer demand. Our comprehensive market and competitor
research allows our customers to have insight into their new target market. Our
customers are better able to price their products and services competitively and
position their brand effectively. Market research services include market,
economic and political overview, logistics and cost environment, partnership
identification, competitor research including availability of distribution
channels, competitor promotional strategies and identification of specific
differentiation opportunities. Market and competitor research is the first step
for a client's launch into a new market. These services are billed on a project
basis, with the scope determined in collaboration with the client. Research can
be done as a one-off service prior to a new launch, or as an on-going project
with a smaller scope to monitor competition in a particular market.

Marketing Strategy Development

Essential to the success of entering a new market is an appropriate and
effective marketing strategy. After establishing a budget and target market, we
develop a marketing plan that can help our clients reach their potential
customers. A core part of our marketing services is the design and deployment of
specialized reports that capture, measure and analyze target market data to
provide insights into market opportunities, value proposition, positioning and
messaging development. The result is a custom Business Development plan that
addresses overall marketing strategy for a launch to a new market.

Translation Services

Launching a product in a new market often requires adaptation of packaging,
corporate identity documents, and marketing materials to a new language. Our
translation services ensure complete compatibility with local culture and market
conditions for any corporate communication materials.

Trade show and commercial event management

An important part of a product or service launch is effective presentation at
industry and consumer trade shows. We ensure an effective presentation at trade
shows by developing target market appropriate booth design and sales material,
as well as helping to manage staffing and logistics. We also consult and manage
other commercial events, such as marketing events, product demos, and public
relations events.

Administration and On-Going Business services

We provide services offering ongoing assistance with marketing, sales, and
distribution after initial product launch. The scope of services depends on
customer requirements. We can provide one-off consultations regarding marketing
or distribution strategies, resulting in short-term engagements. For customers
who require extra support, we can act as broker of record for a line of products
in a specific geographic area. We customarily charge the client a flat monthly
fee, with an additional commission depending on a portion of sales made in the
target market.

As of September 30, 2014 we provided consulting services related to market
feasibility studies and competitor research. Our plan over the next twelve
months is to expand our client base and the range of services we provide.
