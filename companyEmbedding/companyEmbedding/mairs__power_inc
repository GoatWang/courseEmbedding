                                    Growth Fund (MPGFX) Overview                            
Objective
The Mairs & Power Growth Fund seeks to provide shareholders with a diversified portfolio of common stocks that have the potential for above-average, long-term appreciation.
Investment Strategy

Commits to long-term investing in consistently growing companies with minimal turnover.
Focuses first on companies in Minnesota and the Upper Midwest.
Seeks companies with long-term, durable competitive advantages at reasonable prices.

Fund Characteristics

No load*
Low expense ratios
Tax efficient, low turnover
Regional focus
Multi-cap

The Fund focuses primarily on common stocks with some emphasis on foreign equity securities and convertible debt securities rated less than investment-grade.  Preference is given to holdings in companies with consistent, above-average growth, durable competitive advantages and financial strength. Recognizing that smaller capitalization companies can provide somewhat higher returns over longer time frames, some emphasis is placed on small companies to medium-sized companies, generally located in the Upper Midwest region. The Fund seeks to keep its assets reasonably fully invested at all times, maintain modest portfolio turnover rates, and to moderate risk by investing in a diversified portfolio of equity securities.
*You pay no sales charge for the purchase or sale of Fund shares and no 12b-1 marketing fees. You will, however, incur expenses for investment advisory, management and administrative services, which are included in annual fund operating expenses.

Objective
The Mairs & Power Balanced Fund seeks to provide capital growth, current income, and preservation of capital.
Investment Strategy

Commits to long-term investing with minimal turnover in consistently growing companies.
Focuses first on companies in Minnesota and the upper Midwest.
Seeks companies with long-term, durable competitive advantages as defined by Porter’s Five Forces at reasonable prices.
Diversifies across a portfolio of approximately 60% equity and 40% fixed income.

The Fund emphasizes investments in common stock and fixed income securities, with preference given to higher rated investment-grade fixed income securities (Baa or better by Moody’s Investors Service). Lower rated debt securities may be purchased if we believe the potential rewards outweigh the incremental risks. The Fund may also invest in foreign securities, which includes ADRs. The Fund may also invest in other investment vehicles. See the Fund’s prospectus for a complete list. The Fund seeks to keep its assets reasonably fully invested at all times, maintain modest portfolio turnover rates and moderate risk by investing in a diversified portfolio of equity and fixed income securities. 
The Fund is offered on a no-load basis.*

                            Mairs & Power's Small Cap Fund Closes to New Investors                    
Announcement - August 15, 2016
After careful deliberation, Mairs & Power has decided to close the Small Cap Fund (MSCFX/ the "Fund") to new investors effective as of the close of business on September 30, 2016 (the "Closing Date"). The Fund will remain open to investment by existing shareholders, existing Mairs & Power private clients, retirement plans with an existing agreement and new or existing clients of an individual financial adviser representative with pre-existing investments in the Fund.
Mairs & Power Growth Fund (MPGFX) and Mairs & Power Balanced Fund (MAPOX) remain open to new investors.
"With our disciplined, low turnover and long-term investment approach, we hold relatively concentrated positions in a carefully selected portfolio of companies. This strategy means that we manage our asset base carefully," said Mark Henneman, Chief Investment Officer of Mairs & Power, Inc. (the "Adviser"). "We manage capacity for each of our Funds individually, taking a conservative approach that considers, among other factors, total assets under management, the rate of asset growth and the availability of securities that meet the Funds' investment objectives."
"We believe this decision is in the best long-term interest of the Small Cap Fund's existing shareholders, as it allows us to maintain stable and balanced growth with the Fund. We remain confident in our ability to continue to find attractive investment opportunities within the small cap universe and we remain committed to protecting the interests of our Fund's shareholders. This soft close demonstrates that commitment," said Andrew Adams, lead portfolio manager of the Mairs & Power Small Cap Fund.
Launched in 2011, the Small Cap Fund has experienced significant, but manageable, asset flows. The Fund's performance success over one-, three-, and five-year periods led to strong asset growth from both existing and new investors. While this growth has not impacted the Adviser's ability to implement the Fund's stated investment strategy, the decision to close the Fund at this time followed careful deliberation and discussion on how best to serve the interests of existing shareholders by managing asset growth.
Complete guidelines on eligibility to invest in the Fund are available in the Fund's prospectus.
 
About the Small Cap Fund
The Small Cap Fund seeks above-average, long-term appreciation by investing in smaller companies with attractive business niches and prospects for profitable growth. Like all Mairs & Power mutual funds, the Small Cap Fund focuses the majority of its investments on companies located in the Upper Midwest. Lead portfolio manager Andrew R. Adams and co-manager Allen D. Steinkopf bring a total of 43 years of professional investment management experience to their roles, including a combined 14 years at Mairs & Power.

                            White Papers                    
Mairs & Power has produced two white papers - Why Minnesota Works for Investors and Focused Investing for the Long-Term
January 2017 - Why Minnesota Works for Investors, this white paper describes what we at Mairs & Power have long known; Minnesota and the Upper Midwest present an opportunity-rich landscape for investors.
April 2016 - Focused Investing For The Long-Term, this white paper explores why a low-turnover, buy-and-hold strategy works for investors and in particular how, in the current, short-term focused market, such a strategy may deliver an advantage to long-term oriented investors.




                            Full Economic Cycle Charts                    
As a bottom-up fundamental investor, Mairs & Power looks for investments that have "a sustainable competitive advantage" which implies that portfolio holdings will outperform their peers over a long time horizon. When we talk about the advantages of holding through a "economic cycle," the only cycle that is relevant is the economic business cycle fluctuating between periods of expansion and slowing of demand across the economy as measured by Gross Domestic Product growth.
The below charts illustrate the performance of both the Mairs & Power Growth Fund and the Mairs & Power Balanced Fund over five full economic cycles as defined by the national Bureau of Economic Research, measured trough-to-trough, as well as the current period where we are mid-cycle. Each Fund's performance is compared to its relevant benchmark, and in the case of the Growth Fund, with its market index.
These charts illustrate the Growth Fund outperformed its peer as measured by the Lipper Multi-Cap Core Fund Index through every cycle. Both Funds also outperformed their benchmark index in all economic cycles except the 1982-1991 cycle.
The underperformance during the 1982-1991 business cycle coincided with a historic shift in the economy - the dramatic reduction in inflation which had held stock valuations down in the previous cycle. As investors' expectations for inflation came down, there was an across-the-board expansion of stock valuations across the market, resulting in the only period of underperformance to the benchmarks. Both the Growth Fund and Balanced Fund significantly outperformed their benchmarks during the subsequent two cycles.

                            Escheatment and Abandoned Property                    
Mairs & Power Mutual Fund Investor Education on Escheatment and Abandoned Property - June 2015Escheatment is the process of turning over financial assets considered lost or abandoned property to a state authority.  Abandoned property is property that is unclaimed by its rightful owner or his or her heirs.  Unclaimed property refers to accounts in financial institutions and companies that have had no activity generated or contact with the owner for one year or longer.  States define abandoned property as one of, or a combination of, accounts without activity initiated by the account owner; accounts with an address deemed as undeliverable by the USPS; or uncashed checks.  Each state has its own rules concerning abandoned property.  The time periods for abandoned property range from three to five years.
It is important to note that abandoned property rules prevents Mairs & Power from recording systematic purchases or redemptions as contact as well as automatic reinvestment of dividends and capital gains. 
Please contact Shareholder Services at 800-304-7404 with any questions you have regarding this information.  If you have any questions regarding the laws specific to your state of residence, you may visit the National Association of Unclaimed Property Administrators website at www.unclaimed.org for more information.
If you received a notice that your account(s) are subject to escheatment, please perform one of the following:

Complete the Shareholder Signature(s) section in the notice mailed to you and return the entire letter in the envelope provided;

   This mutual fund manager has staying power.

The firm also manages about $3 billion in assets for retail customers, benefits managers, and charitable foundations. Mairs and Power relies on a conservative investment strategy, where it seeks growth stocks that it holds for long periods of time. It invests heavily in companies based in the Midwest, where the firm is based, because of its familiarity with the region.
