        extent NSMIA permits them to do so under NSMIA's preservation of their anti-fraud authority.

Product Description
Glyco Manager Rx
Just how remarkable is the all new Glyco Manager Rx by Premier Pharmaceutical?  This extraordinary sublingual formula allows carbohydrates from starchy foods to pass through the body, helping to shuttle nutrients into the muscle cells, staying away from the fat cells.  The Scientifically tested ingredients in Glyco Manager Rx support healthy insulin function by enhancing metabolism and carbohydrate uptake.
Directions: For best results, take 15 minutes before a meal containing carbohydrates. Take a maximum of 2 droppers (2 ml) once per day under the tongue for 30 seconds and then swallow. Or you can mix with your favorite beverage.  Do not exceed recommended dose and do not take more than one dose per day.  It is important that you eat food within 15 minutes of using this product to avoid drop in blood sugar.
Supplement Benefits
Reduces Carbohydrate and Lipid Absorption*
Decreases Calorie Absorption*
Supports Healthy Weight Loss*
Stimulant Free*
Examining the Formula:
Glyco Manager Rx features a unique combination of Chromium, Vanadium, Phellodendron, and Banaba – these earth elements represent and contain a broad foundation of phytochemicals that are to be used as part of a healthy diet for maintaining maximum insulin response, expediting carbohydrate metabolism. Recent studies have shed light on the potential roles of Chromium and Vanadium in maintaining proper carbohydrate and lipid metabolism at a molecular level, by binding to insulin receptors and activating the receptor’s tyrosine kinase activity – what this means is that these compounds appear to play a role in amplifying the mechanism in insulin signaling and carbohydrate uptake. (1)   Phellodendron and Crape Myrtle are believed to contain certain active ingredients within the leaves that have insulin-modulating properties. Specifically, Banaba, a variety of Crape Myrtle that grows in certain parts of the world (eg, Philippines, India, Malaysia, Australia) and contains corosolic acid, for which increased interest exists in relation to its potential role in treating type-2 diabetes, due to the multiple metabolic effects reported for corosolic acid, including stimulated glucose uptake. (2) Research continues to show that people can obtain better results by adding increased macro/micronutrients, phytonutrients, and herbs into their daily regimen.

Estrogen Blocker Rx
Estrogen Blocker Rx, by Premier Pharmaceutical, is a premium matrix of natural earth elements and compounds that can eradicate, decrease and in some cases even stop the synthesis of Estrogen, while simultaneously increasing and supporting maximum testosterone levels.  To ensure effectiveness, Estrogen Blocker Rx was developed for sublingual delivery (under the tongue) for maximum absorption.
Testosterone and Estrogen are present, and both play vital roles, in both men and women.  The science community, through extensive research, has made it increasingly clear that estrogen directly impacts testosterone just as testosterone directly impacts estrogen.   When estrogen levels are too high they have the ability to decrease the levels of testosterone. This means that estrogen levels have everything to do with the amount of testosterone that can be effective within the body; estrogen levels alone can inhibit testosterone by affecting the ratio of the two combined.
Directions:  As a dietary supplement, take one dropper (1 ml) twice daily.
Examining the Formula
 (1-7) Removing the negative effects of increased estrogen in males, these compounds have been presented in numerous peer-reviewed medical journals to do just that. Compounds such as: Indole-3- carbinol (I3C) cause growth arrest, increased cell death and ameliorate the effects of estrogen (1); Diindolylmethane (DIM), much like I3C, it is found in cruciferous vegetables and has the ability to arrest estrogen activity and assist in its metabolism (2); Agaricus Bisporus, found in mushrooms, has very powerful anti-aromatase activity which suppresses estrogen bio-synthesis (3); Calcium D Glucarate, initiates a process called glucaronidation, the process by which estrogen is metabolized and detoxified from the body (4). These, along with other compounds used in Premier Pharmaceuticals powerful and effective proprietary Estrogen Blocker, have very strong effects on lowering negative and unwanted estrogen levels. By not only removing them from the body but also by stopping or decreasing the amount of testosterone that is converted into estrogen and estrogen metabolites by a process called aromatization. (3) Premier Pharmaceutical has compiled years of research, and obtained only the best quality ingredients to formulate these compounds into one product to make it easy for men to keep their hormone levels normalized and their estrogen production at bay.
Furthermore, the overproduction of certain sex hormones is intimately related to the synthesis of cancer. Cancer rates are continuously growing, and are said to affect 1 out of 2 people in their lifetimes. Studies show that the compounds used in Estrogen Blocker Rx also possess the chemoprotective properties found in numerous studies to regress cancers and tumors in patients by lowering bad hormone levels and balancing and regulating the good ones (1-4,6,7); so it could be said that these compounds can be used as a means of prevention and not just treatment, for the reduction and prevention of cancers and not just the removal and lowering of unwanted sex hormones in the athlete or healthy individual.   -Dr. Joseph A. Arena, Holistic Physician

If so, I will return to buy many more.

Am nearly out of ink so I am reordering and really like the fact that this order is costing less than my first order due to a % off and free shipping. Your prices are much lower than the big box stores. I am on Social Security and this discount  really helps.Thank You!

A bit more definition would be helpful                                 Overall Rating:               Would Shop Here Again:               Likelihood To Recommend:   Full ratings for this review »                Paradigmpi                           Jul 27, 2017            I really like your inks - have used your brother inks for about 10 years and have found them EXCELLENT.

Jul 27, 2017  I did not realize how bad my first replacements were when I ordered a 2nd set. I now know they are not very good or my first order was ok. I really do not know. I learned a  lesson.
