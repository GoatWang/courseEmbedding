Sagoon Seeks To Raise Funds
Dec 14 16
Sagoon.Inc. is in the process of raising $20 million in fresh funding through a `mini-IPO', under the regulations enacted by the Obama administration's landmark JOBS Act. The Delaware and Noida-based venture, which was founded by Nepalese-origin entrepreneur Govinda Giri, is looking to raise funds under Regulation A-plus of the Act, which allows startups to raise up to $50 million from unaccredited investors. "Instead of raising funds from venture capital investors, we decided to reach out to the public directly through this route," said Swati Dayal, cofounder of Sagoon.

Sagoon is a social commerce platform that currently offers three desktop-only services - My Day, Secret Messaging and MoodTalk. Sagoon is a Delaware, USA-based corporation. It was first launched as private beta in July 2014 in Washington DC; the public beta was launched in November 2015 in Kathmandu, Nepal.
History[edit]
Sagoon was founded by Govinda Giri in 2009, but he faced a ridiculously rough capital environment and after 14 months of trial and error, he had to shut down his search engine.[1]
In September 2013, he quit his job and started working full time from the basement of his home. Soon he associated himself with an experienced graphic designer Swati Dayal who started working part time for Sagoon.[2] Giri spent eight months on market research and analysis of users’ behaviour, and then rolled out Sagoon as a Social Commerce Site. Its private beta was launched in Washington DC by Manisha Koirala.[3]
Giri introduced Sagoon Version 2.0 in November 2015, it was launched by Nepal PM K. P. Sharma Oli in November 8, 2015 in Kathmandu, Nepal.[4][5]
In January 2015, Giri visited India and registered Sagoon India Pvt. Ltd as 100% subsidiary of Sagoon Inc. Swati Dayal became the Executive Director of Sagoon India Pvt. Ltd and later was also promoted as the co-founder of company. After successfully setting up the office in India, Giri visited Kathmandu and hired a few employees to work from there as well.[6]
In May 2015, Sagoon launched "Sagoon Social Smart Card". The digital card is based on an incremental value model.[7][8][9]
In 2016, Sagoon successfully raised $500,000 in the seed funding phase.[10][11][12]

WASHINGTON, April 24, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Sagoon Inc., a Washington, DC-based tech startup, is pleased to announce that, due to the generosity of several angel investors, it has closed $500,000 seed funding. Funds raised will go towards product development and team expansion in engineering in India and US, supporting the company's upcoming web and mobile applications.
"We are grateful and proud to have such wonderful angel investors who clearly believe in our vision and have rewarded us with the ability to tackle great challenges in the future," says founder Govinda Giri. 
Sagoon Inc. originally introduced trial versions as part of their vision for Web 3.0: Social Smart Card and ME Page. Social Smart Card is a digital card solution designed to customize users' online shopping experiences while ME Page personalizes content for users' personal and professional lives, giving readers an overview of both professional achievements and social activities. In July 2014, Sagoon Inc. launched a suite of apps as a beta test that included Secret and Occasion, allowing users to tell their stories in pictures, reveal their secrets and share special personal moments.
At this time, Sagoon Inc. has over 156,000 registered users, a number that is increasing by 20% each week. There is a waiting list of more than 1.5 million potential users. Since ME Page was introduced, 48,000 pages have been created with over half a million text messages and photos being shared. 
"The success of our seed funding has encouraged us to move forward and prove our ability to bring positive changes to the lives of millions of people as a result of the technology we are creating," says co-founder Kabin Sitoula.

KATHMANDU, Nepal, Nov. 2, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Sagoon Inc., a Washington DC-based start-up, is proud to announce the launch of Sagoon 2.0 on November 8, 2015, in Kathmandu, Nepal - a country nestled between two large and powerful neighbors, China and India. 
Sagoon's mission is to create a groundbreaking social platform in Asia, capitalizing on its current success and enabling members to simplify their lives while enjoying openness with colleagues, friends and family. 
"Sagoon 2.0 represents a major milestone for Sagoon in its continued efforts to deliver a rewarding experience," says founder Govinda Giri. "Our goal is to take advantage of two huge markets, namely China and India, with a total of one billion Internet users between them. We will launch Sagoon 2.0 in these markets first and then take it global. The next big wave to breathe life into the Internet will be Sagoon. Watch for it!"
Sagoon offers users the opportunity to organize their lives from the time they wake up in the morning until they go to bed at night, enjoying the satisfaction that comes from being well organized and productive. The new version will include: 
- My Day: Offering superior tools to organize users' daily routines, creating schedules, to-do lists and reminders in a quick, simple fashion.
- Open Secrets: Providing a free-for-all platform to disclose information that could be useful to anyone or everyone -- a place to seek and give advice and to help those struggling with their personal relationships, work issues or just life in general. 
- MoodTalk: Livening up chats with fun and customizable moods. Chats are not recorded and vanish after a 24-hour period.
Unlike several other applications, Sagoon 2.0 gives users complete control of their everyday lives, both online and offline. 
Visit blog.sagoon.com for further information, photos and updates about the new version. Sagoon 2.0 is available to users worldwide.
About Sagoon 
Sagoon (sagoon.com) is a social commerce platform with offices located in Washington DC, New Delhi and Kathmandu. There are 30 team members and about 200,000 global users. Sagoon was financed from seed money donated by US-based angel investors.

Sagoon is a social commerce platform that currently offers three desktop-only services - My Day, Secret Messaging and MoodTalk. Sagoon is a Delaware, USA-based corporation. It was first launched as private beta in July 2014 in Washington DC; the public beta was launched in November 2015 in Kathmandu, Nepal.
History[edit]
Sagoon was founded by Govinda Giri in 2009, but he faced a ridiculously rough capital environment and after 14 months of trial and error, he had to shut down his search engine.[1]
In September 2013, he quit his job and started working full time from the basement of his home. Soon he associated himself with an experienced graphic designer Swati Dayal who started working part time for Sagoon.[2] Giri spent eight months on market research and analysis of users’ behaviour, and then rolled out Sagoon as a Social Commerce Site. Its private beta was launched in Washington DC by Manisha Koirala.[3]
Giri introduced Sagoon Version 2.0 in November 2015, it was launched by Nepal PM K. P. Sharma Oli in November 8, 2015 in Kathmandu, Nepal.[4][5]
In January 2015, Giri visited India and registered Sagoon India Pvt. Ltd as 100% subsidiary of Sagoon Inc. Swati Dayal became the Executive Director of Sagoon India Pvt. Ltd and later was also promoted as the co-founder of company. After successfully setting up the office in India, Giri visited Kathmandu and hired a few employees to work from there as well.[6]
In May 2015, Sagoon launched "Sagoon Social Smart Card". The digital card is based on an incremental value model.[7][8][9]
In 2016, Sagoon successfully raised $500,000 in the seed funding phase.[10][11][12]

Background


2007

Sagoon Inc., a Delaware corporation, was founded by Govinda Giri in the Washington DC area in 2007 with the goal of developing a web search engine.




2012

In 2012, Sagoon Inc. was amended and the incorporation restated, while keeping the same name, with the goal of developing a Social Commerce Platform.




2013


In September 2013, Govinda quit his job and started developing with a single graphics designer in India.
                                    



2014

In July 2014, Sagoon version 1.0 was launched (as a private beta) in Washington DC and India by Bollywood star Manisha Koirala.
                                    
In November 2014, Sagoon opened a development office in India as a 100% subsidiary, Sagoon India Pvt. Ltd., with the goal of capturing the talents and market of South Asia as its first go-to-market strategy.



2015

In November 2015, Sagoon version 2.0 was launched (as a public beta) in Kathmandu by the then Nepal Prime Minister, Mr. KP Sharma Oli.
                                    





Our Business
Sagoon Inc. is a GIFTING company.

                            The company is set to disrupt the $300 billion worth social gifting market and plans to share its earning with every single user by creating an innovative social path: CONNECT – SHARE – EARN.
                        

Sagoon intends to achieve its mission of making the world a better place to live by helping people build true connections, share useful experiences and earn while socializing. We believe reinventing the concept of social gifting would improve people’s relationships and make them cherish each moment spent with their loved ones.

We call Sagoon a “social movement” – CONNECT – SHARE – EARN


Connect
People want their lives to be more fruitful. We don’t just want you to ‘connect’; we want your time to be useful, we want you to build meaningful and productive relationships.


Share
We don’t want you to share everything you find with all of your contacts, that creates boring relationships. Instead, share experiences, feelings and thoughts that would create better bonds or turn out to be a life-saving gift to others.


Earn
We want to share our earnings with you. By spending time with us, you will learn, enjoy, and eventually earn cash rewards. We believe Sagoon’s most exciting feature will eventually be its ability to provide monetary rewards to users for the time they spend on this social network.




Our Major Sources of Revenue

Social Smart Card introduction: a digital shopping and gifting card where we take a 10% to 20% commission fee on every transaction by selling gift cards and coupons.
                        
Here’s how we get commission.

First, we will build a payment gateway (merchant account) on the Sagoon platform
Second, Sagoon will have partnerships with vendors of gift cards and coupons
Third,  we will integrate partners’ product APIs into Sagoon’s “Social Smart Card”
Fourth, every single user will get Sagoon’s “Social Smart Card” FREE with those partners’ names – either retail or online stores
Lastly, we will take a commission for reselling gifts and coupons
                            

Banner Ads Introduction: 

                            We plan to create a revolution in the banner ads market by adding value, knowledge and experience. Banner ads will follow our application, featuring a story in pictures. We will introduce a cost per thousand (CPM) model as our ads system in the ‘Secret and Wish’ messaging page of the user’s personal dashboard, allowing advertisers to brand their product by telling sales stories in pictures.
                        


How do we stand out from the crowd?
Several of Sagoon’s key features separate us from the crowd. Additionally, there are five major innovative factors that enable us to serve a unique niche market:

R&D cost: Our product development cost is five times lower than our competitors’ 
Product and Service: We offer social media and social gifting in one place
Shared Earnings: Users earn money for the time they spend on Sagoon
South Asian Market: We can have a huge influence in this market and we fit into it culturally more easily than our competitors 
Technology: We plan to use a data-retrieving method based on advanced mathematical formulae that support Semantic Web and Natural Language Processing (NLP)




Intellectual Property
 We have more than 15 patent and trademark applications ready to file after this offering. Employees and third-party consultants have signed non-disclosure agreements with the company to further protect its proprietary rights. We are continuing to develop intellectual property, with the intention of aggressively protecting our position in key technologies. The company owns several trademarks protecting the company’s name and logo, as well as extensive data, engineering analysis, and other intellectual property.
                        


We are in India: Sagoon India Pvt. Ltd.

We are in India to reinvent the wheel. We plan to combine the experience, culture and success of Silicon Valley with the incredible talent that gives India the chance to change the world. Our plan is to roll out the same culture of product delivery, the same business model and retail concept, the same game plan, the same investment opportunity, the same employee benefits, and the same successful management team that a Silicon Valley company would.
We believe we have the potential to go bigger and much better because of the size of the South Asian market compared to the U.S. market – more than 500 million Internet users at present, a figure that is projected to reach more than 700 million by 2018. We have a team and an infrastructure already in place. We plan to hire and build a bigger team with key management, developers and engineers after closing this equity crowdfunding campaign.

How do we use the money raised?








Watch the video to know what are the future plans of Sagoon and what it has in store for you




2017


Expand office spaces in New Delhi by March 2017 and in Washington DC by June 2017





Set up a technology lab in IIT, New Delhi in 2017


Govinda meeting Dr. Tuli (Dean) and Dr. Chatterjee (Mathematics Professor) in IIT, New Delhi.



Develop and launch an Android app by August 2017 and an iOS app by the end of 2017





App in progress
A mobile app with the same exciting features and the all-new interface.






2018


Develop and launch a Social Smart Card by Feb 2018





Develop sale and marketing to acquire more than 9 million users by 2018 





Start making a framework for an IT Hub in Nepal by 2018 







With just the desktop and mobile version, the valuation of the company stands at $93 million. Imagine what will happen when we launch the mobile app and the Social Smart Card? The current valuation, in that case, is expected to increase exponentially. And when the valuation of the company increases, the price of investors’ dollars is bound to rise many times likewise.


Products and Services
Sagoon’s comprehensive suite of products and services supports the needs of global online users. Each product suite has unique features and a different customer presentation strategy; the purpose of each application is to strengthen relationships. The core Sagoon technology enables products to be categorized semantically with lower development costs and faster speeds.

Social Smart Card: The real game changer
The Social Smart Card is a digital card for all the shopping and gifting needs of users that we plan to launch by the end of 2017. It will allow Sagoon users to earn money while shopping, redeeming coupons and gifting their loved ones.
Every Sagoon user will receive a FREE Social Smart Card. With this card, users will be able to EARN money, SPEND money, REDEEM coupons and GIFT their loved ones while socializing. Currently, there is no other social media channel that offers shopping and gifting in one place through a Social Smart Card, which will eventually give all users a share in our earnings. This is what we believe is a GAME CHANGER

With a single Social Smart Card, users can:




Buy and send gifts to loved ones.





Easily collect and redeem gift cards and coupons to buy goods and services.





Get a percentage back on each transition.






Tried and Tested
Sagoon rolled out a pilot project to gauge the response of Sagoon users towards a Social Smart Card. The project included 96,000 Sagoon users, who were rewarded with virtual money for sharing their confessions, chatting with their friends and creating to-do lists. Even though we launched a Social Smart Card with limited features, over 80,000 people liked the concept due to its uniqueness.
We then discussed this concept with many e-commerce vendors, who found it so interesting that they agreed to associate themselves with the Social Smart Card. Despite knowing that we are launching it at the year end, Sagoon users are asking us to release it earlier. This is the popularity this card already enjoys in the market. 


Our Target Market
Sagoon is focused on the $300 billion Social Commerce Market, which is growing by leaps and bounds every year. Here is a quick glimpse into some of this market’s segments:




 $34 billion 
Revenue from social networks today (fee + advertisement) with projected growth of 43.1% each year.




 $31 billion 
Online Coupons (in 2014, digital coupons worth $16 billion were redeemed, that is 1% of total offered).




 $149 billion 
Digital Gift Cards (the worth of unused Gift Cards is $1 billion annually).



         Source: CEB ToweGroup.     



Why do we believe Sagoon is a Game Changer?
It’s simple: revenue sharing. We believe that Sagoon’s platform will be a pioneer in social media monetization where its users will earn money while making social connections and sharing personal stories.
Imagine being able to earn money, just by spending time on social media. The Social Smart Card – which we anticipate launching by the end of 2017 – will allow every single user to earn a percentage of Sagoon’s revenue.

The key points of investment
We think that an informed decision is a wise decision. Before you decide to come aboard as an investor, we want you to take a peek into the following insights of the company and inform yourself about what we are focusing on, what we have achieved, and what we want to do.



 


We are focused on more than $300 billion social commerce market. We intend that our major revenue sources in the first phase will be “gifting and socializing” coupons.







We are the pioneer of social media monetization – a unique business innovation that has the potential to change the way the social media landscape is used today.







Sagoon is a social movement. The motivation in investing in Sagoon is not just to get financial returns but also to foster innovation from an isolated community and underserved market.







Team: We are a very passionate and committed team of entrepreneurs, who have full confidence in what we observe, perform and execute.







We offer our users the opportunity to earn money while they socialize with their loved ones; it will be made possible through a ‘Social Smart Card’ that creates a spin cycle of positive outcomes - more gifting, more advertising. That’s how we plan for successful growth.







We have already won half of the battle by making “Sagoon” a well-recognized household name among more than a billion people from South Asia and other parts of the world. We produce zero dollar branding cost.







We have a long-term vision. Since inception, we have been located in the United States and India - a new land of opportunity - where more than 500 million users access the Internet. We are also located in Nepal - a transit spot to China where more than 700 million users surf the Internet.

Investment Queries

Q1. What is a Mini-IPO?
The “Mini-IPO” is a media term that is used for Regulation A+. It’s a new US securities law that makes it legal for the general public to invest in a private growth-stage company before the company’s stocks are publicly traded.
Here’s what usually happened before the new law existed. Only rich people who had a net worth of $1 million or those with an annual salary of over $200,000 were allowed to invest early. Then the company grew until it went to an IPO and stock started being publicly traded. So everyone else only got the opportunity to invest once the company growth had slowed down. That’s why rich people (early investors) made much more money than the less-rich people (late investors).
But now with Reg A+ (Mini-IPO), you do not need to be rich to invest. You just need to commit to not invest more than 10% of your annual income or net worth. Everyone can invest.
Good luck!
