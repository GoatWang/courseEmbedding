 RICHMOND, VA                                            




The GoalHelp two young designers, John and Miriam, capture and create art as they undertake a cross country road trip to refine their craft, while embracing their absolute love for design. As two passionate photographers and artists, we have decided to escape the world for a while, with the goal of returning home and hosting an art exhibition where proceeds from the selling of our work will be donated to our friends at mOb+Storefront ​. Please take a look and thanks so much for checking us out!We are Space Explorers!As children, this phrase was as undeniable as any. We were all on a journey to explore space and time, as we jumped into life attempting to find beauty in the unknown. Unfortunately, as life passes, this truth becomes less and less self evident. As adults, and as reality builds, we must more frequently resort to exploring less, while remembering more. Surrounding ourselves with reminders of our past explorations. Our homes filled with objects we once made, places we once visited and sites we once saw. Telling stories of our past explorations, through artifacts captured from our own lenses and created by our own hands, but now just memories and products removed from the spaces in which they were once created!The inherent beauty in interpreting these modern day trends is that all hope may not be lost. One day, reality will decide to slow itself down and the objects and memories once captured will be the catalyst to drive new exploration and innovation! Rather then surrounding ourselves with memories and reminders of our past we, for some unknown reason, will act on impulse and rebel, as we begin to surround ourselves with life led through exploration. Humans have not yet and will never lose their ability to explore! We are all space explorers!The Exhibition - Giving Back!Upon their arrival back from their long  journey, John and Miriam plan to compile, refine and organize their best pieces into an exhibition titled, "Drive for Design". The goal purpose of this exhibition is to both showcase the beauty that can so easily be found in our country but to also remind others that although terrifying and unpredictable, taking a leap of faith can lead to great happiness and beauty. They hope to create new rebels and new explorers that will embrace their uncertainties, slow their lives down just enough, and find happiness worth cherishing. For the exhibition John and Miriam plan on printing as many photographs as they can afford! If their financial goal of $3500 is met, a portion of the remaining proceeds will be donated to our good friends at mOb+Storefront, the place where John and Miriam first thought up this whole dream! mOb is an interdiciplnary design studio where VCUarts students work in group projects to bring good quality design to the Richmond community through a partnership with Storefront .  The money will be used to purchase new materials, help with rent for the studio space, as well as provide a hopeful expansion of their volunteering staff.The Back StoryJohn and Miriam met while going to school at Virginia Commonwealth University in Richmond, Virginia. At the time, John was a Museum exhibit designer and was recruited by mOb+Storefront to be a mentor for a group of seniors working on an exhibit design project for the Institute for Contemporary Art. Miriam just so happened to be one of the students on this project and the rest was history. Keeping in touch here and there over the past year, they randomly contacted each other to grab coffee and Miriam shared her desires to break free and explore the world on a cross country adventure! John, having recently relocated to Raleigh, NC and in somewhat of a crisis himself, decided he would join! And here we are today! Two friends a car and the open road!John Bonano 27, holds an undergraduate degree from NC States Universities School of architecture and a Masters degree from Virginia Commonwealth University's Masters of Product innovation. John's passions lie in architectural photography as well as hand sketching and painting. Prepared with his digital camera, tripod and multiple memory cards, he plans on further improving his photography technique, while finally getting the chance to see the sites he once saw as a child! Be sure to check out John's photography on Instagram  or follow him on their journey on Snapchat: Johnyboy365.Miriam Weirich 24, holds an undergraduate degree from Virginia Commonwealth University with a BFA in Interior Design and a minor in General Business. Curiosity drives her passion for design. She analyzes colors and seeks patterns in her surroundings; resulting in personal reflection with watercolor and ink. Free to thrive with no boundaries she plans to eat many tacos and throughly document her experiences through photography, sketching and watercolor. Be sure to check out Miriam's photography on Instagram  or follow her on their journey through her blog posts on her website here ! The TripMiriam and John plan on leaving August 16th in a car, with many loaves of bread and jars of Nutella, heading out to find great sites, great architecture and great beauty. They will leave from Raleigh, NC on an expedition in finding and making art. They've constructed a list of their "must see" destinations and plan to share their stories through a daily blog. For five weeks, averaging 8 hours of driving per day, they will stop, camp, observe, capture, make and move on. Taking just enough time to absorb and interpret, but just little enough time to maintain the insatiable need to return once again. Their destinations include:New OrleansChattanoogaAustinDallasSan JoseAlbequerquePhoneixSan Francisco Big SurJoshua TreeDeath ValleyLos AngelasSalt Lake CityKansas CityOklahoma Cityand beyond!The Impact  and Lasting Affect During our travels and after the Exihibition we hope to encourage others in our community and world to take the time to explore and truly soak in their surroundings. To no longer take for granted the beauty that is within grasp and to use that as inspiration for their daily lives. What We Need: For the TripTo be honest we are looking for whatever help we can get! In regards to the trip, we have budgeted for the following:$1100 for gas$400 for food$550 for camping supplies and gear$500 new photography gear$150 for campground accommodations$200+ for painting and art supplies$100 miscAs specified earlier, a portion of whatever money we receive beyond our goal, will be donated to our good friends at mOb+storefront. We thank you all for the support and are greatly looking forward to making beautiful art!
