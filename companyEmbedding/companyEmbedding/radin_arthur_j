Sustainability Assurance Reporting A Nascent Niche, Likely to Grow 
By Radin, Arthur J.

Article excerpt

The use of sustainability reports for public and private companies has blossomed in the last few years. Reports run from as few as five to more than 250 pages and generally have pretty pictures, lots of verbiage as to the company's intentions, improvements from previous years, and a future commitment to be a good corporate citizen. They indicate room for improvement and management's intent to improve. As sustainability reporting becomes more widespread, it will increasingly encroach on territory long considered within the remit of CPAs.Elements of Sustainability ReportingAdvocates for sustainability reporting-who have become increasingly numerous and vociferous in recent years-use many different terms, such as sustainability; good citizenship; environmental, social and governance (ESG); environmental responsibility; and responsible investing. The terms are not quite equivalent, but all address the same general concepts.One key concept in sustainability reporting is that of stakeholders. Stakeholders include anyone currently doing business with the company or using its products, anyone living in communities where the company operates, and anyone who might be affected by the company in the future. The breadth of this definition, however, raises the question of its usefulness. Companies generally limit their reporting to investors, suppliers, employees, customers, neighbors, and governments, all of whom clearly have a "stake" in the company. Issues such as greenhouse gas emissions (GHG), however, clearly have an effect beyond those parties.Another significant issue is "materiality," or what is material to a stakeholder and which stakeholders are material to the company. Many sustainability reports discuss how the company has determined what is material, normally not in a quantitative manner. Because stakeholders can be defined as anything from a small number of people to all living things, materiality is an open issue, and debate as to standards continues.Sustainability reports themselves differ significantly in quantity of statistics. Some give percentages showing improvements, such as "our use of water for each dollar of sales was down 3.7%." Others have tables going back many years, indicating in detail the quantitative improvements being made. The reports may also address good citizenship, covering many areas that do not directly affect environmental sustainability, such as employee diversity, community involvement, human rights, women's empowerment, charitable giving, or indigenous rights. Many also have a governance section indicating the appropriateness of their corporate controls. As with most corporate reporting, the reports are very upbeat.Standards of Sustainability ReportingThere are a number of published standards for sustainability reports, generally referred to as "frameworks." The Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Sustainability Reporting Guidelines is the most commonly used. The GRI is based in Europe and has partnered with many companies and the major accounting firms. In the United States, the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) provides standards for specific industries. In addition, at least nine other organizations have published their own sustainability frameworks.In this author's view, the GRI's guidelines are the most comprehensive, with 150 different disclosures required for complete conformity. Some companies list all of them and disclose whether or why any are omitted; others just list those they are following. The companies listing the requirements give interactive cross-references to the information, including, in some cases, the Form 10-K, Proxy Statements, and similar documents. The GRI's website indicates which companies currently use its framework.There is no legal requirement for a sustainability report in the United States; the pressure comes from various stakeholders. In addition, some investment analysts believe very strongly in ESG issues and will only recommend investment in a company with an appropriate ESG profile. …

Article excerpt

High Costs and Few BenefitsDuring the past decade, many accounting and reporting rules and restrictions have been enacted specifically for businesses and also for the accounting profession as a whole. These rules and restrictions come from many sources, including Congress, the SEC, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), and state governments.Such new rules and regulations are invariably referred to as "reforms." Although some might be quite effective in this respect, the usefulness of many such reforms is dubious - and they all cost money to implement. At their worst, they can be useless, expensive, and possibly even damaging. Unfortunately, the costs to implement such reforms are very difficult to determine, and any benefits are impossible to quantify. Some reforms - but certainly not all - are shown in the Exhibit.The Cost of ReformSo why should the accounting profession care? Society is being burdened with massive costs that do not translate into useful products or services. From a global perspective, the issue is whether these rules and regulations are stifling the U.S. economy. The answer is impossible to determine because the actual costs of these reforms are too diverse and impractical to quantify. The costs include the direct expenditures relating to compliance, as well as largely ignored hidden costs, such as -* additional employee compensation while people learn the rules,* development and enactment of procedures to comply with the rules,* related restrictions on economic activities, and* resolution of noncompliance issues.The government has always paid Up service to eliminating inefficiencies and minimizing red tape. For example, section 3(f) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1933 requires that the SEC evaluate the effect of rulemaking as follows:Consideration of promotion of efficiency, competition, and capital formation. - Whenever pursuant to this title the Commission is engaged in rulemaking, or in the review of a rule of a self-regulatory organization, and is required to consider or determine whether an action is necessary or appropriate in the public interest, the Commission shall also consider, in addition to the protection of investors, whether the action will promote efficiency, competition, and capital formation. (http://www.sec.gov/about/laws/sa33.pdf)Nevertheless, this section of the law appears to the author to be routinely ignored (other than as indicated below).The list in the Exhibit highlights just how impossible it is to even try to quantify the costs of these measures. For example, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (SOX) outlawed loans to certain officers. Although this item appears to be minor, there are real costs, such as the following:* Every lawyer and accountant practicing before the SEC must become familiar with the rule.* Company management and directors must become familiar with the rule.* Accounting firms handling public companies must add to their checklists a line item referring to loans to senior officers.* Corporate management must now find a new solution in situations where a loan to an officer might once have been the best economic solution for both the individual and the company.This is a perfect example of regulatory overload. To address the rare questionable transaction, Congress has made a routine transaction criminal. Is this "sledgehammer approach" appropriate? It has been often taken with respect to unusual, inappropriate transactions throughout various regulatory regimes, and I do not believe that it is possible to evaluate any of the costs or benefits of these new laws.SOX Section 404Much effort has been expended to determine the costs and potential benefits of the recent rule involving SOX section 404, which requires auditors to evaluate a company's internal controls over financial reporting. In September 2009, the SEC published the results of its study - required by SOX - of the costs and benefits of section 404. …

Arthur J. Radin, CPA
Partner Emeritus

arthur.radin@janoverllc.com 



A partner in public accounting firms for more than 50 years, Arthur Radin is widely regarded as an accounting jack-of-all-trades. In addition to being responsible for audits, reviews and compilations of financial statements for public and private companies, he has extensive experience in tax planning, compliance and federal and state tax examinations. He has also successfully defended cases before the Appeals Office of the Internal Revenue Service.
Art has consulted on numerous mergers and acquisitions ranging in size from under $1,000,000 to over $1,000,000,000, advising those involved on subjects including tax and accounting planning, negotiations and due diligence. He has also been called upon to testify as a forensic accounting expert at trials in federal courts.
He has served on the SEC Regulations Committee of the American Institute of CPAs as well as on a number of committees of the New York State Society of CPAs. He is a member of the Editorial Board of The CPA Journal, published by the NYSSCPA, and his work has frequently appeared in the publication.
Art originally trained as an SEC auditor. He started his career at Touche Ross & Co., which eventually merged into Deloitte. After leaving Touche Ross for a small CPA firm, he became more of a tax, general consulting and mergers and acquisition practitioner before the firm split into Radin, Glass & Co., LLP in 1998. He and his colleagues from Radin Glass joined Janover LLC in January of 2015.
Art earned a Master in Business Administration degree from New York University and a Bachelor of Arts degree from Columbia College.
