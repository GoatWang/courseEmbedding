East Coast Asset Managementâ
            management team has been active in the Financial Services
            market for thirty-five years. We have focused on receivables
            management and servicing for the last six years.
Our current company was established in 2012 to work with
          small businesses that service Medical and Personal Care
          markets. East Coast partners with our business partners in managing 
          receivables that are both performing and nonperforming on consumer
          and commercial accounts. We work with each of our clients to enhance
          profitability and cash-flow.
We strive to rehabilitate non-performing debtors in an effort
          to allow the original service provider to reactivate their
          relationship with their client. Through structuring strategic
          periods for receivables acquisition we can improve our clients
          profitability and enhance our acquired portfolio values. Our
          compliance focus and respect for our debtors enables us to
          improve performance. 
Our goal is to establish long term relationships with
          established service providers. Working together on mutual
          objectives has proven to be profitable for all parties
          involved.

Who We Are


East Coast Asset Management is an employee-owned, SEC registered investment advisor founded in 2008. We manage over $400 million using rigorous fundamental research. Our team serves a broad, global investor base represented by individuals, families, and institutions. We’ve been based in Essex, MA, on Boston’s North Shore since inception.

We believe great businesses and great investments are rare. We are focused on employing a demanding research effort to uncover the most ideal investments and applying a disciplined valuation approach to construct a portfolio that will compound attractively over time.

OUR INDEPENDENCE
We view having a differentiated perspective from the consensus as a cornerstone of our long-term competitive advantage. A mindful decision of establishing on our own research base and thought processes has influenced our geography and the information sources we choose to value.

Wealth Management


The wealth management experience for our clients and us is one of discovery, development, and continuous updates designed to work in conjunction with our investment management services. While many firms like to talk about plans, we want to focus on solutions. Our team of legal, tax and investment professionals will work with you to develop sophisticated, appropriate and personalized solutions to your financial challenges. We offer the following non-inclusive list of capabilities to our investment management clients and to non-investment management clients on a flat fee financial planning basis.
Asset Allocation Planning

We work with our clients to develop asset allocation strategies built around both the assets we manage and those held outside of our firm. We think that our high touch approach is particularly beneficial for those clients who need a manager that will take the time to understand their company plans or other outside managers and then take that knowledge and not only apply it to the management of their own funds but to drive the holistic discussions that are so crucial to confront today’s fast moving global markets.
Retirement Planning
We use leading software to help clients model out their current cash flow or future retirement needs.  We feel that our investment management focus makes us particularly adept at how future assumptions with regard to taxes, inflation or currency changes may impact an individual’s purchasing power. While many firms utilize financial plans to generate static numbers, we prefer to work with our clients on an ongoing basis to review the trends and help them better understand after each meeting whether they are closer or further away from reaching their goal.
Estate Planning
With our breadth of legal and tax professionals, we are able to partner with our clients to help them develop an estate plan that not only encompasses the challenges of passing wealth on to the next generation but the ever important task of anticipating the possible risks from disability or lawsuits. We have developed strong relationships with many leading regional and national law firms and can walk our clients through every step of the process from the first meeting with their attorney through the signing and funding of their new estate plan. Furthermore, our proactive planning approach allows us to anticipate and direct modifications to the plan as the lives of our clients or the tax laws change.
Risk Management

We define risk management as dotting the “i’s” and crossing the “t’s.” Whether it is reviewing life, disability or long term care needs and then finding a suitable insurance provider or working with clients to make sure they are properly protecting the corporate veil shielding their personal assets from their business risk our team of professionals is available to help clients take the detailed steps that can have the biggest effect whenever a personal storm arises.
Tax Planning
Our team of professionals is available to help clients develop a multi-year tax minimization strategy. Working closely with your own CPA, we can assist with the type of financial or tax modeling that is crucial given the year to year fluctuations in the income tax laws. For those clients who need assistance with tax preparation, we can make a referral to an outside professional.

Q1 2017 Investment Review

May 8, 2017 


David W. Lemons, CFA
Senior Managing Director, Portfolio Manager
“A man who tells lies, like me, merely hides the truth. But a man who tells half-lies, has forgotten where he’s put it.” Mr. Dryden – played by Claude Raines – in Lawrence of Arabia (1962)
In large part, the first few months of this year have been a continuance of the post-election rally last year. Global stock markets have generally been positive performers, as seen in the exhibit below. The bulk of these returns, however, occurred in January and February (+5.9% for the S&P 500 and +5.7% for the MSCI All Country World Index), with relatively little progress in March. The momentum that had built up in most U.S. stock indices, and many abroad, fizzled as March unfolded… Read more >





Q4 2016 Investment Review

January 7, 2017 


David W. Lemons, CFA
Senior Managing Director, Portfolio Manager
“In order to make progress, one must leave the door to the unknown ajar.”
– Richard Feynman 
As we reflect on the conclusion of 2016 and contemplate 2017, much seems to be poking its nose through the “unknown” doorway – to follow the thoughts of Richard Feynman, the theoretical physicist who was awarded the Nobel Prize in physics in 1965. First among several important events last quarter was, of course, the US Presidential election. Regardless of one’s politics, we believe it is appropriate to state the obvious; the election’s result was not widely expected. After the surprise result of the “Brexit” referendum in Britain last spring, US political pundits were, seemingly, extra vigilant to the shifting attitudes of the electorate – especially in the essential electoral college “swing” states. Nevertheless, this turn of events was a shocker… Read more >





Q3 2016 Investment Review

November 3, 2016 


David W. Lemons, CFA
Senior Managing Director, Portfolio Manager
But what a fool believes he sees,
no wise man has the power to reason away
what seems to be is always better than nothing
there’s nothing at all, but what a fool believes he sees
The Doobie Brothers, 1978 
Global financial markets continue to be captivated by the daily debate about when and by how much the Federal Reserve will raise short-term interest rates. Opinions vary, and some of the debate has taken the form of pundits claiming to be the wiser and suggesting their counterparts are fools. Perhaps predictably, the topic has even become an issue for rhetoric by our presidential candidates. Right now, the Fed’s Open Market Committee guideline for the federal funds rate is basically nothing… Read more >





Q2 2016 Investment Review

August 3, 2016 


David W. Lemons, CFA
Senior Managing Director, Portfolio Manager
“Ulysses, glorious Greek, arriving here! O stay thy ship, that thou mayst hear our voice! For none hath ever sail’d past this our isle, ere the sweet voice form forth our mouths he heard…and all things on the fertile earth we know.” So spake their charming voice, and then my heart desired to hear.
The Odyssey of Homer, George William Edginton 
What Brexit? The timing of the vote by the Brits to leave the European Union (June 23rd), the result (leave!), the immediate financial market reaction (sell!), and the bountiful political, social, and economic commentary that continues unabated made it the dominating event in the minds of many investors during the second quarter. In the two trading days following the verdict, the S&P 500 fell -5.3%, the MSCI All Country World was cut by -6.9%, and the MSCI EAFE dropped -9.8%. Bond yields slumped (prices rose), and gold prices firmed. Read more >





Q1 2016 Investment Review

April 18, 2016 


David W. Lemons, CFA
Senior Managing Director, Portfolio Manager
“In matters of principle, stand like a rock; in matters of taste, swim with the current.” – Thomas Jefferson 
Right out of the gate, the first quarter of 2016 was dreadful for stock investors and there didn’t seem to be a direct, easy connection between real time data and the markets’ movement lower. The backdrop to the end of 2015 included concerns about the Federal Reserve’s decision in December to increase short-term interest rates, Chinese economic growth, the potential for a US recession, and continued weakness in oil prices. The markets carried this sack of issues forward into January… Read more >





Dusting Off Your New Year’s Money Resolutions

August 7, 2015 


East Coast Asset Management’s John Slupski was quoted in this excellent story about how to stay on track to meet your goals.

U.S. News & World Report
By Geoff Williams
It’s not too late to improve your financial picture in 2015.

“2015 is my year to… SAVE MONEY”
You probably said this at the beginning of the year. Have you been sticking to it?

Remember all those financial goals you set for yourself right around New Year’s Day? How’s that going?
This would be the year, you said, that you would get serious about saving for retirement and fattening up your emergency fund. You vowed to write a will, buy more life insurance or save for a house.
If you didn’t stick to your resolutions, you’re not alone.  Continue reading →





CNBC Ranking – East Coast Ranked in the Top 100 Fee-Only Wealth Management Firms for Second Year in a Row

June 4, 2015 


We are pleased to report that for the second straight year, East Coast Asset Management was selected by CNBC as one of the Top 100 Fee-Only Wealth Management firms in the country, and one of only four in New England.
The list can be found on CNBC’s web site at the following link:
http://www.cnbc.com/id/102605785.
The ranking methodology scored firms using a proprietary formula that included criteria such as assets under management, professional designations (CFA and CFP), working with third-party professionals such as attorneys and CPAs, average account size, growth of assets, and years in business.
We appreciate the objective criteria used by CNBC and their focus on fee-only firms. We often look at these professional lists with a skeptical eye as many solicit a fee and are little more than advertisement, comingling fee-only wealth management firms, like East Coast, with commissioned brokers. We also appreciate that the rankings highlight firms working with third-party professionals, as the quality and depth of our working partnerships have been integral to helping our clients achieve their wealth management objectives.
