Your small offices or branch locations require the best network security available. An integrated solution that is easy to deploy and manage improves IT efficiency. Affordable pricing and the ability to scale as necessary are other important product benefits. You get all that and more with the Cisco®ASA 5505 Adaptive Security Appliance Firewalls. These firewalls are used and trusted by small and midsize businesses with one or a few locations.
Enterprise class security. Cisco MultiScale®performance, The ability to deliver multiple security services at scale. Unprecedented services flexibility. Modular scalability. Feature extensibility. Lower deployment and operational costs. All of these features and benefits add up to tremendous value in the Cisco ASA 5505 Adaptive Security Appliance. Available models deliver the same proven level of security that protects the networks of some of the largest and most security-conscious companies in the world.
Product Overview
The Cisco ASA 5505 is a full-featured firewall for small business, branch, and enterprise teleworker environments. It delivers high-performance firewall, SSL and IPsec VPN, and rich networking services in a modular, immediately operational appliance. Using the integrated graphical Cisco Adaptive Security Device Manager (ASDM), the Cisco ASA 5505 can be rapidly deployed and easily managed, helping businesses reduce operational costs. It features a flexible 8-port 10/100 Fast Ethernet switch whose ports can be dynamically grouped to create up to three separate VLANs for home, business, and Internet traffic for improved network segmentation and security. 
The Cisco ASA 5505 provides two Power over Ethernet (PoE) ports, simplifying the deployment of Cisco IP phones with highly secure zero-touch voice over IP (VoIP) capabilities and the deployment of external wireless access points for extended network mobility. A high-performance intrusion prevention and worm mitigation service is available with the addition of the Advanced Inspection and Prevention Security Services Card (AIP SSC). Multiple USB ports can be used to implement additional services and capabilities, as needed.
As your business needs grow, you can install a Security Plus upgrade license, The Cisco ASA 5505 can then scale to support a higher site to site VPN connection capacity of 25 IPsec VPN connections, add full DMZ support, and integrate into switched network environments through VLAN trunking support. This upgrade license improves business continuity by helping to enable support for redundant ISP connections and stateless active/standby high-availability services.
Businesses can also extend the Cisco ASA 5505’s VPN service by enabling the Cisco AnyConnect client and clientless VPN remote access to support various mobile workers and business partners. Cisco secure remote access solution deployments can scale to serve up to 25 Cisco AnyConnect or clientless VPN concurrent users on each Cisco ASA 5505. Licenses for AnyConnect are purchased separately from the ASA based on feature tier (Plus/Apex) unique/authorized user count and term. The Apex tier also supports clientless SSL VPN connectivity. Additional information can be found in the AnyConnect ordering guide. http://www.cisco.com/c/dam/en/us/products/security/anyconnect-og.pdf.
This combination of market-leading security and VPN services, advanced networking features, flexible remote management capabilities, and future extensibility makes the Cisco ASA 5505 an excellent choice for businesses requiring a best-in-class small business, branch, or enterprise teleworker security solution.

2 Firewall traffic that does not go through the IPS service can have higher throughput. 
 

3 VPN throughput and maximum sessions depend on the ASA device configuration and VPN traffic patterns, including average packet size. These elements should be taken into consideration as part of your capacity planning. Throughput represents the maximum possible IPsec throughput. Maximum users may be further limited by your throughput requirements. 
 

4 AnyConnect licenses required. See the AnyConnect Ordering Guide for details. Maximum users may be further limited by your throughput requirements.

	                      "I wanted to 
	                      thank you for getting the new telephone batteries to us so soon!. We 
	                      were having phone problems and the quick service was appreciated. I 
	                      purchase many things from websites and once many of them have the order 
	                      they don't seem to worry about how long it takes for the products to 
	                      arrive... I really appreciate the follow-up to my status request email 
	                      and that the batteries arrived even sooner than we had planned."

Conducting a FERC environmental assessment: A case study and recommendations from the Terror Lake ProjectProduct Type: ReportYear: 1984Author(s): Olive, S.W. and B.L. LambSuggested Citation: Olive, S.W. and B.L. Lamb. 1984. Conducting a FERC environmental assessment: A case study and recommendations from the Terror Lake Project. FWS/OBS-84/08. Washington, DC: Fish and Wildlife Service, U.S. Department of the Interior. 62 p. Over the past several years the Cooperative Instream Flow Service Group has prepared case studies which detail efforts to protect instream uses of water in four States. These instream uses refer to the water as it flows in a stream for navigation, recreation, aesthetics, water quality maintenance, and fish and wildlife habitat. The earlier case studies concentrated on State programs for protecting instream uses of water (See, for example, Sweetman 1980). 
 Unlike those reports, this paper is an account of the process that evolved during acquisition of the license to operate the Terror Lake hydroelectric power project under the auspices of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC). The Commission is responsible for granting these licenses under the Federal Power Act (16 U.S.C. 792 et seq.). This act provides, in part, that FERC may condition a license to protect the public interest. The public interest in these cases has come to include both instream and terrestrial values. 
 The Terror River is located on Kodiak Island in Alaska. The river is within the Kodiak National Wildlife Refuge; it supports excellent runs of several species of Pacific Salmon which are both commercially important and a prime source of nutrition for the Kodiak brown bear. The river is also a prime resource for generating electric power. As with any FERC license, there were many issues involved in the Terror Lake Project other than instream uses of water. For example, one major concern in the negotiations was the impact of land disturbance and management practices on brown bear habitat--i . e., protection of the brown bear. Maintenance of the the bears’ habitat is the main purpose of the Kodiak National Wildlife Refuge. But, like many other projects, resolving the instream flow issue was of major importance in the issuance of the FERC license.
