Hot 25: Juergen Gromer

Juergen Gromer thinks it's ironic that he's re-reading Einstein's theory of relativity. Gromer, who first studied the material as a physics student at the University of Stuttgart, muses about the theory's implications concerning time travel.

"Part of that theory is to be at different places in the world at the same time. That would be good, although I have to concentrate on what I can do," said Gromer, vice president of Tyco International Ltd. and president and chief executive of Tyco Electronics Corp.

Some say Gromer's office is wherever his briefcase is. His business card lists offices

in Bensheim, Germany, near his home, and Tyco Electronics' headquarters in Harrisburg, Pa.

Gromer, who spends 40% of his time visiting customers worldwide, believes in testing limits. He has driven his Porsche at 190 miles per hour on the autobahn and ridden rapidly up the more than 15,000-ft.-high Mt. Blanc on his mountain bike, but knows the dangers of such pursuits.

Gromer thrives on three or four hours of sleep a night. But he claims not to be having any trouble sleeping-when he sleeps-despite the challenges of running Tyco Electronics' now vast empire and making difficult decisions about head count and costs to meet Tyco International's financial goals.

However, he doesn't believe Tyco Electronics has reached its peak, despite the face that sales have risen 100% and earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) 140% for the fiscal year ended Sept. 30. 

"It's difficult in business to say 'I've reached the limit,' " Gromer said. "You can always do more."

Tyco Electronics is still in the market for more acquisitions, according to Gromer, who took the helm following the acquisition two years ago of AMP Inc. "You can only achieve the ratios Tyco [requires] through acquisitions," he said.

It's an understatement to say the company, with holdings now ranging from circuit-protection to electromechanical devices and a deal pending to buy Lucent Power Systems, has been on a buying spree. Gromer and Tyco have made clear their intention to bolster their holdings in passive and active components and in OEM markets.

Gromer has had several good teachers at his current job, including Tyco International's chief executive, L. Dennis Kozlowski, and Ed Federman, now executive vice president and chief financial officer of Tyco Electronics. The two educated Gromer in the art of acquisition and business integration, helping to round out his management expertise from the days at AMP, where his buyout experience was limited. At AMP, Gromer held several management positions, including senior vice president of worldwide sales and services and president of the Global Automotive Division, which he formed in 1997.

Today, Gromer draws his energy and enthusiasm from the fact that he's having fun and is proud of Tyco Electronics' accomplishments. "We're now really somebody in the eyes of the customer," he said.

That wasn't always the case for the executive. AMP's top-heavy management dwarfed decision-making, and the company had become so mired in meetings that it had lost sight of customer needs, he said. AMP's acquisition by Tyco re-energized the company and enabled Gromer to "finally put all those things I complained about [at AMP] into effect."

However, the hardest part, following the acquisition, was cutting 10,000 jobs, including two-thirds of AMP's vice presidents, Gromer said, adding that the action was necessary. Fortunately, the  job cuts came during a strong economy and nearly everyone found work quickly, he said.

Colleagues and industry observers consider Gromer a caring person, effusive in his praise of employees. 

"Juergen's strength is his knowledge of the people-particularly the customers-involved," Federman said. "And he knows what it takes to put together [an efficient] structure."

"Juergen is a dynamic, inspirational leader who took charge of AMP immediately following the acquisition and quickly doubled the size of the company through a combination of acquisitions, improved pricing practices, and internal growth," said Jerry Labowitz,  an analyst at Merrill Lynch & Co. Inc., New York.

The operations Gromer managed at AMP were among the company's most profitable, Labowitz added. 

But much has happened since those days. "Two years ago, I would have loved to have been in charge of a company like AMP, but my expectations were somewhat limited," Gromer said. "Because I'm a non-U.S. citizen, I couldn't have expected to move so fast in a U.S. company. Tyco thinks broader, more international. Dennis Kozlowski is driving that. It's a new chance under a new umbrella."

Two years from now, Gromer hopes Tyco Electronics-whose fiscal 2000 revenue was more than $10 billion-will be even larger and more competitive than it already is.

resistion It doesn't look like EUV is replacing SAQP, by most accounts.  Many cell designs are more SAQP-friendly now, recognizing that SAQP is a new risk for yield.

resistion Shrinking could be driven by self-aligned patterning, but post-FinFET everything might be re-evaluated.
