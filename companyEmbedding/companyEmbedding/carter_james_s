James Carter





	Jimmy Carter served as the 39th President of the United States from 1977 to 1981. He was awarded the 2002 Nobel Peace Prize for work to find peaceful solutions to international conflicts, to advance democracy and human rights, and to promote economic and social development.




	Jimmy Carter aspired to make Government "competent and compassionate," responsive to the American people and their expectations. His achievements were notable, but in an era of rising energy costs, mounting inflation, and continuing tensions, it was impossible for his administration to meet these high expectations.

	Carter, who has rarely used his full name--James Earl Carter, Jr.--was born October 1, 1924, in Plains, Georgia. Peanut farming, talk of politics, and devotion to the Baptist faith were mainstays of his upbringing. Upon graduation in 1946 from the Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland, Carter married Rosalynn Smith. The Carters have three sons, John William (Jack), James Earl III (Chip), Donnel Jeffrey (Jeff), and a daughter, Amy Lynn.

	After seven years' service as a naval officer, Carter returned to Plains. In 1962 he entered state politics, and eight years later he was elected Governor of Georgia. Among the new young southern governors, he attracted attention by emphasizing ecology, efficiency in government, and the removal of racial barriers.

	Carter announced his candidacy for President in December 1974 and began a two-year campaign that gradually gained momentum. At the Democratic Convention, he was nominated on the first ballot. He chose Senator Walter F. Mondale of Minnesota as his running mate. Carter campaigned hard against President Gerald R. Ford, debating with him three times. Carter won by 297 electoral votes to 241 for Ford.

	Carter worked hard to combat the continuing economic woes of inflation and unemployment. By the end of his administration, he could claim an increase of nearly eight million jobs and a decrease in the budget deficit, measured in percentage of the gross national product. Unfortunately, inflation and interest rates were at near record highs, and efforts to reduce them caused a short recession.

	Carter could point to a number of achievements in domestic affairs. He dealt with the energy shortage by establishing a national energy policy and by decontrolling domestic petroleum prices to stimulate production. He prompted Government efficiency through civil service reform and proceeded with deregulation of the trucking and airline industries. He sought to improve the environment. His expansion of the national park system included protection of 103 million acres of Alaskan lands. To increase human and social services, he created the Department of Education, bolstered the Social Security system, and appointed record numbers of women, blacks, and Hispanics to Government jobs.

	In foreign affairs, Carter set his own style. His championing of human rights was coldly received by the Soviet Union and some other nations. In the Middle East, through the Camp David agreement of 1978, he helped bring amity between Egypt and Israel. He succeeded in obtaining ratification of the Panama Canal treaties. Building upon the work of predecessors, he established full diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China and completed negotiation of the SALT II nuclear limitation treaty with the Soviet Union.

	There were serious setbacks, however. The Soviet invasion of Afghanistan caused the suspension of plans for ratification of the SALT II pact. The seizure as hostages of the U. S. embassy staff in Iran dominated the news during the last 14 months of the administration. The consequences of Iran's holding Americans captive, together with continuing inflation at home, contributed to Carter's defeat in 1980. Even then, he continued the difficult negotiations over the hostages. Iran finally released the 52 Americans the same day Carter left office.

Do You Have Insurance for Drone Liabilities? 

James S. Carter
Unmanned aerial vehicles, popularly known as drones, present enormous commercial potential for companies seeking to use this new technology to collect data. Drones are currently used for data collection in a number of fields. For example, farmers use drones to collect crop data, oil companies use drones to explore for oil and gas, surveyors use drones to create maps, and sports teams use drones to analyze practices. Numerous other industries will find uses for drones as regulatory barriers are relaxed.
Drones also present certain risks. Drones obviously pose the risk of colliding with objects and living things. Fortunately, the insurance industry has started to introduce specialized insurance coverage for these types of risks. And technological developments, such as sense-and-avoidance technology, promise to enhance drone safety. Continue reading “Do You Have Insurance for Drone Liabilities?”

Does Your Company’s Cyber Risk Insurance Cover Cyber-Related Bodily Injury and Property Damage? 

James S. Carter
A recent article in the Wall Street Journal highlights a widespread cybersecurity threat that it reports has generally gone unrecognized: the vulnerability to cyberattacks of the underlying control systems that power and cool data-center networks.[1] These same types of systems, which include generators, thermostats, and air conditioners, are also found in commercial buildings and factories.[2]
The article reports that a cyberattack involving control systems has the potential to take down an entire operation.[3] It could also endanger human life.[4] While these risks are not new, the article notes that security personnel at many companies do not realize that such systems may be connected to the computer system or the internet, and thus exposed to a cyberattack.[5] In fact, the article reports, such systems often lack basic security protocols, such as user names or passwords.[6] Continue reading “Does Your Company’s Cyber Risk Insurance Cover Cyber-Related Bodily Injury and Property Damage?”

What Happens If Your Company Gives Late Notice of a Claim to Its Insurer? Hint: Insurers Should Not Make Policyholders Guess 

James S. Carter
One of the most common questions that in-house counsel may have for coverage counsel is, “What is the effect of providing late notice of an insurance claim?” The answer is that it depends on which state’s law applies to the insurance policy. A minority of states view notice as a condition precedent to coverage, and unexcused or unreasonably late notice voids coverage. The majority of states, however, have adopted the notice-prejudice rule, which is one of the most beneficial rules to policyholders. Rooted in equity and contract principles, it holds that untimely notice does not waive coverage unless the insurance carrier has been materially prejudiced by the delay. But a state’s adoption of the notice-prejudice rule is usually not the end of the story. As the notice-prejudice rule has gained prominence, insurers have shifted strategy from arguing against the adoption of the notice-prejudice rule to urging courts to carve out exceptions to the rule in which the insurer is deemed to suffer prejudice as a matter of law. This strategy, if successful, could have the effect of eroding the protection that the notice-prejudice rule affords policyholders. At a minimum, it will foster uncertainty among policyholders as to whether the notice-prejudice rule will apply.

How to Make Sure the Indemnification and Additional Insured Provisions in Your Next Contract Deliver the Protection Your Company Expects 

James S. Carter
Many companies rely on indemnification and additional insured provisions in their contracts for protection against losses arising from a contractual relationship. Indemnification provisions insulate the company from certain losses by requiring the other party to assume and to indemnify it against those losses. Additional insured provisions add another layer of protection by requiring the other party to arrange for the company to become an insured under the other party’s insurance policies. Ideally, indemnification provisions and additional insured coverage should work together when losses occur to furnish the level of protection the company expected when it entered into the contract.
Unless company representatives read the insurance policy that provides the additional insured coverage, however, they may have little idea how the additional insured coverage works. A recent decision by the Supreme Court of Texas arising out of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill incident illustrates how the interplay between additional insured coverage and wording in an underlying contract can operate to frustrate an additional insured’s expectations of coverage.

Advertising Insurance Policies: Advertiser Beware 

James S. Carter
Is your company about to embark on an advertising campaign? Insurers offer a wide variety of specialized insurance coverage for advertising risks. The marketing materials associated with such coverage often suggest that the coverage is broad. Advertising policies, however, often contain non-standard and untested language that might contain subtle nuances that could give rise to coverage disputes.
In one recent case, a coverage dispute turned on the placement of a mere comma in a seemingly broadly written provision granting coverage for advertising-related claims. See ACE European Group, Ltd. v. Abercrombie & Fitch, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 131269, Case No. 2:12-CV-1214, Case No. 2:11-CV-1114 (S.D. Ohio Sept. 13, 2013). Abercrombie & Fitch sought coverage under a “Safeonline Advertisers and Internet Liability Policy” for several consumer class actions alleging that Abercrombie had misled consumers about a nationwide gift card promotion.

Seeking Insurance Coverage for a Product Disparagement Claim 

James S. Carter
The “advertising injury” coverage in commercial liability insurance policies typically extends to lawsuits alleging product disparagement. But is there coverage if your company’s advertisement does not specifically mention a competitor’s product by name? A recent judicial decision suggests that the answer is yes.
JAR Laboratories LLC v. Great American E&S Insurance Co., 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 67516 (N.D. Ill. May 10, 2013), addressed whether an insurance company had a duty to defend its policyholder, the manufacturer of an over-the-counter pain relief patch, against a lawsuit brought by a distributor of a prescription pain relief patch. The issue turned on whether the allegations in the distributor’s complaint fell within the scope of the policy’s coverage for “personal and advertising injuries” resulting from the publication of material that “disparages a person’s or organization’s goods, products, or services.” Id. at *12 (quotation marks omitted).

Renewing Product Liability Coverage? Consider the Number of Occurrences 

James S. Carter
Many companies at this time of year are preparing to renew their product liability coverage, which is supposed to provide security for products lawsuits.  The insurance policy that a company is considering for its products liability coverage, however, may leave the amount of coverage for product liability losses up to chance because of an issue that arises in insurance coverage litigation, particularly those involving product liability claims, known as the number of “occurrences.”  Simply put, the number-of-occurrences issue asks whether product liability claims arise from one occurrence or more than one occurrence.  Because the amount of coverage or any deductible is typically stated as a dollar amount “per occurrence,” the answer to that question can leave a policyholder with an abundance of coverage, or leave it essentially self-insured.
The number-of-occurrences issue can have a particularly profound effect on insurance coverage in the product liability context because of the potential for numerous claims.  If, for instance, a policy has a per-occurrence deductible, and each product liability claim is deemed to be a separate occurrence, the total amount of deductibles could exceed the total amount of coverage.  Alternatively, if product liability claims are grouped together as one occurrence, then only one deductible would have to be paid, thus preserving coverage.

Recode Decode: Maverick Carter, LeBron James's business manager - Product Hunt































Product HuntThe best new products, every dayAsk●|Log InSign up Featured a year agoRecode Decode: Maverick Carter, LeBron James's business managerAthletes become kings when they control their own messageget it28 ShareWould you recommend Recode Decode: Maverick Carter, LeBron James's business manager to a friend?😡 NO🤔 MAYBE😍 YESHunterHKara SwisherMakersMKurt WagnerDiscussionYou need to become a Contributor to join the discussion - Find out how.⭐️ Ben Tossell@bentossell · Community Lead, Product HuntWhen LeBron James announced in 2010 that he would leave the Cleveland Cavaliers for the Miami Heat, he did it through a live TV special on ESPN called "The Decision." Media reactions were swift and often critical, his manager, Maverick Carter, said, but then something funny happened.

"The largest growth in LeBron’s brand at Nike was that year, 'The Decision,'" Carter said in an interview with Recode's Kurt Wagner on the latest episode of Recode Decode. Put another way: Whatever, haters! "The Decision" and the move helped James sell lots and lots of merch.

That was one of the best indicators to Carter that his approach to media coverage — control the message — was working.

After two NBA Playoff championships in Miami and a return to Cleveland, this time announced via a carefully planned letter in Sports Illustrated, James is a bigger star than ever. He and Carter co-founded Uninterrupted, a platform for first-person athlete stories hosted on Bleacher Report; he made a well-received crossover into film with a prominent role in Judd Apatow's "Trainwreck"; and whispers abound that he will succeed Michael Jordan in the Looney Tunes sports movie "Space Jam 2."

"Maybe we’re going to do it. There’s a lot of rumors. Nothing is set yet," Carter said of "Space Jam."

Today, Carter said he sees traditional media as "complementary" to his and James's work, and a good source of broad distribution, but he wants more and more athletes to be telling their own stories.

"The media has to cover a lot of stories and a lot of athletes," he said. "If Draymond Green wants to tell a deeper, more insightful story, we [Uninterrupted] are the place for that. But he’s still going to talk to the Golden State press every day." 5Share·a year ago👋 Welcome to Product HuntGet the best new products in your inbox, daily.SubscribeRelated ProductsRecode Decode: Ashton KutcherWhy Ashton Kutcher passed on investing in Snapchat, twiceRecode Decode: Bill Gurley"Too much money is my biggest problem"Recode Decode: Satirizing Silicon ValleyThis is your life in Silicon Valley: I wanted to hit a nerveAction Army #15 - An unexpected lesson from LeBron JamesLess about basketball and more about your reputation.Recode Decode w/ the European Commissioner for CompetitionMargrethe Vestager: Google & Apple should have limits, too.Recode Decode - "Hamilton" producer Jeffrey Seller: Tech can't beat live theaterSeller: Live theater is the antidote to digital overload flag

James Coolidge Carter (1827-1905) was an American lawyer, a partner in the firm that eventually became Carter Ledyard & Milburn (CL&M), which he helped found in 1854. He helped create the The Association of the Bar of the City of New York.
Biography[edit]
Carter was born in Lancaster, Massachusetts, on October 14, 1827,[1] the youngest child of a large and needy family. He entered Harvard College in 1846 and graduated in 1850. He rowed stroke oar in his class boat and was class orator at commencement. Joseph H. Choate said of him:

When I entered Harvard College in 1848 Mr. Carter, who had already been there for two years, was a very marked man among the 300 students who then constituted the entire community of the little college. To very commanding abilities he added untiring industry and to a lofty character most pleasing manners, a combination which easily made him foremost. He was filled with an honorable ambition, and took all the prizes; he took an interest in the public questions of the day and cultivated the art of speaking with discriminating assiduity; he was a devoted admirer of Mr. Webster . . ., and I always thought he modeled himself upon that noble example in style, in expression and in the mode of treating every question that arose. Indeed in his last years I regarded him as the last survivor of the Websterian school.

Carter later attended Harvard Law School until 1853.[2] He had entered the law school in 1851 after spending a year tutoring in New York City. It was during this year in New York City that he worked in the office of Kent & Davies, where his attendance was only nominal.[3]
One of the partners of Kent & Davies, Henry E. Davies, later came to see Carter at Harvard Law School.[3] Davies told Carter that the firm of Kent & Davies was about to be dissolved, that the firm of Davies & Scudder would be located at 66 Wall Street, and that he wanted Carter to accept a position as managing clerk. Carter accepted the offer, and shortly thereafter was admitted to the New York bar. After about a year, Davies & Scudder dissolved when Davies left to become Corporation Counsel of The City of New York. So in 1854, at the age of 28, after one year of practice, Carter became a junior partner in Scudder & Carter, which has under its successive organization leading to CL&M, in the words of Joseph Choate, “occupied a great place in the annals of the profession in New York.”
Carter, instead of deriving any special benefit from it at the outset of his career, had to make his own way by dint of long hours and hard work. Starting with little money and no major clients, Carter by 1865 had become prominent as a litigator and was being sought out by other lawyers to assist them in their cases. Thus, he was asked by Charles O'Conor, a well-known New York lawyer, to assist him in number of cases, including an action against William Marcy Tweed, boss of Tammany Hall, to recover funds for the City of New York. David Dudley Field represented the defendant. The preparation and trial of the case by Carter and O’Conor resulted in a verdict in which the City recovered over $60,000,000.
As a result of his endeavors in the Tweed case, in 1877 Carter was appointed a member of Governor Tilden’s commission to devise a plan for the government of cities, to prevent a repetition of Tweed’s system. The plan which the Commission proposed was that the government of cities should be non-partisan; as a result, it was not adopted.
In 1870 Carter joined with other prominent New York lawyers in establishing The Association of the Bar of the City of New York, and he was twice president of the Association, first 1884–1885 and a second time in 1897–1899.
As Robert W. Gordon of Stanford law School points out, during the years from 1870 to 1900 Carter was involved in many of the important movements for the reform of New York City government: he was a member of the Tilden Commission mentioned above, the anti-Tammany Committee of Seventy (formed by seventy members of The Association of the Bar to oppose Tammany boss Richard Croker), the National Municipal League (of which he was president in 1896), the Citizens Union (which he helped to found), the Good Government Clubs, and the City Club of New York (of which Carter had been its first president).[4] He was elected an Associate Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1896.[5] Carter was also a member of the Committee of One Hundred (actually 104 members) organized to support a reform plan for New York City schools.
Under Carter’s leadership, the Bar Association was also prominent in defeating David Dudley Field’s proposed civil code. The arguments Carter then framed and addressed to successive legislatures and governors led to the final rejection of the code. His views were published in a series of pamphlets, the first of which appeared in 1884 under the title The Proposed Codification of our Common Law. “The main theme of Carter’s argument,” according to George W. Martin, “was built on a distinction he drew between ‘written’ or statutory law, originated and occasionally repealed or revised by the legislature, and the ‘unwritten’ or common law, which was revealed by the decisions of judges.”[6] With respect to the unwritten law, Carter maintained that the judge’s function was “to apply the existing standard of justice (Carter’s emphasis) to the new exhibition of fact, and to do this by ascertaining the conclusion to which right reason, aided by rules already established leads.” That standard of justice rested on public opinion, which he defined as follows:

And what is this but saying that law, in order to be obeyed and enforced, must accord with the public standard or conception of justice? All well conceived efforts to make, or to declare, law, are, therefore, efforts to apply this public, or, as we have styled it, national, standard of justice to human conduct. This national standard, more particularly stated, is the final result of the moral and intellectual life and culture of a nation, the product of all the influences, public and private, which tend to cultivate and develop men’s conceptions of what is just, expedient and useful, and which is unconsciously perceived and felt by every individual member of society by reason of the fact that he is such a member, and exposed to like influences with his fellows.[7]

In 1885, he delivered an address before the Virginia State Bar Association, which was afterwards published under the title of The Provinces of the Written and Unwritten Law. In 1890, he addressed the American Bar Association on “The Ideal and the Actual in the Law,” which embodied further views on his theory of the origin of law. In his later years he formulated his theories in a series of lectures which he planned to deliver at the Harvard Law School, and which were published posthumously by his executor, Lewis Cass Ledyard, in a book entitled Law: Its Origin Growth and Function.
In 1892, he was appointed one of the counsel to present the claims of the United States before the Bering Sea tribunal.[8][9]
He died in New York City on February 14, 1905.[10]
