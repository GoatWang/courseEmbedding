Personal life[edit]
Born in Calgary, Alberta, she attended Queen's University and graduated with Civil Engineering and MBA degrees. She was the sole winner of the highest tribute at Queen's, the Agnes Benidickson Tricolour Award, in 2007.[5] Michele is the daughter of Marvin Romanow, the former President & CEO of Nexen.
Business[edit]
Romanow launched her first business, The Tea Room,[5] a zero consumer waste coffee shop, in 2006 while studying at Queen's University. Romanow then partnered with two colleagues from her engineering class, Anatoliy Melnichuk and Ryan Marien. Together, they founded Evandale Caviar, Buytopia.ca, and SnapSaves without raising any external capital. Romanow graduated and started Evandale Caviar, a vertically integrated fishery that distributed high end sturgeon caviar to luxury hotels and restaurants. She then became the Director of Strategy for Sears Canada. In 2011, Romanow started Buytopia.ca which, by 2013, had 2.5M subscribers and had provided over $100M in savings through deals for products, services, events, and travel, with merchants including brands like Cirque du Soleil, Porter Airlines, and Staples.[6] Buytopia also grew by acquiring six competitors.[7][8] Romanow started SnapSaves, a mobile couponing app that gives shoppers cash back when they buy certain items in the grocery store by partnering with consumer packaged goods companies. Groupon purchased SnapSaves in June 2014, relaunched in the U.S. as Snap by Groupon.[9]
In June 2017, Ruma Bose, the former president of Chobani Ventures LLC, founded the Canadian Entrepreneurship Initiative with support from Michele Romanow. According to the Globe and Mail, the not-for-profit is meant to help small-business owners get inexpensive financing, and Romanow promised any female entrepreneurs applying through the initiative a 10 percent discount on loans obtained through her financial services platform, clearbanc.com. [10]
Romanow is currently a director for Whistler Blackcomb (TSX: WB)[11] and Shad Valley International.[12]
Television[edit]
Romanow was announced as one of the new dragons on Season 10 of the Canadian reality television series Dragons' Den in 2015, alongside Joe Fresh founder Joe Mimran and Manjit Minhas of Minhas Breweries after the departure of Arlene Dickinson, David Chilton, and Vikram Vij, and continues to appear in 2017.[13]
Romanow previously starred in Season 1 of Dragon’s Den NextGenDen, a Dragons’ Den series aimed at tech companies for entrepreneurs below 40.[14][15]
Awards[edit]
Romanow has been recognized with several honors and awards including:

#31 Fastest Growing Company on Profit Magazines Profit Hot 50 Ranking[7][16]
#21 Fastest Growing Company on the W100 (3,163% 3 year revenue growth)[17][18]
EY Entrepreneur of the Year Finalist[19][20]
WXN 100 Most Powerful Women[2][21]
RBC Canadian Women Entrepreneur Award Finalist[22]
Toronto Board of Trade Business Excellence Award[23]

Snap for Groupon changing with Canadian product founders Michele Romanow & Anatoliy Melnichuk departing | BetaKit






















































 




























 
























































 

















                    By Jessica Galang

Canadian Startup News
February 9, 2016


Snap for Groupon changing with Canadian product founders Michele Romanow & Anatoliy Melnichuk departing








 

The Snap by Groupon platform, which allows users to get cash back on groceries, is undergoing major changes — but the Canadian founding team behind the product won’t be part of it.
Earlier this week, BetaKit received a tip that the Snap platform would be dissolved within the week and the managing team let go, which includes co-founders Michele Romanow and Anatoliy Melnichuk.
Launched in October of 2013 by Toronto’s Buytopia, SnapSaves was acquired by Groupon in June of 2014. As part of the acquisition, Buytopia and SnapSaves co-founders Melnichuk and Romanow – the latter a recent addition to CBC’s Dragons’ Den — both took positions at Groupon.

BetaKit reached out to both Melnichuk and Romanow for comment on the departure, with Romanow directing us to Groupon’s Head of Communications, Bill Roberts.
Roberts told BetaKit that Snap is not shutting down, but undergoing “exciting changes” over the coming weeks, transitioning to focus more on mass-retail couponing.
“We’re expanding the number of offers available within the app to include our inventory of more than 60,000 coupons and promotions at the top retailers in the U.S and Canada,” Roberts said in a statement.
Roberts also indicated that Romanow and Melnichuk have not been dismissed, but that the departure is their decision.
“As we transition Snap to focus more on mass-retail couponing, the Snap founders have decided to pursue opportunities outside of Groupon. We thank them for their work with Groupon and wish them the best.”
Melnichuk responded shortly after, saying that “Snap is constantly evolving, and we listen to what consumers want. And consumers are looking for more retail coupons so we will be expanding our offering.” Melnichuk also offered that, “we will be helping with the transition of Snap, then Michele and I will be moving on to other new ventures.”
Groupon will notably report its Q4 fiscal earnings after market close this Thursday. In Q3, Groupon replaced CEO and co-founder Eric Lefkofsky with Rich Williams following a mixed earnings report. The switch followed shortly after Groupon’s exit from Nordic markets including Sweden, Denmark, Norway, and Finland, as well as the layoffs of 1,100 customer service and international employees.

More than a decade in, Dragons’ Den continues to inspire and amuse Canadian TV audiences. But the CBC’s hit show isn’t just meant to be entertaining. It’s a televised school for entrepreneurs. For each episode of Season 11 (which airs Wednesdays at 8 pm ET), we’ll be talking to one of the Dragons to get a behind-the-scenes glimpse of their decision-making process and hear what they hope viewers learned. And we’ll be examining the pitches for smart strategies and useful tips that entrepreneurs can use to make their own businesses better. Episode 6, the ‘Why Didn’t I Think of That?’ special, featured plenty of inventive ideas and two entrepreneurs with a single-SKU success story.

Manufactures and distributes children’s hockey apparel

A lot of business origin stories follow a familiar pattern: See a need, come up with a solution to fill that need, then build a company around the solution. Getting Product No. 1 right is key says Michele Romanow. “It needs to have such strong product-market fit that [it] can carry you for a while,” she explains. “If your first product is weak, you’re never going to get the flywheel going—the initial traction to get you enough customers [and] revenue to get to growth.”
Emily Rudow and Kayla Nezon had achieved that crucial initial step with the protective base-layer children’s hockey pants they pitched on Dragon’s Den’s “Why Didn’t I Think of That?’ special episode. “These girls had found a real need, probably spent a touch too much time on product development, but had a very good end product,” Romanow said in an exclusive interview before the episode aired. On set, she offered $50,000 for a 25% equity stake in Oneiric. Joe Mimran also made a bid, asking for 40% of the company and an equal say on decisions. Manjit Minhas made it three, offering the capital for a 5% royalty for five years. Rudow tried to get the three Dragons together, but when they demurred, the duo shook hands with Minhas.
The idea for Oneiric came from Rudow’s own frustrations as a bantam hockey player. The product speeds up the process of getting dressed for the rink, and protects against cuts and bruises to the back of the leg. “I think when you walk into a dressing room and one person puts it on, I think all the kids are going to go home and say, ‘Mom, I want one of those,’” Jim Treliving said in the Den.
Oneiric had amassed $10,000 in sales over the three months pre-taping, with 60% of that coming from retail and the rest direct-to-consumer, through tournaments and online. The pants retailed at $130 for the player version and $115 for the goalie, and cost the company just under half that amounts to make. Not all the Dragons liked those numbers, though Rudow noted she’d been in talks with manufacturers to reduce the fabricating expense. “Why didn’t you price it according to where you think your cost will be?” asked Joe Mimran. “Because retail price points do determine whether you’re going to be successful or not.” Oneiric was positioning itself as a premium product, Rudow explained. For her part, Romanow wasn’t worried about consumer sticker shock. “I would put hockey in the category of babies, weddings [and] pets, where people think, ‘If it’s 50 bucks, okay. If it’s $100, okay. If it’s 150, okay,’’ she says post-filming. “It’s largely talking to a price-insensitive customer.”
Those consumers still expect quality for their money, and delivering one is even more important for a single-offering company like Oneiric. Perfecting what you’re selling—as Rudow spent several years doing—is crucial. “This is one of the huge problems with startups—if you don’t win the first time, it’s almost impossible for you to scale,” says Romanow. Once it’s a proven success, that initial product can become an impediment, as entrepreneurs resist trying anything else. “I can’t think of many billion-dollar companies that are single-SKU products,” notes Romanow. “You ultimately have to move beyond that.” But all of that still begins with a single starting product. “The first thing you scale on has to be something that customers really want.”

Umbrella Station
Entrepreneur: Mike McQuaid | From: Kelowna, B.C. | Ask: $100,000 for 20%
Manufactures and distributes a holder for picnic umbrellas

Mind the unit economics: Kelowna may be one of the few places in the country where a beach umbrella will spend more time open than in storage, but Mike McQuaid believed there was a big market for his shade-holder. When he entered the Den, McQuaid had just quit his job to focus on his company full time. “My first real production run is about to come off the line,” he explained to the Dragons. Still, he’d already moved $7,000 worth of Umbrella Stands in 10 days. “I’m really impressed that you went from the beach, you developed a prototype and you really have something that’s ready to sell,” said Michele Romanow. While the Dragons liked the top-line figure, they were less pleased with the unit economics of the product. The Umbrella Stand was set to retail for $99 sans the brolly, and a $31.25 wholesale price and $24 manufacturing cost left a slim margin for McQuaid, who planned to shift manufacturing to China. Still, Michael Wekerle opened the bidding, asking for a 6% royalty for the $100,000. “Once you start ramping up sales, this product, based out of China, I’d be surprised if you pay more than $10 for the whole thing,” he told McQuaid. Manjit Minhas also made an offer, asking for a 25% stake in return for her capital. “I can help you with the procurement, because cost optimization is where the margins are going to be in this,” she said, suggesting she’d also buy a million pieces branded with the logo for her beer as a promotional gimmick. McQuaid took Minhas’ deal.

Paint Away Products
Entrepreneur: Kris Friesen & Marc Allen | From: Langley, B.C. | Ask: $25,000 for 15%
Manufactures and distributes painting accessories

What’s your plan?: Numbers are usually a challenge for nascent businesses entering the Den, but the Dragons saw some potential in Paint Away Products’ early returns. The company had sold some $12,000 worth of Marc Allen’s preservative cases for paint applicators in two weeks, at significant margins. But they were less impressed by the future prognosis. “We want to see this everywhere,” Kris Friesen told them. “So we see online as huge. We also see [it in] say in a Home Depot and big box stores.” “That’s not much of a plan,” Michele Romanow shot back. The duo hadn’t made any progress towards their other goal—to team up with a national paint company for Canada-wide distribution—in part because Friesen wasn’t working for the company full-time. “If you don’t put time into the company and dedicate your resources, how do you expect it to grow?” asked Manjit Minhas. But some Dragons were willing to bite. Romanow offered the $25,000 for half the company. Michael Wekerle upped the stakes, proposing $50,000 for a 40% stake. Friesen tried to negotiate him down, but Wek stood firm, and the Paint Away duo ultimately took the deal.

Trinken
Entrepreneur: Jerry McArthur & Wendy Lloyd | From: North Vancouver, B.C.
Ask: $150,000 for 20%
Manufactures and distributes beer accessories

Prove your worth: Most cities and towns—not to mention neighbours—frown upon those sauntering down the street with a tallboy in hand. Trinken’s solution: A faux coffee cup lid that clips onto the top of the can and fits on a standard paper cup. “Originally it was a way to hide a beer, but then we started realizing all the other awesome features, like keeping it cold,” Jerry McArthur explained. The company, called Lolo Lids when it pitched the Dragons, had sold $90,000 worth of the product in three months at $15 a pop, mostly during a Kickstarter campaign. “It’s such a good way to test market validation for your idea,” said Michele Romanow. “You don’t have to spend money up front, you see if the audience likes it, you see if they put their credit card down.” McArthur and partner Wendy Lloyd saw their lids as an alternative to the logo-plastered promotional beer koozie, a $1.3 billion market. “I think there’s a real product,” said Jim Treliving. “I could probably buy some right now [and] take it to another couple of beer companies that we’d deal with.” He asked for $150,000 in return for half the company. Beer baroness Manjit Minhas was also a fan, offering the capital for a 33% stake. McArthur and Lloyd took her deal.

Michele Romanow
Age 28, Toronto
Co-founder: Buytopia

2012 revenue: $5-$10 million
Employees: 50 full-time, 10 part-time
W100 ranking: #24
(Get the complete W100 rankings of Canada’s Top 100 Female Entrepreneurs.)
Michele Romanow is a serial entrepreneur who started three companies before her 28th birthday. Her latest venture, the e-commerce company Buytopia, has ballooned to 2.5 million subscribers nabbing deals on everything from vintage designer bags to spa treatments.
She started the company with a couple of friends and earned $10,000 on the first day of sales. “I knew I had something interesting!”
Michele, who studied engineering at Queen’s University in Kingston, Ont., is a metrics geek rather than a shopping freak. But ultimately some of her greatest wins have been about trusting her gut. “In the first year we had $13,000 left in the bank and we bought a $6,000 print ad. I thought, ‘If no one buys after that, I’m in a lot of trouble.’ That was enormous. We’ve always been gutsy.”
In the past year alone, Michele has taken over seven smaller competitors and created an app. Her newest brainwave is a grocery couponing app called SnapSaves. “Rather than having to redeem a coupon in-store, when shoppers know that a product is $2 off, they can buy it, photograph the receipt and upload it. Then $2 is deposited into their account. It’s an elegant solution.”

Power play: Buytopia has saved subscribers over $100 million in the past two years on brands as varied as Staples, Netflix and Porter Airlines.
Words of advice: “Women need to just take a deep breath and take risks early on to start companies, try different ideas, learn to adapt and pivot, and get over the fear of failure.”

How to pick a winning new product idea
BuyTopia cofounder and Dragons’ Den judge Michele Romanow says the secret is not investing too heavily in any one idea


    Jul 21, 2015


CB Staff  







BuyTopia and SnapSaves cofounder Michele Romanow. (Sian Richards)
Michele Romanow, co-founder of Buytopia and SnapSaves and Dragons’ Den judge, argues the secret to innovating is not investing too heavily in any one idea. Here are her three tips for taking sensible risks without betting the whole company:

1. Create projects, not businesses
“It’s a gentler fall to say “the project didn’t work” rather than “the business failed.” Some projects need to be abandoned right away, but some take a bunch of iterations to get right. I was playing with the idea of doing sample boxes and calling tons of vendors to see if we could distribute a sample box for them, when we realized that what was really needed was a better mobile couponing vendor. So that’s how we created SnapSaves. Trying little projects and seeing what happens is really important.”





With inboxes overloaded, smart marketers look beyond email


2. Build a low-cost trial
“Can you build a landing page to test if people are excited by a new idea? Can you get out a really basic software product without investing too much? The nice part about technology is that ideas can be tried very quickly.”
3. Call your competitors
“When entrepreneurs are testing new ideas, they can become obsessed with their market research. But you really just need to get the basics. Talk to people who have worked in that space and find out what works. People are always scared to talk to their competitors, but asking people, “Is this sector growing? What are you struggling with?” gives you a ton of data. If there’s no one doing a particular business, it’s probably not because nobody has tried it. It’s probably because no one has succeeded in it.”

Michele Romanow’s entrepreneurial secret? Launch now, fix later
The youngest Dragon in the Den (and serial entrepreneur herself) has a message for aspiring founders: don’t wait


    Jun 2, 2016


Joanna Pachner  







Michele Romanow. (Portrait by Raina + Wilson)
“Please, help yourself!” Michele Romanow cries, seeing me eye the coffee table overflowing with swag. It’s the first day of taping season 11 of Dragons’ Den, and food was a prominent theme: Samples of exotic trail mix and a box of Sweets on Demand peek out from under a pair of bright blue spandex pants (from a pitch for a “soccer lifestyle brand”). Now, 13 hours into a day that started at 6:30 a.m. with two hours of makeup and hair fluffing, she’s finally kicking back in her dressing room, on-air black leather pants swapped for jeans and a T-shirt. Tired? Ha. Even in downtime mode, the woman radiates energy, her thoughts flowing out in rapid, breathless streams that occasionally end in, “Does that make sense?”

More Dragons’ Den stars:





The rise and fall and rise of Michael Wekerle






Manjit Minhas is the biggest beer baron you’ve never heard of—yet


At 30, Romanow is the youngest Dragon ever, and she’s made youthful vitality something of a trademark. Bubbly, thought her business partner Anatoliy Melnichuk when he first met her at Queen’s University—and he didn’t know the half of it yet. She’s launched four businesses, three of them with the same two partners, but that doesn’t really sum up her entrepreneurial knowledge. On her fourth day of shooting last season, the show’s producers approached her warily to ask if she was getting notes from the presenting entrepreneurs, because she knew a surprising amount about each industry. “No,” she told them. “I’ve tried to start half of these businesses.” Biodegradable packaging, bespoke suits made overseas, subscription beauty boxes and hundreds of other ideas—Romanow and her partners brainstormed, researched and started or rejected them all. “For every business we tried that people might know, there were five that didn’t work,” she says.
In 2014, she left the best known of those businesses, Toronto-based daily deals website Buytopia, to join Groupon after it bought her Buytopia spinoff. Now Romanow is getting ready to start her fifth business, in fintech. She knows little about financial services, but then she also knew nothing about running a café, making caviar, managing websites or peddling rebates when she pressed on with previous startups.
That’s one thing to know about Romanow: She has unshakable confidence—no, certainty—that she can figure out anything. She admits to having something to prove. “I don’t know where I get that from,” she muses, fiddling with a blingy earring left over from her Den outfit. “Maybe thinking I’d never be as successful as my dad.” (That would be Marvin Romanow, the former CEO of oilpatch giant Nexen.)
Her worries seem unfounded. Over the past decade, she’s learned that success demands refusing rejection and not waiting for permission. “Michele is a person who skips the line,” says Nicole Verkindt, founder of online aerospace marketplace OMX and one of Romanow’s best friends. “‘No’—she doesn’t even hear the word.”

 


 

Start something. Anything
This persistence was evident at an early age. In Grade 5, Romanow felt her bedtime was too early, so her parents encouraged her to survey her classmates for comparison. “The results showed that her bedtime was dead last, but despite the evidence, she still argued she should go to bed later,” her dad recalls. The first of four kids, Romanow was born in Calgary, and then moved to Regina, but spent a lot of time on her extended family’s farms. The experience taught her that no task was beneath her. Her motto: “Successful people do what unsuccessful people are not willing to do.”
An academic high achiever, she studied civil engineering at Queen’s but within a year knew it wouldn’t be her career. At 19, she decided to open a zero-waste café on campus and entered business plan competitions to raise funds. She didn’t win, but Melnichuk, a fellow engineering student, saw her pitch and pulled her aside. “Next year, we can beat these guys,” he said. Her first thought: What do you mean we?
How Tonia Jahshan built Steeped Tea into a huge retail empire
She opened the Tea Room in her fourth year and, 10 years later, it’s still run by the student government at Queen’s. Meanwhile, Melnichuk introduced Romanow to Ryan Marien, “the smartest guy in engineering and chemistry,” who also had a knack for analyzing business models. But Melnichuk, who did door-to-door sales as a kid, is the one who taught the partners to be deaf to “no.” “If you’re afraid of someone saying no, you won’t try,” Marien says. Melnichuk had another quality Romanow needed: He was an ultra-high risk taker while she struggled to find that gutsiness early on.
The trio spent most nights brainstorming business ideas and then cold-calling companies, saying they were students doing a research project. “Part of the benefit of starting so young was that we believed we could learn anything,” says Romanow. Some ideas (subscription cosmetics) were a poor fit with the Canadian market, and others (financing home upgrades) demanded more capital than three 20-year-olds could rustle up.
One day, someone suggested growing trees for expensive furniture. “If we’re going to farm anything, it’s gotta be the most expensive product in the world,” Melnichuk retorted. That was enough to send them off researching the caviar market; they discovered the world supply had plunged by 80% due to sturgeon overfishing. They read every study on fish farming and travelled to meet with sturgeon researchers. Romanow informed her parents that she couldn’t come home for Thanksgiving because she was flying to San Francisco to visit a sturgeon farm. After six months, they had a comprehensive 18-tab Excel spreadsheet and entered numerous business plan competitions in North America. By year’s end, they had collected $120,000.
The three of them packed into Marien’s Toyota Camry and drove to tiny Evandale, N.B., which had one of the few remaining natural supplies of Atlantic sturgeon. They knew that five local fishermen, all retired, had licences to catch sturgeon and found one who agreed to rent it to them. Now they had to find a working fisherman. “You should get Ted,” they were told. “Just go up the street, left at the lights, and he’s in the white house.” Romanow sat by the door for 10 hours waiting for the guy to get home. “I thought, I did an engineering degree. I did an MBA. And I’m literally stalking a fisherman right now.”
To get Evandale Caviar, a sustainable sturgeon aquaculture facility, off the ground, they lived in a hotel, and learned how to process fish and make caviar themselves. In the evenings, they called high-end restaurants and hotels to sell their wares. After the summer fishing season, they sold most of their inventory before October—October 2008, that is. The world of luxury retail collapsed. New export legislation hammered the final nail in Evandale’s coffin. Nevertheless, Romanow sees Evandale as a huge personal success. “I don’t think I could ever do that again, but the fact that I did it was so powerful.”

Ignore the naysayers
With the recession in full swing, the partners took a hiatus, and Romanow snagged a job as director of strategy at Sears Canada. The plodding corporate environment was a big contrast to the lightning speed of a startup. Still, Romanow was part of an internal consulting group and inhaled every piece of research that came across her desk. During a get-together with Melnichuk and Marien, she told them about the explosion in group buying, with companies like Chicago-based Groupon giving merchants a low-cost way to connect with consumers, who received deep discounts. None of them had technology skills, but they saw an opportunity—if they moved fast. With no time for meticulous planning, they threw together a strategy. “We would have a famous person tweet for us, we’d outsource the website overseas, and we’d launch at a trade show,” Romanow says. “That was it. Pathetic!”
Buytopia’s launch, at the National Women’s Show in late 2010, was a shambles: The firm they had hired to build the website missed the deadline, so they just put up a JPEG of the site’s layout and pasted a “Buy” button overtop a PayPal interface. Nevertheless, their first three deals brought in $10,000. Getting that early customer response was crucial, which is something Romanow believes many entrepreneurs still underestimate. “To have real people swipe their credit cards is so much more valuable than combining 18 VCs’ notes,” she says. “If you can do low-cost trials of an idea, let the market tell you if it’s good.”
Entrepreneurial MBAs get a degree and start a business simultaneously
The market was challenging: Groupon’s rise had fed a massive wave of me-too businesses, and Buytopia was a late arrival. “If I had come on Dragons’ Den, I wouldn’t have given myself money,” says Romanow. Indeed, no investor did. They used leftover funds from the caviar firm and pooled their own money to bootstrap Buytopia, which managed to sign a deal with Sears. That put it on the map and led to contracts with Cirque du Soleil and Staples. “We got all these national brands that probably should have worked with Groupon because we were persistent and we got there first,” says Romanow.
By the second year, Buytopia went on a shopping spree and bought six competitors. The partners tried to build relationships with their rivals, while closely tracking the competition’s traffic and sales data. “As people started to exit, we were the first phone call they made,” says Romanow. By the end of 2013, consolidation had shrunk Canada’s daily deal arena to a few dozen sites and, with 2.5 million subscribers and $10 million in sales, Buytopia was one of the largest.
But it was a complex business, involving operations in sales, technology, content creation, email marketing, customer service, financing and e-commerce. For the first two years, the partners didn’t pay themselves. Romanow worried about turning off her cellphone at night. Recalling the stress of those days, her tone goes quiet, as if she’s remembering a trauma. “Every day I was scared. You’re a day away from bankruptcy, markets are shifting very quickly and at any moment this could all fall apart, and I will have been the hardest-working person of all my friends and missed every birthday party, neglected my body and destroyed my personal relationships, and I will be left here with nothing.”
In those turbulent years, Romanow tried to surround herself with entrepreneurs. She started jogging with Verkindt, and those runs became therapy sessions in which they shared their deepest fears. “When you want to believe that things with low probability will happen, you have to be around people who have succeeded in that,” Romanow says. “Otherwise, you’ll have rational people every day tell you all the reasons it will fail, and you’ll start to believe them.”
The closeness among the partners made a big difference. Rather than split up the leadership functions, they tackled priorities together and traded off if one wasn’t making progress. They often disagreed, but the rule was that if two voted one way, that was it, and they moved on. “If you were listening to our conversation, you’d think it was a brutal fight, but it was just us debating,” says Melnichuk. Most important, they helped one another through crises. The experience gave them a benchmark for measuring adversity. When things seemed bleak later, they looked back on Buytopia’s early days and thought: We’ve been through far worse.

Know when to exit
Even as they laboured to grow Buytopia, the partners continued to develop new ideas. “We never called them ‘new businesses.’ We called them ‘projects,’” says Romanow. “By the time you say you’re starting a business, it feels too big to fail.” One such project was online scheduling software called Cleverfox, which stemmed from Buytopia’s experience with merchants who struggled to track customer appointments. They built it and released it, but it didn’t take.

Another venture was a mobile couponing app that allowed consumers to earn grocery rebates by photographing and emailing their receipts on selected products. It essentially bypassed retailers and connected Buytopia’s subscribers with packaged goods companies. The app launched in August 2013, and shoppers took to it immediately. But consumer products giants have long sales cycles and weren’t keen on working with a startup. The partners realized that to get SnapSaves going, they needed to gain traction in the bigger U.S. market. Cracking it would be expensive, and they’d need capital. So they travelled to Silicon Valley and Boston for meetings with investors and potential partners. They scored term sheets from three VC firms when Groupon asked to meet.
The trio expected a courtship but instead got a hazing. There were 10 people around the table, all asking questions, when Eric Lefkofsky, Groupon’s co-founder and then CEO, interrupted: “Listen, when the market changes and the retailers are pissed off that you disrupted the space, what are you gonna do?” The memory makes Melnichuk chuckle. “[Eric] made me run the gauntlet, trying to see how much shit I could take and if I could break,” he says. “After that meeting, we thought, This is done. Eric hates it.” But as the team flew home, Lefkofksy gave his lieutenants an order: “Buy the company.”
Groupon, with 50 million active customers, would give SnapSaves immediate scale and credibility in an arena already full of rivals. “If we raised money, we’d be starting from scratch,” says Melnichuk. The deal closed in June 2014, and Groupon relaunched the app in the U.S. as Snap by Groupon a few months later. Melnichuk and Romanow moved to Chicago to work as Snap heads of sales and marketing respectively, and severed active ties with Buytopia to avoid competitive conflicts of interest. (Marien stayed in Toronto and remains Buytopia’s CEO.)
Suddenly, Romanow found herself back in a corporate environment. “There was definitely a bigger-company mentality: Things took longer, [and] there was more risk aversion,” she says. But while Snap was one of Groupon’s most successful launches, it soon became apparent it was the wrong fit with the American coupon culture: People were looking for deals from retailers, not the manufacturer coupons for which the app was designed. Six months in, Groupon pivoted the app to focus on retailers. Romanow insists that was fine by her. “There was no part of me that was upset—you want your product to succeed and evolve.”
Melnichuk and Romanow were required to remain at Groupon for a year; they stayed for a year and a half. Romanow says she never envisioned a long-term commitment to the company. “Groupon isn’t mine [to build].” Besides, she was already involved in something that was calling her back home.

Take another risk
When Romanow joined Dragons’ Den last season, she was the youthful sparkplug, the most approachable of the quintet. Her ever-present Moleskine notebook in her lap, she looked like a student taking notes in class and was sometimes shouted over and patronized by the older men on the panel. Then came the gourmet poutinerie episode. Romanow was explaining why the entrepreneur’s ownership structure was untenable when Jim Treliving, the restaurant franchise master, tapped her arm. “Hold it, sweetie,” he said. “Don’t call me sweetie,” she snapped. After a frosty, tense pause, she resumed her lecture.

It made for good TV. Twitter loved it. Romanow’s sister Jackie even offered to put the retort on T-shirts. But the incident highlighted the downside of Romanow’s business-prodigy image: Her youth, combined with a diminutive, girlish demeanour, can also be a hurdle. “There’s definitely an old school–new school dynamic with me and Jim,” Romanow says. But on the show, she tries to keep her ego in check and insists on giving the entrepreneurs a genuine shot. “I’m not going to be the asshole. I was most recently on the other side, walking into VC meetings scared out of my mind. When we start interrupting people in the first two minutes and throw them off their game, that doesn’t bring out the best in them,” she says. “I remember what it was like to take those risks.”
She’s about to take those risks again. Romanow won’t reveal much about her new venture, other than to say, “I’m passionate about the future of work and fintech.” She figures she’s seasoned enough to raise her odds of success. “My ratio before was one in five. Now, it’s maybe one in four,” she laughs. But no matter how high the odds, she passionately urges entrepreneurs to try—and try young, before a mortgage and kids tie them down. You don’t need an MBA, Romanow insists. You need a GSD—the “get shit done” degree. “The worst piece of advice young people get is, ‘Do this one day, but for now you need two years in this job or it will look bad on your resumé,’” she says. “You’re not building your life for resumé readers. Just get going. You’ll figure it out.”
