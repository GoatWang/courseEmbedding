            SI Financial Group, Inc. To Acquire Newport Bancorp, Inc.
        

Mar 05, 2013





        
Willimantic, Connecticut and Newport, Rhode Island, March 5, 2013 — SI Financial Group, Inc. (Nasdaq: SIFI), the holding company for   Savings Institute Bank and Trust Company, and Newport Bancorp, Inc.   (Nasdaq: NFSB), the holding company for Newport Federal Savings Bank,   today announced the execution of a definitive merger agreement pursuant   to which SI Financial Group will acquire Newport Bancorp.  The   acquisition will add to SI Financial Group approximately $449.4 million   in assets, $355.0 million in loans and $289.7 million in deposits before   acquisition accounting adjustments.  The transaction will expand SI   Financial Group’s presence into Newport and Washington Counties in Rhode   Island, where Newport Federal Savings Bank operates five full-service   banking offices, and will add one branch in Stonington, Connecticut. Under the terms of the merger agreement, stockholders of Newport   Bancorp will have the right to elect to receive either $17.55 in cash or   1.5129 shares of SI Financial Group common stock in exchange for each   share of Newport Bancorp held by them, subject to proration procedures   so that 50 percent of the outstanding Newport Bancorp common shares is   converted into SI Financial Group common stock and the balance is   converted into the cash consideration.  Based upon SI Financial Group’s   five-day average closing price of $11.60 on March 4, 2013, the   transaction is valued at $17.55 per share, or approximately $61.3   million in the aggregate. The transaction is intended to qualify as a   tax-free reorganization for federal income tax purposes.  SI Financial   Group expects the transaction to be immediately accretive to its   earnings per share, excluding one-time transaction expenses.  The   transaction represents 116% of Newport Bancorp’s tangible book value and   a core deposit premium of 3.0% at December 31, 2012. Rheo A. Brouillard, President and Chief Executive   Officer of SI Financial Group, stated, “We are very pleased to announce   our plans to partner with Newport Bancorp.  This combination presents a   tremendous opportunity for us to expand our presence into Rhode Island   and partner with such a well managed, like-minded banking company. Like   us, Newport Bancorp has deep roots in the communities it serves, and we   look forward to working with the staff that its customers have come to   know and trust and to introduce our brand of banking to this region,   including wealth management, brokerage and a broader array of commercial   loan products. We believe the strategic value of this transaction will   enhance our franchise and add value to our stockholders’ investment.  We   are excited about the future of our combined company.” “We feel that this merger is an excellent opportunity for our   customers and the markets we serve,” said Kevin M. McCarthy, President   and Chief Executive Officer of Newport Bancorp.  “Partnering with   Savings Institute Bank and Trust Company will allow us to continue   providing our customers with a high level of personalized service, an   expanded menu of products and continued local decision-making while   preserving the home town banking culture our communities value.” The transaction, which has been unanimously approved   by the board of directors of both SI Financial Group and Newport   Bancorp, is expected to close in the third quarter of 2013.  The   transaction is subject to certain conditions, including the approval by   SI Financial Group’s and Newport Bancorp’s stockholders and customary   regulatory approvals. Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, a Stifel Company, served as financial   advisor to SI Financial Group and Kilpatrick Townsend & Stockton LLP   acted as SI Financial Group’s legal counsel. In addition, both Keefe,   Bruyette & Woods, a Stifel Company, and Northeast Capital &   Advisory, Inc. rendered fairness opinions to SI Financial Group in   connection with the transaction.

SI Financial Group Foundation
The Foundation provides funding to support charitable causes within the bank’s market areas in CT and RI.
 Apply









The   SI Financial Group Foundation, Inc. was established in 2005 by SI   Financial Group, Inc., the parent company of the Savings Institute Bank   & Trust Co. in Willimantic, CT. These causes we support are selected   based on several criteria, including their ability to enhance the   quality of life for the constituencies they serve. In September   2013, Savings Institute Bank & Trust acquired NewportFed and the   NewportFed Charitable Foundation became a completely independent   organization. Contact the NewportFed Charitable Foundation to obtain more information or submit a grant request. Eligibility & Restrictions Federally   recognized, under Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code,   organizations and most charitable, educational and civic institutions   serving the Communities where we do business are eligible for our   grants. In general, organizations that are funded by taxpayers are a   lower priority, although special projects and programs facilitated by   nonprofit organizations working within municipalities are considered. In   some cases, with the SIFG Foundation’s prior approval, nonprofit   organizations that do not have a tax-exempt letter may submit a proposal   under a sponsoring tax-exempt organization that will assume expenditure   responsibility for the duration of the project. The applying   organization must provide the SIFG Foundation with the sponsoring   organization’s tax exempt letter and its written assurance that it will   oversee the project. Generally, no grants will be awarded to   individuals; political or fraternal organizations; religious   institutions (unless the program benefits the community at large);   political or lobbying activities. In most cases, support is given for a   period of one year, and organizations must reapply for a grant each year   they wish to be considered for additional support.  View Grant Guidelines Funding Priorities  Our   first priority is to improve life in the CT and RI communities served   by Savings Institute Bank & Trust. We are proud to support nonprofit   organizations that provide the following:  Community development via affordable housing, job training and programs that assist the economically disadvantaged Basic human services and health programs for those considered at risk or in need Educational projects that expand learning beyond the classroom and increase literacy Cultural and artistic enrichment programs that build audiences for the arts, especially among underserved populations Environmental projects that help preserve, protect and revitalize our natural resources  Like   most foundations, we receive far more requests for support than we can   approve. We encourage all agencies, whether they receive a grant or not,   to keep us informed of their activities. This proves to be very helpful   for future reviews and considerations for grant dollars. Please call the Foundation at (860) 456-6509 to discuss any questions related to your request.

The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.
