This report is not for commercial use. Thorough reviews have been conducted to assure this data accurately reflects disclosures. However for a complete and definitive understanding of the pay practices of any company, users should refer directly to the actual, complete proxy statement. 
Use of Data / Disclaimer
The information shown here is a reporting of information included in the company's proxy statement. The proxy statement includes footnotes and explanations of this information plus other information that is pertinent in assessing the overall value and appropriateness of the compensation information. For those interested in conducting a detailed compensation analysis, we recommend that you review the entire proxy statement. You may retrieve the full proxy statement by going to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) website at www.sec.gov and entering the company's name and then looking in the first column for an entry of "Form DEF 14A" (or any similar code). You may also find the annual proxy statement by going directly to the company's website.
What is a proxy statement?
A proxy statement (or "proxy") is a form that every publicly traded U.S. company is required to file with the U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) within 120 days after the end of its fiscal year. The proxy must be sent to every shareholder in advance of the company's annual shareholders meeting. All proxy statements are public filings made available to the general public by the SEC.
The proxy statement's main purpose is to alert shareholders to the annual meeting and provide them information about the issues that will be voted on during the annual meeting, including decisions such as electing directors, ratifying the selection of auditors, and other shareholder-related decisions, including shareholder-initiated initiatives. Also, proxies must disclose specific detailed information regarding the pay practices for certain executives.

 RADNOR, Pa. -- Airgas, Inc. (NYSE:ARG), the nation's largest
distributor of industrial, specialty, and medical gases and related
products, today announced that Roger F. Millay will resign as senior
vice president and chief financial officer, effective September 20,
2006. He has accepted an appointment as senior executive vice president
and CFO of Discovery Communications, Inc., the parent company of the
Discovery Channel, the Learning Channel (TLC), and Animal Planet, among
others.

 Robert M. McLaughlin, vice president - controller, will take over
as interim CFO for Airgas upon Millay's resignation while a search
for a permanent replacement is conducted.

 "Roger leaves Airgas at the top of his game, having been named
by Chemical Week as its Senior Financial Officer (SFO) of the Year just
last month," said Airgas Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Peter
McCausland. "In almost seven years as Airgas' CFO, Roger has
helped build a strong financial team, aligned around clear metrics,
which will endure as we move forward. We wish him all the best in his
new role."

 McLaughlin has been vice president and controller for Airgas since
June 2001 and, among other accomplishments, he has led the
Company's accounting systems conversion to Oracle and the
development of a Central Accounting Group.

 Prior to joining Airgas, McLaughlin had served as vice
president-finance for Asbury Automotive Group, an automotive retailer,
and before that as vice president of finance and in other financial
management roles with Unisource Worldwide, Inc., an international paper
and industrial supply distribution company. McLaughlin, a Certified
Public Accountant, began his career with Ernst & Young in 1979. He
earned his bachelor's degree in accounting from the University of
Dayton.

 "While this is a great new opportunity for me, I will miss the
people here at Airgas," said Millay. "I know Bob and the rest
of the finance organization are well-positioned to carry forward with
everything we have built in the past few years. This has been a
rewarding experience to work for a great company, which I believe will
continue to lead."

 Millay joined Airgas in November 1999 as senior vice president and
chief financial officer. Prior to joining Airgas, he was senior vice
president and CFO at Transport International Pool, a leasing and
equipment management division of General Electric Capital Corporation.
Other positions held during his 12-year career at GE included chief
financial officer roles at GE Capital Mexico and Colony Advisors, Inc.,
a GE Capital joint venture. Prior to joining GE in 1987, he held
positions at Citicorp and Arthur Young & Company.
