Dell EMC (EMC Corporation until 2016) is an American multinational corporation headquartered in Hopkinton, Massachusetts, United States.[2][3] Dell EMC sells data storage, information security, virtualization, analytics, cloud computing and other products and services that enable organizations to store, manage, protect, and analyze data. Dell EMC's target markets include large companies and small- and medium-sized businesses across various vertical markets.[4][5] The company's stock (as EMC Corporation) was added to the New York Stock Exchange on April 6, 1986,[6] and was also listed on the S&P 500 index.
EMC had over 70,000 employees and was the world’s largest provider of data-storage systems by market share, competing against NetApp, IBM, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, and Hitachi Data Systems (arranged in descending order of external data-storage market share).[7] Joseph M. Tucci had served as EMC's chief executive since January 2001 and chairman of the board of directors since January 2006; he joined the company in 2000 as president and chief operating officer.[8] Tucci was also chairman of the board of VMware Corporation[8] and chairman of the board of Pivotal Software, which are partially owned by EMC.[9] On October 12, 2015, Dell Inc. announced that it would acquire EMC in a cash-and-stock deal valued at $67 billion—the largest-ever acquisition in the technology industry.[10][11][12] The merger closed on September 7, 2016. EMC has been renamed to Dell EMC as a result of the merger.[13]The derivation of the former name EMC is Egan, Marino, Connolly & Curley. The second C implied in the former EMC2 logo refers to "Corporation".

History[edit]




Richard Egan, co-founder of EMC Corporation


EMC, founded in 1979 by Richard Egan, Roger Marino and Jack Curley (the E, M and C in EMC),[14] introduced its first 64-kilobyte memory boards for the Prime Computer in 1981[15][16] and continued with the development of memory boards for other computer types. In the mid-1980s the company expanded beyond memory to other computer data storage types and networked storage platforms. EMC began shipping its flagship product, the Symmetrix, in 1990. Symmetrix was the main reason for EMC's rapid growth in the 1990s, both in size and value, from a company valued in the hundreds of millions of dollars to a multi-billion company.[17]
Michael Ruettgers joined EMC in 1988 and served as CEO from 1992 until January 2001.[18] Under Ruettgers’ leadership, EMC revenues grew from $120 million to nearly $9 billion 10 years later, and the company shifted its focus from memory boards to storage systems.[19] Ruettgers was named one of BusinessWeek's "World's Top 25 Executives"; one of the "Best Chief Executive Officers in America" by Worth magazine; and one of Network World's "25 Most Powerful People in Networking".[19]
In 2001, Joe Tucci was named chief executive officer of EMC.[20] He has been credited with transforming EMC's business model from a focus on high-end storage platforms to a portfolio of platforms, software, and services that enable organizations to deliver IT as a service through cloud computing.[20] Under Tucci's leadership, EMC grew to $21.7 billion in revenues in 2012.[21]
In 2009, EMC and Cisco, with investments from VMware and Intel, formed a joint venture called VCE to develop products and services for the converged infrastructure and cloud computing markets.[22]
EMC announced its 450,000 square foot Center of Excellence (COE) in Durham, North Carolina in 2011.[23] The COE houses a virtualized data center and includes 130,000 square feet of global research and development labs. The company also has COEs in India, China, Egypt, Israel, Ireland, Russia and Draper, Utah, USA which perform engineering, research and development, customer, and translation services for EMC business units.[23]
In 2013, EMC launched a new company named Pivotal.[24] Led by Paul Maritz, the organization combines technologies from VMware and EMC and is focused on delivering Platform-as-a-Service products.[24]
EMC has been growing in part through aggressively making acquisitions of small companies, and starting to bring those products to market.[25]
Acquisition by Dell[edit]




EMC Corporation logo prior to merger


On October 12, 2015, Dell Inc. announced its intent to acquire EMC in a cash-and-stock deal valued at $67 billion, which has been considered the largest-ever acquisition in the technology sector. Dell CEO Michael Dell explained that the purchase was meant to "evolve the company into the most relevant areas where IT is moving", combining Dell's enterprise server, personal computer, and mobile businesses with EMC's enterprise storage business. The deal is structured so that Dell will pay $24.05 per share of EMC, and $9.05 per share of tracking stock in VMware.[26][27][28]
Products and services[edit]
In addition to those of the majority-owned VMware and Pivotal companies, EMC sells products and services designed to allow IT departments to move to a cloud computing model and to analyze big data.

Big data projects[edit]
In 2012, EMC sponsored The Human Face of Big Data,[99] a globally crowd-sourced media project focusing on the ability to collect, analyze, triangulate and visualize vast amounts of data in real time. The Human Face of Big Data, produced by Rick Smolan and Jennifer Erwitt, includes “a number of fascinating stories…(that) represent some of the most innovative applications of data that are shaping our future.”[100]
EMC sponsors The Digital Universe, a study by IDC “measuring and characterizing all the digital data created, replicated, and consumed worldwide in a single year.”[101] The Digital Universe 2012 report anticipates that "during the next eight years, the amount of digital data produced will exceed 40 zettabytes, which is the equivalent of 5,200 GB of data for every man, woman and child on Earth. To hit that figure, all data is expected to double every two years through 2020."[102]
Recognition and awards[edit]
In 2015, EMC was ranked no. 2 on Fortune’s list of the World’s Most Admired Computer Companies for the fifth consecutive year.[103] EMC was included on the 2012 Thomson Reuters Top 100 Global Innovators list.[104] In 2013, four EMC and RSA channel executives were named CRN’s 2013 Channel Chiefs for “trying to make sure their company’s partners succeed."[105]
EMC has ranked on several global best places to work lists. EMC was ranked the 19th Best Multinational Workplace in Europe by Great Places to Work in 2012.[106] EMC was included on Crain’s 2012 Best Places to Work in New York City,[107] The Boston Globe’s 2012 Top Places to Work,[108] and Washington's Best Workplaces 2012.[109] EMC has also been recognized for diversity and inclusion as one of Careers & the disABLED Magazine’s 2013 Top 50 employers[110] and received a score of 100 on the Human Rights Campaign 2013 Corporate Equality Index.[111]
Corporate responsibility and sustainability[edit]
EMC supports a variety of corporate responsibility initiatives around the world, and in 2012 EMC ranked 47th on Corporate Responsibility Magazine's 100 Best Corporate Citizens List.[112] EMC was named the 43rd Greenest Company Globally on Newsweek’s Green Rankings 2012.[113] EMC sponsors programs in the United States that strive to improve education for Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM).[114] More than 80,000 students have taken EMC Information Storage and Management courses since the program launched in 2006.[115]
Collaboration with colleges and universities[edit]
EMC's Academic Alliance program, a collaboration with colleges and universities worldwide, sells curriculum-based education on technology topics such as virtualization, cloud computing, big data analytics, and information storage and management.[116] The global program is geared towards arming students with the knowledge necessary to differentiate themselves in the job market and improve their competitive advantage.[117]
Collaboration with NSA[edit]
RSA Security, the security division of EMC, has received widespread criticism for accepting $10 million in a secret deal with NSA in 2004 to make Dual_EC_DRBG the default cryptographically secure pseudorandom number generator in its prominent BSAFE cryptography library, and for continuing to use it until 2013.[118] Dual_EC_DRBG had been suspected since 2007 of containing a kleptographic backdoor designed by NSA. This was confirmed in a 2013 New York Times article following the Snowden leak.[119] The standard FIPS version of Dual_EC_DRBG (which RSA Security implemented) was theoretically and empirically shown to be insecure in 2006 and 2007 (even aside from the backdoor); following discoveries by Dan Shumow and Niels Ferguson in 2007, prominent security expert Bruce Schneier published an article in Wired magazine titled "Did NSA Put a Secret Backdoor in New Encryption Standard?".[120] Though Dual_EC_DRBG was highly suspect after 2007, its usage in EMC's BSAFE was not widely known until the 2013 New York Times article brought it back into the spotlight. At the 2014 RSA Conference, RSA Security Executive Chairman Art Coviello defended RSA Security's choice to keep using Dual_EC_DRBG until NIST issued new guidance in 2013. He claimed that NIST only issued the guidance stop using the algorithm "when it became possible that concerns raised in 2007 might have merit".[121]

Dell EMC (EMC Corporation until 2016) is an American multinational corporation headquartered in Hopkinton, Massachusetts, United States.[2][3] Dell EMC sells data storage, information security, virtualization, analytics, cloud computing and other products and services that enable organizations to store, manage, protect, and analyze data. Dell EMC's target markets include large companies and small- and medium-sized businesses across various vertical markets.[4][5] The company's stock (as EMC Corporation) was added to the New York Stock Exchange on April 6, 1986,[6] and was also listed on the S&P 500 index.
EMC had over 70,000 employees and was the world’s largest provider of data-storage systems by market share, competing against NetApp, IBM, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, and Hitachi Data Systems (arranged in descending order of external data-storage market share).[7] Joseph M. Tucci had served as EMC's chief executive since January 2001 and chairman of the board of directors since January 2006; he joined the company in 2000 as president and chief operating officer.[8] Tucci was also chairman of the board of VMware Corporation[8] and chairman of the board of Pivotal Software, which are partially owned by EMC.[9] On October 12, 2015, Dell Inc. announced that it would acquire EMC in a cash-and-stock deal valued at $67 billion—the largest-ever acquisition in the technology industry.[10][11][12] The merger closed on September 7, 2016. EMC has been renamed to Dell EMC as a result of the merger.[13]The derivation of the former name EMC is Egan, Marino, Connolly & Curley. The second C implied in the former EMC2 logo refers to "Corporation".

History[edit]




Richard Egan, co-founder of EMC Corporation


EMC, founded in 1979 by Richard Egan, Roger Marino and Jack Curley (the E, M and C in EMC),[14] introduced its first 64-kilobyte memory boards for the Prime Computer in 1981[15][16] and continued with the development of memory boards for other computer types. In the mid-1980s the company expanded beyond memory to other computer data storage types and networked storage platforms. EMC began shipping its flagship product, the Symmetrix, in 1990. Symmetrix was the main reason for EMC's rapid growth in the 1990s, both in size and value, from a company valued in the hundreds of millions of dollars to a multi-billion company.[17]
Michael Ruettgers joined EMC in 1988 and served as CEO from 1992 until January 2001.[18] Under Ruettgers’ leadership, EMC revenues grew from $120 million to nearly $9 billion 10 years later, and the company shifted its focus from memory boards to storage systems.[19] Ruettgers was named one of BusinessWeek's "World's Top 25 Executives"; one of the "Best Chief Executive Officers in America" by Worth magazine; and one of Network World's "25 Most Powerful People in Networking".[19]
In 2001, Joe Tucci was named chief executive officer of EMC.[20] He has been credited with transforming EMC's business model from a focus on high-end storage platforms to a portfolio of platforms, software, and services that enable organizations to deliver IT as a service through cloud computing.[20] Under Tucci's leadership, EMC grew to $21.7 billion in revenues in 2012.[21]
In 2009, EMC and Cisco, with investments from VMware and Intel, formed a joint venture called VCE to develop products and services for the converged infrastructure and cloud computing markets.[22]
EMC announced its 450,000 square foot Center of Excellence (COE) in Durham, North Carolina in 2011.[23] The COE houses a virtualized data center and includes 130,000 square feet of global research and development labs. The company also has COEs in India, China, Egypt, Israel, Ireland, Russia and Draper, Utah, USA which perform engineering, research and development, customer, and translation services for EMC business units.[23]
In 2013, EMC launched a new company named Pivotal.[24] Led by Paul Maritz, the organization combines technologies from VMware and EMC and is focused on delivering Platform-as-a-Service products.[24]
EMC has been growing in part through aggressively making acquisitions of small companies, and starting to bring those products to market.[25]
Acquisition by Dell[edit]

On October 12, 2015, Dell Inc. announced its intent to acquire EMC in a cash-and-stock deal valued at $67 billion, which has been considered the largest-ever acquisition in the technology sector. Dell CEO Michael Dell explained that the purchase was meant to "evolve the company into the most relevant areas where IT is moving", combining Dell's enterprise server, personal computer, and mobile businesses with EMC's enterprise storage business. The deal is structured so that Dell will pay $24.05 per share of EMC, and $9.05 per share of tracking stock in VMware.[26][27][28]
Products and services[edit]
In addition to those of the majority-owned VMware and Pivotal companies, EMC sells products and services designed to allow IT departments to move to a cloud computing model and to analyze big data.

Big data projects[edit]
In 2012, EMC sponsored The Human Face of Big Data,[99] a globally crowd-sourced media project focusing on the ability to collect, analyze, triangulate and visualize vast amounts of data in real time. The Human Face of Big Data, produced by Rick Smolan and Jennifer Erwitt, includes “a number of fascinating stories…(that) represent some of the most innovative applications of data that are shaping our future.”[100]
EMC sponsors The Digital Universe, a study by IDC “measuring and characterizing all the digital data created, replicated, and consumed worldwide in a single year.”[101] The Digital Universe 2012 report anticipates that "during the next eight years, the amount of digital data produced will exceed 40 zettabytes, which is the equivalent of 5,200 GB of data for every man, woman and child on Earth. To hit that figure, all data is expected to double every two years through 2020."[102]
Recognition and awards[edit]
In 2015, EMC was ranked no. 2 on Fortune’s list of the World’s Most Admired Computer Companies for the fifth consecutive year.[103] EMC was included on the 2012 Thomson Reuters Top 100 Global Innovators list.[104] In 2013, four EMC and RSA channel executives were named CRN’s 2013 Channel Chiefs for “trying to make sure their company’s partners succeed."[105]
EMC has ranked on several global best places to work lists. EMC was ranked the 19th Best Multinational Workplace in Europe by Great Places to Work in 2012.[106] EMC was included on Crain’s 2012 Best Places to Work in New York City,[107] The Boston Globe’s 2012 Top Places to Work,[108] and Washington's Best Workplaces 2012.[109] EMC has also been recognized for diversity and inclusion as one of Careers & the disABLED Magazine’s 2013 Top 50 employers[110] and received a score of 100 on the Human Rights Campaign 2013 Corporate Equality Index.[111]
Corporate responsibility and sustainability[edit]
EMC supports a variety of corporate responsibility initiatives around the world, and in 2012 EMC ranked 47th on Corporate Responsibility Magazine's 100 Best Corporate Citizens List.[112] EMC was named the 43rd Greenest Company Globally on Newsweek’s Green Rankings 2012.[113] EMC sponsors programs in the United States that strive to improve education for Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM).[114] More than 80,000 students have taken EMC Information Storage and Management courses since the program launched in 2006.[115]
Collaboration with colleges and universities[edit]
EMC's Academic Alliance program, a collaboration with colleges and universities worldwide, sells curriculum-based education on technology topics such as virtualization, cloud computing, big data analytics, and information storage and management.[116] The global program is geared towards arming students with the knowledge necessary to differentiate themselves in the job market and improve their competitive advantage.[117]
Collaboration with NSA[edit]
RSA Security, the security division of EMC, has received widespread criticism for accepting $10 million in a secret deal with NSA in 2004 to make Dual_EC_DRBG the default cryptographically secure pseudorandom number generator in its prominent BSAFE cryptography library, and for continuing to use it until 2013.[118] Dual_EC_DRBG had been suspected since 2007 of containing a kleptographic backdoor designed by NSA. This was confirmed in a 2013 New York Times article following the Snowden leak.[119] The standard FIPS version of Dual_EC_DRBG (which RSA Security implemented) was theoretically and empirically shown to be insecure in 2006 and 2007 (even aside from the backdoor); following discoveries by Dan Shumow and Niels Ferguson in 2007, prominent security expert Bruce Schneier published an article in Wired magazine titled "Did NSA Put a Secret Backdoor in New Encryption Standard?".[120] Though Dual_EC_DRBG was highly suspect after 2007, its usage in EMC's BSAFE was not widely known until the 2013 New York Times article brought it back into the spotlight. At the 2014 RSA Conference, RSA Security Executive Chairman Art Coviello defended RSA Security's choice to keep using Dual_EC_DRBG until NIST issued new guidance in 2013. He claimed that NIST only issued the guidance stop using the algorithm "when it became possible that concerns raised in 2007 might have merit".[121]

On February 16, 2016, security researchers publicly disclosed a vulnerability in the Linux glibc library, which is commonly found in Linux-based operating systems. The glibc DNS client side resolver is vulnerable to a stack-based buffer overflow when the getaddrinfo() library function is used (CVE-2015-7547). A remote attacker could create specially crafted DNS responses, which could cause the library to crash or potentially execute code with the permissions of the user running the library.
Following the disclosure of this vulnerability, we immediately initiated a review of EMC Information Infrastructure and RSA products to assess any potential impact. (more…)

Building Trust through Product Security - December 6, 2013






The launch last week of the IEEE Center for Secure Design is an opportunity to remind the industry of the prominent role of secure design in building secure IT products.
Security engineering requires three main technical activities: Secure design, secure coding and security testing. Much of emphasis has been put by the industry on secure coding and security testing and much less on secure design. That is unfortunate. (more…)

The following post was co-authored with Steve Lipner from Microsoft and originally posted on the SAFECode blog.
Customers frequently ask all software developers – including SAFECode members – how they can be confident in the security of the software they acquire. We are well aware that acquired software can introduce new vulnerabilities into IT environments and that risk managers need a method for assessing the security of the IT products they procure and the impact those products may have on the organization’s risk posture.

Dell EMC (EMC Corporation until 2016) is an American multinational corporation headquartered in Hopkinton, Massachusetts, United States.[2][3] Dell EMC sells data storage, information security, virtualization, analytics, cloud computing and other products and services that enable organizations to store, manage, protect, and analyze data. Dell EMC's target markets include large companies and small- and medium-sized businesses across various vertical markets.[4][5] The company's stock (as EMC Corporation) was added to the New York Stock Exchange on April 6, 1986,[6] and was also listed on the S&P 500 index.
EMC had over 70,000 employees and was the world’s largest provider of data-storage systems by market share, competing against NetApp, IBM, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, and Hitachi Data Systems (arranged in descending order of external data-storage market share).[7] Joseph M. Tucci had served as EMC's chief executive since January 2001 and chairman of the board of directors since January 2006; he joined the company in 2000 as president and chief operating officer.[8] Tucci was also chairman of the board of VMware Corporation[8] and chairman of the board of Pivotal Software, which are partially owned by EMC.[9] On October 12, 2015, Dell Inc. announced that it would acquire EMC in a cash-and-stock deal valued at $67 billion—the largest-ever acquisition in the technology industry.[10][11][12] The merger closed on September 7, 2016. EMC has been renamed to Dell EMC as a result of the merger.[13]The derivation of the former name EMC is Egan, Marino, Connolly & Curley. The second C implied in the former EMC2 logo refers to "Corporation".

History[edit]




Richard Egan, co-founder of EMC Corporation


EMC, founded in 1979 by Richard Egan, Roger Marino and Jack Curley (the E, M and C in EMC),[14] introduced its first 64-kilobyte memory boards for the Prime Computer in 1981[15][16] and continued with the development of memory boards for other computer types. In the mid-1980s the company expanded beyond memory to other computer data storage types and networked storage platforms. EMC began shipping its flagship product, the Symmetrix, in 1990. Symmetrix was the main reason for EMC's rapid growth in the 1990s, both in size and value, from a company valued in the hundreds of millions of dollars to a multi-billion company.[17]
Michael Ruettgers joined EMC in 1988 and served as CEO from 1992 until January 2001.[18] Under Ruettgers’ leadership, EMC revenues grew from $120 million to nearly $9 billion 10 years later, and the company shifted its focus from memory boards to storage systems.[19] Ruettgers was named one of BusinessWeek's "World's Top 25 Executives"; one of the "Best Chief Executive Officers in America" by Worth magazine; and one of Network World's "25 Most Powerful People in Networking".[19]
In 2001, Joe Tucci was named chief executive officer of EMC.[20] He has been credited with transforming EMC's business model from a focus on high-end storage platforms to a portfolio of platforms, software, and services that enable organizations to deliver IT as a service through cloud computing.[20] Under Tucci's leadership, EMC grew to $21.7 billion in revenues in 2012.[21]
In 2009, EMC and Cisco, with investments from VMware and Intel, formed a joint venture called VCE to develop products and services for the converged infrastructure and cloud computing markets.[22]
EMC announced its 450,000 square foot Center of Excellence (COE) in Durham, North Carolina in 2011.[23] The COE houses a virtualized data center and includes 130,000 square feet of global research and development labs. The company also has COEs in India, China, Egypt, Israel, Ireland, Russia and Draper, Utah, USA which perform engineering, research and development, customer, and translation services for EMC business units.[23]
In 2013, EMC launched a new company named Pivotal.[24] Led by Paul Maritz, the organization combines technologies from VMware and EMC and is focused on delivering Platform-as-a-Service products.[24]
EMC has been growing in part through aggressively making acquisitions of small companies, and starting to bring those products to market.[25]
Acquisition by Dell[edit]




EMC Corporation logo prior to merger


On October 12, 2015, Dell Inc. announced its intent to acquire EMC in a cash-and-stock deal valued at $67 billion, which has been considered the largest-ever acquisition in the technology sector. Dell CEO Michael Dell explained that the purchase was meant to "evolve the company into the most relevant areas where IT is moving", combining Dell's enterprise server, personal computer, and mobile businesses with EMC's enterprise storage business. The deal is structured so that Dell will pay $24.05 per share of EMC, and $9.05 per share of tracking stock in VMware.[26][27][28]
Products and services[edit]
In addition to those of the majority-owned VMware and Pivotal companies, EMC sells products and services designed to allow IT departments to move to a cloud computing model and to analyze big data.

Big data projects[edit]
In 2012, EMC sponsored The Human Face of Big Data,[99] a globally crowd-sourced media project focusing on the ability to collect, analyze, triangulate and visualize vast amounts of data in real time. The Human Face of Big Data, produced by Rick Smolan and Jennifer Erwitt, includes “a number of fascinating stories…(that) represent some of the most innovative applications of data that are shaping our future.”[100]
EMC sponsors The Digital Universe, a study by IDC “measuring and characterizing all the digital data created, replicated, and consumed worldwide in a single year.”[101] The Digital Universe 2012 report anticipates that "during the next eight years, the amount of digital data produced will exceed 40 zettabytes, which is the equivalent of 5,200 GB of data for every man, woman and child on Earth. To hit that figure, all data is expected to double every two years through 2020."[102]
Recognition and awards[edit]
In 2015, EMC was ranked no. 2 on Fortune’s list of the World’s Most Admired Computer Companies for the fifth consecutive year.[103] EMC was included on the 2012 Thomson Reuters Top 100 Global Innovators list.[104] In 2013, four EMC and RSA channel executives were named CRN’s 2013 Channel Chiefs for “trying to make sure their company’s partners succeed."[105]
EMC has ranked on several global best places to work lists. EMC was ranked the 19th Best Multinational Workplace in Europe by Great Places to Work in 2012.[106] EMC was included on Crain’s 2012 Best Places to Work in New York City,[107] The Boston Globe’s 2012 Top Places to Work,[108] and Washington's Best Workplaces 2012.[109] EMC has also been recognized for diversity and inclusion as one of Careers & the disABLED Magazine’s 2013 Top 50 employers[110] and received a score of 100 on the Human Rights Campaign 2013 Corporate Equality Index.[111]
Corporate responsibility and sustainability[edit]
EMC supports a variety of corporate responsibility initiatives around the world, and in 2012 EMC ranked 47th on Corporate Responsibility Magazine's 100 Best Corporate Citizens List.[112] EMC was named the 43rd Greenest Company Globally on Newsweek’s Green Rankings 2012.[113] EMC sponsors programs in the United States that strive to improve education for Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM).[114] More than 80,000 students have taken EMC Information Storage and Management courses since the program launched in 2006.[115]
Collaboration with colleges and universities[edit]
EMC's Academic Alliance program, a collaboration with colleges and universities worldwide, sells curriculum-based education on technology topics such as virtualization, cloud computing, big data analytics, and information storage and management.[116] The global program is geared towards arming students with the knowledge necessary to differentiate themselves in the job market and improve their competitive advantage.[117]
Collaboration with NSA[edit]
RSA Security, the security division of EMC, has received widespread criticism for accepting $10 million in a secret deal with NSA in 2004 to make Dual_EC_DRBG the default cryptographically secure pseudorandom number generator in its prominent BSAFE cryptography library, and for continuing to use it until 2013.[118] Dual_EC_DRBG had been suspected since 2007 of containing a kleptographic backdoor designed by NSA. This was confirmed in a 2013 New York Times article following the Snowden leak.[119] The standard FIPS version of Dual_EC_DRBG (which RSA Security implemented) was theoretically and empirically shown to be insecure in 2006 and 2007 (even aside from the backdoor); following discoveries by Dan Shumow and Niels Ferguson in 2007, prominent security expert Bruce Schneier published an article in Wired magazine titled "Did NSA Put a Secret Backdoor in New Encryption Standard?".[120] Though Dual_EC_DRBG was highly suspect after 2007, its usage in EMC's BSAFE was not widely known until the 2013 New York Times article brought it back into the spotlight. At the 2014 RSA Conference, RSA Security Executive Chairman Art Coviello defended RSA Security's choice to keep using Dual_EC_DRBG until NIST issued new guidance in 2013. He claimed that NIST only issued the guidance stop using the algorithm "when it became possible that concerns raised in 2007 might have merit".[121]

Where applicable, a project is considered as such until the end of construction and ramp-up to full capacity (with the exception of mining projects, where the date of commissioning signifies the end of the project). Projects must have a:  a) Start date b) Estimate for completion c) Initial investment estimate  Data For state-owned projects, initial information about the start date and estimates for completion and investment are taken from original signed contracts, along with addendums and annexes. If original contracts cannot be obtained, information is taken from public documents, presentations, news articles from BNamericas archives, and external sources. In cases where contracts are subject to approval by legislators, the start date is the date of the law or legislative approval. In the case of private projects, information is taken from public sources, such as stock exchange filings, annual reports, company presentations, third party research and press releases. In judging the timing of investment decisions for private projects, great care was taken to differentiate between large projects receiving environmental approval and proceeding directly to construction, and smaller projects where the investment decision hinges on securing financing. Best care is taken to ensure that recorded data is correct at the time of entry and that each entry is backed with a relevant source. The greatest care possible was taken to ensure consistency of information in order make a like-for-like comparison in project costs. Insofar as the figures rely on disclosure by the organization or company responsible, the figures can be considered to be conservative in nature. No attempt was made to adjust figures for inflation during the course of research or for consideration of the time value of money. Validation In the case of state-owned projects, validation is carried out where possible with either a member of the consortium, EPC contractor, a relevant state agency or advisors to either party. Currency Projects costs are measured in US dollars. Where project costs are measured in a local currency, amounts are converted to US dollars at the date of the relevant announcement, signature or report.
