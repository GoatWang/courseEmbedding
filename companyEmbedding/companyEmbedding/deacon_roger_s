Hide this message.QuoraSign In John Deacon Queen (band) RetirementWhy did John Deacon retire from any dealings with Queen?He had no part in the creation of We Will Rock You and had nothing to do with the reunion tour.UpdateCancelPromoted by Better MortgageHow much house can I afford?Get an estimate of how much house you can afford with Better Mortgage's 3-minute pre-approval.Learn More at better.comAnswer Wiki11 Answers  Todd MathersAnswered 267w agoBrian and Roger have been asked this question a lot and they've always been kind of evasive in their answers, but there have been snippets. I think its a combination of factors. He does have a number of kids (I think it's actually 6) so I'm sure he wanted to spend more time with them, but the other vibe I've picked up on in interviews with Brian and Roger is that John was not really into the celebrity lifestyle and not really much of a people person. If you look at old footage of the band, he rarely spoke in interviews and even when he did, he did not seem all that comfortable. On stage, he stuck to the background and stayed close to Roger's drumkit most of the time. I don't ever recall seeing him speak to the audience on stage, except at the Freddie Mercury tribute concert, where he look terrified. In the book recently written by Peter Hince (Freddie's and John's roadie) he made reference to John getting more and more agitated on the 1986 tour and at the end of one show throwing his bass in anger at one of the amps. So my guess is he retired for the reasons mentioned above plus the fact that he has tons of money and really didn't want to keep living in high profile world that he really didn't feel all that comfortable in.66.4k Views · 15 UpvotesPromoted by qplumFree investment planning.Design your plan before investing.Learn More at qplum.coRelated QuestionsMore Answers BelowHow did Queen members split/share their incomes?Why do people keep talking about Freddie Mercury and Brian May but never mention John Deacon and Roger Taylor? What are some interesting facts...Does John Deacon still write music?Would John Deacon have continued with Queen had Freddie Mercury not died?Is Queen's John Deacon underrated?  Eva Sanchez, former WriterAnswered 22w agoAs many have noted John Deacon had a very close relationship with Freddie Mercury. Queen was Freddie Mercury although the other three members were very talented. But it was Freddie's song writing that propelled Queen to International fame. And it was Freddie's vibrant and electric performances that captured fans around the world. Once Freddie died, the life and breath was gone from Queen. John recognized this and made a personal choice that honored his good friend, Freddie Mercury, and made good professional sense. No one can replace Freddie, no matter how many front men Queen tries. They are currently touring with Adam Lambert and personally, I can't even watch one song or video with Lambert. It just doesn't seem right to lose someone of Freddie's caliber, class, and charisma and replace him with someone that lacks the qualities that made Mercury the best male vocalist and performer of all time. Who can top that or at least equal that and stand in Freddie's place singing his music. I wish Brian May could acknowledge that Queen ended when the King of Queen left us. We his true fans prefer to hear his records and see his music videos that are performed by Freddie Mercury, otherwise it's just not worth seeing someone who performs several notches down from Freddie's ability. It's impossible to replace or substitute thus gorgeous beautiful man with a voice of gold! We love You Freddie, no one else will do!3.7k Views · 8 Upvotes  Paloma Pomaraga, I'm a Queen Oficial Fans Club Member and I think that I know a lot of things... Maybe not, but I can help :)Answered 286w agoYes, John was a very good friend of Freddie.He left the group when in 2001, Queen decided to do some songs for Knight's Tale OST with Robbie Williams as a singer. John began to suspect about a posible replacement of Freddie and he disagreed. He left the recording and left the studio. In fact, John gets money when Roger or Brian play some of his songs on tour, so he is involucrated in the group, but only for money. The group disapeard when Freddie died.71.2k Views · 6 UpvotesView More AnswersRelated QuestionsWhat do you think is John Deacon's best bass line?How did Queen get their first record deal?How was Queen able to stay together after Freddie Mercury's death?How can someone retire at an early age?How much did you retire on for an early retirement?Is $10M enough to retire?Why did Tim Bergling (Avicii) choose to retire?Should Roger Federer consider retirement?Why was the Concorde retired in 2003 despite having a good operational history barring the 2000 crash?Should Paul McCartney retire?Related QuestionsHow did Queen members split/share their incomes?Why do people keep talking about Freddie Mercury and Brian May but never mention John Deacon and Roger Taylor?

Mike Wokulich, Account Executive for Deacon, will assist the training and certification of installers with the incoming Aquatherm product lines. Deacon Industrial Supply Company, Inc. is now stocking the Aquatherm Product line. To help with the transition, Deacon’s Account Executive Mike Wokulich will help with the training and certifying installers in socket, electro, and butt fusion.
Aquatherm is a 40-year-old, German engineered product that’s used in domestic water, compressed air, glycol, and a variety of other piping applications.  Additional strengths include: its efficiency and sustainability characteristics, leak-free connections, resistance to scale and minimum 60-year life expectancy. This piping system is a solution to many of problems associated with metallic piping systems.  The building facilities concern for long-term maintenance and repair costs are significantly reduced.
Deacon Industrial Supply Company has specialized in the distribution of pipe, valves, fittings and many other related products and services across the Mid-Atlantic Region.  Founded in 1963 on providing its customers with “sudden service,” Deacon Industrial has since developed experienced personnel, a large inventory and great service offerings.
