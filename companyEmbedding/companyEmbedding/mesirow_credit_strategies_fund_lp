Share


















































Mesirow Financial is an employee-owned financial services company with operations in 17 U.S. states, London and Hong Kong. The firm's investment management division primarily serves institutional investors, offering a range of traditional and alternative investment strategies to meet the diverse needs of corporate clients, pension funds, charitable foundations, and other public- and private-sector institutions. The investment management division also offers wealth management and investment advisory services to individuals and families.
As of Dec. 31, 2015, Mesirow Financial reported $96.8 billion in total worldwide assets under management (AUM). Institutional investment products account for the vast majority of the firm's AUM, including $65.6 billion in its currency management products. Only about 4% of AUM is associated with the firm's wealth advisory and retirement planning business. Apart from its investment management services, Mesirow Financial also offers a range of broker-dealer services, insurance consulting services, investment banking services and other financial services primarily for institutional and corporate clients.
Product Overview
Mesirow Financial's currency management products serve a diverse corporate and institutional clientele across North America, Europe and Australia. The firm offers both passive and active strategies to manage currency risk, and each strategy is ultimately tailored to meet the specific currency exposures and risk objectives of individual clients. The firm has offered customized currency management strategies since 1995 and has deep experience delivering results through diverse market environments and all along the risk-return spectrum. Mesirow Financial's currency management business accounts for nearly 68% of its worldwide AUM.
Mesirow Advanced Strategies, Inc. is a wholly owned subsidiary of Mesirow Financial focused on multimanager hedge fund strategies. The business unit manages $12.9 billion in assets for institutional investors around the world, nearly 14% of its parent's total AUM. Customized portfolio solutions account for nearly two-thirds of the unit's business. Other options include single-strategy solutions such as equity hedge strategies, distressed security strategies and event-driven strategies.
Mesirow Financial's fixed-income team offers a variety of strategies across major bond market sectors. Fixed-income strategies account for $4.5 billion in AUM, making it Mesirow Financial's third-largest investment management unit. Mesirow Financial Private Equity, an operating unit founded in 1982, offers partnership funds with independent U.S. private equity managers in the United States and Europe. The unit specializes in diversified funds that provide coverage across private equity asset classes and geographies. It also offers a co-investment strategy targeting smaller-market buyouts and growth equity financing opportunities. The unit reports $3.7 billion in AUM as of Sept. 30, 2015.
Executive Leadership
Richard S. Price has served as chairman and chief executive officer (CEO) at Mesirow Financial since 2011. He also serves on the board of directors. Price joined the firm in 1972 to assist in the establishment of the firm's insurance services business. In 1982, he was named president of insurance services at the firm. In 2006, Price took on the role of president and chief operating officer (COO).
Michael Miranda is senior managing director and chief investment officer (CIO) for the currency management division at Mesirow Financial. Miranda has served as CIO since 2014. He is responsible for the division's investment teams and the associated research and trading operations. Miranda completed his undergraduate education at Northwestern University before earning an MBA degree at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business. He holds the chartered financial analyst (CFA) designation.
Tom Macina is CEO of Mesirow Advanced Strategies. He also serves on the Mesirow Financial board of directors. Macina is responsible for the oversight of multimanager hedge fund products at Advanced Strategies and provides strategic leadership for the firm. He started at Mesirow Financial in 2003, joining the Mesirow Advanced Strategies investment committee in 2005. He completed his undergraduate education at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign before earning an MBA degree at the Kellogg Graduate School of Management at Northwestern University.

How We Serve Clients



Mesirow Advanced Strategies, Inc. specializes in sourcing niche opportunistic and multi-manager investments to build custom-designed portfolios for qualified institutional investors, including public and private pension funds, banks, hospital and healthcare organizations, insurance companies, corporations and sovereign wealth funds.
Founded in 1990, Mesirow Advanced Strategies is one of the oldest investment advisers for multi-manager hedge fund programs. We also specialize in direct investments in longer-dated opportunities. Our partnership with clients includes developing customized portfolios that are designed to achieve any number of institutional objectives – including diversification, portfolio completion, portfolio hedge, portable alpha, liability-driven investing or volatility dampening. We are headquartered in Chicago with local offices in London and Hong Kong. 


 Tailored Investment Solutions
We work with clients to construct portfolios that are best positioned to meet their investment objectives.

67% customized portfolios
95% institutional clients

As of March 31, 2017.Source: Willis Towers Watson/Financial Times Global Alternatives Survey, July 2016.













Our Competitive Advantages
 Specialized Focus on Customized Portfolios
We have worked with our clients to tailor custom investment solutions for more than $6.7 billion of our assets (more than 67% of the AUM clients have entrusted to us). Customized investment solutions programs vary across the risk/return spectrum and are tailored across a number of other attributes. We built our first customized portfolio in 1990. That client remains invested with us today.
 Private, Independent, Employee-Owned Company
Because we (along with other Mesirow-affiliated employees) own our business, we are accountable only to our clients. We do not have unaffiliated shareholders pressuring us to place profitability above client concerns. Our privately held structure allows us to invest the resources to better service our clients through custom portfolios, custom reporting and other services they may need to be accountable to their ultimate clients – the pensioners, sovereigns, hospital systems and others that are counting on them.
 Established Philosophy and Seasoned Team
We have employed a disciplined, value-oriented investment approach to hedge fund investing since our inception in 1990. We believe our team of seasoned professionals has the experience needed to recognize when fundamentals dictate portfolio changes to capture opportunities for growth and avoid large losses.
 Specialized Focus on Co-Investment and Credit
For clients who are more return-seeking, and who have longer-dated liquidity budgets, we focus on constructing investment portfolios with 3-5 year horizons in the co-investment and credit space. Our co-investments take the best ideas from hedge fund managers, focusing in particular on market dislocations where the supply of capital is low and the risk profile is, in our view, asymmetric. We make our credit investments in accordance with the overall credit cycle, taking long and short positions and complex investments in stressed, distressed and workout opportunities.
