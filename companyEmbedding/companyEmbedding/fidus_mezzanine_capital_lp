Fidus Investment Corporation Receives Approval For Second SBIC License






GlobeNewswire



May 30, 2013 8:00 AM EDT













 




























































    EVANSTON, Ill., May 30, 2013 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Fidus Investment Corporation (Nasdaq:FDUS) ("Fidus" or the "Company") today announced that its wholly owned subsidiary, Fidus Mezzanine Capital II, L.P., has received approval for a license from the U.S. Small Business Administration ("SBA") to operate as a Small Business Investment Company ("SBIC"). This is the second SBIC license granted to the Company through its SBIC subsidiaries.  As an SBIC, Fidus Mezzanine Capital II, L.P. will be subject to a variety of regulations and oversight by the SBA concerning, among other things, the size and nature of the companies in which it may invest as well as the structure of those investments. The license will allow Fidus Mezzanine Capital II, L.P. to obtain leverage by issuing SBA-guaranteed debentures, subject to the issuance of a capital commitment by the SBA and customary procedures. SBA debentures are loans issued by an SBIC which have interest payable semi-annually and a ten-year maturity. The interest rate is fixed at the time of issuance at a market-driven spread over U.S. Treasury Notes with ten-year maturities. Current regulations permit Fidus Mezzanine Capital II, L.P. to issue up to $75 million in SBA debentures.  "We are very pleased to have received approval for a second SBIC license, which provides us access to an additional $75 million of attractive long term debt capital," said Edward Ross, Chief Executive Officer of Fidus Investment Corporation. "This capital, combined with the $59 million of cash on our balance sheet at March 31, 2013, positions us well to continue to selectively grow our investment portfolio as we remain focused on capital preservation and generating attractive risk-adjusted returns over the long term."  ABOUT FIDUS INVESTMENT CORPORATION  Fidus Investment Corporation provides customized debt and equity financing solutions to lower middle market companies, which we generally define as U.S. based companies having revenues between $10.0 million and $150.0 million. Fidus' investment objective is to provide attractive risk-adjusted returns by generating both current income from our debt investments and capital appreciation from our equity related investments. Fidus seeks to partner with business owners, management teams and financial sponsors by providing customized financing for change of ownership transactions, recapitalizations, strategic acquisitions, business expansion and other growth initiatives.

You are prohibited from using any marks for any purpose including, but not limited to use as metatags on other pages or sites on the World Wide Web without the written permission of Fidus Partners or such third party, which may own the marks.BUSINESS CONTINUITY DISCLOSUREFidus Partners has designed a business continuity plan ("BCP") to evaluate and manage a potential significant disruption to its business operations so that we may continue critical business functions in the event of an emergency. Critical functions include the storage and preservation of data, alternate communications with clients and regulators, and alternate communications with employees. Since the timing and impact of disasters and disruptions are unpredictable, we will have to be flexible in responding to actual events as they occur. With that in mind, we are providing you with this information on our business continuity plan.If after a significant business disruption you cannot contact us as you usually do at 704.334.2222 or at info@fiduspartners.com, you should refer to our posted message on our web site at www.fiduspartners.com. The BCP was designed after reviewing the potential risks and ability to recover from key losses. The BCP is reviewed and updated at least annually. The BCP includes discussion of potential disruptions including loss of one or more offices, loss of communication services, loss of power, loss of key personnel, and loss of key service providers. Our BCP addresses: data backup and recovery; all mission critical systems; financial and operational assessments; alternative communications with customers, employees, and regulators; alternate physical location of employees; critical supplier, bank and counter-party impact; and regulatory reporting.Fidus Partners utilizes various off-site locations to replicate critical data and technology. In the event of a significant disruption, it is Fidus Partners' goal to recover from the disruption within 24 hours or less so that we can continue business operations. Fidus intends to respond to such disruptions by safeguarding our employees and property, making a financial and operational assessment, and protecting the firm's books and records. In short, our business continuity plan is designed to permit our firm to resume operations as quickly as possible, given the scope and severity of the significant business disruption.Significant business disruptions can vary in their scope. A disruption may affect only our firm, a single building housing one of our firm's offices, the business district where one of our firm's offices is located, the city where one of our firm's offices is located, or a whole region where one or more of our firm's offices are located. Within each of these areas, the severity of the disruption can also vary from minimal to severe. In a disruption to only our firm or a building housing one of our firm's offices, we will make every effort to transfer our operations to a local site when needed and expect to recover and resume business within 24 hours or less. In a disruption affecting a business district, city, or region including one or more of our offices, we will make every effort to transfer our operations to a site outside of the affected area, and recover and resume business within 24 hours or less. In either situation, we plan to continue in business, and notify you on how to contact us through our web site www.fiduspartners.com. The nature of the BCP is to lessen the impact of emergencies. Because events that bring about disruptions are unpredictable, Fidus Partners may have no ability to restore full service in the event of failures in certain infrastructure such as utilities, communication networks, transportation, and third party providers. Fidus Partners does not guarantee that it will be able to continue or resume business operations within any specified period of time under all circumstances.If you have questions about our business continuity planning, you can contact us at info@fiduspartners.com.

Mezzanines
Can’t Go Out? – Go Up!
A.M.F.I. Engineered Structural Steel Mezzanines
A.M.F.I. mezzanines are perfect in industrial operations such as warehousing, distribution or manufacturing. Our industrial structures offer the most cost effective way to expand floor space for production, storage, office space or manufacturing and more, making our steel products the perfect solution for cost conscious buyers that need more space in a hurry.
Our mezzanines are specifically designed to exceed the stringent Seismic Zone 4 requirements for engineering and design and our standard bracing design avoids many problems often associated with permitting structures in the Western United States areas. For mezzanine structures outside of the zone 4 area, our design is scaled back to make the structure as cost effective as possible.
We provide mezzanine products that are designed to last a lifetime and strive for our company and customer relationships to duplicate that longevity. Whether working with us in-house to design an embedded system, purchasing A.M.F.I. products to integrate with your material handling equipment or just a stand alone product we are here for you.
Specifications

Bolt together design eliminates field cutting or welding
Heavy duty structural design suited for almost any application
Custom sizes, shapes, colors and finishes available
Numerous decking options; wood, steel, bargrate, concrete…
Easy to relocate due to bolt together design
Custom match any paint color, no extra charge.
Creates usable floor space at a moderate cost

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.

Mezzanines
Can’t Go Out? – Go Up!
A.M.F.I. Engineered Structural Steel Mezzanines
A.M.F.I. mezzanines are perfect in industrial operations such as warehousing, distribution or manufacturing. Our industrial structures offer the most cost effective way to expand floor space for production, storage, office space or manufacturing and more, making our steel products the perfect solution for cost conscious buyers that need more space in a hurry.
Our mezzanines are specifically designed to exceed the stringent Seismic Zone 4 requirements for engineering and design and our standard bracing design avoids many problems often associated with permitting structures in the Western United States areas. For mezzanine structures outside of the zone 4 area, our design is scaled back to make the structure as cost effective as possible.
We provide mezzanine products that are designed to last a lifetime and strive for our company and customer relationships to duplicate that longevity. Whether working with us in-house to design an embedded system, purchasing A.M.F.I. products to integrate with your material handling equipment or just a stand alone product we are here for you.
Specifications

Bolt together design eliminates field cutting or welding
Heavy duty structural design suited for almost any application
Custom sizes, shapes, colors and finishes available
Numerous decking options; wood, steel, bargrate, concrete…
Easy to relocate due to bolt together design
Custom match any paint color, no extra charge.
Creates usable floor space at a moderate cost
Call for a quote; prices vary $15-$30 / sq. ft. delivered and installed for most structures.
