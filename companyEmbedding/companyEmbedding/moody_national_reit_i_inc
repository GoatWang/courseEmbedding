HOUSTON, May 21, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Moody National REIT I, Inc. (the "REIT"), announced today it is under contract to acquire a 149-hotel portfolio (the "Project 149") from a third party seller, for an aggregate purchase price of $1.725 billion, excluding acquisition costs.
The portfolio includes 14,000 units spread across 32 states. Project 149 has a concentration of hotels in California, Arizona, Texas and the Northeast. The majority of the portfolio consists of Marriott and Hilton branded select-service hotels.
"This is a great concentration of assets in key states which will benefit from several years remaining in the expanding hotel cycle," said Brett Moody, CEO and Chairman of the REIT. "These are well-branded and well-managed assets."
While a bulk of the Marriott and Hilton assets have undergone renovations (Courtyard Refreshing Business, Residence Inn Gatehouse Re-Inventions and Hampton Inn Forever Young Initiative), the REIT plans to accelerate and complete all remaining brand required renovations.
The acquisition ofÂ Project 149 is subject to substantial conditions to closing, including (1) the REIT's ability to obtain financing for the acquisition of Project 149; and (2) the absence of a material adverse change to Project 149 prior to the date of the acquisition. There is no assurance that the REIT will close the acquisition of Project 149 on the terms described above or at all.

AUSTIN, TXâMoody National REIT I, Inc. has entered a contract to purchase the Hilton Garden Inn Austin NW/Arboretum for $29 million, excluding acquisition costs and subject to adjustments and prorations as contemplated by the purchase agreement.Â 
Positioned to meet demand from nearby corporate offices, including Apple, IBM, Motorola, 3M and Cisco, the hotel is located north of the city center just off Highway 183, in close proximity to the Arboretum at Great Hills, the University of Texas, Sixth Street and Lake Travis. Â 
"This asset fits perfectly within our existing portfolio, being a premium brand in a market that's slated to outperform the majority of other major metropolitan areas," said Brett Moody, chairman of the board and CEO of Moody National Companies. "This particular asset located in a great sub-market, the Arboretum/The Domain Shopping Mall, establishes the environment for this asset to outperform Austin as a whole."
The 138-room Hilton Garden Inn hotel opened in 2002. Located on 3.427 acres, hotel amenities include an indoor swimming pool, HDTV and in-room hospitality centers with refrigerators, as well as approximately 1,400 sq. ft. of meeting space.
If acquired, the Hilton Garden Inn would represent the second Hilton acquisition by Moody REIT I within the Austin market over the past year. The REIT purchased the Hampton Inn South Austin Airport in the fourth quarter of 2013.
Upon acquisition, Moody National REIT I, Inc. intends to perform a Property Improvement Plan (PIP) to bring the hotel into compliance with the latest Hilton Garden Inn brand standards.

With Rise in Travel Spending, Dreams Can Come True

Well, Allianz Global Assistance (AGA) just released data earlier this week saying that Americans are spending more on summer vacations this year, topping $100 billion for the first time in the AGA surveyâs eight-year history. This represents a 12.5% increase over last year.

Strategy & Benefits

Key Benefits
You know that TRADING is different than investing. But the opportunity to take advantage of short-term trends is only won, if you get the direction right.
Whether youâre a bull or a bear, Direxion is with you. Our leveraged ETFs are powerful tools built to help you:

Magnify your short-term perspective with daily 3X leverage
Go where thereâs opportunity, with bull and bear funds for both sides of the trade; and
Stay agile â with liquidity to trade through rapidly changing markets

Leveraged and inverse ETFs pursue daily leveraged investment objectives which means they are riskier than alternatives which do not use leverage. They seek daily goals and should not be expected to track the underlying index over periods longer than one day. They are not suitable for all investors and should be utilized only by investors who understand leverage risk and who actively manage their investments.







Target Index

The MSCI US REIT Index (RMS G) is a free float-adjusted market capitalization weighted index that is comprised of equity real estate investment trusts (âREITsâ) that are included in the MSCI US Investable Market 2500 Index, with the exception of specialty equity REITs that do not generate a majority of their revenue and income from real estate rental and leasing operations. The Index represents approximately 99% of the U.S. REIT universe. One cannot directly invest in an index.

* The Net Expense Ratio includes management fees, other operating expenses and Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses. If Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses were excluded, the Net Expense Ratio would be 0.95%.  The Fundsâ Adviser, Rafferty Asset Management, LLC (âRaffertyâ) has entered into an Operating Expense Limitation Agreement with each Fund, under which Rafferty has contractually agreed to cap all or a portion of its management fee and/or reimburse each Fund for Other Expenses through September 1, 2018, to the extent that the Fundâs Total Annual Fund Operating Expenses exceed 0.95% of the Fundâs daily net assets other than the following:  taxes, swap financing and related costs, acquired fund fees and expenses, dividends or interest on short positions, other interest expenses, brokerage commissions and extraordinary expenses. If these expenses were included, the expense ratio would be higher.
The performance data quoted represents past performance. Past performance does not guarantee future results. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate. An investorâs shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance quoted. Returns for performance under one year are cumulative, not annualized. For the most recent month-end performance please visit the funds website at direxioninvestments.com.
Short-term performance, in particular, is not a good indication of the fundâs future performance, and an investment should not be made based solely on returns. Because of ongoing market volatility, fund performance may be subject to substantial short-term changes. For additional information, see the fundâs prospectus.

* The Net Expense Ratio includes management fees, other operating expenses and Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses. If Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses were excluded, the Net Expense Ratio would be 0.95%.  The Fundsâ Adviser, Rafferty Asset Management, LLC (âRaffertyâ) has entered into an Operating Expense Limitation Agreement with each Fund, under which Rafferty has contractually agreed to cap all or a portion of its management fee and/or reimburse each Fund for Other Expenses through September 1, 2018, to the extent that the Fundâs Total Annual Fund Operating Expenses exceed 0.95% of the Fundâs daily net assets other than the following:  taxes, swap financing and related costs, acquired fund fees and expenses, dividends or interest on short positions, other interest expenses, brokerage commissions and extraordinary expenses. If these expenses were included, the expense ratio would be higher.
The performance data quoted represents past performance. Past performance does not guarantee future results. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate. An investorâs shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance quoted. Returns for performance under one year are cumulative, not annualized. For the most recent month-end performance please visit the funds website at direxioninvestments.com.
Short-term performance, in particular, is not a good indication of the fundâs future performance, and an investment should not be made based solely on returns. Because of ongoing market volatility, fund performance may be subject to substantial short-term changes. For additional information, see the fundâs prospectus.

Strategy & Benefits

Key Benefits
You know that TRADING is different than investing. But the opportunity to take advantage of short-term trends is only won, if you get the direction right.
Whether youâre a bull or a bear, Direxion is with you. Our leveraged ETFs are powerful tools built to help you:

Magnify your short-term perspective with daily 3X leverage
Go where thereâs opportunity, with bull and bear funds for both sides of the trade; and
Stay agile â with liquidity to trade through rapidly changing markets

Leveraged and inverse ETFs pursue daily leveraged investment objectives which means they are riskier than alternatives which do not use leverage. They seek daily goals and should not be expected to track the underlying index over periods longer than one day. They are not suitable for all investors and should be utilized only by investors who understand leverage risk and who actively manage their investments.







Target Index

The MSCI US REIT Index (RMS G) is a free float-adjusted market capitalization weighted index that is comprised of equity real estate investment trusts (âREITsâ) that are included in the MSCI US Investable Market 2500 Index, with the exception of specialty equity REITs that do not generate a majority of their revenue and income from real estate rental and leasing operations. The Index represents approximately 99% of the U.S. REIT universe. One cannot directly invest in an index.

 The performance data quoted represents past performance. Past performance does not guarantee future results. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate. An investorâs shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost; current performance may be lower or higher than the performance quoted. Returns for performance for one year and under are cumulative, not annualized. Short term performance, in particular, is not a good indication of the fundâs future performance, and an investment should not be made based solely on returns. For additional information, see the fund(s) prospectus.
Each Direxion Fund share price is calculated as of the close of regular trading, usually as of 4:00 p.m. Eastern Time, each day the New York Stock Exchange is open for business. Each fund seeks to meet its investment objective relative to the value of the target index or benchmark as of 4:00 p.m.
Shares of Direxion Shares are bought and sold at market price (not NAV) and are not individually redeemed from the Fund. Brokerage commissions will reduce returns. Market Price returns are based upon the midpoint of the bid/ask spread at 4:00 PM Eastern time (when NAV is normally determined), and do not represent the returns you would receive if you traded shares at other times. Fund returns assume that dividends and capital gains distributions have been reinvested in the Fund at NAV. Some performance results reflect expense subsidies and waivers in effect during certain periods shown. Absent these waivers, results would have been less favorable.
After-Tax and After-Tax, Post Sales Returns
Tax-adjusted returns and tax cost ratio are estimates of the impact taxes have had on a fund. We assume the highest tax rate in calculating these figures. These returns follow the SEC guidelines for calculating returns before sale of shares. Tax-adjusted returns show a fundâs annualized after tax total return for the one, three and five year periods, excluding any capital-gains effects that would result from selling the fund at the end of the period. To determine this figure, all income and short-term capital gains distributions are taxed at the maximum federal rate at the time of distribution. Long-term capital gains are taxed at a 15% rate.
