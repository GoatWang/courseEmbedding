Purebase Reports the Registration of Purebase Core Products in Colorado


Press Release
-


									updated: Jun 1, 2017							

 


			Ione, California, 
			June 1, 2017			(Newswire.com) -
	 Purebase Corporation (OTCQB: PUBC), a company focused on delivering high-quality sustainable organic mineral products for the agricultural sector, is pleased to announce the successful registration of its first two strategic organic products: Purebase Shade Advantage (WP)® and Purebase Soil Advantage, for sale in the State of Colorado. 
For the last year, Purebase has been engaged in meeting the registration requirements of the Colorado Department of Agriculture for its proprietary organic soil bio-enhancing materials designed to promote soil restoration and ecological balance while setting the stage for optimization of the plant’s genetic expression under different technologies. The uses of these products vary from conventional and organic commercial open field agriculture to dry land and irrigation, including under-the-roof farming technologies. They can be put to use in a diverse menu of crops, including grains, legumes, animal feeds, vegetables, fruits, vineyards, tubers, cannabis and nuts.
With 66.3 million acres* of usable crop lands, Colorado produces approximately $7.1 billion* annually in consumable goods (http://www.coloradofarmshow.com/news/colorado-farm-show-news/detail/id/24, 02/2016). It is noteworthy to mention that Colorado is the pioneer state of growth and taxation of medical and recreational marijuana. Additionally, the Marijuana industry generates $1.3 billion* in annual sales, with no sign of plateauing (Huffington Post, 02/2017).
“Colorado’s modern agricultural marketplace, while complex and demanding, is well suited for the versatility and wide spectrum of benefits our products have to offer… we are very excited and are eager to meet the challenge” said Robert Hurtado, Purebase Corporation’s Vice President – Agriculture Research & Development.
About Purebase (OTCBBQB: PUBC)
Purebase is a diversified, natural and industrial mineral resource company providing solutions to the agriculture industry.

IONE, Calif., June 13, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Purebase Corporation (OTCQB: PUBC), is pleased to report the 2017 Shade Advantage (WP) Protectant Season has begun in Arizona and California.  
Description








The last four weeks, Purebase has shipped and technically supported distributors to achieve a successful market insertion for the first selling season of Purebase Shade Advantage (WP) throughout Western Arizona and Southern California on citrus, mangos, onions, and olive crops. This market insertion strategy progresses north into Oregon, Washington State anticipating distributors demands. Likewise, in the following weeks the Purebase team will visit Idaho and Colorado distributors, which represent an estimated combined total of 773,851 cultivated acres. 
This last week, applications and distribution of Purebase Shade Advantage (WP) have also begun in the San Juaquin and Sacramento Valleys on walnuts, olives and citrus. Simultaneously, Purebase is ramping up distribution operations for applications on cherries throughout the San Juaquin Valley and Bakersfield California. 
Robert Hurtado, VP of Purebase Ag. Products Research and Development states, that "we are expecting an unusually warm summer this season and Purebase Shade Advantage WP can help mitigate heat induced stress to these valuable crops and new orchards and vineyards being established." Purebase Shade Advantage (WP) protects these crops by absorbing and diffusing harmful ultraviolet and infrared radiation light that scalds fruits and nuts and affects plant physiology and DNA transfer for next year crops.

Purebase is a diversified, natural and industrial mineral resource company that acquires, develops, and commercializes industrial and natural mineral deposits to provide soil amendment solutions to the agriculture industry, domestically and internationally.
