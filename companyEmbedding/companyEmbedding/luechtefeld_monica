See moreSee lessMonica is incredibly knowledgeable and effective when it comes to ecommerce and improving online businesses. The first time I had the pleasure of meeting Monica was when we were pitching to supply her organisation with UX services. One of the things that stood out the most was how much she already knew about usability, the customer experience and website optimisation. After working on several successful projects together, I realised that it was more than just knowledge and expertise in the subject that made her such an effective leader. In my opinion it was very much down to the way she listened so carefully to what everyone had to say, whether they were researchers, analysts, developers or product owners. She took everything in and where necessary questioned all aspects in order to fully understand the issues before clearly defining the best course of action. She then made sure that all the different teams and stakeholders met their deadlines and delivered the highest quality work throughout the project. I would highly recommend Monica to anyone who is looking to make significant and long-term improvements to their organisation.See moreSee lessSign up to see who recommended MonicaGroupsMulti-channel Customer Contact StrategiesTotal Retail -  Instore tech, marketing, luxury, partnerships and franchising, digital retailingOffice Products Women in Leadership ( OPWIL)Harvard Business ReviewView Monica’s full profile to...See who you know in commonGet introducedContact Monica directlyView Monica’s Full ProfileView this profile in another languageEnglishGermanPeople Also ViewedStephen HareCFO at Office Depot, Inc.Michelle TrentacosteRegional Migration Manager SE - Office DepotPamela WilsonSolutions Development Manager - Copy and Print at Office DepotMarcy FriedmanSales Manager at Acme Corrugated BoxKevin R.

By Linda Tischler8 minute ReadIt is a busy Saturday at one of Office Depot’s Boca Raton retail stores. The staff is hustling during the back-to-school season to match middle schoolers with backpacks and college students with graphing calculators. Salesclerk Monica Luechtefeld, crisply professional in a red Office Depot polo shirt and black pants, draws a particularly thorny request from a young customer.advertisementThe teenage boy desperately wants to buy a computer and a monitor with the money that he has earned during the summer. Trouble is, he has only about $500 — not quite enough even for a low-end off-the-rack system. But Luechtefeld, a mother herself, can’t bear the thought of sending the kid home empty-handed. So she marches him right over to a computer kiosk near the front of the store, clicks around the Office Depot Web site displayed on the screen, and presto! — just like that, she manages to find a reconditioned 1.5-GHz Hewlett-Packard computer, complete with warranty, for $499. A few more clicks, and she discovers a refurbished monitor that was originally priced at $179.99 but that now features a $150 mail-in rebate, for a grand total of $29.99.Even the store manager is astonished. But Luechtefeld, who is working there as part of a companywide executives-in-the-field program, isn’t completely satisfied. The search wasn’t as seamless as she’d expected. There were a few things that could have tripped up less Web-savvy searchers. Most disturbing, her fellow sales associates seemed only dimly aware of the vast virtual inventory available through the site. She vows to make it right.By Monday, Luechtefeld, dressed in a stylish black St. John’s knit suit, is back at her real job as e-commerce chief of Office Depot (annual revenue: $11 billion), based in Delray Beach, Florida. She has a fistful of notes for her tech team. “When I came back, I told the IT guys, ‘This is your worst nightmare, having me use the tools inside the store,’ ” she says, laughing.Present at the Creation Meet one of the fearless mavericks of e-commerce. Monica Luechtefeld has been directing online initiatives for Office Depot since 1994, when she embarked on a joint project with MIT to develop a business-to-business Web site for ordering office supplies. That was the equivalent of the early Bronze Age of the Internet, when few people aside from hard-core techies and members of academia had even heard of the Web. But Luechtefeld was excited by the opportunity, inspired by the vision of Web pioneers like Tim Berners-Lee, and determined to position Office Depot at the forefront of the revolution. “Although most companies didn’t see it yet, I really thought that this kind of technology was going to be a home run for corporate America in automating routine transactions for suppliers,” Luechtefeld says.Eight years later, her blend of spirited evangelism and results-oriented execution has produced an e-commerce grand slam. In 2001, Office Depot’s worldwide e-commerce sales broke the billion-dollar threshold, topping off at $1.6 billion — 14% of total sales. That makes Office Depot the second-largest multichannel retailer on the Web, trailing only Amazon.com, and puts the office-supply store some $650 million ahead of Staples, its nearest competitor. The company’s recently announced partnership with Amazon, which will improve its access to individual — as opposed to corporate — shoppers (a market that Luechtefeld estimates at more than $90 billion), means that Office Depot is likely to reach chairman and CEO Bruce Nelson’s goal of $2 billion in online sales this year without breaking a sweat.What’s even more remarkable than this track record of growth is Office Depot’s seven-year track record of profitability. The company’s site has made money since its first year of operation. There was never starry-eyed talk of reckless spending in an attempt to attract eyeballs, increase stickiness, or monetize traffic. “From day one, it was all about the sale,” Luechtefeld says. “You had to have initiative and vision, but you also had to figure out how to make it work in the real world and make real money.”advertisementThe company also decided early on that the Web site would not be a stand-alone venture, Luechtefeld says, but a front door into all of Office Depot’s other sales channels. “We’ve always viewed the Web as an enabler to doing business as opposed to a discreet channel,” says Robert Keller, president of business services.That meant a no-silo strategy: At launch, the online division was integrated into the company’s back-end systems, organization chart, and business planning. Web-based transactions were also built into compensation plans for the sales force, instantly heading off squabbling over who would get credit for which orders. “From an internal-accounting point of view, it didn’t matter to us whether the order originated over the phone or online,” Luechtefeld says. “So we weren’t pulling sales from one channel to another. We were letting the customer choose.” Now some 60% of Office Depot’s corporate customers do their business on the Web, and CEO Nelson predicts that that number will climb to 80% in the next three to four years.The Long Road to Internet Glory As refreshingly commonsense as Luechtefeld’s strategies seem today, it wasn’t always so. Indeed, she recalls the rocky transition from the early promise of the MIT site to the point where corporate America finally embraced the technology as a lonely slog through a clueless landscape. “It took two long years to get our first 500 customers connected,” Luechtefeld says. During that time, she traveled relentlessly in a grassroots effort to sell her vision of how the Web would change how business worked. It was often an uphill battle. “We used to do training at corporations where 60% of the people in the classes had never touched a mouse,” she says.Keller recalls one meeting with 100 Fortune 500 customers that he and Luechtefeld had in 1998. He began by asking how many of the customers were buying on the Web. Four people raised their hands. Then he asked, “How many are thinking about doing it?” About 20 hands went up. Finally, exasperated, he asked, “How many people know what we’re talking about here?” Less than half of the audience weakly waved back.While those were trying times in the business, they were also grueling ones for Luechtefeld personally. A California native, she joined the company in 1993, when Office Depot acquired Eastman, the West Coast’s leading contract office supplier, where she had been vice president. For several years, she ran the chain’s southern California operations but was persuaded to move to headquarters in 1996 to handle marketing and new-business development and to oversee the development of the MIT site.Reluctant to uproot her son, Christopher, who was a high-school senior, Luechtefeld let him stay behind with his father. For a year and a half, she spent her weeks in Delray, then hopped a flight on Friday night to spend her weekends in Valencia, California. “It was an ordeal,” she says, “but it was worth it.”advertisementIn 1997, Office Depot’s planned merger with Staples was quashed by the FTC. The setback rattled the company, which had slowed its expansion pending the completion of the transaction. Suddenly, says Michael Kirschner, a VP in the IT business-services group, there was huge pressure to build a public Web site — and soon. That was in October. By January 15, 1998, after more than three months of nonstop work and barely a pause for Christmas, OfficeDepot.com went live. Within a few months, Kirschner says, the site had logged its first million-dollar day.Soon after, Keller stripped Luechtefeld of all non-Web-related duties. She was furious. “I took everything else away,” Keller admits. “She was really honked at me. But e-commerce was more than a full-time job.”These days, Luechtefeld’s 12-hour days leave little time for boredom. In addition to shepherding the Amazon deal, she has launched two special-interest Web sites: School.com for educational supplies and JanitationDepot.com for janitorial cleaning supplies. In 2001, she negotiated a deal to acquire 4Sure.com, an online computer-networking and software reseller, adding some 65,000 technology products to Office Depot’s virtual inventory — and giving the company a significant leg up on its competitors in the office-supply space. That same year, she struck a partnership deal with Microsoft to offer bCentral Web-based services on the Office Depot site.Luechtefeld is currently working with colleague Jerry Colley, president of North American stores, to test potential in-store technology services, including kiosks and wireless devices. And she has ambitious plans to build an online businesswomen’s network and to launch a Web site for the Hispanic marketplace.Looking back, Luechtefeld credits her parents with planting the seeds that powered her pioneering spirit. “My mother always said, ‘You can be anything, you can do anything,’ and my father always told me, ‘Figure it out.’ I think those two scripts really helped me take risks and go where there was no road.”Asked what message he got from his mother, Luechtefeld’s son, now a broker at Morgan Stanley in Los Angeles, says, “She always told me, ‘Why not?’ “advertisementSidebar: What’s FastVirtual Sales, Real Experience Monica Luechtefeld isn’t the only Office Depot executive to experience firsthand what it feels like to work on the company’s front lines. Two years ago, when Bruce Nelson took over as CEO, store sales were sluggish and employees were still dispirited from the company’s failed merger with Staples.To get his executive team in closer touch with the company’s far-flung retail empire, Nelson instituted a program that would send managers — including the CEO himself — to work in the stores one day per quarter. The insights from that program are shared in Monday-morning executive meetings and used to make improvements in everything from the company’s Web site to its sales-force training. The first year that Nelson staffed the stores, he got an earful of complaints. “People told me that this wasn’t the most compelling place to work,” he says. Two years later, the reviews are more positive, and he spends his tour of duty picking up on ideas for running the stores — and the company — better. “People tell me things that are important to them that I never would have thought about,” he says.Meanwhile, other top executives have discovered their inner sales associate. Last year during his stint in the field, Robert Keller, president of business services, helped an elderly customer buy a lamp. At the end of the sale, she turned around and asked him, “How long have you been working in this store?” “Actually, ma’am,” he said, “this is my first day.” “Well,” she said, “you’re getting a pretty late start in life on this. But I think you’ve got a career in sales.”Linda Tischler (ltischler@fastcompany. com) is a Fast Company senior writer.

Monica Luechtefeld



May 14, 2001, 12:00 AM EDT











Office Depot Inc.
POSITION: Executive Vice-President, E-Commerce

      CONTRIBUTION: Made OfficeDepot.com the second-largest e-tailer after Amazon.com.
CHALLENGE: To raise the percentage of Office Depot customers buying online to 50% by yearend from today's 40%.
      
      



Monica Luechtefeld, the executive vice-president who heads Office Depot Inc.'s online business, has little patience for people from other companies who complain to her that they can't get e-commerce off the ground. "Doesn't your chairman grill you daily about online performance?" she recalls asking one such whiner at a recent industry conference. When he answered "no," Luechtefeld scolded, "Shame on you and your company. No wonder you're failing."
Luechtefeld has earned the right to be smug. Under her leadership, the Delray Beach (Fla.)-based company has quietly become the second-largest e-tailer in the world behind Amazon.com (AMZN
      ). Office Depot (ODP
      ) booked $850 million in online sales last year--double that of its biggest rival, Staples Inc. (SPLS
      ) Last year, Internet sales grew 143% from the $350 million in 1999. The outfit has been profitable since it was created in 1996. And this year, online sales are expected to nearly double, to $1.5 billion, representing 20% of the company's overall sales. Now, she aims to push to 50% from 40% the number of Office Depot customers ordering online by yearend. "Our success is measured not by traffic to the site, but by sales," says Luechtefeld. "What differentiates us from others is execution."








Luechtefeld provides a case study in how best to marry bricks with clicks. Not only can the company's corporate and individual customers order 14,000 items online--twice as many as in the stores--but they also can check the inventory at any of the company's 850 U.S. superstores via the Net. If a customer orders something online, a nearby store will package it for pickup at the customer service desk. No more standing in line. And computers at the stores allow walk-in customers to check online to find out such things as what type of cartridge they need for a certain printer and whether it's in stock. The idea is to create a seamless experience for customers where retail and online operations feed off each other.
Still, the online effort is just a toddler in Luechtefeld's eyes. Next, she plans to expand beyond the company's thousands of big corporate customers to serve the 13 million small businesses that shop at Office Depot. To do that, she plans to offer them more than just office supplies. "I want us to serve them both as coach and trusted adviser," she says. To Luechtefeld that means expanding to include online services such as tax preparation and bookkeeping. Office Depot has no expertise in this area, so Luechtefeld is making alliances with those that do, including software giant Microsoft Corp. (MSFT
      ) Such moves win raves from Charles Martin, chairman of the Net Future Institute, a New Hampshire think tank that studies e-commerce. "Office Depot has used the Net to lock customers into a deeper relationship," he says. "Someday, they'll be able to sell them other things such as airline tickets."

Luechtefeld has deep experience in selling businesses all manner of things. The 52-year-old Los Angeles native left furniture supplier Eastman Inc. in 1993 to join Office Depot. She began her career at the company running its massive operations in Southern California, overseeing distribution, warehousing, and sales. Next, she moved to headquarters to handle marketing. Thanks to her training, when the Internet emerged she understood immediately how it could not only boost sales, but also cut costs. Online sales are half as expensive to process as orders received via fax or phone. And she was convinced corporate purchasing managers would love the Net, too. It would let them control policy and the purse strings from above but push actual buying down into the trenches. Luechtefeld persuaded her superiors to let her try to make Office Depot No. 1 in online sales of office supplies.
Job done. Thanks to Luechtefeld, there's no whining at Office Depot.

Resume: Monica Luechtefeld - Bloomberg




























































  
















Resume: Monica Luechtefeld



August 6, 2001, 12:00 AM EDT








 Born: Jan. 23, 1949, in Los Angeles
Education: Earned a Bachelor of Science degree in 1971 from Mount St. Mary's College, a Catholic school in Los Angeles.
U-Turns: Although trained as a scientist, her first job was in the recruiting office of Mount St. Mary's College. While in college doing research on mosquitoes, she decided that science didn't give her enough human contact.







                        The most important business stories of the day.

                                    Sign Up
                            















Career highlights: Left her job as a recruiter in 1979 to become a sales rep at Maloney's, a family-owned office-supply chain in Los Angeles. Joined Office Depot (ODP
      ) in 1993. Soon rose to run the sales, warehouse, and distribution operations in Southern California. In 1996, promoted to vice-president of contract marketing and sales administration. That's when she recognized the rising importance of the Internet and helped get Office Depot wired. In 2000, she was named senior vice-president of e-commerce.
How she challenges herself: She keeps two items on her bookshelf to keep her focused: One is the book E-Volve-or-Die.com, which prods her to keep an eye on the next trend; the other is a little toy shopping cart, a reminder that her core business is retail sales.
Leaves work at work: She clocks long days, usually from 7:15 a.m. to 8 p.m. But come the weekend, she leaves her briefcase at the office. She's a big believer in downtime to recharge her battery. Calling her while she's vacationing is a definite no-no.
Family: Divorced 10 years ago, with one son, Chris, 22.
