Every day, she runs into 20- and 30-somethings who are eager to share their concerns with her — like weight gain, sleep loss, and mood swings — in the communal kitchen.At Parsley Health, Berzin and her colleagues want to help those people get off prescription drugs and avoid the eye-popping fees that specialists charge. The startup takes a holistic approach to care, with physicians taking in information about a person’s history, lifestyle, and genetics, and offering treatment that puts alternative therapies ahead of traditional medicine.”read the full storySelfWhat Really Happens When You Detox?“What interests me most about detoxing, at least the way Dr. Berzin prescribes it, is whether it has the potential to reduce inflammation in our bodies. Inflammation is a well-established medical concept, and Dr. Berzin’s explanation is pretty simple: “If you’re consistently eating foods that cause a low-grade allergic reaction or contain lots of toxins, your immune system is constantly kicking into gear,” she says. That immune response is, by its very nature, inflammatory, because it has to produce lots of proteins (called antibodies) and chemical agents to fight off invaders. Which is what you want them doing—just not all the time. “Once your immune response is on, it’s on systemwide,” Dr. Berzin explains. “That leads to a chronic state of low-level inflammation, which can cause all sorts of problems.” Think acne, migraines and weight gain in the short term, with heart disease looming down the road.”Read the full storyWell+GoodThe Progressive, Affordable Doctor Is In“Over time, your immune system has gotten confused,” Robin Berzin, MD, explained, after about an hour spent delving through my health history, from my Cesarean birth to my chronic congestion to what kind of protein powder I put in my smoothie yesterday…read the full storyOrganic AuthorityThis Functional Medicine Clinic is Changing Healthcare in Los Angeles“Parsley Health is a one-stop locale for functional medicine, built on a completely new model: instead of hundred (or thousand) dollar an hour doctor visits, members pay $150/month for unlimited contact with a healthcare professional.  This completely changes the way that medical needs are met.“We needed to get away from fee for service,” explains Berzin. “You shouldn’t pay me to see me for more hours; you should pay to get better.”read the full storyABC HomePortrait of a Doctor as a Young Techy: Dr. Robin BerzinThe revolution will be digital and nutritional.

I constantly battled allergies and asthma, but was still able to compete as a triathlete. At that time, ‘managing’ my problems meant 5 pills and 4 inhalers a day. Within 5 weeks with Parsley Health, I noticed a remarkable difference in my asthma symptoms and was able to reduce my medications significantly. Parsley’s state of the art testing also showed I was pre-diabetic, so we quickly identified problematic foods and sugar sources. I feel confident that the Parsley team will help me live the healthy and prescription drug-free life I deserve.”“Parsley Health’s data was unlike anything I had ever seen before. Dr. Berzin diagnosed me with an autoimmune disease called Hashimotos Thyroiditis. None of my doctors had even mentioned it was a possibility. That was what was making me tired, depressed and gaining weight. We’ve essentially been able to eliminate all of the symptoms. The most unexpected benefit has been the mental clarity that I’ve re-discovered over the past six months that I couldn’t achieve with over ten years of weekly psychologist appointments.”-RICHARD35 REAL ESTATE EXEC NEW YORK CITY-JOHANNA29 WRITER SAN FRANCISCO“I’m 29 and healthy, but I was having trouble getting pregnant. My OB/GYN immediately recommended expensive fertility treatments.After three months with Parsley, I got pregnant naturally.”  There are no products                   × Member Perks - Parsley Health                                                      Svg Vector Icons : http://www.onlinewebfonts.com/icon                                                                                Section 1 JoinMing & BodyChinese Medicine & AyurvedaFitness & YogaNatural Products …    …       Menu      Login JoinMember Perks Our Favorite Places To Sweat, Stretch, Spa and ShopMing & BodyChinese Medicine & AyurvedaFitness & YogaNatural Products …    …   Members enjoy exclusive access to a select community of wellness partners Lift Sensory Deprivation FloatsLift / Next Level Floats is the East Coast’s largest premier sensory deprivation / floatation therapy center.

It’s called Magnesium and if you’re living a busy life in 2016, you need it more than ever.  Magnesium is involved in over 600 enzymatic reactions in the body including energy metabolism and protein synthesis. Half of us are deficient in it. That’s why at Parsley, we test your micronutrient levels.Stress depletes magnesium stores, as does excess alcohol consumption, eating processed foods, taking antibiotics and taking certain drugs like high blood pressure meds and diuretics.Here are the top 5 benefits of magnesium supplementation that we most commonly see a need for at Parsley:1. Reduces insomnia. Can’t sleep?  Magnesium Glycinate pills or a hot epsom salt (Magnesium Sulphate) bath can un-tense your muscles and help to relax your whole body, promoting a sense of sleepiness for a good night’s rest.2. Helps alleviate constipation. If you’re feeling stopped up, Magnesium Citrate can get things moving again. It helps relax the muscles of the digestive tract and neutralize stomach acid allowing your poop to pass on. Take it at night for a healthy bowel movement first thing in the morning.3. Prevents migraines. Magnesium plays a role in neurotransmitter function and blood circulation, regulating the blood vessel constriction that often leads to migraines. (Here’s a previous post on how to avoid migraines)4. Calms your nerves. Dr. Berzin calls it “nature’s anti-anxiety drug”.  Stress can be a cause of Magnesium deficiency and low magnesium levels can magnify the stress response. So we need more Mg in times of stress. Which is why Robin floated naked in a pool of it last weekend.5. Relieves muscle pain and cramping (hi PMS)Not having enough magnesium available to our muscles can cause muscle spasms that often lead to pain, cramping or twitching. Taking a supplement can help muscles (including those lining the uterus) to contract and relax normally.Dietary sources?  sea vegetables such as kelp and dulse, almonds, cashews, walnuts, shrimp, avocado, beans and garlic.Unfortunately, magnesium is not routinely checked by most conventional doctors. At Parsley we check your levels and then personalize your plan accordingly.It’s medicine the way the should be!Schedule a time to chat with someone from the team! We’d love to tell you more about Functional Medicine and our purpose with Parsley Health.References:Supplementation of Mg appears to improve subjective measures of insomnia: PubmedMg deficiency may be present in up to half of migraine patients – PubmedMg for constipation – PubmedMagnesium in Man: implications for health and disease – Pubmed  Share This Post!FacebookEmailTwitterPinterestLinkedIn   Jacqueline DamboragianJackie is a New York City based health coach. She is a Certified Holistic Health Coach through The Institute for Integrative Nutrition and is accredited by the American Association of Drugless Practitioners. She has extensive training in Functional Nutrition through The School of Applied Functional Medicine. She holds additional certifications in Yoga and Herbal Medicine.
Jackie’s passion for a holistic approach to health came out of her own experience.
As she navigated jobs that didn’t light her up, she used her non-working hours to explore farmer’s markets, cook more meals from scratch, and really understand how food affected her body. The result? Her weight stabilized. Her thinking became clearer. And her energy was smooth and steady. She was ready to share what she learned with others, and to empower them to be the leaders and nurturers of their own health and wellness.
She’s had the honor of guiding many people out of the haze of sugar addiction, chronic pain, digestive distress, excess weight, fatigue and more into real freedom, peace, and the kind of health that has them feeling like they’ve got a new lease on life.

	Parsley
      







The delicious and vibrant taste and wonderful healing properties of parsley are often ignored in its popular role as a table garnish.  Highly nutritious, parsley can be found year round in your local supermarket.
Parsley is the world's most popular herb.  It derives its name from the Greek word meaning "rock celery" (parsley is a relative to celery).   It is a biennial plant that will return to the garden year after year once it is established.

Health BenefitsDescriptionHistoryHow to Select and StoreTips for Preparing and CookingHow to EnjoyNutritional ProfileReferences
Health Benefits
A sprig of parsley can provide much more than a decoration on your plate. Parsley contains two types of unusual components that provide unique health benefits. The first type is volatile oil components—including myristicin, limonene, eugenol, and alpha-thujene. The second type is flavonoids—including apiin, apigenin, crisoeriol, and luteolin.
Promote Optimal Health
Parsley's volatile oils—particularly myristicin—have been shown to inhibit tumor formation in animal studies, and particularly, tumor formation in the lungs. Myristicin has also been shown to activate the enzyme glutathione-S-transferase, which helps attach the molecule glutathione to oxidized molecules that would otherwise do damage in the body. The activity of parsley's volatile oils qualifies it as a "chemoprotective" food, and in particular, a food that can help neutralize particular types of carcinogens (like the benzopyrenes that are part of cigarette smoke and charcoal grill smoke).
A Rich Source of Anti-Oxidant Nutrients
The flavonoids in parsley—especially luteolin—have been shown to function as antioxidants that combine with highly reactive oxygen-containing molecules (called oxygen radicals) and help prevent oxygen-based damage to cells. In addition, extracts from parsley have been used in animal studies to help increase the antioxidant capacity of the blood.
In addition to its volatile oils and flavonoids, parsley is an excellent source of vitamin C and a good source of vitamin A (notably through its concentration of the pro-vitamin A carotenoid, beta-carotene).
Vitamin C has many different functions. It is the body's primary water-soluble antioxidant, rendering harmless otherwise dangerous free radicals in all water-soluble areas of the body. High levels of free radicals contribute to the development and progression of a wide variety of diseases, including atherosclerosis, colon cancer, diabetes, and asthma. This may explain why people who consume healthy amounts of vitamin C-containing foods have reduced risks for all these conditions. Vitamin C is also a powerful anti-inflammatory agent, which explains its usefulness in conditions such as osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis. And since vitamin C is needed for the healthy function of the immune system, it can also be helpful for preventing recurrent ear infections or colds.
Beta-carotene, another important antioxidant, works in the fat-soluble areas of the body. Diets with beta-carotene-rich foods are also associated with a reduced risk for the development and progression of conditions like atherosclerosis, diabetes, and colon cancer. Like vitamin C, beta-carotene may also be helpful in reducing the severity of asthma, osteoarthritis, and rheumatoid arthritis. And beta-carotene is converted by the body to vitamin A, a nutrient so important to a strong immune system that its nickname is the "anti-infective vitamin."
Parsley for a Healthy Heart
Parsley is a good source of folic acid, one of the most important B vitamins. While it plays numerous roles in the body,  one of its most critical roles in relation to cardiovascular health  is its necessary participation in the process through which the body converts homocysteine into benign molecules. Homocysteine is a potentially dangerous molecule that, at high levels, can directly damage blood vessels, and high levels of homocysteine are associated with a significantly increased risk of heart attack and stroke in people with atherosclerosis or diabetic heart disease. Enjoying foods rich in folic acid, like parsley, is an especially good idea for individuals who either have, or wish to prevent, these diseases. Folic acid is also a critical nutrient for proper cell division and is therefore vitally important for cancer-prevention in two areas of the body that contain rapidly dividing cells—the colon, and in women, the cervix.

Protection against Rheumatoid Arthritis
While one study suggests that high doses of supplemental vitamin C makes osteoarthritis, a type of degenerative arthritis that occurs with aging, worse in laboratory animals, another indicates that vitamin C-rich foods, such as parsley, provide humans with protection against inflammatory polyarthritis, a form of rheumatoid arthritis involving two or more joints.
The findings, presented in the Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases were drawn from a study of more than 20,000 subjects who kept diet diaries and were arthritis-free when the study began, and focused on  subjects who developed inflammatory polyarthritis and  similar subjects who remained arthritis-free during the follow-up period.
Subjects who consumed the lowest amounts of vitamin C-rich foods were more than three times more likely to develop arthritis than those who consumed the highest amounts.
So, next time parsley appears on your plate as a garnish, recognize its true worth and partake of its abilities to improve your health. As an added bonus, you'll also enjoy parsley's legendary ability to cleanse your palate and your breath at the end of your meal.
Description
While parsley is a wonderfully nutritious and healing food, it is often under-appreciated. Most people do not realize that this vegetable has more uses than just being a decorative garnish that accompanies restaurant meals. They do not know that parsley is actually a storehouse of nutrients and that it features a delicious green and vibrant taste.
The two most popular types of parsley are curly parsley and Italian flat leaf parsley. The Italian variety has a more fragrant and less bitter taste than the curly variety. There is also another type of parsley known as turnip-rooted (or Hamburg) that is cultivated for its roots, which resemble salsify and burdock. Parsley belongs to the Umbelliferae family of plants, and its Latin name is Petroselinum crispum.
History
Parsley is native to the Mediterranean region of Southern Europe. While it has been cultivated for more than 2,000 years, parsley was used medicinally prior to being consumed as a food. The ancient Greeks held parsley to be sacred, using it to not only adorn victors of athletic contests, but also for decorating the tombs of the deceased. The practice of using parsley as a garnish actually has a long history that can be traced back to the civilization of the ancient Romans.
While it is uncertain when parsley began to be consumed as a seasoning, it seems to be sometime in the Middle Ages in Europe. Some historians credit Charlemagne with its popularization since he had it grown on his estates.
In some countries, the curly leaf variety is more popular. This may have its roots in the ancient preference for this type since people were oftentimes reticent to consume the flat leaf variety because it resembled fool's parsley, a poisonous weed.
Turnip-rooted (or Hamburg) parsley, a relatively new species, having only been developed within the past two hundred years, has only recently begun gaining popularity.
How to Select and Store
Whenever possible, choose fresh parsley over the dried form of the herb since it is superior in flavor. Choose fresh parsley that is deep green in color and looks fresh and crisp. Avoid bunches that have leaves that are wilted or yellow as this indicates that they are either overmature or damaged. Just like with other dried herbs, if you choose to purchase dried parsley flakes, try to select organically grown parsley since this will give you more assurance that the herbs have not been irradiated.
Fresh parsley should be kept in the refrigerator in a plastic bag.  If the parsley is slightly wilted, either sprinkle it lightly with some water or wash it without completely drying it before storing in the refrigerator.
If you have excess flat leaf parsley, you can easily dry it by laying it out in a single layer on a clean kitchen cloth. Once dried, it should be kept in a tightly sealed container in a cool, dark and dry place. Curly leaf parsley is best preserved by freezing, as opposed to drying. Although it will retain most of its flavor, it has a tendency to lose its crispness, so it is best used in recipes without first thawing.
Tips for Preparing and Cooking
Tips for Preparing Parsley
Fresh parsley should be washed right before using since it is highly fragile. The best way to clean it is just like you would spinach. Place it in a bowl of cold water and swish it around with your hands. This will allow any sand or dirt to dislodge. Remove the leaves from the water, empty the bowl, refill it with clean water and repeat this process until no dirt remains in the water.
Since it has a stronger flavor than the curly variety, Italian flat leaf parsley holds up better to cooking and therefore is usually the type preferred for hot dishes. It should be added towards the end of the cooking process so that it can best retain its taste, color and nutritional value.
If you are making a light colored sauce, use the stems from this variety as opposed to the leaves, so the sauce will take on the flavor of parsley but will not be imparted with its green color.
How to Enjoy
A Few Quick Serving Ideas

Combine chopped parsley with bulgur wheat, chopped green onions (scallions), mint leaves, lemon juice and olive oil to make the Middle Eastern classic dish, tabouli.
Add parsley to pesto sauce to add more texture to its green color.
Combine chopped parsley, garlic and lemon zest, and use it as a rub for chicken, lamb and beef.
Use parsley in soups and tomato sauces.
Serve a colorful salad of fennel, orange, cherry tomatoes, pumpkin seeds and parsley leaves.
Chopped parsley can be sprinkled on a host of different recipes, including salads, vegetable sautés and grilled fish.

Introduction to Food Rating System Chart
In order to better help you identify foods that feature a high concentration of nutrients for the calories they contain, we created a Food Rating System. This system allows us to highlight the foods that are especially rich in particular nutrients. The following chart shows the nutrients for which this food is either an excellent, very good, or good source (below the chart you will find a table that explains these qualifications). If a nutrient is not listed in the chart, it does not necessarily mean that the food doesn't contain it.  It simply means that the nutrient is not provided in a sufficient amount or concentration to meet our rating criteria. (To view this food's in-depth nutritional profile that includes values for dozens of nutrients - not just the ones rated as excellent, very good, or good - please use the link below the chart.) To read this chart accurately, you'll need to glance up in the top left corner where you will find the name of the food and the serving size we used to calculate the food's nutrient composition. This serving size will tell you how much of the food you need to eat to obtain the amount of nutrients found in the chart. Now, returning to the chart itself, you can look next to the nutrient name in order to find the nutrient amount it offers, the percent Daily Value (DV%) that this amount represents, the nutrient density that we calculated for this food and nutrient, and the rating we established in our rating system. For most of our nutrient ratings, we adopted the government standards for food labeling that are found in the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's "Reference Values for Nutrition Labeling."

Scientific names: Petroselinum crispum
Common names: Parsley also is known as rock parsley and garden parsley.
Efficacy-safety rating:
ÒÒ...Ethno or other evidence of efficacy.
Safety rating:
●...Little exposure or very minor concerns.
What is Parsley?
Parsley is an annual herb indigenous to the Mediterranean region, but now cultivated worldwide. It has erect stems and bright green leaves. Two cultivars of parsley exist: a curly leaf type and a flat leaf type. Parsley produces an umbel of tiny flowers and characteristic ribbed seeds.
Caution must be used when gathering wild parsley because of the general similarity of its leaves and flowers to 3 common poisonous plants. The first, Aethusa cynapium (dog poison, fool's parsley, small hemlock) may be distinguished from parsley by the shiny, yellow-green underside of the leaves, which are dull in parsley, and the white flowers, which are yellowish in parsley. Similarly, collectors should be aware of Conium maculatum (poison hemlock, water hemlock, poison parsley) and Cicuta maculata (water hemlock). Poison hemlock is a much larger plant than common parsley. Poisonings have occurred when the leaves of Conium were mistaken for parsley and the seeds for anise. Symptoms of Conium and Cicuta poisoning include vomiting, diarrhea, weakness, paralysis, weak pulse, dilated pupils, convulsions, and death.

What is it used for?
Traditional/Ethnobotanical uses
Parsley leaves and roots are popular as condiments and garnish worldwide. In Lebanon, parsley is a major ingredient in the national dish tabbouleh. An average adult may consume as much as 50 g of parsley per meal.
Miscellaneous uses
Parsley has been used as a source of certain vitamins and minerals. Parsley seed was used traditionally as a carminative to decrease flatulence and colic pain. The root was used as a diuretic and the juice to treat kidney ailments. Parsley oil also has been used to regulate menstrual flow in the treatment of amenorrhea and dysmenorrhea, and is purported to be an abortive. Bruised leaves have been used to treat tumors, insect bites, lice, skin parasites, and contusions. At one time, parsley tea was used to treat dysentery and gallstones. Other reported traditional uses include treatment of diseases of the prostate, liver, and spleen. Historically, parsley also has been used in the treatment of anemia, arthritis, and cancers, as an expectorant, antimicrobial, aphrodisiac, hypotensive, diuretic, and laxative. It also has been used as a scalp lotion to stimulate hair growth. However, there have been no clinical trials to confirm these uses.
What is the recommended dosage?
Parsley has been used at daily doses of 6 g. However, no clinical studies have been found that support this dose. The essential oil should not be used because of toxicity.
How safe is it?
Contraindications
Contraindications have not yet been identified.
Pregnancy/nursing
Generally recognized as safe when used as food. Safety and efficacy for dosages above those in foods are unproven and should be avoided. Emmenagogue (to stimulate menstrual flow) and abortive effects in higher doses.
Interactions
None well documented.
Side Effects
Adverse effects from the ingestion of parsley oil include headache, giddiness, loss of balance, convulsions, and renal damage. The psoralen compounds found in parsley have been linked to a photodermatitis reaction found among parsley cutters.
Toxicities
While no major toxicities have been reported with the use of parsley, pregnant women should not take parsley because of possible uterotonic effects.

Q:

Do jetpacks exist?



A:
There are multiple examples of functional jetpack technology, though not all of these machines make use of jet propulsion technology, and very few of them approach the functionality of those jet packs seen in science fiction or cartoons. Some real-life jet packs only make very limited flights, while others are more like machine-powered parachutes that don't have the ability to lift off from the ground independently.

Q:
Why do airplanes take longer to fly west than east?


A:
Airplanes take longer to fly west than east because of high-altitude winds that blow from west to east. The Earth has four such wind patterns, and they are called jet streams. When planes fly from west to east, the jet stream helps accelerate the aircraft. When they fly in the opposite direction, the planes cannot fly as fast into the face of the wind.

Q:
What causes someone to sleep with their eyes open?


A:
