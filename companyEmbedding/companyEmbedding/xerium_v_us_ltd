Forming Fabrics
Decades ago, Xerium introduced the industry to synthetic forming fabric technology at a time when bronze wires were the standard. Shortly after, we then pioneered "X-Weave" extra shute product technology. Xerium also invented and introduced "SSB" class triple layer technology known as Huytexx delivering unprecedented machine performance and sheet quality.
Press Felts
Xerium's ancestors manufactured metal wires and woolen press felts two centuries ago, and quickly established an excellent reputation in the paper industry. As a result of more demanding paper machines coming online in recent years Xerium has set entirely new standards as the market-leading innovator in endless and seam felt technology.  
Dryer Fabrics
Xerium offers a wide variety of dryer fabrics for every position on the machine covering all paper grades.  Our woven styles are provided with pin seams or pin-spiral seams to fit the position requirements. In addition, we offer an excellent portfolio of spiral dryer fabrics for those applications with special requirements. 
Roll Covers
Xerium's Stowe Woodward roll cover product portfolio includes premium performance rubber, polyurethane, and composite technology engineered specifically for each application. Our innovative products are the standard by which roll technology is measured!  
Spreader Rolls
Xerium's Stowe and Mount Hope bowed spreader rolls products provide high-performance web and fabric smoothing for the most demanding applications. In addition, our portfolio includes all metal rolls as well as specially engineered sleeves for high temperature and high speed applications.
SMART® Technology
Xerium's roll product portfolio includes Stowe roll covers, Stowe and Mount Hope bowed spreader rolls, and SMART® Technology. Our roll cover products are engineered for each papermaking machine.  Our patented SMART® Technology uses embedded sensors in roll covers to dynamically measure nip conditions across numerous sections of the machine.
Mechanical Services
Xerium offers a full range of roll-related repairs and upgrades from On-the-Run (OTR) Roll Analysis, vibration analysis, internal inspection & repair, optical & laser alignment, suction box overhauls, to new shell constructions and much more.

SCHEDULE 4.14 



Environmental Matters 

1. In connection with closure of certain manufacturing facilities under its restructuring 
program in 2004 the Borrower conducted environmental site assessments which indicated 
potential contamination at the Wake Forest, NC and Farmville, VA sites. The Borrower 
has sold the Wake Forest, NC facility and completed the remediation of that site based 
upon the requirements of the applicable North Carolina regulatory authority. The 
Borrower is attempting to sell the Farmville, VA site and believes that it has substantially 
completed the remediation of this site and does not expect that any future costs related to 
the environmental remediation of this site would be material. 


2. The Borrower received a letter from the United States Environmental Protection Agency 
dated May 4, 2004 and addressed to Weavexx, a brand used by the Borrower and part of 
the name of one of the Borrower’s subsidiaries. The letter seeks information about 
business transactions between Huyck Felt Co. and Safety Light Corporation (including 
Safety Light Corporation’s predecessors and affiliates), and the disposal of hazardous 
substances and/or radioactive wastes at Safety Light Corporation’s site in Bloomsburg, 
Pennsylvania between 1945 and the present. The Borrower’s response to the EPA was 
dated July 30, 2004 and explained that the Borrower has no information about a 
relationship with Safety Light Corporation or any related hazardous substances. 


3. The Borrower has never used asbestos in its manufacturing process. However, in the past 
other manufacturers of clothing did sometimes use asbestos and, as a result, have been 
named as defendants in lawsuits in the United States brought by individuals alleging 
injuries caused by such use of asbestos. While the Borrower has also been named as a 
defendant in a number of cases, it has been able to show that it did not use asbestos and, 
as a result, has typically been successful in getting dismissed from such lawsuits. 
Accordingly, the Borrower does not anticipate incurring any material liabilities for 
asbestos-related claims. 

4. The U.S. federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability 
Act, as amended (“CERCLA”) provides for response to, and, in some instances, joint and 
several liability for releases of hazardous substances into the environment. The Borrower 
has been identified as a potentially responsible party under CERCLA or similar state 
requirements for the following two off-site locations to date: the Avanti Corporation Site, 
Indianapolis, IN; Maxey Flats Nuclear Disposal Site, Hillsboro, KY. The Borrower has 
also disclosed that it has received a 104(e) information request concerning the Safety 
Light Corporation site in Pennsylvania.

Style Scores:



NA Value | NA Growth | NA Momentum | NA VGM                


The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.


Value Score
A


Growth Score
A


Momentum Score
A


VGM Score
A


Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

Xerium unveils roll product Photo: Xerium Technologies
                Published by
            Steven Anderson
 - 21 Mar 2011
            Xerium Technologies, Inc., a global manufacturer of industrial textiles and rolls used primarily in the paper production process, recently announced full commercial availability of a technologically advanced new series of roll cover products designed for improved machine performance, better wear and longer, more efficient product life. The latest range of roll cover products are designed to reduce operational costs and maximize the output of existing equipment, while enhancing product customization capabilities for each individual customer.Roll covers, which are used to coat the large machine cylinders that transport raw paper along the lengthy belts while the paper is formed, pressed, and dried, are critical to the quality of paper as it is produced. With this latest series of advanced technology roll covers, Xerium continues to work with its paper manufacturing customers to maximize output and reduce operational costs."We continue to work very closely with our customers to advance the technology of paper manufacturing by enabling greater efficiency, leaner inventories, and lower costs," said Stephen R. Light, President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman. "The high-ROI class of products that we're developing is in direct response to manufacturers' demands for higher performance at lower costs."
