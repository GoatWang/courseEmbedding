CloudMine and Sway Health
Accelerate Mobility and Compliance
Case Study: Preventative Care and Counseling







Situation
Sway health set out to build an application to make tobacco counseling effortless for the user. Sway health needed a databasing solution that was HIPAA compliant, affordable and would help to accelerate development time.










Solution
CloudMine is Sway Health’s HIPAA compliant data store. Sway Health is also leveraging CloudMine for the out-of-the-box functionality including user access controls and profile management.
 
 





 
“From day one, our contacts at Cloudmine have been absolutely outstanding at maintaining clear and concise communicating with our team. Folks at Cloudmine are always available to answer questions, loop us into the product roadmap, and now, even syndicate deal-flow.”
–Kevin DePopas, CEO, Sway Health


Results
Leveraging CloudMine’s Development Platform Sway Health has been able to speed up development of their product internally and leverage CloudMine’s out-of-the-box dev ops and functionality and focus developer’s time instead on additional functionality their clients were looking for.







 





About the Company
During their third year of medical school at Georgetown University, co-founders Eric DePopas and Jesse Smith recognized a need for a more efficient way to deliver time-consuming preventive counseling. Fellow co-founder, Kevin DePopas, later joined the team to lead product development and guide Sway to market. At Sway Health, we are passionate about driving innovation in digital health and contributing to the future of patient-centered medicine.

What We're Building




Sway is focused on helping healthcare providers improve patient care and boost revenue by streamlining preventive counseling for issues like tobacco dependence, weight management, drug abuse, etc.
The premise of Sway is that providers don't counsel patients because it takes too much time. To combat this, Sway:
• Eliminates the upfront Q&A that precedes a normal counseling session by ingesting patient information before a visit;
• Alleviate the physician responsibility to counsel by empowering mid-levels and nurses;
• Ensure providers get paid by automating notes and billing for preventive services; and
• Reduce the follow-up burden with complete patient resources, including virtual counseling delivered by Sway.
While our initial focus is on tobacco cessation, our platform is capable of optimizing any type of preventive counseling. To begin improving healthcare in the U.S., we have to make it easier for providers to help their patients make life-changing preventative decisions.
