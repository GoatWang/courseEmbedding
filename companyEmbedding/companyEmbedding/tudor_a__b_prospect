Friendly staff too.Verified Hotels.com guest review1 night trip with friends Apr 29, 2017Lindaau5.0 / 5Outstanding"Great Stay"Relaxing Stay, Central to attractions. 5 Stars!Verified Hotels.com guest review1 night family trip Apr 29, 2017A Travellerau3.0 / 5Good"Hotel was easy to find travelling from the airport"The room was fine.  The bed was comfortable.  There was a good restaurant with decent prices off the casino area.  Only issue was the morning after we arrived, workmen were working on the unit next door and were very noisy starting at 7:00 A.M.  Management was advised.Verified Expedia guest reviewOther trip Apr 25, 2017Pca2.0 / 5Fair"Dusty room"Family room was very, very dusty; one towel short for the number of guests, which happened last time, too; caked on urine stains at the back of the toilet seat; new shower and bath, but the same old rusty shower rail (can't figure that out!). Verified Wotif guest reviewOther trip Apr 21, 2017A Travellerau3.0 / 5Good"Nice Hotel and handy to town"A litle disconcerting booking in as a family at  the bar as opposed to the reception area where one would expect to book in, etc, the room was very clean and tidy, comfortable, good value for money, a comfortable night spent here Verified Wotif guest reviewFamily trip Apr 20, 2017A Travellerau5.0 / 5Outstanding"We were close to shops and restaurant."We had a great stay and we could get easily to tourist attractions.Verified Lastminute guest reviewOther trip Apr 19, 2017A Travellerau5.0 / 5Outstanding"Perfect for launching a Tasmania holiday"We arrived late and left early next morning - this was the perfect spot.  Easy to find, close enough to the airport, clean, serviceable and everything we needed.  We were unable to dine at the hotel but the local supermarket was just a short walk away and had all we needed.  The staff also rang us when we were on our way to make arrangements to pick up keys - we were delighted at this extra touch as our flights were delayed and our arrival now quite late into the evening.Verified Expedia guest reviewFamily trip Apr 17, 2017A Travellerau5.0 / 5Outstanding"Hotel I will stay again"Loved the hotel.  Staff was friendly,  room was comfortable. Bathroom had a huge shower,  heated floor and heated towel rack.
We were not impressed with the bistro food - too expensive and the prawns I had was tasteless and my husband steak was over cooked.   It was great to have a Super IGA next door and a few food places. Definitely stay again. Verified Wotif guest reviewOther trip Apr 16, 2017A Travellerau4.0 / 5Excellent"Very nice and close to shops"Great hotel, particularly families with children.

Highly recommend and will stay again. Verified Wotif guest reviewOther trip Mar 26, 2017A Travellerau4.0 / 5Excellent"Ok for the money "Our room had been updated so that was good. It was clean too. But what the motel lacks however is some garden areas. It's asphalt or concrete everywhere. Just a bit dreary. And all the guests and staff that smoke do so close to rooms where people don't smoke. So if your a non smoker it's not pleasent. It's more of a practical place to stay not overly a pleasant place to stay. But ok for the cost.Verified Wotif guest reviewOther trip Mar 21, 2017A Travellerau5.0 / 5OutstandingWe were travelling from Hobart late afternoon and became held up in traffic.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
