	Principal Investment Strategy






	As a money market fund, the
	fund is subject to the maturity, quality, liquidity and diversification requirements of Rule 2a-7 under
	the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, which are designed to help money market funds maintain
	a stable share price of $1.00. To pursue its goal, the fund normally invests at least 80% of its net
	assets, plus any borrowings for investment purposes, in short-term, high quality municipal obligations
	that provide income exempt from federal and New Jersey state income taxes. The fund also may invest
	in high quality, short-term structured notes, which are derivative instruments whose value is tied to
	underlying municipal obligations.




	Although the fund seeks to provide income exempt from federal and
	New Jersey state income taxes, income from some of the funds holdings may be subject to the federal
	alternative minimum tax.









	Principal Risks






	An investment
	in the fund is not a bank deposit. It is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance
	Corporation (FDIC) or any other government agency. Although the fund seeks to preserve the value of
	your investment at $1.00 per share, it is possible to lose money by investing in the fund.




	The fund's
	yield will fluctuate as the short-term securities in its portfolio mature and the proceeds are reinvested
	in securities with different interest rates. Additionally, while the fund has maintained a constant
	share price since inception, and will continue to try to do so, neither The Dreyfus Corporation nor its
	affiliates are required to make a capital infusion, enter into a capital support agreement or take other
	actions to prevent the fund's share price from falling below $1.00. The following are the principal
	risks that could reduce the fund's income level and/or share price:





	·





	 






	Interest rate risk.




	This risk refers
	to the decline in the prices of fixed-income securities that may accompany a rise in the overall level
	of interest rates. A sharp and unexpected rise in interest rates could cause a money market fund's share
	price to drop below a dollar. A low interest rate environment may prevent the fund from providing a
	positive yield or paying fund expenses out of fund assets and could impair the fund's ability to maintain
	a stable net asset value.






	1





	 





	·





	 






	Credit risk.




	Failure of an issuer to make timely interest or principal payments,
	or a decline or perception of a decline in the credit quality of a security, can cause the security's
	price to fall. Although the fund invests only in high quality debt securities, any of the fund's holdings
	could have its credit rating downgraded or could default. The credit quality and prices of the securities
	held by the fund can change rapidly in certain market environments, and the default or a significant
	price decline of a single holding could impair the fund's ability to maintain a stable net asset value.





	·





	 






	Liquidity risk.




	When
	there is little or no active trading market for specific types of securities, it can become more difficult
	to sell the securities in a timely manner at or near their perceived value. In such a market, the value
	of such securities may fall dramatically, potentially impairing the fund's ability to maintain a stable
	net asset value, even during periods of declining interest rates. Also, during such periods, redemptions
	by a few large investors in the fund may impair the fund's ability to maintain a stable net asset value
	and adversely affect remaining fund shareholders.





	·





	 






	Regulatory risk




	. The Securities and
	Exchange Commission has adopted amendments to the rules governing money market funds that may change
	the way that the fund, and similar money market funds, operate. Under the amended rules, as of October
	14, 2016, the share price of money market funds that will be designated as "institutional prime" or "institutional
	municipal" type money funds would fluctuate and, as a result, shares of those funds when sold may be
	worth more or less than their original purchase price. In addition, as of October 14, 2016, all prime
	and all municipal money market funds become subject to a regime of liquidity fees imposed upon the sale
	of their shares or the temporary suspension of redemptions, in each case triggered (and subject to board
	determination) by the percentage of a fund's Weekly Liquid Assets falling below certain minimums as defined
	in amended Rule 2a-7. The amendments impose additional regulatory and reporting requirements on all
	money market funds, which generally are expected to be implemented by the funds by April 14, 2016. As
	a result of the amendments, additional expenses may be incurred by the fund.





	·





	 






	Municipal securities
	risk




	. The amount of public information available about municipal securities is generally less
	than that for corporate equities or bonds. Special factors, such as legislative changes, and state and
	local economic and business developments, may adversely affect the yield and/or value of the fund's investments
	in municipal securities. Other factors include the general conditions of the municipal securities market,
	the size of the particular offering, the maturity of the obligation and the rating of the issue. Changes
	in economic, business or political conditions relating to a particular municipal project, municipality,
	or state, territory or possession of the United States in which the fund invests may have an impact on
	the fund's ability to maintain a stable net asset value.





	·





	 






	Tax risk.




	To be tax-exempt, municipal
	obligations generally must meet certain regulatory requirements. If any such municipal obligation fails
	to meet these regulatory requirements, the interest received by the fund from its investment in such
	obligations and distributed to fund shareholders will be taxable.





	·





	 






	Structured notes risk.




	Structured notes,
	a type of derivative instrument, can be volatile, and the possibility of default by the financial institution
	or counterparty may be greater for these instruments than for other types of money market instruments.
	Structured notes typically are purchased in privately negotiated transactions from financial institutions
	and, thus, an active trading market for such instruments may not exist.





	·





	 






	State-specific risk.




	The fund is subject
	to the risk that New Jersey's economy, and the revenues underlying its municipal obligations, may decline.
	Investing primarily in a single state makes the fund more sensitive to risks specific to the state and
	may magnify other risks.





	·





	 






	Non-diversification risk.




	The fund
	is non-diversified, which means that the fund may invest a relatively high percentage of its assets in
	a limited number of issuers. Therefore, the fund's performance may be more vulnerable to changes in
	the market value of a single issuer or group of issuers and more susceptible to risks associated with
	a single economic, political or regulatory occurrence than a diversified fund.









	Performance






	The
	following bar chart and table provide some indication of the risks of investing in the fund. The bar
	chart shows changes in the performance of the fund's Class A shares from year to year. The table shows

	If you invested in the fund through a third party, such as a bank, broker-dealer or financial adviser,
	you may mail your request to sell shares to Dreyfus Institutional Department, P.O. Box 9882, Providence,
	Rhode Island 02940-8082. If you invested directly through the fund, you may mail your request to sell
	shares to Dreyfus Shareholder Services, P.O. Box 9879, Providence, Rhode Island 02940-8079.






	Tax Information






	The
	fund anticipates that dividends paid by the fund generally will be exempt from federal and New Jersey
	state income taxes. However, the fund may realize and distribute taxable income and capital gains from
	time to time as a result of the funds normal investment activities.






	Payments to
	Broker-Dealers and Other Financial Intermediaries






	If you purchase shares through
	a broker-dealer or other financial intermediary (such as a bank), the fund and its related companies
	may pay the intermediary for the sale of fund shares and related services. These payments may create
	a conflict of interest by influencing the broker-dealer or other intermediary and your salesperson to
	recommend the fund over another investment. Ask your salesperson or visit your financial intermediary's
	website for more information.

	Fund Details









	Goal and Approach






	The fund seeks as high a level
	of current income exempt from federal New Jersey state income taxes, consistent with the preservation
	of capital and the maintenance of liquidity. As a money market fund, the fund is subject to the maturity,
	quality, liquidity and diversification requirements of Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act of
	1940, as amended, which are designed to help money market funds maintain a stable share price of $1.00.




	To
	pursue its goal, the fund normally invests at least 80% of its net assets, plus any borrowings for investment
	purposes, in short-term, high quality municipal obligations that provide income exempt from federal New
	Jersey state income taxes. The fund also may invest in high quality, short-term structured notes, which
	are derivative instruments whose value is tied to underlying municipal obligations.




	While the
	fund generally invests solely in securities with the highest credit rating or the unrated equivalent
	as determined by Dreyfus, it may invest up to 3% of its assets in securities with the second-highest
	credit rating that mature in 45 days or less.




	The fund is required to hold at least 30% of
	its assets in cash, U.S. Treasury securities, certain other government securities with remaining maturities
	of 60 days or less, or securities that can readily be converted into cash within five business days.
	The maximum weighted average maturity of the fund's portfolio is 60 days and the maximum weighted average
	life to maturity of the fund's portfolio is 120 days.




	Although the fund seeks to
	provide income exempt from federal New Jersey state income taxes, income from some of the fund's holdings
	may be subject to the federal alternative minimum tax. The fund also may invest temporarily in high
	quality, taxable money market instruments, including when the portfolio manager believes acceptable
	New Jersey State municipal obligations are not available for investment. During such periods, the fund
	may not achieve its investment objective. In addition, a portion of the funds assets may be invested
	in short-term, high quality municipal obligations that do not pay income that is exempt from New Jersey
	state income taxes.




	In response to liquidity needs or unusual market conditions, the
	fund may hold all or a significant portion of its total assets in cash for temporary defensive purposes.
	This may result in a lower current yield and prevent the fund from achieving its investment objective.




	The
	fund is non-diversified.






	Investment Risks








	An investment
	in the fund is not a bank deposit. It is not insured or guaranteed by the FDIC or any other government
	agency. Although the fund seeks to preserve the value of your investment at $1.00 per share, it is possible
	to lose money by investing in the fund.




	The fund's yield will fluctuate as the short-term
	securities in its portfolio mature and the proceeds are reinvested in securities with different interest
	rates. Additionally, while the fund has maintained a constant share price since inception, and will
	continue to try to do so, neither The Dreyfus Corporation nor its affiliates are required to make a capital
	infusion, enter into a capital support agreement or take other actions to prevent the fund's share price
	from falling below $1.00. The following are the principal risks that could reduce the fund's income
	level and/or share price:





	·





	 






	Interest rate risk.




	This risk refers
	to the decline in the prices of fixed-income securities that may accompany a rise in the overall level
	of interest rates. A sharp and unexpected rise in interest rates could cause a money market fund's share
	price to drop below a dollar. A low interest rate environment may prevent the fund from providing a
	positive yield or paying fund expenses out of fund assets and could impair the fund's ability to maintain
	a stable net asset value.





	·





	 






	Credit risk.




	Failure of an issuer to
	make timely interest or principal payments, or a decline or perception of a decline in the credit quality
	of a security, can cause the security's price to fall. Although the fund invests only in high quality
	debt securities, any of the fund's holdings could have its credit rating downgraded or could default.
	The credit quality and prices of the securities held by the fund can change rapidly in certain market
	environments, and the default or a significant price decline of a single holding could impair the fund's
	ability to maintain a stable net asset value.

	their perceived value. In such a market, the value of such securities may fall dramatically, potentially
	impairing the fund's ability to maintain a stable net asset value, even during periods of declining interest

	ability to maintain a stable net asset value and adversely affect remaining fund shareholders.

	Regulatory risk




	.
	The Securities and Exchange Commission has adopted amendments to the rules governing money market funds
	that may change the way that the fund, and similar money market funds, operate. Under the amended rules,
	as of October 14, 2016, the share price of money market funds that will be designated as "institutional
	prime" or "institutional municipal" type money funds would fluctuate and, as a result, shares of those
	funds when sold may be worth more or less than their original purchase price. In addition, as of October
	14, 2016, all prime and all municipal money market funds become subject to a regime of liquidity fees
	imposed upon the sale of their shares or the temporary suspension of redemptions, in each case triggered
	(and subject to board determination) by the percentage of a fund's Weekly Liquid Assets falling below
	certain minimums as defined in amended Rule 2a-7. The amendments impose additional regulatory and reporting
	requirements on all money market funds, which generally are expected to be implemented by the funds by
	April 14, 2016. As a result of the amendments, additional expenses may be incurred by the fund.

	Municipal securities
	risk




	. The amount of public information available about municipal securities is generally less
	than that for corporate equities or bonds. Special factors, such as legislative changes, and state and
	local economic and business developments, may adversely affect the yield and/or value of the fund's investments
	in municipal securities. Other factors include the general conditions of the municipal securities market,
	the size of the particular offering, the maturity of the obligation and the rating of the issue. Changes
	in economic, business or political conditions relating to a particular municipal project, municipality,
	or state, territory or possession of the United States in which the fund invests may have an impact on
	the fund's ability to maintain a stable net asset value.





	·





	 






	Tax risk.




	To be tax-exempt, municipal
	obligations generally must meet certain regulatory requirements. If any such municipal obligation fails
	to meet these regulatory requirements, the interest received by the fund from its investment in such
	obligations and distributed to fund shareholders will be taxable.

	Structured notes risk.




	Structured notes,
	a type of derivative instrument, can be volatile, and the possibility of default by the financial institution
	or counterparty may be greater for these instruments than for other types of money market instruments.
	Structured notes typically are purchased in privately negotiated transactions from financial institutions
	and, thus, an active trading market for such instruments may not exist.

	State-specific risk




	. The fund is subject
	to the risk that New Jersey's economy, and the revenues underlying its municipal obligations, may decline.
	Investing primarily in a single state makes the fund more sensitive to risks specific to the state and
	may magnify other risks.

	Non-diversification risk




	. The fund
	is non-diversified, which means that the fund may invest a relatively high percentage of its assets in
	a limited number of issuers. Therefore, the fund's performance may be more vulnerable to changes in
	the market value of a single issuer or group of issuers and more susceptible to risks associated with
	a single economic, political or regulatory occurrence than a diversified fund.









	Management








	The investment adviser for the fund is The Dreyfus Corporation, 200 Park Avenue, New York,
	New York 10166. Founded in 1947, Dreyfus manages approximately $245 billion in 165 mutual fund portfolios.
	For the past fiscal year, the fund paid Dreyfus a management fee at the annual rate of 0.08% of the
	fund's average daily net assets. A discussion regarding the basis for the board's approving the fund's
	management agreement with Dreyfus is available in the fund's annual report for the fiscal year ended
	November 30, 2014. Dreyfus is the primary mutual fund business of The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation
	(BNY Mellon), a global financial services company focused on helping clients manage and service their
	financial assets, operating in 35 countries and serving more than 100 markets. BNY Mellon is a leading
	investment management and investment services company, uniquely focused to help clients manage and move
	their financial assets in the rapidly changing global marketplace. BNY Mellon has $28.5 trillion in
	assets under custody and administration and $1.6 trillion in assets under management. BNY Mellon is
	the corporate brand of The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation. BNY Mellon Investment Management is
	one of the world's leading investment management organizations, and one of the top U.S. wealth managers,
	encompassing BNY Mellon's affiliated investment management firms, wealth management services and global
	distribution companies. Additional information is available at

	The Dreyfus asset management philosophy is based on the belief that discipline and consistency
	are important to investment success. For each fund, Dreyfus seeks to establish clear guidelines for
	portfolio management and to be systematic in making decisions. This approach is designed to provide
	each fund with a distinct, stable identity.




	MBSC Securities Corporation (MBSC), a wholly-owned
	subsidiary of Dreyfus, serves as distributor of the fund and of the other funds in the Dreyfus Family
	of Funds. Any Rule 12b-1 fees and shareholder services fees, as applicable, are paid to MBSC for financing
	the sale and distribution of fund shares and for providing shareholder account service and maintenance,
	respectively. Dreyfus or MBSC may provide cash payments out of its own resources to financial intermediaries
	that sell shares of funds in the Dreyfus Family of Funds or provide other services. Such payments are
	separate from any sales charges, 12b-1 fees and/or shareholder services fees or other expenses that may
	be paid by a fund to those intermediaries. Because those payments are not made by fund shareholders
	or the fund, the fund's total expense ratio will not be affected by any such payments. These payments
	may be made to intermediaries, including affiliates, that provide shareholder servicing, sub-administration,
	recordkeeping and/or sub-transfer agency services, marketing support and/or access to sales meetings,
	sales representatives and management representatives of the financial intermediary. Cash compensation
	also may be paid from Dreyfus' or MBSC's own resources to intermediaries for inclusion of a fund on a
	sales list, including a preferred or select sales list or in other sales programs. These payments sometimes
	are referred to as "revenue sharing." From time to time, Dreyfus or MBSC also may provide cash or non-cash
	compensation to financial intermediaries or their representatives in the form of occasional gifts; occasional
	meals, tickets or other entertainment; support for due diligence trips; educational conference sponsorships;
	support for recognition programs; technology or infrastructure support; and other forms of cash or non-cash
	compensation permissible under broker-dealer regulations. In some cases, these payments or compensation
	may create an incentive for a financial intermediary or its employees to recommend or sell shares of
	the fund to you. Please contact your financial representative for details about any payments they or
	their firm may receive in connection with the sale of fund shares or the provision of services to the
	fund.




	Class A shares of the fund are subject to an annual shareholder services fee of up to
	.25% to reimburse the fund's distributor for shareholder account service and maintenance expenses.




	The
	fund, Dreyfus and MBSC have each adopted a code of ethics that permits its personnel, subject to such
	code, to invest in securities, including securities that may be purchased or held by the fund. Each
	code of ethics restricts the personal securities transactions of employees, and requires portfolio managers
	and other investment personnel to comply with the code's preclearance and disclosure procedures. The
	primary purpose of the respective codes is to ensure that personal trading by employees does not disadvantage
	any fund managed by Dreyfus or its affiliates.

	Shareholder Guide









	Buying and Selling Shares








	You pay no
	sales charges to invest in Class A shares of the fund. Your price for Class A shares is the net asset
	value (NAV) per share, which is calculated as of 12:00 noon Eastern time on days the New York Stock Exchange
	is open for regular business. Your order will be priced at the next NAV calculated after your order
	is received in proper form by the fund's transfer agent or other authorized entity.




	The fund's
	investments are valued at amortized cost, which does not take into account unrealized gains or losses.
	As a result, portfolio securities are valued at their acquisition cost, adjusted over time based on
	the discounts or premiums reflected in their purchase price. The fund uses the amortized cost method
	of valuation pursuant to Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, in order to
	be able to maintain a share price of $1.00. Because the fund seeks tax exempt income, it is not recommended
	for purchase in IRAs or other qualified retirement plans.




	When calculating its NAV, the
	fund compares the NAV using amortized cost to its NAV using available market quotations or market equivalents,
	which generally are provided by an independent pricing service approved by the fund's board. The pricing
	service's procedures are reviewed under the general supervision of the board.

	General Policies






	The
	fund and the fund's transfer agent are authorized to act on telephone or online instructions from any
	person representing himself or herself to be you and reasonably believed by the fund or the transfer
	agent to be genuine. You may be responsible for any fraudulent telephone or online order as long as
	the fund or the fund's transfer agent (as applicable) takes reasonable measures to confirm that the instructions
	are genuine.




	All shareholder services and privileges offered to shareholders may be modified or terminated
	at any time, except as otherwise stated in the fund's Statement of Additional Information (SAI). Please
	see the fund's SAI for additional information on buying and selling shares, privileges and other shareholder
	services.






	8





	 




	If you invest through a financial intermediary (rather than directly through the fund),
	the policies and fees may be different than those described herein. Banks, brokers, financial advisers
	and financial supermarkets may charge transaction fees and may set different minimum investments or limitations
	on buying or selling shares. Please consult your financial representative.




	Money market
	funds generally are used by investors for short-term investments, often in place of bank checking or
	savings accounts, or for cash management purposes. Investors value the ability to add and withdraw their
	funds quickly, without restriction. For this reason, although Dreyfus discourages excessive trading
	and other abusive trading practices, the fund has not adopted policies and procedures, or imposed redemption
	fees or other restrictions such as minimum holding periods, to deter frequent purchases and redemptions
	of fund shares. Dreyfus also believes that money market funds, such as the fund, are not targets of
	abusive trading practices, because money market funds seek to maintain a $1.00 per share price and typically
	do not fluctuate in value based on market prices. However, frequent purchases and redemptions of the
	fund's shares could increase the fund's transaction costs, such as market spreads and custodial fees,
	and may interfere with the efficient management of the fund's portfolio, which could detract from the
	fund's performance. Accordingly, the fund reserves the right to reject any purchase or exchange request
	in whole or in part. Funds in the Dreyfus Family of Funds that are not money market mutual funds have
	approved policies and procedures that are intended to discourage and prevent abusive trading practices
	in those mutual funds, which may apply to exchanges from or into the fund. If you plan to exchange your
	fund shares for shares of another Dreyfus fund, please read the prospectus of that other Dreyfus fund
	for more information.




	The fund also reserves the right to:





	·





	 




	change
	or discontinue fund exchanges, or temporarily suspend exchanges during unusual market conditions





	·





	 




	change
	its minimum or maximum investment amounts





	·





	 




	delay sending
	out redemption proceeds for up to seven days (generally applies only during unusual market conditions
	or in cases of very large redemptions or excessive trading)





	·





	 




	"redeem
	in kind," or make payments in securities rather than cash, if the amount redeemed is large enough to
	affect fund operations (for example, if it exceeds 1% of the fund's assets)




	The fund
	also may process purchase and sale orders and calculate its NAV on days the fund's primary trading markets
	are open and the fund's management determines to do so.





	Small Account Policies





	To
	offset the relatively higher costs of servicing smaller accounts, the fund charges regular accounts with
	balances below $2,000 an annual fee of $12. The fee will be imposed during the fourth quarter of each
	calendar year.




	The fee will be waived for: any investor whose aggregate Dreyfus mutual fund investments
	total at least $25,000; accounts participating in automatic investment programs; and accounts opened
	through a financial institution.




	If your account falls below $500, the fund may ask you to increase
	your balance. If it is still below $500 after 45 days, the fund may close your account and send you
	the proceeds.





	Escheatment





	If your account is deemed "abandoned" or "unclaimed" under state
	law, the fund may be required to "escheat" or transfer the assets in your account to the applicable state's
	unclaimed property administration. The state may sell escheated shares and, if you subsequently seek
	to reclaim your proceeds of liquidation from the state, you may only be able to recover the amount received
	when the shares were sold. It is your responsibility to ensure that you maintain a correct address for
	your account, keep your account active by contacting the fund's transfer agent or distributor by mail
	or telephone or accessing your account through the fund's website at least once a year, and promptly
	cash all checks for dividends, capital gains and redemptions. The fund, the fund's transfer agent and
	Dreyfus and its affiliates will not be liable to shareholders or their representatives for good faith
	compliance with state escheatment laws.









	Distributions and Taxes








	The
	fund earns dividends, interest and other income from its investments, and distributes this income (less
	expenses) to shareholders as dividends. The fund also realizes capital gains from its investments, and
	distributes these gains (less any losses) to shareholders as capital gain distributions. The fund normally
	pays dividends monthly and capital gain distributions, if any, annually. Fund dividends and capital
	gain distributions will be reinvested in the fund unless you instruct the fund otherwise. There are
	no fees or sales charges on reinvestments.






	9





	 




	The fund anticipates that dividends paid by the fund generally will be exempt from federal
	and New Jersey state income taxes. However, the fund may realize and distribute taxable income and capital
	gains from time to time as a result of the funds normal investment activities. For New Jersey
	state personal income tax purposes, distributions derived from interest on municipal securities of New
	Jersey issuers and from interest on qualifying securities issued by U.S. territories and possessions
	are generally exempt from tax. Distributions that are federally taxable as ordinary income or capital
	gains are generally subject to New Jersey state personal income taxes.




	The tax status of any distribution
	generally is the same regardless of how long you have been in the fund and whether you reinvest your
	distributions or take them in cash.




	Your sale of shares, including exchanges into
	other funds, may result in a capital gain or loss for tax purposes. A capital gain or loss on your investment
	in the fund generally is the difference between the cost of your shares and the amount you receive when
	you sell them.




	The tax status of your distributions will be detailed in your annual tax statement from
	the fund. Because everyone's tax situation is unique, please consult your tax adviser before investing.

	you can exchange shares worth $500 or more (no minimum for retirement accounts) into shares of the same
	class, or another class in which you are eligible to invest, of another fund in the Dreyfus Family of
	Funds. You can request your exchange by calling 1-800-DREYFUS (inside the U.S. only) or your financial
	representative. Be sure to read the current prospectus for any fund into which you are exchanging before
	investing. Any new account established through an exchange generally will have the same privileges as
	your original account (as long as they are available). There is currently no fee for exchanges, although
	you may be charged a sales load when exchanging into any fund that has one.




	Your exchange
	request will be processed on the same business day it is received in proper form, provided that each
	fund is open at the time of the request. If the exchange is accepted at a time of day after one or both
	of the funds is closed (i.e., at a time after the NAV for the fund has been calculated for that business
	day), the exchange will be processed on the next business day. See the SAI for more information regarding
	exchanges.

TESTIMONIALS "We are very happy with our compactor on our riverboat the Creole Queen. We've had this machine on board for the past few years and it's the most reliable piece of equipment I've ever seen. We use it every day, it still looks brand new and it has had a revolutionary impact on our operation. You offer a wonderful product."

"I never hesitate to recommend our Vertical Trash Compactor because it does everything your brochure represents it to accomplish. I can't imagine anyone in the restaurant business not utilizing this apparatus. It really has become one of my proudest restaurant possessions. It works so smooth that I almost feel smug when I see all the gigantic trash containers for other restaurants."

“Our disposal costs have dropped which at least covers the cost of the compactors. Aside from the monetary aspect, the compactors allow the stores to be considerably cleaner.Clean-up at night is much easier because we have no trash cluttering up the back room of the store. All in all, we are very pleased with the compactors.”
Doug GehrigMcDonalds

“We would like to thank the great service of Compactors Inc. We currently have on board the Vertical Trash Compactor model 4500SS. It has been a tremendous help with the recycling of our trash. The machine works great and is very friendly to use. We have been using this equipment for about four of five years now. When we need parts due to this machine being used over 30 times on a daily basis, Compactors Inc. is there for logistic support and they even give credit back for certain parts. My experience working with Compactors Inc. is a very reliable company to do business with. So thank you again for the great service from the USNS Laramie (T-AO 203) crew!”

TESTIMONIALS "We are very happy with our compactor on our riverboat the Creole Queen. We've had this machine on board for the past few years and it's the most reliable piece of equipment I've ever seen. We use it every day, it still looks brand new and it has had a revolutionary impact on our operation. You offer a wonderful product."

Captain Brian Collins

"I never hesitate to recommend our Vertical Trash Compactor because it does everything your brochure represents it to accomplish. I can't imagine anyone in the restaurant business not utilizing this apparatus. It really has become one of my proudest restaurant possessions. It works so smooth that I almost feel smug when I see all the gigantic trash containers for other restaurants."

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!

About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
