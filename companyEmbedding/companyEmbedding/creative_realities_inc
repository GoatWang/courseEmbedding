Dynamic Innovation -- An Operational Model





Innovations Critical Success Factors





The Power of An External Mindset -- Change happens at the edges




An Self-Assessment Tool for Innovation






























The 3 Keys for Innovation
- The 5 Phase Innovation Model
- The 4 Uncontrollable Drivers of Innovation
- Innovation's Critical Success Factors





Our Philosophy
The magic of business innovation is not the generation of new ideas.  Ideas are a "dime a dozen."  The real magic of business innovation lies in engaging diverse internal and external perspectives in a replicable process to envision the future, identify new ways to create value, then successfully implementing those unique and meaningful solutions.





Our Approach


Align Key Stakeholders around a "Vision" for the future and their Agenda for Innovation


Engage a collaborative team of internal and external resources in Discovering the Key Drivers, Opportunity Spaces and Insights into unmet needs in that future


Create innovative new ideas to build new value solutions for those needs


Develop beginning Ideas into Platforms and Business Models to deliver that Value


Execute with a "Launch & Learn" approach that engages stakeholders in the passionate pursuit of success in the marketplace































  























"Creative Realities has designed a mind-bending and challenging process that will make you think and act differently"-- Martin Madaus, Former Chairman, President and CEO, Merck/MIllipore
