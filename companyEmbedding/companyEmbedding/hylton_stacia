Patrick Leahy has scheduled a hearing on her confirmation for the Senate Judiciary Committee on November 17th. If her nomination is approved, it would be a major blow to criminal justice reform.
While U.S. Federal Detention Trustee, Hylton awarded several multi-million dollar contracts to the GEO Group, the country's second largest private jailer. She also awarded Corrections Corporation of America (CCA), the largest U.S. private prison company, an $80 million contract for a 1,000+ bed prison in Nevada. When she retired as Trustee earlier this year, the President of CCA attended her retirement party.
Immediately after retiring, Hylton began earning six-figures consulting for GEO; and now she wants back in the administration, where she will be in a position to award her friends in the private prison industry with more fat contracts for building more beds that would allow our incarceration rate to grow even more. 
Please tell the administration to withdraw the nomination of a prison profiteer, and instead nominate a person who is committed to reducing this country's incarceration rate and reigning in those who profit from it. And tell Senator Leahy and his committee to demand a new nominee.This petition was delivered to:SenatorJeff SessionsSenatorRuss FeingoldSenatorTammy Baldwin17 more decision makers...SenatorJohn CornynSenatorTom CoburnSenatorChuck GrassleySenatorSheldon WhitehouseSenatorTed KaufmanSenatorAl FrankenSenatorPatrick LeahySenatorOrrin HatchSenatorJeff FlakeSenatorDianne FeinsteinSenatorDick DurbinSenatorBen CardinSenatorAmy KlobucharSenatorCharles SchumerSenatorArlen SpecterSenatorLindsey GrahamPresident of the United StatesRead the letterLetter toSenator Jeff SessionsSenator Russ FeingoldSenator Tammy BaldwinSenator John CornynSenator Tom CoburnSenator Chuck GrassleySenator Sheldon WhitehouseSenator Ted KaufmanSenator Al FrankenSenator Patrick LeahySenator Orrin HatchSenator Jeff FlakeSenator Dianne FeinsteinSenator Dick DurbinSenator Ben CardinSenator Amy KlobucharSenator Charles SchumerSenator Arlen SpecterSenator Lindsey GrahamPresident of the United StatesAs someone concerned about this country's shamefully high rate of incarceration and the revolving door of government workers become highly paid industry lobbyists, I am asking you to oppose Stacia Hylton's name as nominee for U.S. Marshall.This year, after awarding private prison companies millions of dollars as a top DOJ employee, Ms. Hylton made more than $112,000 as a consultant for the private prison industry -- which stands to gain the most by increasing the number of people imprisoned in our country. We need someone in this important position who is committed to reducing the number of people behind bars in Federal prisons, and someone committed to shrinking the influence of private prison companies. President Obama, when you ran for office, you vowed to close the "revolving door;" please demonstrate this commitment to both good government and criminal justice reform by withdrawing Ms. Hylton's name and appointing a real advocate for changing the course and moving our country away from being the world's biggest jailer. And Senator Leahy and members of the Judiciary Committee: please reject this nomination.
