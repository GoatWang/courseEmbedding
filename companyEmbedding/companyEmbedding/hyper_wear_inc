About Hyperwear


OUR MISSION
To provide simple, powerful, gear supported by best-in-class education and training resources to help you get the most from Hyperwear products. We are a leading producer of innovative, high-quality, functional fitness equipment that is safe, effective and easy to use.
OUR STORY
Founded in Austin, Texas in 2007, Hyperwear began with the patented Hyper Vest® PRO, the best weight vest on the market.
In 2008 Hyperwear introduced the SandBell® to fill a need for a free weight that was more versatile and functional for top strength and conditioning coaches to train their athletes. Soon personal trainers, physical therapists, and general gym goers quickly adopted it as a safe, effective and versatile piece of equipment. Quick to follow was the more demanding steel shot filled SteelBell® version.
Hyperwear took functional training a step further in 2013 with the launch of the SandRope® and re-invented sandbag training with the launch of Fit RUCK™ fitness backpack in 2015.
At Hyperwear, we have expanded our investment in quality education, training, and programming. Hyperwear now offers regularly updated SandBell GX group fitness classes licensing, certification workshops, live training, and a growing exercise video library.
Hyperwear’s line of unique products has won international following and upstanding reviews in many major media outlets. They are the choice of many professional and collegiate athletic teams, top CrossFit and OCR athletes, military, police and fire personnel as well as the general fitness community.
Hyperwear remains dedicated to our mission of providing simple, powerful, gear.

ONE YEAR LIMITED WARRANTY. ALL OTHER WARRANTIES, GUARANTEES OR REMEDIES ARE EXCLUDED INCLUDING ANY IMPLIED WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.




Where can I find Hyperwear training resources?


There are a number of places you can go for Hyperwear training information and workout suggestions.Instructional Videos: Hyperwear YouTubeWorkouts & Articles: Hyperwear BlogSandBell Training Schedule: Hyperwear CertificationsDVD Series: Hyperwear Training DVD's



Can I buy Hyperwear products in any retail outlets in the US?


Yes, you can purchase Hyperwear products at these American Home Fitness locations:1703 W 14 Mile Rd, Birmingham, MI 48009. Ph: (248) 723-906244937 Schoenherr Rd, Sterling Heights, MI 48313. Ph: (586) 737-260144225 Twelve Mile Rd, Novi, MI 48377. Ph: (248) 347-4944

Yes, we have a number of Hyperwear Non-US distributors who sell our range of products. Please contact us at [email protected] for more information.  Please note that any taxes or fees incurred as a result of importing into a Non-US country is the sole responsibility of the customer and not Hyperwear.  




Hyper Vest PRO


How do I determine the correct weight vest size?


To determine the best weight vest size for your height and weight please view our Sizing Chart. The weight vest should fit snugly and hug your core. Side laces allow you to adjust the vest to best fit your torso, which removes some of the load from your shoulders making the Hyper Vest PRO weight vest the most comfortable weighted vest on the market. If you still have questions please Contact Us directly.




What is the maximum weight each Hyper Vest PRO size can hold?


The number of pockets in the weight vest determines the amount of weight each size can hold. The larger the weight vest size, the more pockets and therefore the more weight it can hold. Here are the maximums for each size:Small: 21.4lbsMedium: 23.6lbsLarge: 33.2lbsXLarge: 42.3lbsXXLarge: 60lbs




How much weight should I use in a weighted vest?


This all depends on what type of activities you are performing. The Hyper Vest PRO comes pre-loaded with 10lbs of zinc-coated steel weight bars. We recommend starting with this amount or less, until you become familiar and comfortable with using a weight vest. You can then adjust the amount of weight to suit your goals and type of activity. General guidelines recommend between 5-15% of your bodyweight. For strength training exercises, such as pull ups, dips and push ups you can use closer to the higher end of the range. While for cardiovascular-type activities like running and plyometric-type exercise like jumping and bounding we recommend sticking to the lower end of the range.




Can I get more weight for my weight vest?


Yes, extra weight Booster Packs are available here. Each 5lb box contains 36 individual zinc-coated steel weight bars (2.25oz each) allowing you to increase in small increments.




Is it easy to load and unload weights from my Hyper Vest PRO weight vest?


Yes, adding and removing weight to and from the Hyper Vest PRO is very quick and simple. Individual weight bars can be removed by pulling back the black webbing on top of the pocket then pushing the weight up from the bottom. To insert, simply slide the weight bar into the pocket and ensure the black webbing is closed over the top. Each pocket can hold up to two weight bars. Check out this video of the process.




Is the Hyper Vest PRO adjustable?


Yes, the Hyper Vest PRO weight vest features flexible side lacing for a highly-adjustable fit. The lacing can be cut to your desired length and tied at each end in a small knot. It is also one of the only weighted vests that zips on and off (most other weight vests use Velcro straps or belts). The zipper also you to quickly put on and take off the Hyper Vest PRO, as well as unzip it partially to allow for increased air flow.




Will the weights bounce up and down in my weight vest when I run or jump?


No, our weighted vests feature a patented design that limits vertical movement eliminating any bounce. The design also provides for flexion in the horizontal plane, allowing for full chest expansion while breathing, keeping the weights in place even during vigorous, multi-plane movements.




How should I clean my Hyper Vest PRO weight vest?


The Hyper Vest PRO weight vest is made from a breathable, odor-resistant fabric so you do not need to wash it every time you use it. After use lay the vest flat to air out. You can also spray it with a little Febreze from time to time.
For more extensive cleaning we recommend hand washing in a sink with a mild soap or detergent, rinsing, then wringing the excess water out in a towel, and laying the vest flat in a cool, dry place to dry completely. You do not need to remove the weights for this. You can also wash the vest in the washing machine using a delicate cycle, then, lay flat to dry. Be sure to remove all the weights before putting weight vest in washing machine.




Is the Hyper Vest PRO durable?


Yes, the Hyper Vest PRO weight vest is constructed of a very tough fabric called Tyvex that is patented by DuPont and is extremely durable. If fraying or tears do appear, please take a photo and Email Us. To reduce wear and tear on your weight vest DO NOT DROP or let the vest strike or rub on hard or abrasive surfaces. This type of damage is not covered under our limited warranty.




Can I wear my Hyper Vest PRO weight vest under a shirt or blouse?


Yes, the Hyper Vest PRO’s slim profile allows for exceptional wear-ability and comfortable. The ¼ inch thick high-density steel weights make this weight vest barely detectable under a shirt. It also features a scoop neck cut that will help hide your weight vest under clothes.




SandBell and SteelBell


What is the difference between a SandBell and a SteelBell?


There are a few structural differences between the SandBell and SteelBell as well as some training differences.First and most obvious, the SandBell is filled with sand, while the SteelBell is filled with steel shot, which is twice as dense. Since the steel shot is denser it makes the SteelBells smaller in diameter and footprint compared to SandBells of the same weight. Multiple SteelBells will therefore take up even less in a facility than other types of equipment like dumbbells, kettlebells or medicine balls.The neoprene on the SteelBell is slightly thicker than the SandBell and has a textured exterior for improved grip. Both are extremely challenging on grip, hand and wrist strength. The steel shot also has less friction so it moves around more than sand, which increases the instability and grip characteristics and makes every movement more intense and engaging.Both are extremely durable, using high quality materials and a patented design to create a free weight like you have never before experienced. They are both also great for all the traditional free weight exercises as well as countless explosive power movements such as slams, tosses and throws. Its versatility makes it ideal for many types of training from general strength and conditioning, to endurance based circuit as well as sports performance.




Can I buy a SandBell or SteelBell empty?


SandBells can be purchased filled or empty. A funnel is required to fill an empty SandBell. Instructions are provided with your empty SandBell. We recommend using washed dry play sand, which is available from most home improvement stores. View this video tutorial on how to properly fill.SteelBells are only sold filled.




What type of sand should I use to fill an empty SandBell?


We recommend a washed, dry play sand like Quikrete Play Sand available at most home improvement stores.




How do I fill a SandBell?


Check out our filling tutorial video.




How should I grip a SandBell or SteelBell?


Both the SandBell and SteelBell challenges grip strength by engaging the hand wrist and forearm with every move. When gripping a SandBell, grab a handful of sand and neoprene. DO NOT grip by the outer vinyl trim alone.
There are a number of ways you can grip and hold a SandBell. Here are four of the most common, basic grips;The Center: Grip the center of the SandBell in one or both hands making sure to grab a handful of sand and neoprene with each hand.The Claw: Grip the outer edge of the SandBell in one hand making sure to grab a handful of sand and neoprene. DO NOT grip by the vinyl trim alone.The Double Claw: Grip the outer edge of the SandBell in both hands making sure to grab a handful of sand and neoprene with each hand. DO NOT grip by the vinyl trim alone.The Cradle: Grip the center of the SandBell in one or both hands making sure to grab a handful of sand and neoprene with each hand.



Are SandBells suitable for children?


The SandBell is extremely safe for all ages. The patented, innovative disc design and sand filling allows for the weight to expand and force to dissipate over the surface area of the bag. So Hyperwear has extensive SandBell physical education resource material for kids, and it is the safest free weight for children. Contact Us for more information




How should I clean my SandBell and SteelBell?


Wipe down and clean your SandBell or SteelBell using a damp cloth. Spraying with an odor-eliminating product like Febreze® or OdoBan will help to handle any odors and keep your SandBell and SteelBell smelling clean and fresh.




What if I get my SandBell or SteelBell wet?


SandBells and SteelBells are extremely versatile free weights that are great for outdoor training for bootcamp, crossfit or obstacle course racing. You can get them wet, just be sure to dry them out completely to avoid mildew. Since the SteelBell is filled with steel shot, you should avoid getting it excessively wet, as the steel shot can rust. This is not covered under our limited warranty.




What kind of sand do I use to fill a SandBell and where can I buy it?


Use dry play sand available at most home improvement stores. Quikrete Play Sand is available at most Lowe’s and Home Depot’s and is a good choice.




Can I slam my SandBell or SteelBell?


Please do it’s the best unique feature and benefit. Use a good squat to reach down and pick it up and you just found the secret to an incredibly effective full body exercise that gets your heart rate up. Get more results in less time with a SandBell and SteelBell.




Can I repair a SandBell or SteelBell if there is a puncture, if so, how?


Punctures and cuts are not covered under our warranty policy. Avoid using your SandBell or SteelBell on any surfaces where a puncture or cut may occur. Contact Us for tips on repair options for punctures or cuts/tears.




What surfaces can I use my SandBell or SteelBell on?


The patented, innovative disc design and filling allows for the weight to expand and force to dissipate over the surface area of the bag. This makes the SandBell and SteelBell extremely safe for all surfaces including hardwood studio and gym flooring. We do not recommend using a SandBell or SteelBell on hard, abrasive surfaces like concrete or asphalt as these can rapidly increase the wear and tear.


Where can I find more info on the SandBell Group Exercise classes?


Check out more info on SBGX here.




SandRope


What is the difference between a SandRope and a battle rope?


While the SandRope shares many similarities with traditional battle ropes, it also differs in some major ways. To begin with, SandRopes are weighted (15 or 30lbs) and are only 10ft long compared to 25-50ft long for battle ropes. SandRopes can be used anchored like a battle rope or unanchored. SandRopes a much wider range of exercise possibilities since they can be used anchored or unanchored. 




How do I anchor my SandRope?


To properly anchor your SandRope, loop one end of the nylon webbing around or through a secure anchor point or object. Thread the other end of the nylon webbing through this loop and pull tight. Attach the loose end of the nylon to the carabineer, which is attached to the end of the SandRope. Check out the instruction video here. 




Do I need to anchor my SandRope?


The SandRope can be used both anchored or not, which provides for a larger variety of exercises. Anchored, the SandRope is great for all types of traditional battle rope exercises. Unanchored it can be used for countless other movements such as slams, carries, pull-ups, dips and much more.  




What is the SandRope collar for?


The SandRope Collar Accessory is designed to trap sand at one end of the SandRope making a handle. During anchored exercises, sand will shift away from you towards the other end. Wrap around the collar around the SandRope approx. 1 1/2 feet from one end to trap sand for a good consistent grip. We recommend regularly switching direction to re-distribute sand evenly.

May 27th, 2016

Memorial Day is just a few days away and while most ordinary Americans will be relaxing at barbecues, eating hot dogs and enjoying a lazy day off, many in the CrossFit community will spend it in the gym, in pain!

Murph WOD

 
The reason for their pain; MURPH.
MURPH is a CrossFit workout that honors Navy Lt. Michael Murphy, who was killed in action in Afghanistan in 2005. In CrossFit, a fitness system known for its no-nonsense workouts, MURPH is considered one of its most brutal.
It is a timed workout that starts with a one-mile run, followed by 100 pull-ups, 200 push-ups and 300 squats and finished off with another one-mile run.
Lt. Murphy created the workout himself and originally christened it “Body Armor” because he did it wearing his 20 lb tactical body armor.
Oh yeah, and did I mention it is supposed to be done wearing a 20 lb weight vest!
While it is simple in design, it is anything but in execution. The sheer volume of reps is daunting. Any one part by itself would be a tough workout. Put them all together, throw on a weight vest, race the stopwatch and you have yourself one serious trip to the pain cave.
This Memorial Day I will attempt my first MURPH. As a non-crossfitter and MURPH virgin, I asked 4x CrossFit Games athlete Julie Foucher for some survival tips.

HW: Will you be tackling MURPH this Memorial Day?
Julie: Absolutely! I do it every year on Memorial Day and it’s always a highlight.
HW: How many times have you performed it in the past?
Julie: According to my results in Beyond the Whiteboard, I’ve done MURPH eight times since starting CrossFit in June of 2009.
HW: What is your best time?
Julie: My best time with a vest was 40 min 7 seconds in 2014 and without a vest was 31:49 in 2013. (to put that into perspective anything around 30 minutes is in the elite category).
HW: Do you wear a weight vest?
Julie: Yes, I usually wear my Hyper Vest PRO. I have done it both with and without in the past.
HW: What is your strategy for completing it? How do you break up your rounds?
Julie: When wearing a vest, I usually do sets of 5-10-15. Without the vest sometimes I will do 10-10-15 until I am done with my pull-ups and then 10 more sets of 10-15.
HW: Do you take rest breaks in between or just go straight through?
Julie: I go straight through as much as I can. Although I often have to break up the push-up sets.

HW: With only a few weeks to go what do you recommend for training/practice leading up to the day?
Julie: I recommend adding more of the Murph movements to your workouts. Try different variations of the workout, for example; 5 rounds of 400 m run, 10 pull-ups, 20 push-ups, 30 squats. You might also want to start wearing your weight vest in some workouts too.
HW: Do you have any good hydration/nutrition tips?
Julie: If I am doing a long workout, especially in high heat and humidity, I will add some electrolyte tabs to my water or make sure I recover with a drink like Formula O2.
HW: What’s the best advice you can give a 1st timer?
Julie: My best advice for a first timer is to just keep moving. This workout is much more difficult mentally than physically. At times, it may seem as if you are hardly making progress, but if you just keep moving forward one rep at a time you will get there! As with all hero workouts, focus your mind on individuals like Lt. Michael P. Murphy who gave the ultimate sacrifice for our country and our freedom.
I have been taking Julie’s advice in my training using 5 pull-up/10 push-up/15 squat rounds and it has been working pretty good. I have also been splitting my training, doing some with and some without a weight vest.
I plan on attempting the MURPH wearing my Hyper Vest PRO and will see how far I get. Hopefully, I can just muscle through and complete it. As Julie said: just keep chipping away one rep at a time.
How do you eat an elephant? One bite at a time!
Good luck to everyone participating in this year’s MURPH. And if you are looking for a weight vest to wear check out the Hyper Vest PRO; the best weight vest on the market.

Description 



Additional 







The Hyper Vest PRO weighted vest is nothing less than revolutionary. The innovative design features a unique fabric control system that hugs the body for an extremely comfortable fit, like a compression shirt, but does not restrict range of motion.
The patented design flexes in the horizontal plane but not in the vertical plane. This allows for full chest expansion for breathing while keeping the weights in place even during vigorous, multi-plane movements.
The breathable, odor-resistant, wicking fabric and generous open side panels provide superior ventilation. Highly adjustable side lacing and slim profile allow for exceptional fit and comfort. To determine the best weight vest size for your height and weight please view our Sizing Chart. The 1/4" thick high-density steel weights make this weight vest barely detectable under a shirt.
The Hyper Vest PRO weight vest comes pre-loaded with 10 lbs of high-density steel weights and is fully adjustable. The individual weight bar weighs 2.25oz each and can be easily removed or additional weights can be added. Check out this instructional video
Each pocket can hold two weights and weights can be arranged across pockets to change weight distribution. Additional booster weight packs are available here.
Described as the best weight vest by Men's Health Magazine, the Hyper Vest PRO can be used for sports performance training, tactical training for fire, police, and military as well as general fitness, strength training, and rehabilitation.
