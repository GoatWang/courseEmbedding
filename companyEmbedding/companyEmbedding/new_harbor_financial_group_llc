FAQsYou are here: Home / FAQsFrequently Asked Questions

  Who owns New Harbor Financial Group?   New Harbor Financial Group is 100% owned by us. We answer only to you.
  
  What are your investment management fees and how are they determined?   We charge a fixed-percentage based on the amount of assets in managed accounts. Due to economies of scale, we charge lower-percentage fees for larger accounts. Fees are clearly reported and automatically debited from the client’s account once per calendar quarter.
In light of our fee-based model, our compensation for managed accounts is independent of how many or how few transactions are executed. Simply put, clients can take comfort in the fact that we never have a financial incentive to create unnecessary or inappropriate activity within their accounts.
Our fees are very transparent. We want our clients to be able to continually compare our fee against the value we add to their financial picture. If a client feels they are not getting sufficient value to justify our fees, they are free to end their relationship with us at any time, without any penalties or constraints.
  
  What types of investment products do you use?   
Exchange traded funds (ETFs)
Stocks (equity securities)
Bonds
Options
Mutual funds

  
  Will you invest in alternative assets like commodities or real estate?   There are times when these asset classes can be important sources of added return, and can potentially reduce overall portfolio risks due to their low correlation with traditional assets, such as stocks and bonds. When our technical models suggest, we will invest modest amounts of client funds in such alternative asset classes as commodities (energy, agricultural, precious/base metals), foreign currencies, and real estate. These products present unique risks and we will only recommend them when suitable to the investor.
  
  Do you manage individual stocks in the portfolio?   Yes. However, we often favor diversified equity investment vehicles. We believe gaining exposure to an entire sector, as opposed to one or a limited number of stocks in that sector, will likely deliver superior risk-adjusted returns. Rest assured that if you have individual stock positions that you would like us to manage as part of your portfolio, we can apply many of the same value-added investment management techniques that we employ with other investment vehicles. Often, important considerations such as unrealized capital gains justify maintaining long-term individual stock holdings.
  
  You talk about risk-managed investing. How do you hedge investment risks in the portfolio?   We use a variety of strategies to manage risk in the portfolio. In terms of portfolio holdings, inverse ETFs, covered call options, protective put options, and collars are all ways to mitigate the investment risk of other holdings. A strategy that hedges risk is NOT the same thing as a hedge fund. See below.
Options involve certain risks and are not suitable for all investors. Copies of the Options Disclosure Document are available from New Harbor Financial Group at (978) 537-7701.
  
  I’m concerned about hedge funds and other complex investments. Do you utilize these types of funds?   We generally do not use illiquid investments such as hedge funds and limited partnerships. Many hedge fund investors learned that not only can these kinds of investments suffer from significant declines in value, but investors may be restricted or limited from withdrawing their money during times of market turmoil.
  
  How is my account protected from fraud?   Integrity and transparency are very important to us. Your account is protected from fraudulent activity through a variety of checks and balances. We use an independent third-party custodian and recordkeeper to track, audit and report on all investments. Deposits to and withdrawals from all client accounts are made directly to them—not us.
As a federally-registered investment adviser, New Harbor Financial Group is directly regulated by the Securities & Exchange Commission.
Finally, you have complete access to all your account information 24/7. See below.
  
  How can I track my portfolio activity and performance?   Clients can access their accounts online 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, through our secure internet login site.
You will receive printed trade confirmations within a couple days of any transaction and monthly statements showing month-end portfolio values, changes in value since prior month, summary of any transactions conducted during the month, and a detailed list of each investment holding in your account. For those clients who prefer electronic delivery of confirmations and statements, we offer that as an alternative.
At least once a year, and as often as requested by a client, we provide detailed performance summaries which show, both graphically and numerically, the actual performance of a client account (net of our fees). This report also compares your account performance relative to appropriate benchmarks, so you can assess whether we are delivering the value you expect from us.
  
  How often does New Harbor review my investment portfolio?   We take an active approach to managing client assets. We monitor the investment markets and investment positions held in client portfolios several times a day, every day.
  
  What if I need money or want to withdraw funds? How long do I have to wait?   Typically, funds will be available to you within a few days of your request. We generally use highly liquid investments that do not have redemption restrictions, and our custodian is able to process withdrawal requests from such investments very quickly.

Hedging Strategies

Simple Short Exposure. This strategy effectively shorts the S&P 500 by
        buying shares in the S&P 500 Short ETF.
        Simple Hedging will assume that 100%
        of the backtest's invested principal is always in the backtest's long positions.

        For example, if you choose a 25% hedging rate, then for a $10,000 portfolio,
        you will be long $10,000 and have a $2,500 short on the S&P 500.
        The short position will adjust each rebalancing period to match 25% of the total portfolio.
        Any gains/losses from the short are added to the overall available capital for the long positions in the
        portfolio.
      

Moving Average Hedge.  With this strategy, your portfolio will be hedged
        by shorting the S&P 500 whenever your long portfolio's performance drops below the monthly moving average.
        So if you set a 25% hedge, 25% of your long portfolio will be sold and the funds reallocated to the short
        whenever the hedge is in effect.
        Once your long portfolio performance goes back over the moving average, the short hedge will be removed
        and the funds from the short will be reallocated to your long positions.
      

        When hedging strategies are being used, backtests can only go back as far as 2006.  This is the date
        the S&P 500 Short ETF first appeared.

Stock Sell Buffer

      You can optionally include a stock sell buffer in your backtesting model.
      It works by keeping a stock in your portfolio even when it would otherwise drop out
      during rebalancing as long as it remains within your sell buffer threshold.
      For example, you are backtesting with the top 20 stocks each quarter and set a sell buffer of 50.
      In the first quarter, AAPL is one of the top 20 stocks and is included in the portfolio.
      In quarter 2, AAPL drops down to number 25. Without the sell buffer, AAPL would drop out
      for that quarter, but since it is still within the sell buffer threshold of 50,
      it will remain in the portfolio.
      Your portfolio size remains the same. The stocks that would have fallen out stay in and the
      stocks that would otherwise have been added stay out. Using the sell buffer may
      help produce a lower turnover rate.

No sell buffer

Rebalancing Frequency

      By default backtester rebalances quarterly using new 13F filing data. You can
      adjust the rebalancing frequency using the dropdown below. Reasons for
      changing the frequency include lower turnover and possible tax advantages
      by keeping stocks at least one year before selling.
    


        Do not rebalance after each quarter

or rebalance:
        
Every quarter (default)
 Every other quarter
 Once a year

Capital One® Secured Mastercard®


                                            I never had played in credit before, and someone suggested this card to me to build credit for the first time. I've been really satisfied for the most part. They report quickly and accurately, remind me when my bill is due, and the customer service has been kind and thorough....show more

                                            I highly recommend Farm Bureau Insurance. Nathan Ray cares about his clients. As my agent, Nathan meets me with intelligence, patience, humor, warmth, knowledge and empathy.

Electro Savings Credit Union


                                            Electro Savings approve loans under a different set of rules to African Americans than Caucasian customers!  I was 7% above their threshold and when I asked to add a cosigner the answer was still NO!   DO NOT PATRONIZE!

SEFCU


                                            After getting fed-up with SEFCU’s “nickel-and-dime” fee structure and lack of branches/ATMs in my area, I decided to close my account in April 2017. Fast forward to July 25, 2017 when I receive a collection notice for fees due ($175). Access to my online...show more

I have never had an account with PenFed, so I questioned the accuracy of this denial. Considering, as a business owner, my scores are well north of 700, I thought this...show more

                                            We wish Todd and his family all best. No one can control the markets and for 13 years he did an amazing job for us. These bloodthirsty lawyers will stop at nothing to tarnish his name for their own gain.
