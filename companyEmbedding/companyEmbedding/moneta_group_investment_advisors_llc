Our Expertise



Family CFO Services What exactly is a Family CFO? In the same way a chief financial officer coordinates all the financial affairs of a successful business, Moneta Group Family CFOs do the same for successful families, individuals and businesses. Clients have access to a depth and breadth of personalized, conflict-free advice on a range of financial issues, all delivered by a service model that has a single goal–make every client a ‘Raving Fan.’ And as independent Registered Investment Advisors, we act only in the best interests of our clients. We sit on the same side of the table, working in collaboration with clients to provide the service and advice they want and deserve.
Most people seeking financial advice and planning are concerned about the safety and performance of their investments. This is important, and we apply the considerable expertise of our investment department and many other experts to investment planning. But our Family CFO model goes far beyond investment concerns. Without a comprehensive, long-term plan in place—one designed to meet the unique needs of you and your family—even the best investment strategy is like a puzzle with key pieces missing: the picture is incomplete.
Our responsibility—and our expertise—is in asking all the right questions and helping find solutions. What about your children’s education? Have you considered protecting your estate from unwanted tax burdens? Do you want to retire early? Buy a second home? Are you adequately insured? Maybe it’s time to think about creating a trust for your family or to make sure they understand your philanthropic intent. We will guide you, working as your advocate as we explore your plans, dreams and goals for the future.
For many clients, retirement seems a long way off, but early planning for what you hope to accomplish along the way is the framework for long-term peace of mind. Your Family CFO not only helps you plan for that ‘replacement paycheck,’ but can help you think about what comes next and how you can continue to feel vital and engaged during the next phase of your life.
And certainly you may want to consider your golden years: A second home? Sail around the world? Start a new business? Whatever you imagine, whatever you need, your Family CFO offers advice, counsel and guidance.
Moneta Group Family CFOs—experts across many disciplines—anticipate your needs through every life transition. We are there for you today, tomorrow and for generations to come.

Our Expertise



Financial Independence No one can predict the future, but that doesn’t mean you shouldn’t plan for it. No matter where you are along your path toward retirement, your Moneta Family CFO will help you develop strategies to bring your goals within reach. For some families, that means saving for their children’s educations. For others, it may mean leaving a philanthropic legacy.
Although you want a comfortable, worry-free retirement, it isn’t just about the money. This important next phase means making sure you are as vital, engaged and excited in your retirement years as you were in your working life.
A well-designed plan, implemented during the working years, will help guide you toward the retirement you’ve always dreamed of. Your Moneta Family CFO will help design a savings plan based on your goals and objectives and will provide ongoing oversight of your progress. For those closer to retirement, more intense evaluation is applied and strategies are developed for your ‘paycheck replacement’ after retirement.
Then, focus is placed on tax-efficiency of withdrawals, determining from which accounts and which asset classes retirement withdrawals should be made and providing the ongoing analysis necessary to ensure you don’t outlive your money. And like every other part of your financial plan, all of this is based on your family’s financial priorities and goals.

Financial advisors use their knowledge of investments, 
tax laws, and insurance to recommend financial options to individuals.
The SEC typically regulates investment advisers that have assets under management in excess of $25,000,000. Investment advisers that do not meet this threshold generally are regulated by the states. The SEC registers IA firms but does not separately register individual representatives of IA firms. The states register IA firms, and many separately register individual investment adviser representatives.

Currently, you can only search for IA firms on this website. In the future, this website also will provide the ability to search for individual investment adviser representatives.

In 1996 Congress amended the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 to require that the SEC establish a readily accessible electronic process to respond to public inquiries about investment advisers and their disciplinary information. The SEC created this website to satisfy Congress? mandate.

BBB Accreditation





                BBB Accredited Since 03/29/2010
            

                BBB has determined that Moneta Group LLC meets Standards of BBB Accreditation, which include a commitment to make a good faith effort to resolve any consumer complaints. BBB Accredited Businesses pay a fee for accreditation review/monitoring and for support of BBB services to the public.
            

                BBB accreditation does not mean that the business's products or services have been evaluated or endorsed by BBB, or that BBB has made a determination as to the business's product quality or competency in performing services.
            








Standards of BBB Accreditation






Build Trust









            Establish and maintain a positive track record in the marketplace.

                   1. Have been operational (actively selling products or services) in any BBB service area for at least the most recent 6 months, unless the principle(s) previously operated a similar business with an eligible record (one that qualifies for BBB accreditation).
                

                   1. Fulfill contracts signed and agreements reached.
                

                   3. Be free from government action that demonstrates a significant failure to support BBB ethical principles in marketplace transactions (this requires a determination by BBB as to the nature of any violation, whether it was caused or condoned by management, and actions taken to resolve underlying issues that led to the government action).
                
4. Be free of an unsatisfactory rating and maintain at least a B rating at the accrediting BBB and the BBB where it is headquartered, if different.

4. Cooperate with BBB self-regulatory programs for the resolution of advertising disputes.
5. Use the BBB name and logos in accordance with BBB policy.

                    6. Avoid misleading customers by creating the false impression of sponsorship, endorsement, popularity, trustworthiness, product quality or business size through the misuse of logos, trustmarks, pictures, testimonials, or other means

                    1. Promptly respond to all complaints forwarded by BBB by: 
1. Resolving the complaint directly with the complainant and notifying BBB, or

                            2. Providing BBB with a response that BBB determines: 

                                    1. is professional,

                    2. Make a good faith effort to resolve disputes, which includes mediation if requested by BBB. Other dispute resolution options, including arbitration, may be recommended by BBB when other efforts to resolve a dispute have failed. BBB may consider a business' willingness to participate in recommended dispute resolution options in determining compliance with these standards.
                

                    3. Comply with any settlements, agreements or decisions reached as an outcome of a BBB dispute resolution process.

BBB Accreditation Reviews

BBB routinely monitors its files on all Accredited Businesses to affirm that they continue to meet all BBB Accreditation Standards











BBB Accreditation Process


        Not every business is eligible for BBB Accreditation. Businesses must meet, commit to and maintain the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards) 
        in order to be eligible for and maintain BBB Accreditation. The BBB Code of Business Practices represents sound advertising, selling and customer
        service practices that enhance customer trust and confidence in business. The Code is built on the BBB Standards for Trust, eight principles that
        summarize important elements of creating and maintaining trust in business.
    

        In order to be eligible for Accreditation a business must complete an Accreditation application.        
    

        Upon receipt of a fully completed BBB Application for Accreditation, BBB staff:        
        
Reviews the application
Researches the business
Verifies the information presented in the application 
May request additional information
May request proof of specific information on the application

        After the review and verification process, BBB will then evaluate if the business meets the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards)..
    
    
        Once BBB has finished its evaluation, the application for BBB Accreditation is either approved or denied. If the applicant is found in compliance with the BBB Code of Business Practices it will be presented to the BBB Board of Directors, or a committee of that board, for final approval. If the application is denied, BBB will contact the applicant, indicating the BBB Standard(s) that were not met and any recourse available to the applicant.
