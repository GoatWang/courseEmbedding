This report is not for commercial use. Thorough reviews have been conducted to assure this data accurately reflects disclosures. However for a complete and definitive understanding of the pay practices of any company, users should refer directly to the actual, complete proxy statement. 
Use of Data / Disclaimer
The information shown here is a reporting of information included in the company's proxy statement. The proxy statement includes footnotes and explanations of this information plus other information that is pertinent in assessing the overall value and appropriateness of the compensation information. For those interested in conducting a detailed compensation analysis, we recommend that you review the entire proxy statement. You may retrieve the full proxy statement by going to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) website at www.sec.gov and entering the company's name and then looking in the first column for an entry of "Form DEF 14A" (or any similar code). You may also find the annual proxy statement by going directly to the company's website.
What is a proxy statement?
A proxy statement (or "proxy") is a form that every publicly traded U.S. company is required to file with the U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) within 120 days after the end of its fiscal year. The proxy must be sent to every shareholder in advance of the company's annual shareholders meeting. All proxy statements are public filings made available to the general public by the SEC.
The proxy statement's main purpose is to alert shareholders to the annual meeting and provide them information about the issues that will be voted on during the annual meeting, including decisions such as electing directors, ratifying the selection of auditors, and other shareholder-related decisions, including shareholder-initiated initiatives. Also, proxies must disclose specific detailed information regarding the pay practices for certain executives.

FIVE POINTS, Calif., Oct. 27, 2011 /PRNewswire/ -- S&W Seed Company (Nasdaq:   SANW) today announced that Matthew K. Szot has been elected Senior Vice President and full-time Chief Financial Officer ("CFO") effective November 1, 2011. Before today, Mr. Szot served as S&W Seed's part-time CFO under its CFO Support Services Agreement with Cardiff Partners, LLC.
Grover Wickersham, Chairman of the board of directors of S&W Seed Company commented, "Since March 2010, Matt has been the company's part-time CFO under a contract with Cardiff Partners. This was a cost-effective solution that enabled S&W's shareholders to have access to services of a higher caliber CFO than most companies of our size.  However, the board recently concluded that our business has advanced to the point where we need an expert public company CFO on a full-time basis. We are delighted that Matt was willing to fully commit to the opportunities he sees materializing at S&W."
Mark Grewal, president and chief executive officer of S&W Seed, commented, "In view of our organic growth in alfalfa seed, stevia and seed processing markets and, especially our acquisition strategy going forward, having Matt's expertise and full-time commitment is needed. We highly respect Matt, and know his abilities very well. I am extremely pleased to welcome Matt on board as a full-time member of our senior management team."
Mr. Szot commented, "Mark and the board's strategic initiatives are beginning to bear fruit, and I didn't want to miss this opportunity. It was clear that S&W's vertical integration, growth in the alfalfa seed business, development of the stevia program, and the commitment to synergistic acquisitions, meant the company needed a full-time CFO with my skill set. I appreciate the confidence that Mark and the board of directors have in me, and they can be assured I will make every effort to carry out the vision they have set."
Mr. Szot has over fifteen years of experience in corporate accounting and finance, SEC compliance, and operational management.  From 1996 to 2003, Mr. Szot was a CPA and Audit Manager with the international accounting firm KPMG, in San Diego and Chicago and was responsible for audits of numerous public companies. From 2003 to 2006, Mr. Szot was the chief financial officer of Rip Curl, Inc., a market leader in wetsuit and sports apparel products.  Since 2007, Mr. Szot has been the chief financial officer of Cardiff Partners LLC, a financial and business advisory firm that provides executive financial services to various publicly traded and private firms. Mr. Szot graduated from the University of Illinois, Champaign-Urbana, with a Bachelor of Science degree in Agricultural Economics/Accountancy. Mr. Szot is a Certified Public Accountant in the State of California.
