	PROSPECTUS SUMMARY


	 

	As used in this prospectus, the terms "we," "us," "our," "the Company" or "our Company," refer to messageBgone, Inc. unless otherwise indicated.



	 





	SUMMARY INFORMATION, RISK FACTORS AND RATIO OF EARNINGS TO FIXED CHARGES





	 


	This summary provides an overview of selected information contained elsewhere in this prospectus. It does not contain all the information you should consider before making a decision to purchase the shares we are offering. You should very carefully and thoroughly read the more detailed information in this prospectus and review our financial statements contained herein.


	 



	Our Company



	 



	messageBgone, Inc.


	was incorporated in the State of Nevada as a for-profit Company on August 25, 2015, and established a fiscal year-end of August 31st. We are a development-stage company that intends to develop and


	provide a subscription-based communications service that will give customers the ability to send and receive secure point-to-point e-mail messages and attachments in a closed system.


	There can be no assurances that our efforts to develop our proposed communications service will succeed, or that we will be able to market our proposed communications service, if developed. The Company has not yet implemented its business model and to date has generated no revenues. Neither the Company's management nor any affiliates of the Company or its management have previously been involved in the management or ownership of a development-stage company. Additionally, our sole officer and director has no experience in managing a public company or a company in our intended industry.



	  


	Since its incorporation, messageBgone, Inc. has not made any significant purchase or sale of assets, nor has it been involved in any mergers, acquisitions or consolidations, nor has the Company any plans, nor does any of its stockholders have any plans, to merge into an operating company, to enter into a change of control or similar transaction or to change our management. Neither management nor the Company's shareholders have plans or intentions to be acquired. messageBgone, Inc. is not a "blank check" registrant as that term is defined in Rule 419(a)(2) of Regulation C of the Securities Act of 1933, since it has a specific business plan or purpose.


	 


	Our business office is located at: 2360 Corporate Circle, Suite 400, Henderson, Nevada 89074-7739. Our telephone and facsimile number is: (702) 381-5798 and, our website address is www.messagebgone.com.


	 


	As of August 31, 2015, the end of our most recent fiscal year, we had raised $10,000.00 through the sale of our common stock. We had $5,945 cash on hand and liabilities of $0.00. In addition, we anticipate incurring costs associated with this offering totaling approximately $9,370. As of the date of this prospectus, we have generated no revenues from our business operations.



	 





	The Offering

	A Cautionary Note on Forward-Looking Statements



	 



	This prospectus contains forward-looking statements, which relate to future events or our future financial performance.  In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terminology such as "may," "should," "expects," "plans," "anticipates," "believes," "estimates," "predicts," "potential," or "continue" or the negative of these terms or other comparable terminology.  These statements are only predictions and involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors, including the risks in the section entitled "Risk Factors," that may cause our actual results, levels of activity, performance, or achievements to be materially different from any future results, levels of activity, performance, or achievements expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements.



	 



	While these forward-looking statements, and any assumptions upon which they are based, are made in good faith and reflect our current judgment regarding the direction of our business, actual results will almost always vary, sometimes materially, from any estimates, predictions, projections, assumptions or other future performance suggested herein. Except as required by applicable law, including the securities laws of the United States, we do not intend to update any of the forward-looking statements to conform these statements to actual results.



	 



	Being an Emerging Growth Company



	 



	messageBgone, Inc. is a shell company as defined in Rule 405, because it is a company with nominal operations and it has assets consisting solely of cash and cash equivalents. We have no plans or intention to be acquired or to merge with an operating company. Additionally, there are no plans to enter into a change of control or similar transaction or to change the management of the Company.



	 



	The Company is an emerging growth company and the Company intends to take advantage of the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards pursuant to section 107(B) of the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012.



	 



	An issuer remains an emerging growth company until the earliest of:



	 



	The last day of the fiscal year during which it had total annual gross revenues of $1 billion or more;



	 



	The last day of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of its initial public offering date;



	 



	The date on which, during the previous three-year period, issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt; or



	 



	The date on which, during the previous three-year period, issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt; or



	 



	The date on which, during the previous three-year period, issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt; or



	 



	The date on which it is deemed to be a "large accelerated filer", as defined in section 240.12b–2 of Title 17, Code of Federal Regulations, or any successor for that matter.

	Emerging Growth Company Exemptions



	 



	An emerging growth company could be capable of taking advantage of several exemptions, such as:

	Say-On-Pay

	. Section 14A(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 has been amended to exempt emerging growth companies from the "say-on-pay", "say-on-pay frequency" and "say-on-golden parachute" requirements that were enacted as part of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. After cessation of emerging growth company status, if an issuer was an emerging growth company for less than two years after its initial public offering date, it must hold a "say-on-pay" vote no later than the end of the three-year period beginning on the date it is no longer an emerging growth company. Any other company that has ceased to be an emerging growth company must hold a say-on-pay vote no later than the end of the one-year period beginning on the date it is no longer an emerging growth company. In addition, following cessation of emerging growth company status, a company will become subject to the "say-on-pay-frequency" and "say-on-golden parachute" provisions of Rule 14a-21 promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.



	 



	The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has not yet finalized the regulations implementing the pay-versus-performance requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act.



	 




	Pay-versus-Performance



	. Section 14(i) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 has been amended to exempt emerging growth companies from the pay versus-performance requirements that were enacted as part of the Dodd-Frank Act.



	 




	CEO Pay Ratio Disclosure



	. Section 953(b)(1) of the Dodd-Frank Act has been amended to exempt emerging growth companies from the requirement to compare CEO compensation to the median of the annual total compensation of all employees of the issuer other than the CEO. The Securities and Exchange Commission has not yet finalized the regulations implementing the pay ratio disclosure requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act.



	 




	Compensation Disclosures



	. Emerging growth companies may comply with the less burdensome executive compensation disclosure requirements applicable to any issuer with a market value of less than $75 million of outstanding voting and nonvoting common equity held by non-affiliates. Currently these provisions are set forth in Item 402(l) through (r) of Regulation S-K as applicable to smaller reporting companies.



	 




	Financial Statement Requirements



	. Section 7 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, has been revised to require that two years, rather than three years, of audited financial statements be included in any registration statement filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission by an emerging growth company. Similarly, an emerging growth company need only present its Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for each period for which financial statements are presented rather than the periods required by Item 303 of Regulation S-K. Furthermore, an emerging growth company need not present selected financial data for any period prior to the earliest audited period presented in connection with its initial public offering. In addition, an emerging growth company need not comply with any new or revised financial accounting standard until such date that a company that is not an "issuer," as defined in Section 2 of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002. (Generally, a non-public company is required to comply with such new or revised accounting standards. Similar changes were also made to Section 13(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.)



	 




	Internal Control over Financial Reporting



	. Section 404(b) of Sarbanes-Oxley has been amended to exempt emerging growth companies from the requirement to obtain an attestation report on internal control over financial reporting from the issuer's registered public accounting firm. Currently, this requirement is only applicable to "accelerated filers" and "large accelerated filers " as defined in Rule 12b-2 promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.



	 



	The exemptions listed above could be available to the Company and the Company intends to take advantage of the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards pursuant to section 107(B) of the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012.


	  



	The Company intends to file, in a period up to 90 days after the termination of this offering, a Form 8A making the Company a mandatory reporting issuer under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.



	 



	The Company intends to offer its stock for sale in all jurisdictions that its prospectus is valid in and is not limited to any region or country. However, the Company intends to primarily sell shares in Thailand and the United States.

	RISK FACTORS



	 


	An investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the risks described below and the other information contained in this prospectus before investing in our common stock. You are urged to carefully review and consider the section entitled "Risk Factors" beginning on Page 10 of this prospectus. If any of the following risks occur, our business, operating results and financial condition could be seriously harmed. Currently, shares of our common stock are not publicly traded. In the event that shares of our common stock become publicly traded, the trading price of our common stock could decline due to any of these risks, resulting in the loss of all or part of your investment. In the event our common stock fails to become publicly traded, you may also lose all or part of your investment.


	 



	Risks Related to The Offering



	 



	AS THERE IS NO MINIMUM FOR OUR OFFERING, IF ONLY A FEW PERSONS PURCHASE SHARES, THEY WILL LOSE THEIR INVESTMENT WITHOUT THE COMPANY BEING ABLE TO MAKE A SIGNIFICANT ATTEMPT TO IMPLEMENT ITS BUSINESS PLAN.



	 


	Since there is no minimum amount of shares that must be sold directly by the company under this offering, if a limited number of shares are sold, we may not have enough capital to fully implement our proposed plan of operations. As such, we may not be able to meet the objectives we state in this prospectus, or eliminate the "going concern" modification in the reports of our auditors as to uncertainty with respect to our ability to continue as a going concern. If we fail to raise sufficient capital, we would expect to have insufficient funds for our ongoing operating expenses. Any significant lack of funds will curtail the development and growth of our business, and may cause our business to fail. If our business fails, investors will lose their entire investment.


	 




	WEARE A DEVELOPMENT-STAGE COMPANY AND WE HAVE NO OPERATING HISTORY. THEREFORE, WE MAY NEVER BE ABLE TO CARRY OUT OUR PROPOSED PLAN OF OPERATIONS OR ACHIEVE ANY SIGNIFICANT REVENUE OR PROFITABILITY.






	  


	We are subject to all of the risks inherent in the establishment of a new business enterprise, and we have not generated any revenues to date. Any profitability in the future from our business will be dependent upon the successful development and implementation of our proposed communications product and its successful marketing and sale, which are subject to numerous risk factors as set forth herein. Accordingly, we may not be able to successfully carry out our plan of operations and investors may lose their entire investment.


	 



	WE ARE SELLING THIS OFFERING WITHOUT AN UNDERWRITER AND MAY BE UNABLE TO SELL ANY SHARES.



	 


	This offering is self-underwritten, that is, we are not going to engage the services of an underwriter to sell the shares. We intend to sell our shares through Arraya Wilaiphan, our sole officer and director, who will receive no commissions or other remuneration from any sales made. Mr. Wilaiphan will offer the shares to friends, family members, and business associates; however, there is no guarantee that he will be able to sell any of the shares. Unless Mr. Wilaiphan is successful in selling all of the shares and we receive the maximum amount of proceeds from this offering, we may have to seek alternative financing to implement our plan of operations.


	 




	 




	10













	 




	 



	WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO FURTHER IMPLEMENT OUR BUSINESS STRATEGY UNLESS SUFFICIENT FUNDS ARE RAISED IN THIS OFFERING.



	 


	We may not realize sufficient proceeds from this offering to further business development, or to provide adequate cash flow for our planned business activities. As of August 31, 2015 we had $5,945 cash on hand and have sustained a net loss of $2,555. We have not generated any revenue from our operations to date. At this rate, we expect that we will not be able to continue operations without obtaining additional funding or beginning to generate revenue. Accordingly, we anticipate that additional funding will be needed for general administrative expenses, the design and development of our proposed communications offering, business development and marketing costs.


	 






	Our sole officer and director, Arraya Wilaiphan, has agreed to lend the Company up to $20,000.00 in funds so it can remain a current issuer. There is no written agreement with Mr. Wilaiphan.

	Given past expenditures, the Company


	anticipates that it will


	require approximately $6,600 per quarter


	to remain a current


	issuer


	.


	The Company

	will be able to conduct its business with current funding for an additional three quarters at

	this

	rate of expenditure.




	 


	We do not currently have any arrangements for financing and our ability to obtain additional financing will be subject to a number of factors, including general market conditions, investor acceptance of our plan of operations and initial results from our business operations. There is no assurance that any additional financing will be available or, if available, on terms that will be acceptable to us. Failure to secure additional financing will cause us to go out of business. If this happens, you could lose all or part of your investment.


	 


	If our resources are insufficient to satisfy our cash requirements, we may seek to sell additional equity or debt securities or obtain a credit facility. The sale of additional equity securities could result in additional dilution to our stockholders. The incurrence of indebtedness would result in increased debt service obligations and could result in operating and financing covenants that would restrict our operations. We cannot assure you that financing will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us, if at all.


	 



	BECAUSE OUR SOLE OFFICER AND DIRECTOR CURRENTLY OWNS ALL OF OUR OUTSTANDING COMMON STOCK, INVESTORS MAY FIND THAT DECISIONS INFLUENCED BY HIM ARE INCONSISTENT WITH THE BEST INTERESTS OF OTHER STOCKHOLDERS.



	 


	Arraya Wilaiphan, our sole officer and director, currently owns all of the outstanding shares of our common stock, and, upon completion of this offering, will likely own a large percentage of our outstanding common stock. Accordingly, he may have a significant influence in determining the outcome of all corporate transactions or other matters, including mergers, consolidations and the sale of all or substantially all of our assets, and also the power to prevent or cause a change in control of our company. Factors that could cause his interests to differ from the interests of other stockholders include the impact of corporate transactions on the timing of business operations and his ability to continue to manage the business given the amount of time he is able to devote to our company. While we have no current plans with regard to any merger, consolidation or sale of substantially all of our assets, the interests of our sole officer and director may still differ from the interests of other stockholders.


	 



	THERE IS SUBSTANTIAL DOUBT ABOUT OUR ABILITY TO CONTINUE AS A GOING CONCERN.



	 


	As of August 31, 2015, the company has not generated revenue, has no certainty of earning revenue in the future, and has a working capital deficit and a net loss of $2,555 since inception. These factors, among others, raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Our ability to generate future revenue will depend on a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control. These factors include general economic conditions, market acceptance of our proposed product and competitive efforts. Due to these factors, we cannot anticipate with any degree of certainty what our revenue will be in future periods. As such, our independent certified public accountants have expressed substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. This opinion could materially limit our ability to raise additional funds by issuing new debt or equity securities or otherwise. You should carefully consider our independent certified public accountants' comments when determining if an investment in the company is suitable.

	WE ARE AN "EMERGING-GROWTH COMPANY" UNDER THE JOBS ACT, AND WE CANNOT BE CERTAIN IF THE REDUCED DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS APPLICABLE TO EMERGING GROWTH COMPANIES WILL MAKE OUR COMMON STOCK LESS ATTRACTIVE TO INVESTORS.



	 


	We are an "emerging growth company," as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act, and we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not "emerging growth companies" including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. We cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive because we may rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile.


	 


	In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an "emerging growth company" can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an "emerging growth company" can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We are choosing to take advantage of the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards. As a result, our financial statements may not be comparable to those of companies that comply with public company effective dates.


	 


	We will remain an "emerging growth company" for up to five years, although we will lose that status sooner if our revenues exceed $1 billion, if we issue more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt in a three-year period, or if the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million.


	 



	Because Our Company Is A Shell Company There Are Restrictions Imposed Upon The Transferability Of Unregistered Shares And You Will Not Be Able To Resell Your Shares In Certain Circumstances.



	 


	 We are a "shell company" within the meaning of Rule 405, promulgated pursuant to Securities Act of 1933, as amended, because we have nominal assets and nominal operations. Accordingly, the securities sold in this offering can only be resold through registration under Section 5 the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, Section 4(1), if available, for non-affiliates or by meeting the conditions of Rule 144(i), which will potentially reduce liquidity of our securities. Another implication of us being a shell company are enhanced reporting requirements imposed on shell companies and that we cannot file registration statements under Section 5 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, using a Form S-8, a short form of registration to register securities issued to employees and consultants under an employee benefit plan. Additionally, though exemptions, such as under Section 4(1) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, may be available for non-affiliate holders of our shares to resell their shares, because we are a shell company, a holder of our securities may not rely on the safe harbor from being deemed statutory underwriter under Section 2(11) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, as provided by Rule 144, to resell his or her securities. Only after we: (i) are not a shell company; and (ii) have filed all reports and other materials required to be filed by section 13 or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, as applicable, during the preceding 12 months (or for such shorter period that we may be required to file such reports and materials, other than Form 8-K reports); and have filed current "Form 10 information" with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission reflecting our status as an entity that is no longer a shell company for a period of not less than 12 months, can our securities be resold pursuant to Rule 144. "Form 10 information" is, generally speaking, the same type of information as we are required to disclose in this prospectus, but without an offering of securities. These circumstances regarding how Rule 144 applies to shell companies may hinder your resale of your shares of the Company. Being a shell company will also negatively impact on our ability to attract additional capital through subsequent unregistered offerings. 


	 



	WE MAY BE UNABLE TO COMPLY WITH DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES NECESSARY TO MAKE REQUIRED PUBLIC FILINGS.



	 


	We currently have no full-time employees, although we intend to add personnel following this offering. Given our limited resources, we may be unable to maintain effective controls to insure that we are able to make all required public filings in a timely manner. If we are successful in having our common stock listed on a stock exchange or quotation service, and if we do not make all public filings in a timely manner, our shares of common stock may be delisted and we could also be subject to regulatory action and/or lawsuits by stockholders.


	 



	AS A SECTION 15(D) FILER, WE WILL NOT BE A FULLY REPORTING COMPANY.



	 


	We will not be subject to the proxy rules under Section 14 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the prohibition of short-swing profits under Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the third-party tender offer rules, or the beneficial ownership reporting requirements of Sections 13(d) and (g) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. If we have less than three hundred shareholders following the fiscal year in which our registration statement becomes effective, our periodic reporting obligations under Section 13(a) will be automatically suspended under Section 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.


	 



	Risks Related to Our Business



	 



	KEY MANAGEMENT PERSONNEL MAY LEAVE THE COMPANY, WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE ABILITY OF THE COMPANY TO CONTINUE OPERATIONS.



	 


	We are entirely dependent on the efforts of Araya Wilaiphan, our sole officer and director, because of the time and effort that he devotes to messageBgone, Inc. Mr. Wilaiphan is in charge of overseeing all business development strategies, supervising any/all future personnel, including any consultants or contractors that we will engage to assist in developing our proposed communications product, and the establishment of our future sales and marketing efforts. The loss of Mr. Wilaiphan, or other key personnel in the future, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We do not maintain "key person" life insurance on our officers, directors or key employees. Our success will depend on the performance of Mr. Wilaiphan and our ability to attract and motivate other key personnel.

	SHAREHOLDERS MAY HAVE DIFFICULTIES ENFORCING THEIR LEGAL RIGHTS UNDER UNITED STATES SECURITIES LAWS BECAUSE OUR SOLE OFFICER AND DIRECTOR RESIDES OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES.



	 


	While we are a Nevada corporation, our sole officer and director resides in the province of Chachoengsao in Thailand. His ability to travel to the United States is dependent on a number of factors, some of which may be outside of his control. These include: availability; financial, geographical and personal matters; and, passport and visa regulations. Although in person jurisdiction may be difficult to obtain, our sole officer and director remains subject to his obligations as an officer and director of a Nevada corporation and the federal securities laws applicable to officers and directors of United States corporations. However, no assurances can be made that our sole officer and director will be able to attend any event in the United States in a timely manner or at all. Therefore, an investor may not be able to effect service of process on our sole officer and director in the United States, or enforce a judgment against our sole officer and director. Additionally, courts in the Kingdom of Thailand may not recognize or enforce United States judgments.



	 





	PRESENTLY, THE COMPANY'S SOLE OFFICER AND DIRECTOR HAS OTHER OUTSIDE BUSINESS INTERESTS AND, AS SUCH, HE IS NOT DEVOTING ALL OF HIS TIME TO THE COMPANY.



	 


	Our sole officer and director, Arraya Wilaiphan, has other outside business activities, but he is committed to devote approximately 15 hours per week to our operations. Our operations may be sporadic and occur at times when Mr. Wilaiphan is unavailable, which may lead to periodic interruption in the implementation of our business plan. Such delays could have a significant negative effect on the success of our business.


	 



	OUR SOLE OFFICER AND DIRECTOR HAS NO DIRECT EXPERIENCE IN COMMUNICATIONS, OR SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT.



	 


	Arraya Wilaiphan, our sole officer and director, has no direct experience in communications or software development. As a result, he may not be fully aware of many of the specific requirements relating to these areas of business. Mr. Wilaiphan's decisions and choices may not take into account the business, marketing or sales strategies that are commonly deployed in the industry. Consequently our operations, earnings and ultimate financial success could suffer irreparable harm due to his lack of experience in these areas. As a result, we may have to suspend or cease operations, which will result in the loss of your investment.



	 





	COMPENSATION MAY BE PAID TO OUR OFFICERS, DIRECTORS AND EMPLOYEES REGARDLESS OF OUR PROFITABILITY. SUCH PAYMENTS MAY NEGATIVELY AFFECT OUR CASH FLOW AND OUR ABILITY TO FINANCE OUR BUSINESS PLAN, WHICH WOULD CAUSE OUR BUSINESS TO FAIL.



	 


	Arraya Wilaiphan, our sole officer and director, is not presently receiving compensation. However, he and any future employees of our company may be entitled to receive compensation, payments and reimbursements regardless of whether we operate at a profit or a loss. Any compensation received by Mr. Wilaiphan, or the board of directors, which currently consists only of Mr. Wilaiphan, or any other personal that Mr. Wilaiphan in his capacity as sole officer and director, as applicable, will determine from time to time. We expect to reimburse our sole officer and director, and any future personnel, for any direct out-of-pocket expenses they incur on behalf of us.


	 



	WE MAY BE UNABLE TO ACQUIRE OR RETAIN SUBSCRIBERS.



	 


	We must acquire customers to subscribe to our proposed communications product in order to generate revenue and achieve profitability. If customers do not perceive our proposed communications product to be of high value and quality or if we fail to introduce a product that is customized to the needs and interests of our customers, we may not be able to acquire or retain customers.


	 


	We believe that many of our subscribers will originate from word-of-mouth and non-paid referrals from other subscribers, and therefore we must ensure that those subscribers remain satisfied and loyal to our company in order to continue receiving those referrals. Once we establish a subscriber base, if our efforts to satisfy our established subscribers are not successful, we may not be able to acquire new subscribers in sufficient numbers to continue to grow our business or we may be required to incur significantly higher marketing expenses in order to acquire new customers. A decline in the number of subscribers or in subscriber satisfaction would have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

	We currently have no subscribers to our proposed communications product. We have not identified any subscribers and we cannot guarantee we ever will have any subscribers. Even if we obtain subscribers, there is no guarantee that we will generate a profit. If we cannot generate a profit, we will have to suspend or cease operations. You are likely to lose your entire investment if we cannot sell our proposed communications product at a price and in a quantity that generates a profit.


	 



	THERE ARE NO SUBSTANTIAL BARRIERS TO ENTRY INTO THE MARKETPLACE FOR THE PRODUCT WE INTEND TO DEVELOP AND SELL.



	 


	Since our proposed communications product has yet to be developed, other persons may develop the same, or a substantially similar product, and bring it to market before we do. Alternatively, other persons may attempt to copy aspects of our business, including our website design, product or marketing materials. Any encroachment upon our corporate information, including the unauthorized use of our brand name, the use of a similar name by a competing company or a lawsuit initiated against us for infringement upon another company's proprietary information or improper use of their trademark, may affect our ability to create brand name recognition, cause customer confusion and/or have a detrimental effect on our business. Litigation or proceedings before United States or international trademark offices may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights, to protect our trade secrets and domain name and/or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others. Any such infringement, litigation or adverse proceeding could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could seriously harm our business operations and/or the results of operations.


	 



	WE PLAN TO CONDUCT INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS TRANSACTIONS AND WILL BE EXPOSED TO LOCAL BUSINESS RISKS IN DIFFERENT COUNTRIES, WHICH COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.



	 


	We intend to market and sell our proposed communications product internationally, and we expect to have customers located in many countries. Our international operations will be subject to the risks inherent in doing business in foreign countries, including, but not necessarily limited to:


	 







	 





	·





	New and different legal and regulatory requirements in local jurisdictions;






	 




	 




	 






	 





	·





	Potentially adverse tax consequences, including the imposition or increase of taxes on transactions or withholding and other taxes on remittances and other payments;






	 




	 




	 






	 





	·





	Risk of nationalization of private enterprises by foreign governments;






	 




	 




	 






	 





	·





	Legal restrictions on doing business in or with certain nations, certain parties and/or certain products; and,






	 




	 




	 






	 





	·





	Local economic, political and social conditions, including the possibility of hyperinflationary conditions and political instability.






	 






	We may not be successful in developing and implementing policies and strategies to address the foregoing factors in a timely and effective manner in the locations where we intend to do business. Consequently, the occurrence of one or more of the foregoing factors could have a material adverse effect on our operations and upon our financial condition and results of operations.


	 


	Since our proposed communications product will be available for subscription over the Internet in foreign countries and we will have customers residing in foreign countries, foreign jurisdictions may require us to qualify to do business in their countries. We may be required to comply with certain laws and regulations of each country in which we conduct business, including laws and regulations currently in place or which may be enacted related to Internet sales and communications services available to the residents of each country from online sites located elsewhere.

	FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH EXISTING U.S. AND NON-U.S. PRIVACY LAWS AND REGULATIONS, OR THE ENACTMENT OF NEW PRIVACY LAWS OR REGULATIONS, COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS.



	 


	A variety of U.S. and non-U.S. laws and regulations govern the collection, use, retention, sharing and security of consumer data. Existing privacy-related laws and regulations are evolving and are subject to potentially differing interpretations. In addition, U.S. and non-U.S. legislative and regulatory bodies may expand current laws or enact new laws regarding privacy matters. We intend to post privacy policies and practices concerning the collection, use and disclosure of subscriber data on our website. Several U.S. states have adopted legislation that requires businesses to implement and maintain reasonable security procedures and practices to protect sensitive personal information and to provide notice to consumers in the event of a security breach. Any failure, or perceived failure, by us to comply with our posted privacy policies or with any data-related consent orders, U.S. Federal Trade Commission requirements or orders or other U.S. or non-U.S. privacy or consumer protection-related laws, regulations or industry self-regulatory principles could result in claims, proceedings or actions against us by governmental entities or others, or other liabilities, which could adversely affect our business. In addition, a failure or perceived failure to comply with industry standards or with our own privacy policies and practices could result in a loss of subscribers and adversely affect our business.


	 



	THE FAILURE OF THIRD-PARTY SYSTEMS OR THIRD-PARTY SERVICE AND SOFTWARE PROVIDERS UPON WHICH WE WILL RELY COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS.



	 


	We will rely on certain third-party computer systems or third-party service and software providers, including data centers, technology platforms, back-office systems, Internet service providers and communication facilities. Any interruption in these third-party services, or deterioration in their performance or quality, could adversely affect our business. If our arrangement with any third-party is terminated, we may not be able to find alternative systems or service providers on a timely basis or on commercially reasonable terms. This could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.


	 


	We plan to host our website and serve all of our potential subscribers from third-party Internet servers, which will be located at various data center facilities. Problems faced by these data center locations or with the telecommunications network providers with whom they may contract, could adversely affect the experience of our subscribers. If these data centers are unable to keep up with our growing needs for capacity or close without adequate notice, this could have an adverse effect on our business. Any changes in third-party service levels at these data centers or any errors, defects, disruptions, or other performance problems with these services could harm our reputation and adversely affect the performance of our proposed communications product. Interruptions in these services might reduce our sales revenues, subject us to potential liability and thereby adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.


	 


	We cannot guarantee that our website will operate or our proposed communications product will function without interruption or error. We are bound only by a best efforts obligation as regards the operation and continuity of service. Although we are not liable for the fraudulent access to data and/or accidental transmission through viruses or other harmful conduct in connection with the use of our website or proposed product, disruption of our communications service would adversely affect our business, financial conditions, results of operations and cash flows.


	 



	THERE IS A RISK THAT WE MAY BE UNABLE TO CONTINUE TO PROVIDE OUR PROPOSED COMMUNICATIONS PRODUCT OR CONTINUE OPERATIONS IF WE EXPERIENCE UNINSURED LOSSES OR AN ACT OF GOD.



	 


	We may, but are not required to, obtain comprehensive liability and other business insurance of the types customarily maintained by businesses similar to our own. There are certain types of extraordinary occurrences, however, which may be either uninsurable or not economically insurable. For example, in the event of a major earthquake, our computer systems could be rendered inoperable for protracted periods of time, which would impair our ability to maintain our website, market and sell our proposed communications product and collect revenues, thus adversely affecting our financial condition. In the event of a major civil disturbance, our operations could also be adversely affected. If such an uninsured loss should occur, we could lose significant revenues and financial opportunities in amounts that would not be partially or fully compensated by insurance proceeds.


	 




	 




	15













	 




	 



	WE CANNOT ASSURE YOU THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO EFFECTIVELY MANGE THE GROWTH OF OUR COMPANY.



	 


	We anticipate experiencing rapid growth in demand for our proposed communications product. We expect the number of our consultants, service providers, employees, and customers to increase over time once we launch our sales and marketing campaign, and we expect our growth to continue for the foreseeable future. The growth and expansion of our business and product offerings could place significant demands on our management and our operational and financial resources. We will need to manage multiple relationships with various consultants, customers, website developers and other third parties. To effectively manage the growth of our company, we will need to continually implement operational plans and strategies, improve and expand our infrastructure of people and information systems, and train and manage our future employee and third-party service provider base. Our inability to effectively manage the growth of our company would have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.


	 



	WE WILL BE SUBJECT TO PAYMENTS-RELATED RISKS.



	 


	We plan to accept payment for subscriptions to our proposed communications product using a variety of methods, including credit cards and debit cards. As we offer new payment options to consumers, we may be subject to additional regulations, compliance requirements and fraud. Not being a financial institution, we cannot belong to or directly access credit card associations, such as American Express, VISA, MasterCard, etc. As a result, we will have to rely on banks or payment processors to process transactions for us. If these companies become unwilling or unable to provide these services to us, our business and subscriber services will likely suffer substantial disruption. For certain payment methods, including credit and debit cards, we will be required to pay interchange and other fees, which may increase over time, raise our operating costs and lower our profitability. We will also be subject to payment card association operating rules, certification requirements and rules governing electronic funds transfers, which could change or be reinterpreted to make it difficult or impossible for us to comply. If we fail to comply with these rules or requirements, we may be subject to fines and higher transaction fees and lose our ability to accept credit and debit card payments from consumers or facilitate other types of online payments, and our business and operating results could be adversely affected.


	 



	Risks Related to Our Common Stock



	 



	INVESTING IN THE COMMON STOCK OF OUR COMPANY IS A HIGHLY SPECULATIVE INVESTMENT AND COULD RESULT IN THE LOSS OF YOUR ENTIRE INVESTMENT.



	 


	A purchase of the shares offered in this prospectus is highly speculative and involves significant risks. Any person who cannot afford the loss of his or her entire investment should not purchase the offered shares. Our business objectives are also speculative and we may be unable to satisfy those objectives. The shareholders of our company may be unable to realize a substantial return on their purchase of the offered shares, or any return whatsoever, and may lose their entire investment in our company. For this reason, each prospective purchaser of the offered shares should read this prospectus and all of its exhibits carefully and consult with their attorney, business advisor and/or investment advisor.


	 



	IN THE EVENT THAT OUR SHARES ARE PUBLICLY TRADED, OUR STOCK PRICE MAY BE VOLATILE.



	 


	In the event that our shares are publicly traded, the market price of our common stock is likely to be highly volatile and could fluctuate widely in price in response to various potential factors, many of which will be beyond the company's control, including the following: 


	 






	 





	·





	Changes in the reliability or availability of our proposed product by us or our potential competitors;






	 




	 




	 






	 





	·





	Additions or departures of key personnel;






	 




	 




	 






	 





	·





	The company's ability to execute its business plan;






	 




	 




	 






	 





	·





	Operating results that fall below expectations;






	 




	 




	 






	 





	·





	Industry developments;






	 


	In addition, the securities markets have from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that are unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. These market fluctuations may also materially and adversely affect the market price of the company's common stock.


	 




	 




	16













	 




	  



	AS A PUBLIC COMPANY, WE WILL INCUR SUBSTANTIAL EXPENSES.



	 


	Upon declared effectiveness of this registration statement by the Securities and Exchange Commission, we will become subject to the information and reporting requirements of the U.S. securities laws. The U.S. securities laws require, among other things, review, audit, and public reporting of our financial results, business activities, and other matters. Recent Securities and Exchange Commission regulation, including regulation enacted as a result of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 has also substantially increased the accounting, legal, and other costs related to becoming and remaining a Securities and Exchange Commission reporting company. If we do not have current information about our company available to market makers, they will not be able to trade our stock. The public company costs of preparing and filing annual and quarterly reports, and other information with the Securities and Exchange Commission and furnishing audited reports to stockholders, will cause our expenses to be higher than they would be if we were privately-held. These increased costs may be material and may include the hiring of additional employees and/or the retention of additional advisors and professionals. As a result, we may not have sufficient funds to grow our operations. Additionally, our failure to comply with the U.S. securities laws could result in private or governmental legal action against the company and/or our officers and directors, which could have a detrimental effect on our business and finances, the value of our common stock, and the ability of stockholders to resell their stock.


	 



	WE HAVE NOT YET ADOPTED CERTAIN CORPORATE GOVERNANCE MEASURES.



	 


	The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as well as rule changes proposed and enacted by the Securities and Exchange Commission, the New York and American Stock Exchanges and the NASDAQ Stock Market, as a result of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, requires the implementation of various measures relating to corporate governance. These measures are designed to enhance the integrity of corporate management and the securities markets and apply to securities that are listed on those exchanges or the NASDAQ Stock Market. Because we are not presently required to comply with many of these corporate governance provisions and because we chose to avoid incurring the substantial additional costs associated with such compliance any sooner than necessary, we have not yet adopted these measures.


	 


	Because our sole director is non-independent, we do not currently have independent audit or compensation committees. As a result, our sole director has the ability, among other things, to determine his own level of compensation. Until we comply with such corporate governance measures, regardless of whether such compliance is required, the absence of such standards of corporate governance may leave our stockholders without protections against interested director transactions, conflicts of interest and similar matters and investors may be reluctant to provide us with funds necessary to expand our operations.


	 



	IN THE EVENT THAT OUR SHARES ARE PUBLICLY TRADED, THEY MAY TRADE UNDER $5.00 PER SHARE AND THUS WILL BE A "PENNY STOCK."



	 


	In the event that our shares are publicly traded, and our stock trades below $5.00 per share, our stock would be known as a "penny stock," which is subject to various regulations involving disclosures to be given prior to the purchase of any penny stock. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has adopted regulations which generally define a "penny stock" to be any equity security that has a market price of less than $5.00 per share, subject to certain exceptions. Depending on market fluctuations, our common stock could be considered to be a "penny stock." A penny stock is subject to rules that impose additional sales practice requirements on broker/dealers who sell these securities to persons other than established customers and accredited investors. For transactions covered by these rules, the broker/dealer must make a special suitability determination for the purchase of these securities. In addition, he must receive the purchaser's written consent to the transaction prior to the purchase. He must also provide certain written disclosures to the purchaser. Consequently, the "penny stock" rules may restrict the ability of broker/dealers to sell our securities, and may negatively affect the ability of holders of shares of our common stock to resell them. These disclosures require acknowledgement that the investor understands the risks associated with buying penny stocks and can absorb the loss of the entire investment. Penny stocks are low priced securities that do not have a very high trading volume. Consequently, the price of the stock is often volatile and an investor may not be able to buy or sell the stock when desired.


	 




	 




	17













	 




	 



	IN THE EVENT THAT OUR SHARES ARE PUBLICLY TRADED, FINRA RULES MAY LIMIT A STOCKHOLDER'S ABILITY TO BUY AND SELL OUR STOCK.



	 


	The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) has adopted rules that relate to the application of the Securities and Exchange Commission's "penny stock" rules and require that a broker/dealer have reasonable grounds for believing that the investment is suitable for that customer, prior to recommending the investment. Prior to recommending speculative, low priced securities to their non-institutional customers, broker/dealers must make reasonable efforts to obtain information about the customer's financial status, tax status, investment objectives and other information. Under interpretations of these rules, FINRA believes that there is a high probability that speculative, low priced securities will not be suitable for at least some customers. In the event that our shares are publicly traded and are considered to be a "penny stock," these FINRA requirements will make it more difficult for broker/dealers to recommend that their customers buy our common stock, which may have the effect of reducing the level of trading activity and liquidity of our common stock. Further, many brokers charge higher transactional fees for penny stock transactions. As a result, fewer broker/dealers may be willing to make a market in our common stock, reducing a shareholder's ability to resell shares of our common stock.


	 



	IF WE ARE DISSOLVED, IT IS UNLIKELY THAT THERE WILL BE SUFFICIENT ASSETS REMAINING TO DISTRIBUTE TO SHAREHOLDERS.



	 


	In the event of our dissolution, any proceeds realized from the liquidation of our assets will be distributed to shareholders only after all the claims of our creditors are satisfied. In that case, the ability of purchasers of the offered shares to recover any portion of the purchase price for the offered shares will depend on the amount of funds realized and the claims to be satisfied.


	 



	INVESTORS WILL PAY MORE FOR OUR COMMON STOCK THAN THE PRO RATA PORTION OF OUR ASSETS ARE WORTH. AS A RESULT, INVESTING IN OUR COMMON STOCK MAY RESULT IN AN IMMEDIATE LOSS.



	 


	The offering price and other terms and conditions regarding our shares have been arbitrarily determined by us and do not bear any relationship to assets, earnings, book value or any other objective criteria of value. Additionally, since we have recently formed and have only a limited operating history and no earnings, the price of the offered shares is not based on our past earnings. No investment banker, appraiser or other independent third party has been consulted concerning the offering price for the shares or the fairness of the offering price used for the shares.


	 


	The arbitrary offering price of $0.02 per common share is substantially higher than the net tangible book value of $0.00074 per share of our common stock. Our assets do not substantiate a share price of $0.02 per share. This premium in share price applies to the terms of this offering and does not attempt to reflect any forward-looking share price subsequent to our obtaining a listing on any exchange, or becoming quoted on either the Over-The-Counter Bulletin Board or the OTC Markets, if ever.


	 




	 




	18













	 




	 



	OUR MANAGEMENT COULD ISSUE ADDITIONAL SHARES OR CREATE AND ISSUE ADDITIONAL CLASSES OF SHARES, THEREBY DILUTING OUR CURRENT SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY.



	 


	We have 200,000,000 authorized shares of common stock with a par value of $0.001 per share, of which 10,000,000 shares of common stock are currently issued and outstanding. If this offering is fully subscribed, 19,000,000 shares of common stock will be issued and outstanding after the offering terminates. We only have a single class of shares (i.e., common stock) and do not anticipate creating any additional classes of shares in the foreseeable future. Our management could, without the consent of our then existing shareholders, issue substantially more shares or create and issue additional classes of shares, potentially causing a large dilution in the equity position of our then existing shareholders. Additionally, large share issuances by us would generally have a negative impact on our share price. It is possible that, due to additional share issuance or the creation and issuance of additional classes of shares, you could lose a substantial amount, or all, of your investment.


	 



	WE DO NOT HAVE AN ESCROW OR TRUST ACCOUNT FOR INVESTOR SUBSCRIPTIONS.



	 


	Invested funds for this offering will not be placed in an escrow or trust account. Accordingly, if we file for bankruptcy protection, or creditors file a petition for involuntary bankruptcy against us, investor funds will become part of the bankruptcy estate and administered according to the bankruptcy laws. As such, investors will lose their investment and their funds will be used to pay creditors and will not be used for developing our business.


	 



	WE DO NOT ANTICIPATE PAYING DIVIDENDS IN THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE.



	 


	We do not anticipate paying dividends on either our common stock, or on any class of preferred stock that may be created and issued, in the foreseeable future. Rather, we plan to retain earnings, if any, for the operation, growth and expansion of our business.

	The actual costs may differ from the estimated figures outlined above. For our expected timeline for completion of our Plan of Operations, see Page 28.

	 

	The proceeds received from this offering will not be used, fully or in part, to pay salary or make any other payment to our sole officer and director, Mr. Wilaiphan. The estimated expenses to comply with our obligations under the federal securities laws in connection with the issuance and distribution of the securities in this offering are included in the $9,370 in expenses related to this offering as outlined above.


	 


	The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission registration fee has been calculated pursuant to sections 6(b), 13(e), or 14(g) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The fee is $100.70 per $1,000,000 (prorated for amounts less than $1,000,000). It is calculated by multiplying the aggregate offering amount by .00010070 ($180,000 x .00010070 = $18.13) and has been rounded up to $20 for the purpose of estimating our offering expenses.


	 


	There is no minimum amount we are required to raise in this offering and any funds received will be immediately available to us.


	 


	The above expenditures are defined as follows:


	 



	Expenses Related to this Offering:

	Fees paid to our attorney and independent auditors for the preparation and filing of documents required by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission with respect to this registration statement, and other State and Federal documents. Additionally, fees paid to third-party EDGAR services for filing these documents with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and fees paid to the transfer agent for issuing corporate stock and facilitating subsequent stock transactions and oversight, and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission registration fee described above.


	 



	Expenses to Maintain our Reporting Status for 12 Months after Effective Date:

	We expect to spend $10,000 per year for auditor's fees in relation to our annual audit and quarterly reviews. We expect to have annual costs related to EDGARization of $2,600 and XBRL mapping of $3,750.


	 


	For a more detailed description of the expenditures described above, please refer to our Plan of Operations on Page 28.


	 


	There is no assurance that we will be able to raise the entire amount of this offering. The chart on Page 20 details how we will use the proceeds if we raise only 25% or 50% or 75% of this offering.


	 


	If less than 100% of this offering is sold, we will have to reduce both our development and marketing plans. In order to try to guarantee the success of the development of our business, in this situation we will prioritize spending based on the viability of the Company. Therefore, we will allocate the majority of the funds raised to first hire third-party software developers to develop our communications product and, second, to hire third-party web developers to develop our website. Thereafter, if sufficient funds are available, we will invest in hiring third parties to perform quality assurance testing, support services and Internet marketing.


	 



	DETERMINATION OF OFFERING PRICE



	 



	The price of the current offering is fixed at $0.02 per share for the duration of the offering. As there is no established public market for our shares, the offering price and other terms and conditions relative to our shares have been arbitrarily determined by us and do not bear any relationship to assets, earnings, book value, or any other objective criteria of value. In addition, no investment banker, appraiser, or other independent third party has been consulted concerning the offering price for the shares or the fairness of the offering price used for the shares.

	DILUTION





	 



	The price of the current offering is fixed at $0.02 per share for the duration of the offering. This price is significantly greater than the price paid by our sole officer and director for common equity since the Company's inception on August 25, 2015. Our sole officer and director paid $0.001 per share, a difference of $0.019 per share lower than the share price in this offering. Anyone investing in our common stock through this offering will immediately have significant dilution of his or her common stock.



	  


	Dilution represents the difference between the offering price and the net tangible book value per share immediately after completion of this offering. Net tangible book value is the amount that results from subtracting total liabilities and intangible assets from total assets. Dilution arises mainly as a result of our arbitrary determination of the offering price of the shares being offered. Dilution of the value of the shares you purchase is also a result of the lower book value of the shares held by our existing shareholders. The following tables compare the differences of your investment in our shares with the investment of our existing shareholders.

Mr. Wilaiphan will not receive commission from the sale of the shares. Mr. Wilaiphan will not register as a broker/dealer pursuant to Section 15 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, in reliance upon Rule 3a4-1. Rule 3a4-1 sets forth those conditions under which a person associated with our company may participate in the offering of our securities and not be deemed to be a broker/dealer. The conditions are that:


	 






	 





	·





	The person is not subject to a statutory disqualification, as that term is defined in Section 3(a)(39) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, at the time of his or her participation;






	 




	 




	 






	 





	·





	The person is not compensated in connection with his or her participation by the payment of commissions or other remuneration based either directly or indirectly on transactions in securities;






	 




	 




	 






	 





	·

Mr. Wilaiphan has not during the last 12 months and will not in the next 12 months offer or sell securities for another corporation.


	 


	Only after the Securities and Exchange Commission declares this registration statement effective, do we intend to advertise, through tombstones, and hold investment meetings in various states where the offering will be registered. We will not utilize the Internet to advertise our offering. We will also distribute this prospectus to potential investors at the investment meetings and to friends, relatives and business associates of Mr. Wilaiphan, who are interested in a possible investment in this offering.

	DESCRIPTION OF SECURITIES TO BE REGISTERED



	 



	Common Stock





	 


	Our authorized common stock consists of 200,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share. The holders of our common stock:


	 








	*




	have equal ratable rights to dividends from funds legally available if and when declared by our board of directors;






	 




	 




	 








	*




	are entitled to share ratably in all of our assets available for distribution to holders of common stock upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up of our affairs;
















	*




	do not have preemptive, subscription or conversion rights and there are no redemption or sinking fund provisions or rights; and
















	*




	are entitled to one non-cumulative vote per share on all matters on which stockholders may vote.





	 


	We refer you to the bylaws of our articles of incorporation and the applicable statutes of the State of Nevada for a more complete description of the rights and liabilities of holders of our securities.


	 



	Preferred Stock



	 


	At this time we have not created nor anticipate creating any class of preferred stock. The bylaws of our articles of incorporation authorize the board of directors, without stockholder action, to provide for the creation and issuance of preferred stock in one or more classes and to determine with respect to each such class the voting powers, if any (which voting powers, if granted, may be full or limited), designations, preferences, and relative, participating, option, or other special rights, and the qualifications, limitations, or restrictions relating thereto.


	 



	Preemptive Rights and Non-Cumulative Voting



	 


	Our stockholders do not have preemptive rights to acquire additional shares of stock or securities convertible into shares of stock issued by our company. Also our stockholders do not have cumulative voting rights, which means that the holders of more than 50% of the outstanding shares, voting for the election of directors, can elect all of the directors to be elected, if they so choose, and, in that event, the holders of the remaining shares will not be able to elect any of our directors. After this offering is completed, if fully subscribed, Arraya Wilaiphan, our present stockholder will own 52.63% of our outstanding shares.


	 




	 




	25













	 




	 



	Cash Dividends



	 


	As of the date of this prospectus, we have not declared or paid any cash dividends to stockholders. The declaration of any future cash dividend will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon our earnings, if any, our capital requirements and financial position, our general economic condition, and other pertinent conditions. It is our present intention not to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future, but rather to reinvest future earnings, if any, in our business operations.


	 



	Anti-Takeover Provisions



	 


	There are no Nevada anti-takeover provisions that may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in our control. Sections 78.378 through 78.3793 of the Nevada Revised Statutes relate to control share acquisitions that may delay, so as to make it more difficult to acquire our company or change the control of our company. However, these provisions only apply when we have 200 or more stockholders of record, at least 100 of whom have addresses in the State of Nevada appearing on our stock ledger, and we do business in Nevada directly or through an affiliated corporation. Neither of the foregoing events seems likely to occur. Currently, we have no Nevada shareholders and, since this offering will not be made in the State of Nevada, no shares will be sold to Nevada residents. Further, we do not do business in Nevada directly or through an affiliate corporation and we do not intend to do business in the State of Nevada in the future. Accordingly, there are no anti-takeover provisions that have the effect of delaying or preventing an acquisition or a change in our control.



	 





	STOCK TRANSFER AGENT



	 


	We have not engaged the services of a transfer agent at this time. However, within the next twelve months we anticipate doing so. Until a transfer agent is retained, we will act as our own transfer agent.


	 





	LEGAL PROCEEDINGS



	 


	We are not a party to any material legal proceedings and to our knowledge, no such proceedings are threatened or contemplated by any party.


	 



	DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS



	 



	Business Development



	 



	We are a development-stage company, incorporated on August 25, 2015 in the State of Nevada, with a fiscal year end of August 31. We do not own or lease any property.


	The only employee of the Company is its sole officer and director, Arraya Wilaiphan. We are a development-stage company that intends to develop, market and sell a subscription communications service providing secure point-to-point e-mail messages and attachments. To date, our operations have been limited to researching the marketplace for our proposed communications product and the issues entailed in developing this product, as well as the preliminary design and development of our website. We have not yet implemented our business model or undertaken development of our proposed communications product. To date, we have generated no revenues from our operations.


	There can be no assurances that our efforts to develop our proposed communications service will succeed, or that we will be able to market our proposed communications service, if developed.





	  



	Our Business



	 


	We intend to develop, launch, market and sell (via subscription), what will be (depending on user preferences) the most secure, closed point-to-point e-mail system available today. At the present time, privacy breeches in communications between friends, family members, corporate employees and even lovers, are daily events. Malicious attacks on personal and corporate data are difficult to control, particularly given today's open communications services and cloud storage offerings. Our proposed closed messaging system will be designed to alleviate the majority of security concerns inherent in the most popular, open style, text and e-mail communications systems available today.


	 




	 




	26













	 




	 


	Our proposed messageBgone Application (MBA) is not an e-mail system

	per se

	(nor is it a replacement for conventional e-mail) and will not accept messages sent through other e-mail or communications providers. The MBA will also not permit messages to be sent via interface with other e-mail or communications providers. Only e-mail messages created within the MBA application and sent between MBA users will be allowed. This will create a completely closed and secure, point-to-point communications system between MBA subscribers, allowing them to send unlimited messages, in the format of e-mail, together with Portable Document Format (PDF) attachments, if desired. Once subscribed, an MBA user will be able to download either a Windows- or Mac-based software application that will facilitate the exchange of secure encrypted messages and attachments between MBA subscribers within the closed system.


	 



	Market Opportunity



	 


	Some of the weakest links in computer security result from the combination of computers utilizing operating systems such as Windows and OSI, together with web browsers such as Safari ™ and Explorer ™, with a multitude of known and ever-emerging security issues. Any messaging system running within a web browser can only be as secure as the browser itself and can readily lend itself to security breeches due to browser security shortcomings, rather than security issues with the computer program itself. Therefore, instead of being a web browser-based computer application, the MBA will function as a low-level application that will not interact with either computer operating systems or web browsers.


	 


	By writing low-level code that will operate independently, below a computer's operating system and outside of any web browser, there is little chance that a breech of the operating system or browser security will have any impact on the security of the MBA. For added security we intend to block the functionality of some operating system "hot keys" (such as "print screen" and "screen capture") to assist in the containment of the received message. We will also recommend other security precautions to our users in an effort to help them identify and remove malware, key-logging technologies and other types of spyware that could affect a MBA user's message security.


	 


	Every message and attachment sent via the MBA will be encrypted on the user's desktop utilizing AES 256 bit encryption and will then be uploaded to be stored on the messageBgone server, where it will remain encrypted until downloaded and unencrypted by the recipient MBA user. Additional security features will include no message logging, no password logging and no Internet Protocol logging or retention. Additionally, when a message is deleted from the messageBgone server it is truly gone forever. No copies of the message will ever be stored on either the sender's or the recipient's computer.


	 


	The MBA will allow a user to compose and send messages in the format of e-mail, attaching a PDF if desired, and view messages and PDF attachments only in the MBA. There will be no way to save a message or an attachment - only the ability to view it. Once the message's intended recipient downloads, unencrypts and views the message and/or attachment, it will be automatically deleted from the messageBgone server forever when the recipient closes their MBA. If a message is sent to a user and is undelivered for a period of five days (individual users may choose a shorter auto delete period), it will be also be permanently deleted from the server. The messageBgone server and the MBA will have no directory of users. Therefore, a message author will need to know the MBA address of the recipient and type it into the application on the creation of every message. Once a message is opened in the MBA it will remain on the user's screen for five minutes and will then permanently auto-delete. Additionally, the application will close in 120 seconds if there is no user interaction.


	 


	The Company will setup severs in various countries, depending on the most favorable hosting and security issues. (For example, Germany does not require severs to store a traffic logs of IP addresses and visitors.) The website that will be designed to allow customers to subscribe to and download the MBA service and will accept both traditional (Credit Cards, PayPal) and alternative (Bitcoins, hyper wallets) payment methods that will give customers additional levels of security with the option of total anonymity. If a MBA customer should choose to use an anonymous payment system such as Bitcoins, this MBA user would be anonymous even to us. Should an MBA user also choose to utilize their own one-time AES 256 bit encryption key for every message, they would enjoy the greatest level of security and anonymity available in the industry, as it could take hundreds or even thousands of years to decrypt a single message if it where ever to be intercepted.

	Employees and Employment Agreements



	 


	We have no employees other than our sole officer and director, Arraya Wilaiphan. Mr. Wilaiphan is also employed elsewhere, has the flexibility to work on our company approximately fifteen hours per week and may be prepared to devote additional time to our operations if required.


	 


	We presently do not have pension, health, annuity, insurance, stock options, profit sharing, or similar benefit plans; however, we may adopt such plans in the future. There are presently no personal benefits available to our director for time spent as a director.




	 





	MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OR PLAN OF OPERATION



	 


	The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our audited financial statements and the related notes that appear elsewhere in this registration statement and prospectus. The following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates and beliefs. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in these forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed below and elsewhere in this registration statement and prospectus, particularly in the section entitled "Risk Factors," which begins on Page 10.


	 


	Our audited financial statements are stated in U.S. dollars and are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (US GAAP).


	 



	Company Overview



	 


	We are a development-stage company that intends to provide a subscription-based, highly secure, closed point-to-point communications service for messages and attachments. We have recently commenced business operations and have not generated any revenues to date.


	 



	Plan of Operations



	 


	Over the twelve-month period commencing upon the effective date of this prospectus, we intend to develop our corporate website and the messageBgone Application (MBA), in addition to launching sales and marketing activities.


	 


	Within 90 days of this prospectus becoming effective we intend to design the look and feel of our website. We will use a third party design service, like 99 Designs, or a similar service to design our website. Our anticipated expenditure on this effort is detailed in the table on Page 20.


	 


	Within 180 days of this prospectus becoming effective, we will hire a third party development firm to build our website and develop the MBA. We anticipate hiring a firm located in Eastern Europe, India or China to undertake these tasks. We expect the initial release of the MBA within 270 days of this prospectus becoming effective. We will initially develop the MBA for use on both the Windows and Mac platforms and will seek to develop the MBA for use on OSI and Android platforms in the future. Our anticipated expenditure on this effort is detailed in the table on Page 20.


	 




	 




	28













	 




	 


	Within 270 days of this prospectus becoming effective, we anticipate developing our marketing materials, user guide and sales guide. We will also research publications that cater to our target market and attempt to get editorials in these publications to create additional product awareness. Our marketing efforts will be primarily Internet-based and may include some or all of the following:


	 











	 





	·





	Display Advertising - Using web banners or banner advertisements placed on third-party websites to drive traffic to our website and thereby increase awareness for our proposed products.






	 




	 




	 






	 





	·





	Search Engine Marketing - Promoting our website by increasing its visibility in search engines through the use of paid placement, contextual advertising, and paid inclusion, or through the use of free search engine optimization techniques.






	 




	 




	 






	 





	·





	Search Engine Optimization - Improving the visibility of our website in search engines via "natural" or un-paid ("organic" or "algorithmic") search results.






	 




	 




	 






	 





	·





	Social Media Marketing – Seeking to increase and gain traffic and attention to our website through creating and maintaining a presence on a variety of social media sites.





	 






	Traditional e-product marketing utilizing social media, non-spam e-mail, fax blasts and press releases will also be utilized to increase product awareness. Our anticipated expenditure on this effort is detailed in the table on Page 20. We expect to complete this phase within 360 days of the effective date of this prospectus.


	 


	We may attempt to raise additional money through private placements, public offerings or long-term loans in order to expand and enhance our proposed product offerings, enhance our presence in the marketplace, enter into different facets of the marketplace, increase our product sales and grow our business. We will also continue to refine our proposed product and optimize our Interned-based marketing efforts from the market feedback we expect to receive. We do not, at this point in time, have cost or timing estimates for these endeavors.


	 


	At present, Arraya Wilaiphan, our sole officer and director, through his investment in our common stock, has invested $10,000 in our company. Mr. Wilaiphan is willing to make additional financial commitments if required, but the total amount that he is willing to invest has not yet been determined. At the present time, we have not made any arrangements to raise additional cash other than through this offering; however, we intend to raise additional capital through private placements once we gain a quotation on the Over-The-Counter Bulletin Board or the OTC Markets, for which there is no assurance. If we need additional cash but are unable to raise it, we will either suspend development and marketing operations until we do raise the cash, or cease operations entirely. Other than as described in this paragraph, we have no other financing plans.


	 


	If we are unable to complete any phase of our development or marketing efforts because we do not have enough capital, we will cease our development and or marketing operations until we raise sufficient funds. Attempting to raise capital after failing in any phase of our development plan could be difficult. As such, if we cannot secure additional proceeds we will have to cease operations and investors would lose their entire investment.


	 


	We do not plan to hire additional employees at this time. Our sole officer and director will be responsible for the initial phases of our plan of operations. Once we are ready to begin development of our website and the MBA, we plan to hire independent consultants to do so.


	 


	We have no current plans, preliminary or otherwise, to merge with any other entity.

	Liquidity and Capital Resources



	 



	As of August 31, 2015, we had $5,945 in cash on hand and in the bank. We believe that this amount will clearly not satisfy our cash requirements for the next twelve months and, as such, we will need to raise proceeds through this offering or our sole officer and director will need to make additional financial commitments to our company, neither of which is guaranteed.


	Our sole officer and director, Arraya Wilaiphan, has agreed to lend the Company up to $20,000.00 in funds so it can remain a current issuer. There is no written agreement with Mr. Wilaiphan. The company will be able to conduct its business with current funding for an additional three quarters at its rate of expenditure.



	 



	In order for us to completely satisfy our cash requirements for the next twelve months, if this offering is not fully subscribed, we will require additional equity financing, most likely in the form of private placements of common stock. There is no additional offering planned at present.



	  


	We believe that if subsequent private placements are successful, this may allow us to operate our business to a point where we are generating sales revenues. However, additional equity financing may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all, and thus we could fail to satisfy our cash requirements for the next twelve months.


	 


	If we are unsuccessful in raising the additional proceeds through private placements we will then have to seek additional funds through debt financing, which would be extremely difficult and perhaps impossible for a new development-stage company to secure. However, if such financing were to be available, because we are a development-stage company with little or no operations, we would likely have to pay additional costs associated with high-risk loans and be subject to above-market interest rates. At such time as these funds may be required, we would evaluate the terms of such debt financing and determine whether the business could sustain operations and growth in addition to managing the debt load. If we cannot raise additional proceeds through private placements or debt financings, we would be required to cease business operations. As a result, an investor would lose all of their investment.


	 


	The staged development of our business operations (including our website and the MBA) will continue over the twelve-month period immediately following the effective date of our Registration Statement. Other than hiring independent consultants to design and develop our website and the MBA and engage in marketing activities, we do not anticipate hiring any other independent consultants. We do not expect to purchase any significant equipment or facilities and we do not anticipate hiring any employees. Our current material commitments include the total costs of the planned offering as provided herein, estimated at $9,370.


	 


	Our auditors have issued a "going concern" opinion. This means that there is substantial doubt that we can continue as an ongoing business for the next twelve months unless we obtain additional capital to pay our bills. This is because we have not generated any revenues and no substantial revenues are anticipated until we have completed the financing anticipated in this offering. Accordingly, we must raise cash from sources other than from the sale of our proposed communications product. Our only other source for cash at this time is investments by others in this offering. We must raise cash to implement our business strategy and stay in business. If this offering is not fully subscribed, we will likely not have adequate funds for us to operate for at least twelve months. In addition to raising additional capital, our success or failure will be determined by our ability to launch our website, develop the MBA and successfully market and sell the MBA.


	 



	Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements



	 


	We currently have no off-balance sheet arrangements, including outstanding derivative financial statements, off-balance sheet guarantees, interest rate swap transactions or foreign currency contracts. We do not engage in trading activities involving non-exchange traded contracts.


	 



	Intellectual Property



	 


	We intend, in due course, subject to legal advice, to apply for trademark protection and/or copyright protection in the United States, Canada, and other jurisdictions.


	 


	We intend to aggressively assert our rights under trademark and copyright laws to protect our intellectual property, including product design, product research and concepts and recognized trademarks. These rights are protected through the acquisition of trademark registrations, the maintenance of copyrights, and, where appropriate, litigation against those who are, in our opinion, infringing these rights.


	 




	 




	30













	 




	 


	While there can be no assurance that registered trademarks and copyrights will protect our proprietary information, we intend to assert our intellectual property rights against any infringer. Although any assertion of our rights can result in a substantial cost to, and diversion of effort by, our company, we believe that the protection of our intellectual property rights is a key component of our operating strategy.


	 



	Regulatory Matters



	 


	We are unaware of and do not anticipate having to expend significant resources to comply with any governmental regulations of data storage. In general, the development and operation of our business is not subject to special regulatory and/or supervisory requirements.


	 



	Environmental Laws



	 


	We have not incurred and do not anticipate incurring any expenses associated with environmental laws.




	 





	MARKET FOR COMMON EQUITY AND RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS



	 


	There is currently no trading market for our common stock. We do not have any common stock subject to outstanding options or warrants and there are no securities outstanding that are convertible into our common stock. None of our issued and outstanding common stock is eligible for sale pursuant to Rule 144 under the Securities Act of 1933. Rule 144, as currently in effect, allows a person who has beneficially owned shares of a company's common stock for at least twelve months to sell within any three-month period a number of shares that does not exceed the greater of:


	 







	1.



	One percent of the number of shares of the subject company's common stock then outstanding which, in our case, will equal 5,000 shares as of the date of this prospectus; or,















	2.



	The average weekly trading volume of the subject company's common stock during the four calendar weeks preceding the filing of a notice on Form 144 with respect to the sale.





	 


	Sales of common stock under Rule 144 are also subject to manner of sale provisions, notice requirements, and the subject company must be current in its public information filings.


	 


	Under Rule 144(k), a person who is not one of the subject company's affiliates at any time during the three months preceding a sale, and who has beneficially owned the shares proposed to be sold for at least two years, is entitled to sell shares without complying with the manner of sale, public information, volume limitation or notice provisions of Rule 144.


	 


	As of the date of this prospectus, persons who are our affiliates hold 10,000,000 shares of our common stock that may be sold pursuant to Rule 144 after August 25, 2016. Rule 144 applies to the 10,000,000 shares of our common stock except that subparagraph (k) of Rule 144 states that all shares owned by affiliates will continue to be subject to the resale limitations imposed by Rule 144 for so long as the shareholder remains an affiliate of our company. Three months after such persons cease to be affiliates of our company, sales may be made after the two-year period from the issue date without Rule 144 limitations under Rule 144(k).


	 


	We are registering 9,000,000 shares of our common stock under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, for sale. There is currently one holder of record of our common stock.


	 


	We have not declared any dividends on our common stock since the inception of our company. There is no restriction in our articles of incorporation or bylaws that will limit our ability to pay dividends on our common stock. However, we do not anticipate declaring and paying dividends to our shareholders in the near or foreseeable future.


	 




	 




	31













	 




	 


	Shares of our common stock may be subject to rules adopted by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, which regulate broker/dealer practices in connection with transactions in "penny stocks." "Penny stock" is defined to be any equity security that has a market price less than $5.00 per share or an exercise price of less than $5.00 per share, subject to certain exceptions. If we establish a trading market for our common stock, our common stock will most likely be covered by the penny stock rules, which impose additional sales practice requirements on broker/dealers who sell to persons other than established customers and "accredited investors." The term "accredited investor" refers generally to institutions with assets in excess of $5,000,000 or individuals with a net worth in excess of $1,000,000 or an annual income exceeding $200,000 (or $300,000 jointly with their spouse). The penny stock rules require a broker/dealer, prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from the rules, to deliver a standardized risk disclosure document in a format prescribed by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. This document provides information about penny stocks and the nature and level of risks in the penny stock marketplace. The broker/dealer must also provide the customer with current bid and offer quotations for the penny stock, the compensation of the broker/dealer and its salesperson in the transaction and monthly account statements showing the market value of each penny stock held in the customer's account. The bid and offer quotations, and the broker/dealer and salesperson compensation information, must be given to the customer orally or in writing prior to effecting the transaction and must be given to the customer in writing before or with the customer's confirmation. In addition, the penny stock rules require that prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from these rules the broker/dealer must make a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive the purchaser's written agreement to the transaction. These disclosure requirements may have the effect of reducing the level of trading activity in the secondary market for the stock that is subject to these penny stock rules. Consequently, these penny stock rules may affect the ability of broker/dealers to trade our securities.

	Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm




	 


	To the Board of Directors


	messageBgone, Inc.


	Chachoengsao, Thailand


	 


	We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of messageBgone, Inc. as of August 31 , 2015 and the related statements of operations, stockholders' deficit, and cash flows for the period August 25, 2015 (inception) through August 31, 2015. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits


	 


	We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. Our audits included consideration of internal control over fmancial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over fmancial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the fmancial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall fmancial statement presentation. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.


	 


	In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of messageBgone, Inc. as of August 31, 2015 and the results of its operations and cash flows for the period August 25, 2015 (inception) through August 31,2015, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.


	 


	The accompanying fmancial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 2 to the financial statements, the Company has limited operations and has no established source of revenue. This raises substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Management 's plan in regard to these matters is also described in Note 2. The fmancial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

	NOTE 1 – NATURE OF OPERATIONS AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION



	 


	MessageBgone, Inc. was incorporated in the State of Nevada as a for-profit Company on August 25, 2015 and established a fiscal year end of August 31. The Company intends to develop, market and sell the most secure, closed point-to-point messaging system available today.


	 



	Going concern



	 


	To date the Company has generated no revenues from its business operations and has incurred operating losses since inception of $2,555. As at August 31, 2015, the Company has working capital equity of $7,445. The Company will require additional funding to meet its ongoing obligations and to fund anticipated operating losses. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent on raising capital to fund its initial business plan and ultimately to attain profitable operations. Accordingly, these factors raise substantial doubt as to the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. The Company intends to continue to fund its business by way of private placements and advances from related parties as may be required. As of August 31, 2015 the Company has funded initial expensed through advances from the president. These financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts, or amounts and classification of liabilities that might result from this uncertainty.


	 



	NOTE 2 – SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES



	 



	Basis of presentation



	 


	The financial statements present the balance sheet, statements of operations, stockholders' equity and cash flows of the Company. These financial statements are presented in the United States dollars and have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.


	 



	Use of Estimates and Assumptions



	 


	Preparation of the financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect certain reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the period. Accordingly, actual results could differ from those estimates.


	 



	Cash and Cash Equivalents



	 


	Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand and on deposit at banking institutions as well as all highly liquid short-term investments with original maturities of 90 days or less. The Company did not have cash equivalents as of August 31, 2015.


	 



	Financial Instruments



	 


	All significant financial assets, financial liabilities and equity instruments of the Company are either recognized or disclosed in the financial statements together with other information relevant for making a reasonable assessment of future cash flows, interest rate risk and credit risk. Where practical the fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities have been determined and disclosed; otherwise only available information pertinent to fair value has been disclosed.


	 




	 




	39













	 




	 



	Loss per Common Share



	 


	The basic earnings (loss) per share are calculated by dividing the Company's net income available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares during the year. The diluted earnings (loss) per share is calculated by dividing the Company's net income (loss) available to common shareholders by the diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding during the year. The diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding is the basic weighted number of shares adjusted for any potentially dilutive debt or equity. Diluted earnings (loss) per share are the same as basic earnings (loss) per share due to the lack of dilutive items in the Company.


	 



	Income Taxes



	 


	The Company follows the liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax balances and tax loss carry-forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted or substantially enacted tax rates expected to apply to the taxable income in the years in which those differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the date of enactment or substantive enactment.


	 



	Stock-based Compensation



	 


	The Company follows ASC 718-10, "Stock Compensation", which addresses the accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services, with a primary focus on transactions in which an entity obtains employee services in share-based payment transactions. ASC 718-10 is a revision to SFAS No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation," and supersedes Accounting Principles Board ("APB") OpinionNo. 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees," and its related implementation guidance. ASC 718-10 requires measurement of the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant-date fair value of the award (with limited exceptions). Incremental compensation costs arising from subsequent modifications of awards after the grant date must be recognized. The Company has not adopted a stock option plan and has not granted any stock options. As at August 31, 2015 the Company had not adopted a stock option plan nor had it granted any stock options. Accordingly no stock-based compensation has been recorded to date.


	 



	Recent Accounting Pronouncements



	 


	In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-15, "Presentation of Financial Statements – Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40): Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity's Ability to Continue as a Going Concern" ("ASU 2014-15"). ASU 2014-15, which is effective for annual reporting periods ending after December 15, 2016, extends the responsibility for performing the going-concern assessment to management and contains guidance on how to perform a going-concern assessment and when going-concern disclosures would be required under U.S. GAAP. The Company does not anticipate that the adoption of ASU 2014-15 will have a material impact on its financial statements.


	 


	In June 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") No. 2014-10, "Development Stage Entities (Topic 915): Elimination of Certain Financial Reporting Requirements, Including an Amendment to Variable Interest Entities Guidance in Topic 810, Consolidation," ("ASU 2014-10"). ASU 2014-10 removes the definition of a development stage entity from the ASC, thereby removing the financial reporting distinction between development stage entities and other reporting entities from GAAP. In addition, ASU 2014-10 eliminates the requirements for development stage entities to (1) present inception-to-date information in the statements of operations, cash flows, and stockholders' equity, (2) label the financial statements as those of a development stage entity, (3) disclose a description of the development stage activities in which the entity is engaged, and (4) disclose in the first year in which the entity is no longer a development stage entity that in prior years it had been in the development stage. ASU 2014-10 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2014, and interim periods therein. Early adoption is permitted. The Company has elected to adopt ASU 2014-10 effective with this registration statement on Form S-1 and its adoption resulted in the removal of previously required development stage disclosures.

	NOTE 2 – SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)



	 



	Recent Accounting Pronouncements (continued)



	 


	The Company has implemented all new accounting pronouncements that are in effect and that may impact its financial statements and does not believe that there are any other new accounting pronouncements that have been issued that might have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations.


	 



	NOTE 3 – CAPITAL STOCK



	 


	The Company's capitalization is 200,000,000 common shares with a par value of $0.001 per share. No preferred shares have been authorized or issued.


	 


	As of August 31, 2015, the Company has not granted any stock options and has not recorded any stock-based compensation.


	 


	On August 25, 2015, the Company issued 10,000,000 common shares at $0.001 per share to the sole director and president of the Company for cash proceeds of $10,000.


	 





	NOTE 4 – INCOME TAXES



	 


	A reconciliation of the provision for income taxes at the United States federal statutory rate compared to the Company's income tax expense as reported is as follows:

	$


	–



	 






	 




	 




	41













	 




	  


	The significant components of deferred income tax assets at August 31, 2015 are as follows:


	 







	 



	 





	August 31,




	2015





	 






	Net operating loss carry-forward

	Valuation allowance




	 




	 



	(894


	)




	 



	 




	 




	 




	 






	Net deferred income tax asset




	 



	$


	–



	 






	 


	The amount taken into income as deferred income tax assets must reflect that portion of the income tax loss carry forwards that is more likely-than-not to be realized from future operations. The Company has chosen to provide a full valuation allowance against all available income tax loss carry forwards. The Company has recognized a valuation allowance for the deferred income tax asset since the Company cannot be assured that it is more likely than not that such benefit will be utilized in future years. The valuation allowance is reviewed annually. When circumstances change and which cause a change in management's judgment about the realizability of deferred income tax assets, the impact of the change on the valuation allowance is generally reflected in current income.


	 


	As of August 31, 2015, the Company has no unrecognized income tax benefits. The Company's policy for classifying interest and penalties associated with unrecognized income tax benefits is to include such items as tax expense. No interest or penalties have been recorded during the year ended August 31, 2015 no interest or penalties have been accrued as of August 31, 2015. As of August 31, 2015, the Company did not have any amounts recorded pertaining to uncertain tax positions.


	 


	The tax year from 2015 and forward remain open to examination by federal and state authorities due to net operating loss and credit carry forwards. The Company is currently not under examination by the Internal Revenue Service or any other taxing authorities.

	NOTES TO CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

	 





	NOVEMBER 30, 2015

	(Unaudited)








	  





	NOTE 1 – NATURE OF OPERATIONS AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION





	 




	MessageBgone, Inc. was incorporated in the State of Nevada as a for-profit Company on August 25, 2015 and established a fiscal year end of August 31. The Company intends to develop, market and sell the most secure, closed point-to-point messaging system available today.




	 





	Going concern





	 




	To date the Company has generated no revenues from its business operations and has incurred operating losses since inception of $8,844. As at November 20, 2015, the Company has working capital equity of $1,156. The Company will require additional funding to meet its ongoing obligations and to fund anticipated operating losses. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent on raising capital to fund its initial business plan and ultimately to attain profitable operations. Accordingly, these factors raise substantial doubt as to the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. The Company intends to continue to fund its business by way of private placements and advances from related parties as may be required. As of November 30, 2015 the Company has funded initial expensed through advances from the president. These financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts, or amounts and classification of liabilities that might result from this uncertainty.




	 





	NOTE 2 – SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES





	 





	Basis of Presentation – Unaudited Financial Statements





	 




	The accompanying unaudited financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles for financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q. They do not include all information and footnotes required by United States generally accepted accounting principles for complete financial statements. However, except as disclosed herein, there has been no material changes in the information disclosed in the notes to the financial statements for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2015 included in the Company's S-1 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The unaudited financial statements should be read in conjunction with those financial statements included in the Form S-1. In the opinion of Management, all adjustments considered necessary for a fair presentation, consisting solely of normal recurring adjustments, have been made. Operating results for the three months ended November 30, 2015 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending August 31, 2016.




	 





	Use of Estimates and Assumptions





	 




	Preparation of the financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect certain reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the period. Accordingly, actual results could differ from those estimates.

	NOVEMBER 30, 2015

	(Unaudited)









	 





	NOTE 2 – SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)








	 





	Cash and Cash Equivalents





	 




	Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand and on deposit at banking institutions as well as all highly liquid short-term investments with original maturities of 90 days or less. The Company did not have cash equivalents as of November 30, 2015.






	 





	Financial Instruments





	 




	All significant financial assets, financial liabilities and equity instruments of the Company are either recognized or disclosed in the financial statements together with other information relevant for making a reasonable assessment of future cash flows, interest rate risk and credit risk. Where practical the fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities have been determined and disclosed; otherwise only available information pertinent to fair value has been disclosed.




	 





	Loss per Common Share





	 




	The basic earnings (loss) per share are calculated by dividing the Company's net income available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares during the year. The diluted earnings (loss) per share is calculated by dividing the Company's net income (loss) available to common shareholders by the diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding during the year. The diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding is the basic weighted number of shares adjusted for any potentially dilutive debt or equity. Diluted earnings (loss) per share are the same as basic earnings (loss) per share due to the lack of dilutive items in the Company.




	 





	Income Taxes





	 




	The Company follows the liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax balances and tax loss carry-forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted or substantially enacted tax rates expected to apply to the taxable income in the years in which those differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the date of enactment or substantive enactment.

	Recent Accounting Pronouncements





	 




	The Company has implemented all new accounting pronouncements that are in effect and that may impact its financial statements and does not believe that there are any other new accounting pronouncements that have been issued that might have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations.










	 






	NOTE 3 – CAPITAL STOCK

	_________________ 






	(1)



	The person named above may be deemed to be a "parent" and "promoter" of our company, within the meaning of such terms under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, by virtue of his share ownership. Mr. Wilaiphan is the only "promoter" of our company.







	 



	CHANGES IN CONTROL





	 


	We are unaware of any contract, or other arrangement or provision in our articles of incorporation or bylaws, which would result in a change of control of our company.



	 





	CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS





	 


	Except as described below, none of the following parties have, since our date of incorporation, had any material interest, direct or indirect, in any transaction with us or in any presently proposed transaction that have or will materially affect us, other than as noted in this section:


	 







	1.



	Any of our directors or officers;















	2.



	Any person proposed as a nominee for election as a director;















	3.



	Any person who beneficially owns, directly or indirectly, shares carrying more than 5% of the voting rights attached to our outstanding shares of common stock;















	4.



	Any of our promoters; and,















	5.



	Any member of the immediate family (including spouse, parents, children, step-parents, step-children, siblings and in-laws) of any of the foregoing persons.





	 


	On August 25, 2015 we issued a total of 10,000,000 shares of common stock to Arraya Wilaiphan, our sole officer and director, for total cash consideration of $10,000. This was accounted for as a purchase of common stock.


	 




	Our sole officer and director, Arraya Wilaiphan, has agreed to lend the Company up to $20,000.00 in funds so it can remain a current issuer. There is no written agreement with Mr. Wilaiphan.




	 


	Our sole director is not independent because he is an executive officer of our company. The determination of the independence of a director has been made using the definition of "independent director" contained under NASDAQ Marketplace Rule 4200(a)(15).

	DISCLOSURE OF THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION POSITION ON




	INDEMNIFICATION FOR SECURITIES ACT OF 1933 LIABILITIES





	 


	Our bylaws provide that we shall, to the maximum extent permitted by Nevada law, have the power to indemnify each of our representatives against expenses and shall have the power to advance to each such representative expenses incurred in defending any proceeding to the maximum extent permitted by Nevada law.


	 


	Under our bylaws, the term "representative" includes any person who is or was a director, officer, employee or other representative of our company; or is or was serving at the request of our company as a director, officer, employee or representative of another foreign or domestic corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise; or was a director, officer, employee or representative of a foreign or domestic corporation which was a predecessor corporation of our company or of another enterprise at the request of such predecessor corporation. The term "proceeding" means any threatened, pending or completed action or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative. The term "expenses" includes, without limitation, attorney fees, judgments, fines, settlements, and other amounts actually and reasonably incurred in connection with any proceeding arising by reason of the fact any such person is or was a representative of our company.


	 


	Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act of 1933 may be permitted to directors, officers and controlling persons of our company under Nevada law or otherwise, our company has been advised that the opinion of the Securities and Exchange Commission is that such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and is, therefore, unenforceable.

	INDEMNIFICATION OF DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS




	Nevada corporation law provides that:


	 






	 





	·





	A corporation may indemnify any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, except an action by or in the right of the corporation, by reason of the fact that he is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, against expenses, including attorneys' fees, judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by him in connection with the action, suit or proceeding if he acted in good faith and in a manner which he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe his conduct was unlawful;






	 




	 




	 






	 





	·





	A corporation may indemnify any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action or suit by or in the right of the corporation to procure a judgment in its favor by reason of the fact that he is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise against expenses, including amounts paid in settlement and attorneys' fees actually and reasonably incurred by him in connection with the defense or settlement of the action or suit if he acted in good faith and in a manner which he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation. Indemnification may not be made for any claim, issue or matter as to which such a person has been adjudged by a court of competent jurisdiction, after exhaustion of all appeals therefrom, to be liable to the corporation or for amounts paid in settlement to the corporation, unless and only to the extent that the court in which the action or suit was brought or other court of competent jurisdiction determines upon application that in view of all the circumstances of the case, the person is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity for such expenses as the court deems proper; and,






	 




	 




	 






	 





	·





	To the extent that a director, officer, employee or agent of a corporation has been successful on the merits or otherwise in defense of any action, suit or proceeding, or in defense of any claim, issue or matter therein, the corporation shall indemnify him against expenses, including attorneys' fees, actually and reasonably incurred by him in connection with the defense.






	 








	We may make any discretionary indemnification only as authorized in a specific case upon which a determination that indemnification of the director, officer, employee or agent is proper in the circumstances. The determination must be made:


	 






	 





	·





	By our stockholders;






	 




	 




	 






	 





	·





	By our board of directors by majority vote of a quorum consisting of directors who were not parties to the action, suit or proceeding;






	 




	 




	 






	 





	·





	If a majority vote of a quorum consisting of directors who were not parties to the action, suit or proceeding so orders, by independent legal counsel in a written opinion;






	 




	 




	 






	 





	·





	If a quorum consisting of directors who were not parties to the action, suit or proceeding cannot be obtained, by independent legal counsel in a written opinion; or,






	 




	 




	 






	 





	·





	By court order.






	 




	 




	56













	 




	 





	Our bylaws provide that we shall, to the maximum extent permitted by Nevada law, have the power to indemnify each of our representatives against expenses and shall have the power to advance to each such representative expenses incurred in defending any such proceeding to the maximum extent permitted by that law.


	 


	Under our bylaws, the term "representative" includes any person who is or was a director, officer, employee or other representative of our company; or is or was serving at the request of our company as a director, officer, employee or representative of another foreign or domestic corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise; or was a director, officer, employee or representative of a foreign or domestic corporation which was a predecessor corporation of our company or of another enterprise at the request of such predecessor corporation. The term "proceeding" means any threatened, pending or completed action or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative. The term "expenses" includes, without limitation, attorneys' fees, judgments, fines, settlements, and other amounts actually and reasonably incurred in connection with any proceeding arising by reason of the fact any such person is or was a representative of our company.


	 


	Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act of 1933 may be permitted to directors, officers and controlling persons of our company under Nevada law or otherwise, we have been advised the opinion of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is that such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act of 1933 and is, therefore, unenforceable. In the event a claim for indemnification against such liabilities (other than payment by us for expenses incurred or paid by a director, officer or controlling person of our company in successful defense of any action, suit, or proceeding) is asserted by a director, officer or controlling person in connection with the securities being registered, we will, unless in the opinion of our independent legal counsel the matter has been settled by controlling precedent, submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction, the question of whether such indemnification by us is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act of 1933 and will be governed by the final adjudication of such issue.


	 



	RECENT SALES OF UNREGISTERED SECURITIES





	 


	On August 25, 2015 we issued 10,000,000 shares of common stock to Arraya Wilaiphan, our sole officer and director, for cash proceeds of $10,000, or $0.001 per share. We issued these 10,000,000 shares of common stock relying on Section 4(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.

	UNDERTAKINGS





	 


	The undersigned registrant hereby undertakes:


	 





	1.



	To file, during any period in which it offers or sells securities, a post-effective amendment to this, the effective registration statement, to:





	 







	a.



	Include any prospectus required by Section 10(a)(3) of the Securities Act of 1933;















	b.



	Reflect in the prospectus any facts or events which, individually or together, represent a fundamental change in the information in the effective registration statement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any increase or decrease in the volume of securities offered (if the total dollar value of securities offered would not exceed that which is registered) and any deviation from the low- or high-end of the estimated maximum offering range may be reflected in the form of prospectus filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) if, in the aggregate, the changes in volume and price represent no more than a 20% change in the maximum aggregate offering price set forth in the "Calculation of Registration Fee" table in the effective registration statement; and,















	c.



	To include any additional or changed material information on the plan of distribution.





	 





	2.



	For determining any liability under the Securities Act of 1933, treat each post-effective amendment as a new registration statement of the securities offered, and the offering of the securities at that time to be the initial bona fide offering.











	3.



	File a post-effective amendment to remove from registration any of the securities that remain unsold at the end of the offering.











	4.



	For determining liability of the registrant under the Securities Act of 1933 to any purchaser in the initial distribution of securities, the undersigned issuer undertakes that in a primary offering of securities of the registrant pursuant to this registration statement, regardless of the underwriting method used to sell the securities to the purchaser, if the securities are offered or sold to such purchasers by means of the following communications, the registrant will be a seller to the purchaser and will be considered to offer or sell such securities to such purchaser:





	 







	a.



	Any preliminary prospectus or prospectus of the registrant relating to the offering required to be filed pursuant to Rule 424;















	b.



	Any free writing prospectus relating to the offering prepared by or on behalf of the registrant or used or referred to by the registrant;















	c.



	The portion of any free writing prospectus relating to the offering containing material information about the registrant or its securities provided by or on behalf of the registrant; and,















	d.



	Any other communication that is an offer (in the offering) made by the registrant to the purchaser.





	 





	5.



	In the event that a claim for indemnification against such liabilities (other than the payment by the registrant of expenses incurred or paid by a director, officer, or controlling person of the registrant in the successful defense of any action, suit, or proceeding) is asserted by such director, officer, or controlling person connected with the securities being registered, the registrant will, unless in the opinion of its independent legal counsel the matter has been settled by controlling precedent, submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction the question whether such indemnification by it is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act of 1933 and will be governed by the final adjudication of such issue.











	6.



	Each prospectus filed pursuant to Rule 424(b) as part of a registration statement relating to an offering, other than registration statements relying on Rule 430B or other than prospectuses filed in reliance on Rule 430A shall be deemed to be part of and included in the registration statement as of the date it is first used after effectiveness; provided however, that no statement made in a registration statement or prospectus that is a part of the registration statement or made in a document incorporated or deemed incorporated by reference into the registration statement or prospectus that is part of the registration statement will, as to a purchaser with a time of contract of sale prior to such first use, supersede or modify any statement that was made in the registration statement or prospectus that was part of the registration statement or made in any such document immediately prior to such date of first use.

Forward-Looking
Statements

 

This
Annual Report on Form 10-K contains “forward-looking
statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities
Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Section 27A of the Securities Act of
1933, as amended, or the Securities Act, and Section 21E of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange
Act”). Forward-looking statements discuss matters that are
not historical facts. Because they discuss future events or
conditions, forward-looking statements may include words such as
“anticipate,” “believe,”
“estimate,” “intend,” “could,”
“should,” “would,” “may,”
“seek,” “plan,” “might,”
“will,” “expect,” “anticipate,”
“predict,” “project,”
“forecast,” “potential,”
“continue” negatives thereof or similar expressions.
Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made,
are based on various underlying assumptions and current
expectations about the future and are not guarantees. Such
statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other
factors that may cause our actual results, level of activity,
performance or achievement to be materially different from the
results of operations or plans expressed or implied by such
forward-looking statements.

 

We cannot
predict all of the risks and uncertainties. Accordingly, such
information should not be regarded as representations that the
results or conditions described in such statements or that our
objectives and plans will be achieved and we do not assume any
responsibility for the accuracy or completeness of any of these
forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are
found at various places throughout this Annual Report on Form 10-K
and include information concerning possible or assumed future
results of our operations, including statements about potential
acquisition or merger targets; business strategies; future cash
flows; financing plans; plans and objectives of management; any
other statements regarding future acquisitions, future cash needs,
future operations, business plans and future financial results, and
any other statements that are not historical facts.

 

These
forward-looking statements represent our intentions, plans,
expectations, assumptions and beliefs about future events and are
subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors. Many of those
factors are outside of our control and could cause actual results
to differ materially from the results expressed or implied by those
forward-looking statements. In light of these risks, uncertainties
and assumptions, the events described in the forward-looking
statements might not occur or might occur to a different extent or
at a different time than we have described. You are cautioned not
to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which
speak only as of the date of the Annual Report on Form 10-K. All
subsequent written and oral forward-looking statements concerning
other matters addressed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and
attributable to us or any person acting on our behalf are expressly
qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements contained
or referred to in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

 

Except to
the extent required by law, we undertake no obligation to update or
revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new
information, future events, a change in events, conditions,
circumstances or assumptions underlying such statements, or
otherwise.

ITEM 1.
BUSINESS

 

Business
Overview

 

We intend
to develop, launch, market and sell (via subscription), what will
be (depending on user preferences) the most secure, closed
point-to-point e-mail system available today. At the present time,
privacy breeches in communications between friends, family members,
corporate employees and even lovers, are daily events. Malicious
attacks on personal and corporate data are difficult to control,
particularly given todays open communications services and cloud
storage offerings. Our proposed closed messaging system will be
designed to alleviate the majority of security concerns inherent in
the most popular, open style, text and e-mail communications
systems available today.

 

Our
proposed messageBgone Application (MBA) is not an e-mail system
per se (nor is it a replacement for conventional e-mail) and
will not accept messages sent through other e-mail or
communications providers. The MBA will also not permit messages to
be sent via interface with other e-mail or communications
providers. Only e-mail messages created within the MBA application
and sent between MBA users will be allowed. This will create a
completely closed and secure, point-to-point communications system
between MBA subscribers, allowing them to send unlimited messages,
in the format of e-mail, together with Portable Document Format
(PDF) attachments, if desired. Once subscribed, an MBA user will be
able to download either a Windows- or Mac-based software
application that will facilitate the exchange of secure encrypted
messages and attachments between MBA subscribers within the closed
system. We have recently commenced business operations and have not
generated any revenues to date.

 

messageBgone,
Inc. is a shell company as defined in Rule 405, because it is a
company with nominal operations and it has assets consisting solely
of cash and cash equivalents. Our independent registered public
accountant has issued an audit opinion which includes statement
expressing substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a
going concern. Accordingly, there will be illiquidity of any future
trading market until the Company is no longer considered a shell
company.

 

There is
the likelihood that we may never be able to develop and market our
proposed point-to-point email system in order to successfully
complete and implement its plan of operation. If our company is not
capable of building a market for its product, all funds that we
spend on development will be lost.

On August
25, 2015, the Company issued 10,000,000 common shares at $0.001 per
share to the sole director and president of the Company for cash
proceeds of $10,000.

 

Subsequent
to the year ending August 31, 2016, and during September 2016, the
Company issued 221,500 shares of its common stock at $0.02 for
$4,430 in net proceeds to the Company. Post-split the 30 new
shareholders will have 35,440,000 shares of common stock of the
Company.

 

Subsequent
to the year ending August 31, 2016, on October 3, 2016 the founding
shareholder returned 9,750,000 restricted shares of common stock to
treasury and the shares were subsequently cancelled by the Company.
Post-split our founding shareholder will have 40,000,000 shares of
common stock of the Company.

 

Subsequent
to the year ending August 31, 2016, on October 3, 2016, the
directors of the Company approved a special resolution to undertake
a forward split of the common stock of the company on a basis of
160 new common shares for 1 old common share. The issued and
outstanding of common shares after the forward split is
75,440,000.

 

Industry
Analysis/Competition

 

Market/Competition
Analysis

 

Some of
the weakest links in computer security result from the combination
of computers utilizing operating systems such as Windows and OSI,
together with web browsers such as Safari ™ and Explorer
™, with a multitude of known and ever-emerging security
issues. Any messaging system running within a web browser can only
be as secure as the browser itself and can readily lend itself to
security breaches due to browser security shortcomings, rather than
security issues with the computer program itself. Therefore,
instead of being a web browser-based computer application, the MBA
will function as a low-level application that will not interact
with either computer operating systems or web browsers.

 

By writing
low-level code that will operate independently, below a computer's
operating system and outside of any web browser, there is little
chance that a breach of the operating system or browser security
will have any impact on the security of the MBA. For added security
we intend to block the functionality of some operating system "hot
keys" (such as "print screen" and "screen capture") to assist in
the containment of the received message. We will also recommend
other security precautions to our users in an effort to help them
identify and remove malware, key-logging technologies and other
types of spyware that could affect a MBA user's message
security.

 

Every
message and attachment sent via the MBA will be encrypted on the
user's desktop utilizing AES 256 bit encryption and will then be
uploaded to be stored on the messageBgone server, where it will
remain encrypted until downloaded and unencrypted by the recipient
MBA user. Additional security features will include no message
logging, no password logging and no Internet Protocol logging or
retention. Additionally, when a message is deleted from the
messageBgone server it is truly gone forever. No copies of the
message will ever be stored on either the sender's or the
recipient's computer.

 

The MBA
will allow a user to compose and send messages in the format of
e-mail, attaching a PDF if desired, and view messages and PDF
attachments only in the MBA. There will be no way to save a message
or an attachment - only the ability to view it. Once the message's
intended recipient downloads, unencrypts and views the message
and/or attachment, it will be automatically deleted from the
messageBgone server forever when the recipient closes their MBA. If
a message is sent to a user and is undelivered for a period of five
days (individual users may choose a shorter auto delete period), it
will be also be permanently deleted from the server. The
messageBgone server and the MBA will have no directory of users.
Therefore, a message author will need to know the MBA address of
the recipient and type it into the application on the creation of
every message. Once a message is opened in the MBA it will remain
on the user's screen for five minutes and will then permanently
auto-delete. Additionally, the application will close in 120
seconds if there is no user interaction.

 

The
Company will setup severs in various countries, depending on the
most favorable hosting and security issues. (For example, Germany
does not require severs to store a traffic logs of IP addresses and
visitors.) The website that will be designed to allow customers to
subscribe to and download the MBA service and will accept both
traditional (Credit Cards, PayPal) and alternative (Bitcoins, hyper
wallets) payment methods that will give customers additional levels
of security with the option of total anonymity. If an MBA customer
should choose to use an anonymous payment system such as Bitcoins,
this MBA user would be anonymous even to us. Should an MBA user
also choose to utilize their own one-time AES 256 bit encryption
key for every message, they would enjoy the greatest level of
security and anonymity available in the industry, as it could take
hundreds or even thousands of years to decrypt a single message if
it were ever to be intercepted.

Plan of
Operations

 

Over the
twelve- eighteen month period commencing upon the effective date of
this prospectus, we intend to develop our corporate website and the
messageBgone Application (MBA), in addition to launching sales and
marketing activities.

 

Within
90-120 days of this filing we intend to design the look and feel of
our website. We will use a third party design service, like 99
Designs, or a similar service to design our website.

 

Within 180
- 240 days of this filing, we will hire a third party development
firm to build our website and develop the MBA. We anticipate hiring
a firm located in Eastern Europe, India or China to undertake these
tasks. We expect the initial release of the MBA within 270 days of
this prospectus becoming effective. We will initially develop the
MBA for use on both the Windows and Mac platforms and will seek to
develop the MBA for use on OSI and Android platforms in the future.
Our anticipated expenditure on this effort is detailed in the table
on Page 20.

 

Within 12
months of this filing, we anticipate developing our marketing
materials, user guide and sales guide. We will also research
publications that cater to our target market and attempt to get
editorials in these publications to create additional product
awareness. Our marketing efforts will be primarily Internet-based
and may include some or all of the following:

 

 




 



·



Display
Advertising - Using web banners or banner advertisements placed on
third-party websites to drive traffic to our website and thereby
increase awareness for our proposed products.





 



 



 





 



·



Search
Engine Marketing - Promoting our website by increasing its
visibility in search engines through the use of paid placement,
contextual advertising, and paid inclusion, or through the use of
free search engine optimization techniques.





 



 



 





 



·



Search
Engine Optimization - Improving the visibility of our website in
search engines via "natural" or un-paid ("organic" or
"algorithmic") search results.





 



 



 





 



·



Social
Media Marketing – Seeking to increase and gain traffic and
attention to our website through creating and maintaining a
presence on a variety of social media sites.




 

 

Traditional
e-product marketing utilizing social media, non-spam e-mail, fax
blasts and press releases will also be utilized to increase product
awareness. We expect to complete this phase within 360 days of this
filing.

 

We may
attempt to raise additional money through private placements,
public offerings or long-term loans in order to expand and enhance
our proposed product offerings, enhance our presence in the
marketplace, enter into different facets of the marketplace,
increase our product sales and grow our business. We will also
continue to refine our proposed product and optimize our
Interned-based marketing efforts from the market feedback we expect
to receive. We do not, at this point in time, have cost or timing
estimates for these endeavors.

 

At
present, Arraya Wilaiphan, an officer and director, through his
investment in our common stock, has invested $10,000 in our
company. Mr. Wilaiphan is willing to make additional financial
commitments if required, but the total amount that he is willing to
invest has not yet been determined. At the present time, we have
not made any arrangements to raise additional cash other than
through this offering; however, we intend to raise additional
capital through private placements once we gain a quotation on the
Over-The-Counter Bulletin Board or the OTC Markets, for which there
is no assurance. If we need additional cash but are unable to raise
it, we will either suspend development and marketing operations
until we do raise the cash, or cease operations entirely. Other
than as described in this paragraph, we have no other financing
plans.

 

If we are
unable to complete any phase of our development or marketing
efforts because we do not have enough capital, we will cease our
development and or marketing operations until we raise sufficient
funds. Attempting to raise capital after failing in any phase of
our development plan could be difficult. As such, if we cannot
secure additional proceeds we will have to cease operations and
investors would lose their entire investment.

 

An officer
and director will be responsible for the initial phases of our plan
of operations. Once we are ready to begin development of our
website and the MBA, we plan to hire independent consultants to do
so.

Going
Concern

 

Our
auditor has indicated in their reports on our financial statements
for the fiscal years ended August 31, 2016 and August 31, 2015,
that conditions exist that raise substantial doubt about our
ability to continue as a going concern due to our recurring losses
from operations, deficit in equity, and the need to raise
additional capital to fund operations. A “going
concern” opinion could impair our ability to finance our
operations through the sale of debt or equity
securities.

 


Results of
Operations

 

Fiscal
Year Ended August 31, 2016 compared to the period from August 25,
2015 (date of inception) to August 31, 2015

 

We did not
earn any revenues from August 25, 2015 (inception) to August 31,
2016.

 

Expenses
for the year ended August 31, 2016 totaled $13,732 consisting
primarily of office and general expenses of $1,332 and professional
fees of $12,400 resulting in a net loss of $13,732. Expenses for
the period from August 25, 2015 (date of inception) to August 31,
2015 totaled $2,555 consisting primarily of office and general
expenses of $2,555, resulting in a net loss of $2,555. The decrease
in office and general expenses from fiscal 2015 to fiscal 2016 was
primarily due to the decrease in expenses relating to filing fees.
The increase in professional fees from fiscal 2015 to fiscal 2016
was due to the increase in accounting and legal fees activities
during the period.

 


Capital
Resources and Liquidity

 

Our
auditor’s report on our August 31, 2016 financial statements
expresses an opinion that substantial doubt exists as to whether we
can continue as an ongoing business. Since our director maybe
unwilling or unable to loan or advance us additional capital, we
believe that if we do not raise additional capital over the next 12
months, we may be required to suspend or cease the implementation
of our business plans. See “August 31, 2016 Audited Financial
Statements – Auditors Report.”

 

As of
August 31, 2016, we had $1,308 of cash compared to $5,945 of cash
as of August 31, 2015. We anticipate that our current cash and cash
equivalents and cash generated from financing activities will be
insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements for the next 12
months. To date the Company has incurred operating losses since
inception of $16,287. As at August 31, 2016, the Company has a
working capital deficit of $6,287.

 

The
Company requires additional funding to meet its ongoing obligations
and to fund anticipated operating losses. Our auditor has expressed
substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.
The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is
dependent on raising capital to fund its initial business plan and
ultimately to attain profitable operations. These financial
statements do not include any adjustments relating to the
recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts, or
amounts and classification of liabilities that might result from
this uncertainty.

 

We expect
to incur marketing and professional and administrative expenses as
well expenses associated with maintaining our filings with the
Commission. We will require additional funds during this time and
will seek to raise the necessary additional capital. If we are
unable to obtain additional financing, we may be required to reduce
the scope of our business development activities, which could harm
our business plans, financial condition and operating results.
Additional funding may not be available on favorable terms, if at
all. The Company intends to continue to fund its business by way of
equity or debt financing and advances from related parties. Any
inability to raise capital as needed would have a material adverse
effect on our business, financial condition and results of
operations.

 

If we
cannot raise additional funds, we will have to cease business
operations. As a result, investors in the Company’s common
stock would lose all of their investment.

Off
Balance Sheet Arrangements

 

There are
no off-balance sheet arrangements currently contemplated by
management or in place that are reasonably likely to have a current
or future effect on the business, financial condition, changes in
financial condition, revenue or expenses, result of operations,
liquidity, capital expenditures and/or capital
resources.

 

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements

 

The
Company has implemented all new accounting pronouncements that are
in effect and that may impact its financial statements and does not
believe that there are any other new accounting pronouncements that
have been issued that might have a material impact on its financial
position or results of operations.

ITEM 9A.
CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

 

The
management of the Company is responsible for establishing and
maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as
required by Sarbanes-Oxley (SOX) Section 404 A. The Company’s
internal control over financial reporting is a process designed
under the supervision of the Company’s Chief Executive
Officer and Chief Financial Officer to provide reasonable assurance
regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the
preparation of the Company’s financial statements for
external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted
accounting principles.

Management
assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control
over financial reporting based on the criteria for effective
internal control over financial reporting established in SEC
guidance on conducting such assessments as of the end of the period
covered by this report. Management conducted the assessment based
on certain criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated
Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this assessment,
management concluded that our internal controls over financial
reporting were not effective as of August 31, 2016.

 

The
matters involving internal controls and procedures that the
Company’s management considered to be material weaknesses
under the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board were: (1) lack of a functioning audit committee and lack of a
majority of outside directors on the Company's board of directors,
resulting in ineffective oversight in the establishment and
monitoring of required internal controls and procedures; (2)
inadequate segregation of duties consistent with control
objectives; (3) insufficient written policies and procedures for
accounting and financial reporting with respect to the requirements
and application of US GAAP and SEC disclosure re

	PROSPECTUS SUMMARY


	 


	As used in this prospectus, the terms "we," "us," "our," "the Company" or "our Company," refer to


	messageBgone, Inc. unless otherwise indicated.




	 






	SUMMARY INFORMATION, RISK FACTORS AND RATIO OF EARNINGS TO FIXED CHARGES








	 



	This summary provides an overview of selected information contained elsewhere in this prospectus. It does not contain all the information you should consider before making a decision to purchase the shares we are offering. You should very carefully and thoroughly read the more detailed information in this prospectus and review our financial statements contained herein.






	 





	A Cautionary Note on Forward-Looking Statements



	 



	This prospectus contains forward-looking statements, which relate to future events or our future financial performance. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terminology such as "may," "should," "expects," "plans," "anticipates," "believes," "estimates," "predicts," "potential," or "continue" or the negative of these terms or other comparable terminology. These statements are only predictions and involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors, including the risks in the section entitled "Risk Factors," that may cause our actual results, levels of activity, performance, or achievements to be materially different from any future results, levels of activity, performance, or achievements expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements.



	 



	While these forward-looking statements, and any assumptions upon which they are based, are made in good faith and reflect our current judgment regarding the direction of our business, actual results will almost always vary, sometimes materially, from any estimates, predictions, projections, assumptions or other future performance suggested herein. Except as required by applicable law, including the securities laws of the United States, we do not intend to update any of the forward-looking statements to conform these statements to actual results.



	 



	Being an Emerging Growth Company



	 



	messageBgone, Inc. is a shell company as defined in Rule 405, because it is a company with nominal operations and it has assets consisting solely of cash and cash equivalents. We have no plans or intention to be acquired or to merge with an operating company. Additionally, there are no plans to enter into a change of control or similar transaction or to change the management of the Company.



	 



	The Company is an emerging growth company and the Company intends to take advantage of the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards pursuant to section 107(B) of the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012.



	 



	An issuer remains an emerging growth company until the earliest of:



	 



	The last day of the fiscal year during which it had total annual gross revenues of $1 billion or more;



	 



	The last day of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of its initial public offering date;



	 



	The date on which, during the previous three-year period, issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt; or



	 



	The date on which, during the previous three-year period, issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt; or



	 



	The date on which, during the previous three-year period, issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt; or



	 



	The date on which it is deemed to be a "large accelerated filer", as defined in section 240.12b–2 of Title 17, Code of Federal Regulations, or any successor for that matter.

	Emerging Growth Company Exemptions



	 



	An emerging growth company could be capable of taking advantage of several exemptions, such as:

	Say-On-Pay

	. Section 14A(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 has been amended to exempt emerging growth companies from the "say-on-pay", "say-on-pay frequency" and "say-on-golden parachute" requirements that were enacted as part of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. After cessation of emerging growth company status, if an issuer was an emerging growth company for less than two years after its initial public offering date, it must hold a "say-on-pay" vote no later than the end of the three-year period beginning on the date it is no longer an emerging growth company. Any other company that has ceased to be an emerging growth company must hold a say-on-pay vote no later than the end of the one-year period beginning on the date it is no longer an emerging growth company. In addition, following cessation of emerging growth company status, a company will become subject to the "say-on-pay-frequency" and "say-on-golden parachute" provisions of Rule 14a-21 promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.



	 



	The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has not yet finalized the regulations implementing the pay-versus-performance requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act.



	 




	Pay-versus-Performance



	. Section 14(i) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 has been amended to exempt emerging growth companies from the pay versus-performance requirements that were enacted as part of the Dodd-Frank Act.



	 




	CEO Pay Ratio Disclosure



	. Section 953(b)(1) of the Dodd-Frank Act has been amended to exempt emerging growth companies from the requirement to compare CEO compensation to the median of the annual total compensation of all employees of the issuer other than the CEO. The Securities and Exchange Commission has not yet finalized the regulations implementing the pay ratio disclosure requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act.



	 




	Compensation Disclosures



	. Emerging growth companies may comply with the less burdensome executive compensation disclosure requirements applicable to any issuer with a market value of less than $75 million of outstanding voting and nonvoting common equity held by non-affiliates. Currently these provisions are set forth in Item 402(l) through (r) of Regulation S-K as applicable to smaller reporting companies.



	 




	Financial Statement Requirements



	. Section 7 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, has been revised to require that two years, rather than three years, of audited financial statements be included in any registration statement filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission by an emerging growth company. Similarly, an emerging growth company need only present its Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for each period for which financial statements are presented rather than the periods required by Item 303 of Regulation S-K. Furthermore, an emerging growth company need not present selected financial data for any period prior to the earliest audited period presented in connection with its initial public offering. In addition, an emerging growth company need not comply with any new or revised financial accounting standard until such date that a company that is not an "issuer," as defined in Section 2 of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002. (Generally, a non-public company is required to comply with such new or revised accounting standards. Similar changes were also made to Section 13(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.)



	 




	Internal Control over Financial Reporting



	. Section 404(b) of Sarbanes-Oxley has been amended to exempt emerging growth companies from the requirement to obtain an attestation report on internal control over financial reporting from the issuer's registered public accounting firm. Currently, this requirement is only applicable to "accelerated filers" and "large accelerated filers " as defined in Rule 12b-2 promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.



	 




	 




	7













	 




	 



	The exemptions listed above could be available to the Company and the Company intends to take advantage of the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards pursuant to section 107(B) of the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012.



	 



	The Company intends to file, in a period up to 90 days after the termination of this offering, a Form 8A making the Company a mandatory reporting issuer under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.



	 



	The Company intends to offer its stock for sale in all jurisdictions that its prospectus is valid in and is not limited to any region or country. However, the Company intends to primarily sell shares in Thailand and the United States.



	 



	Our Company



	 



	messageBgone, Inc.


	was incorporated in the State of Nevada as a for-profit Company on August 25, 2015, and established a fiscal year-end of August 31st. We are a development-stage company that intends to develop and


	provide a subscription-based communications service that will give customers the ability to send and receive secure point-to-point e-mail messages and attachments in a closed system.


	The Company has not yet implemented its business model and to date has generated no revenues. Neither the Company's management nor any affiliates of the Company or its management have previously been involved in the management or ownership of a development-stage company.



	 



	Since its incorporation, messageBgone, Inc. has not made any significant purchase or sale of assets, nor has it been involved in any mergers, acquisitions or consolidations, nor has the Company any plans, nor does any of its stockholders have any plans, to merge into an operating company, to enter into a change of control or similar transaction or to change our management. Neither management nor the Company's shareholders have plans or intentions to be acquired. messageBgone, Inc. is not a "blank check" registrant as that term is defined in Rule 419(a)(2) of Regulation C of the Securities Act of 1933, since it has a specific business plan or purpose.

	As shown in the financial statements accompanying this prospectus, we have had no revenues to date and have incurred only losses since our inception. We have had no operations and have been issued a "going concern" opinion from our auditors, based upon our reliance upon the sale of our common stock as the sole source of funds for our future operations.




	 





	RISK FACTORS



	 



	An investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the risks described below and the other information contained in this prospectus before investing in our common stock.


	You are urged to carefully review and consider the section entitled "Risk Factors" beginning on Page


	10


	 

	of this prospectus.


	If any of the following risks occur, our business, operating results and financial condition could be seriously harmed. Currently, shares of our common stock are not publicly traded. In the event that shares of our common stock become publicly traded, the trading price of our common stock could decline due to any of these risks, resulting in the loss of all or part of your investment. In the event our common stock fails to become publicly traded, you may also lose all or part of your investment.



	 



	Risks Related to The Offering



	 




	AS THERE IS NO MINIMUM FOR OUR OFFERING, IF ONLY A FEW PERSONS PURCHASE SHARES, THEY WILL LOSE THEIR INVESTMENT WITHOUT THE COMPANY BEING ABLE TO MAKE A SIGNIFICANT ATTEMPT TO IMPLEMENT ITS BUSINESS PLAN.






	 



	Since there is no minimum amount of shares that must be sold directly by the company under this offering, if a limited number of shares are sold, we may not have enough capital to fully implement our proposed plan of operations. As such, we may not be able to meet the objectives we state in this prospectus, or eliminate the "going concern" modification in the reports of our auditors as to uncertainty with respect to our ability to continue as a going concern. If we fail to raise sufficient capital, we would expect to have insufficient funds for our ongoing operating expenses. Any significant lack of funds will curtail the development and growth of our business, and may cause our business to fail. If our business fails, investors will lose their entire investment.



	 




	WE ARE A DEVELOPMENT-STAGE COMPANY WITH A LIMITED OPERATING HISTORY AND MAY NEVER BE ABLE TO CARRY OUT OUR PROPOSED PLAN OF OPERATIONS OR ACHIEVE ANY SIGNIFICANT REVENUE OR PROFITABILITY.






	 



	We are subject to all of the risks inherent in the establishment of a new business enterprise, and we have not generated any revenues to date. Any profitability in the future from our business will be dependent upon the successful development and implementation of our proposed communications product and its successful marketing and sale, which are subject to numerous risk factors as set forth herein. Accordingly, we may not be able to successfully carry out our plan of operations and investors may lose their entire investment.



	 




	WE ARE SELLING THIS OFFERING WITHOUT AN UNDERWRITER AND MAY BE UNABLE TO SELL ANY SHARES.




	 



	This offering is self-underwritten, that is, we are not going to engage the services of an underwriter to sell the shares. We intend to sell our shares through Arraya Wilaiphan, our sole officer and director, who will receive no commissions or other remuneration from any sales made. Mr. Wilaiphan will offer the shares to friends, family members, and business associates; however, there is no guarantee that he will be able to sell any of the shares. Unless Mr. Wilaiphan is successful in selling all of the shares and we receive the maximum amount of proceeds from this offering, we may have to seek alternative financing to implement our plan of operations.



	 




	 




	10













	 




	 




	WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO FURTHER IMPLEMENT OUR BUSINESS STRATEGY UNLESS SUFFICIENT FUNDS ARE RAISED IN THIS OFFERING.






	 



	We may not realize sufficient proceeds from this offering to further business development, or to provide adequate cash flow for our planned business activities. As of August 31, 2015 we had $5,945 cash on hand and have sustained a net loss of $2,555. We have not generated any revenue from our operations to date. At this rate, we expect that we will not be able to continue operations without obtaining additional funding or beginning to generate revenue. Accordingly, we anticipate that additional funding will be needed for general administrative expenses, the design and development of our proposed communications offering, business development and marketing costs.



	 



	We do not currently have any arrangements for financing and our ability to obtain additional financing will be subject to a number of factors, including general market conditions, investor acceptance of our plan of operations and initial results from our business operations. There is no assurance that any additional financing will be available or, if available, on terms that will be acceptable to us. Failure to secure additional financing will cause us to go out of business. If this happens, you could lose all or part of your investment.



	 



	If our resources are insufficient to satisfy our cash requirements, we may seek to sell additional equity or debt securities or obtain a credit facility. The sale of additional equity securities could result in additional dilution to our stockholders. The incurrence of indebtedness would result in increased debt service obligations and could result in operating and financing covenants that would restrict our operations. We cannot assure you that financing will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us, if at all.



	 




	BECAUSE OUR SOLE OFFICER AND DIRECTOR CURRENTLY OWNS ALL OF OUR OUTSTANDING COMMON STOCK, INVESTORS MAY FIND THAT DECISIONS INFLUENCED BY HIM ARE INCONSISTENT WITH THE BEST INTERESTS OF OTHER STOCKHOLDERS.






	 



	Arraya Wilaiphan, our


	sole officer and director, currently owns all of the outstanding shares of our common stock, and, upon completion of this offering, will likely own a large percentage of our outstanding common stock. Accordingly, he may have a significant influence in determining the outcome of all corporate transactions or other matters, including mergers, consolidations and the sale of all or substantially all of our assets, and also the power to prevent or cause a change in control of our company. Factors that could cause his interests to differ from the interests of other stockholders include the impact of corporate


	transactions on the timing of business operations and his ability to continue to manage the business given the amount of time he is able to devote to our company.


	While we have no current plans with regard to any merger, consolidation or sale of substantially all of our assets, the interests of our sole officer and director may still differ from the interests of other stockholders.





	 




	THERE IS SUBSTANTIAL DOUBT ABOUT OUR ABILITY TO CONTINUE AS A GOING CONCERN.






	 



	As of August 31, 2015, the company has not generated revenue, has no certainty of earning revenue in the future, and has a working capital deficit and a net loss of $2,555 since inception. These factors, among others, raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Our ability to generate future revenue will depend on a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control. These factors include general economic conditions, market acceptance of our proposed product and competitive efforts. Due to these factors, we cannot anticipate with any degree of certainty what our revenue will be in future periods. As such, our independent certified public accountants have expressed substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. This opinion could materially limit our ability to raise additional funds by issuing new debt or equity securities or otherwise. You should carefully consider our independent certified public accountants' comments when determining if an investment in the company is suitable.

	WE ARE AN "EMERGING-GROWTH COMPANY" UNDER THE JOBS ACT, AND WE CANNOT BE CERTAIN IF THE REDUCED DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS APPLICABLE TO EMERGING GROWTH COMPANIES WILL MAKE OUR COMMON STOCK LESS ATTRACTIVE TO INVESTORS.




	 



	We are an "emerging growth company," as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act, and we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not "emerging growth companies" including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. We cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive because we may rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile.





	 



	In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an "emerging growth company" can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an "emerging growth company" can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We are choosing to take advantage of the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards. As a result, our financial statements may not be comparable to those of companies that comply with public company effective dates.





	 



	We will remain an "emerging growth company" for up to five years, although we will lose that status sooner if our revenues exceed $1 billion, if we issue more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt in a three-year period, or if the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million.



	 




	WE MAY BE UNABLE TO COMPLY WITH DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES NECESSARY TO MAKE REQUIRED PUBLIC FILINGS.






	 



	We currently have no full-time employees other than our sole officer and director, although we intend to add personnel following this offering. Given our limited resources, we may be unable to maintain effective controls to insure that we are able to make all required public filings in a timely manner. If we are successful in having our common stock listed on a stock exchange or quotation service, and if we do not make all public filings in a timely manner, our shares of common stock may be delisted and we could also be subject to regulatory action and/or lawsuits by stockholders.



	 




	AS A SECTION 15(D) FILER, WE WILL NOT BE A FULLY REPORTING COMPANY.






	 



	We will not be subject to the proxy rules under Section 14 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the prohibition of short-swing profits under Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the third-party tender offer rules, or the beneficial ownership reporting requirements of Sections 13(d) and (g) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. If we have less than three hundred shareholders following the fiscal year in which our registration statement becomes effective, our periodic reporting obligations under Section 13(a) will be automatically suspended under Section 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.



	 



	Risks Related to Our Business



	 




	KEY MANAGEMENT PERSONNEL MAY LEAVE THE COMPANY, WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE ABILITY OF THE COMPANY TO CONTINUE OPERATIONS.




	 



	We are entirely dependent on the efforts of Araya Wilaiphan, our sole officer and director, because of the time and effort that he devotes to messageBgone, Inc. Mr. Wilaiphan is in charge of overseeing all business development strategies, supervising any/all future personnel, including any consultants or contractors that we will engage to assist in developing our proposed communications product, and the establishment of our future sales and marketing efforts. The loss of Mr. Wilaiphan, or other key personnel in the future, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We do not maintain "key person" life insurance on our officers, directors or key employees. Our success will depend on the performance of Mr. Wilaiphan and our ability to attract and motivate other key personnel.

	SHAREHOLDERS MAY HAVE DIFFICULTIES ENFORCING THEIR LEGAL RIGHTS UNDER UNITED STATES SECURITIES LAWS BECAUSE OUR SOLE OFFICER AND DIRECTOR RESIDES OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES.




	 



	While we are a Nevada corporation, our sole officer and director resides in the province of Chachoengsao in Thailand.


	His ability to travel to the United States is dependent on a number of factors, some of which may be outside of his control. These include: availability; financial, geographical and personal matters; and, passport and visa regulations. Although in person jurisdiction may be difficult to obtain, our sole officer and director remains subject to his obligations as an officer and director of a Nevada corporation and the federal securities laws applicable to officers and directors of United States corporations. However, no assurances can be made that our sole officer and director will be able to attend any event in the United States in a timely manner or at all. Therefore, an investor may not be able to effect service of process on our sole officer and director in the United States, or enforce a judgment against our sole officer and director. Additionally, courts in the Kingdom of Thailand may not recognize or enforce United States judgments.




	 






	PRESENTLY, THE COMPANY'S SOLE OFFICER AND DIRECTOR HAS OTHER OUTSIDE BUSINESS INTERESTS AND, AS SUCH, HE IS NOT DEVOTING ALL OF HIS TIME TO THE COMPANY.






	 



	Our sole officer and director, Arraya Wilaiphan, has other outside business activities, but he is committed to devote approximately 15 hours per week to our operations. Our operations may be sporadic and occur at times when Mr. Wilaiphan is unavailable, which may lead to periodic interruption in the implementation of our business plan. Such delays could have a significant negative effect on the success of our business.





	 




	OUR SOLE OFFICER AND DIRECTOR HAS NO DIRECT EXPERIENCE IN COMMUNICATIONS, OR SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT.




	 



	Arraya Wilaiphan


	, our sole officer and director, has no direct experience in communications or software development. As a result, he may not be fully aware of many of the specific requirements relating to these areas of business. Mr. Wilaiphan's decisions and choices may not take into account the business, marketing or sales strategies that are commonly deployed in the industry. Consequently our operations, earnings and ultimate financial success could suffer irreparable harm due to his lack of experience in these areas. As a result, we may have to suspend or cease operations, which will result in the loss of your investment.




	 






	COMPENSATION MAY BE PAID TO OUR OFFICERS, DIRECTORS AND EMPLOYEES REGARDLESS OF OUR PROFITABILITY. SUCH PAYMENTS MAY NEGATIVELY AFFECT OUR CASH FLOW AND OUR ABILITY TO FINANCE OUR BUSINESS PLAN, WHICH WOULD CAUSE OUR BUSINESS TO FAIL.




	 



	Arraya Wilaiphan


	, our sole officer and director, is not presently receiving compensation. However, he and any future employees of our company may be entitled to receive compensation, payments and reimbursements regardless of whether we operate at a profit or a loss. Any compensation received by Mr. Wilaiphan, or the board of directors, which currently consists only of Mr. Wilaiphan, or any other personal that Mr. Wilaiphan in his capacity as sole officer and director, as applicable, will determine from time to time. We expect to reimburse our sole officer and director, and any future personnel, for any direct out-of-pocket expenses they incur on behalf of us.



	 



	WE MAY BE UNABLE TO ACQUIRE OR RETAIN SUBSCRIBERS.



	 


	We must acquire customers to subscribe to our proposed communications product in order to generate revenue and achieve profitability. If customers do not perceive our proposed communications product to be of high value and quality or if we fail to introduce a product that is customized to the needs and interests of our customers, we may not be able to acquire or retain customers.


	 


	We believe that many of our subscribers will originate from word-of-mouth and non-paid referrals from other subscribers, and therefore we must ensure that those subscribers remain satisfied and loyal to our company in order to continue receiving those referrals. Once we establish a subscriber base, if our efforts to satisfy our established subscribers are not successful, we may not be able to acquire new subscribers in sufficient numbers to continue to grow our business or we may be required to incur significantly higher marketing expenses in order to acquire new customers. A decline in the number of subscribers or in subscriber satisfaction would have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.


	 




	 




	13













	 




	 


	We currently have no subscribers to our proposed communications product. We have not identified any subscribers and we cannot guarantee we ever will have any subscribers. Even if we obtain subscribers, there is no guarantee that we will generate a profit. If we cannot generate a profit, we will have to suspend or cease operations. You are likely to lose your entire investment if we cannot sell our proposed communications product at a price and in a quantity that generates a profit.


	 



	THERE ARE NO SUBSTANTIAL BARRIERS TO ENTRY INTO THE MARKETPLACE FOR THE PRODUCT WE INTEND TO DEVELOP AND SELL.



	 


	Since our proposed communications product has yet to be developed, other persons may develop the same, or a substantially similar product, and bring it to market before we do. Alternatively, other persons may attempt to copy aspects of our business, including our website design, product or marketing materials. Any encroachment upon our corporate information, including the unauthorized use of our brand name, the use of a similar name by a competing company or a lawsuit initiated against us for infringement upon another company's proprietary information or improper use of their trademark, may affect our ability to create brand name recognition, cause customer confusion and/or have a detrimental effect on our business. Litigation or proceedings before United States or international trademark offices may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights, to protect our trade secrets and domain name and/or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others. Any such infringement, litigation or adverse proceeding could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could seriously harm our business operations and/or the results of operations.


	 



	WE PLAN TO CONDUCT INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS TRANSACTIONS AND WILL BE EXPOSED TO LOCAL BUSINESS RISKS IN DIFFERENT COUNTRIES, WHICH COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.



	 


	We intend to market and sell our proposed communications product internationally, and we expect to have customers located in many countries. Our international operations will be subject to the risks inherent in doing business in foreign countries, including, but not necessarily limited to:


	 







	 





	·





	New and different legal and regulatory requirements in local jurisdictions;






	 




	 




	 






	 





	·





	Potentially adverse tax consequences, including the imposition or increase of taxes on transactions or withholding and other taxes on remittances and other payments;






	 




	 




	 






	 





	·





	Risk of nationalization of private enterprises by foreign governments;






	 




	 




	 






	 





	·





	Legal restrictions on doing business in or with certain nations, certain parties and/or certain products; and,






	 




	 




	 






	 





	·





	Local economic, political and social conditions, including the possibility of hyperinflationary conditions and political instability.






	 






	We may not be successful in developing and implementing policies and strategies to address the foregoing factors in a timely and effective manner in the locations where we intend to do business. Consequently, the occurrence of one or more of the foregoing factors could have a material adverse effect on our operations and upon our financial condition and results of operations.


	 


	Since our proposed communications product will be available for subscription over the Internet in foreign countries and we will have customers residing in foreign countries, foreign jurisdictions may require us to qualify to do business in their countries. We may be required to comply with certain laws and regulations of each country in which we conduct business, including laws and regulations currently in place or which may be enacted related to Internet sales and communications services available to the residents of each country from online sites located elsewhere.

	FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH EXISTING U.S. AND NON-U.S. PRIVACY LAWS AND REGULATIONS, OR THE ENACTMENT OF NEW PRIVACY LAWS OR REGULATIONS, COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS.




	 



	A variety of U.S. and non-U.S. laws and regulations govern the collection, use, retention, sharing and security of consumer data. Existing privacy-related laws and regulations are evolving and are subject to potentially differing interpretations. In addition, U.S. and non-U.S. legislative and regulatory bodies may expand current laws or enact new laws regarding privacy matters. We intend to post privacy policies and practices concerning the collection, use and disclosure of subscriber data on our website. Several U.S. states have adopted legislation that requires businesses to implement and maintain reasonable security procedures and practices to protect sensitive personal information and to provide notice to consumers in the event of a security breach. Any failure, or perceived failure, by us to comply with our posted privacy policies or with any data-related consent orders, U.S. Federal Trade Commission requirements or orders or other U.S. or non-U.S. privacy or consumer protection-related laws, regulations or industry self-regulatory principles could result in claims, proceedings or actions against us by governmental entities or others, or other liabilities, which could adversely affect our business. In addition, a failure or perceived failure to comply with industry standards or with our own privacy policies and practices could result in a loss of subscribers and adversely affect our business.



	 



	THE FAILURE OF THIRD-PARTY SYSTEMS OR THIRD-PARTY SERVICE AND SOFTWARE PROVIDERS UPON WHICH WE WILL RELY COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS.



	 


	We will rely on certain third-party computer systems or third-party service and software providers, including data centers, technology platforms, back-office systems, Internet service providers and communication facilities. Any interruption in these third-party services, or deterioration in their performance or quality, could adversely affect our business. If our arrangement with any third-party is terminated, we may not be able to find alternative systems or service providers on a timely basis or on commercially reasonable terms. This could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.


	 


	We plan to host our website and serve all of our potential subscribers from third-party Internet servers, which will be located at various data center facilities. Problems faced by these data center locations or with the telecommunications network providers with whom they may contract, could adversely affect the experience of our subscribers. If these data centers are unable to keep up with our growing needs for capacity or close without adequate notice, this could have an adverse effect on our business. Any changes in third-party service levels at these data centers or any errors, defects, disruptions, or other performance problems with these services could harm our reputation and adversely affect the performance of our proposed communications product. Interruptions in these services might reduce our sales revenues, subject us to potential liability and thereby adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.


	 


	We cannot guarantee that our website will operate or our proposed communications product will function without interruption or error. We are bound only by a best efforts obligation as regards the operation and continuity of service. Although we are not liable for the fraudulent access to data and/or accidental transmission through viruses or other harmful conduct in connection with the use of our website or proposed product, disruption of our communications service would adversely affect our business, financial conditions, results of operations and cash flows.


	 



	THERE IS A RISK THAT WE MAY BE UNABLE TO CONTINUE TO PROVIDE OUR PROPOSED COMMUNICATIONS PRODUCT OR CONTINUE OPERATIONS IF WE EXPERIENCE UNINSURED LOSSES OR AN ACT OF GOD.



	 



	We may, but are not required to, obtain comprehensive liability and other business insurance of the types customarily maintained by businesses similar to our own. There are certain types of extraordinary occurrences, however, which may be either uninsurable or not economically insurable. For example, in the event of a major earthquake, our computer systems could be rendered inoperable for protracted periods of time, which would impair our ability to maintain our website, market and sell our proposed communications product and collect revenues, thus adversely affecting our financial condition. In the event of a major civil disturbance, our operations could also be adversely affected. If such an uninsured loss should occur, we could lose significant revenues and financial opportunities in amounts that would not be partially or fully compensated by insurance proceeds.

	WE CANNOT ASSURE YOU THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO EFFECTIVELY MANGE THE GROWTH OF OUR COMPANY.






	 



	We anticipate experiencing rapid growth in demand for our proposed communications product. We expect the number of our consultants, service providers, employees, and customers to increase over time once we launch our sales and marketing campaign, and we expect our growth to continue for the foreseeable future. The growth and expansion of our business and product offerings could place significant demands on our management and our operational and financial resources. We will need to manage multiple relationships with various consultants, customers, website developers and other third parties. To effectively manage the growth of our company, we will need to continually implement operational plans and strategies, improve and expand our infrastructure of people and information systems, and train and manage our future employee and third-party service provider base. Our inability to effectively manage the growth of our company would have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.



	 




	WE WILL BE SUBJECT TO PAYMENTS-RELATED RISKS.






	 



	We plan to accept payment for subscriptions to our proposed communications product using a variety of methods, including credit cards and debit cards. As we offer new payment options to consumers, we may be subject to additional regulations, compliance requirements and fraud.


	Not being a financial institution, we cannot belong to or directly access credit card associations, such as American Express, VISA, MasterCard, etc. As a result, we will have to rely on banks or payment processors to process transactions for us. I


	f these companies become unwilling or unable to provide these services to us, our business and subscriber services will likely suffer substantial disruption. For certain payment methods, including credit and debit cards, we will be required to pay interchange and other fees, which may increase over time, raise our operating costs and lower our profitability. We will also be subject to payment card association operating rules, certification requirements and rules governing electronic funds transfers, which could change or be reinterpreted to make it difficult or impossible for us to comply. If we fail to comply with these rules or requirements, we may be subject to fines and higher transaction fees and lose our ability to accept credit and debit card payments from consumers or facilitate other types of online payments, and our business and operating results could be adversely affected.



	 



	Risks Related to Our Common Stock



	 




	INVESTING IN THE COMMON STOCK OF OUR COMPANY IS A HIGHLY SPECULATIVE INVESTMENT AND COULD RESULT IN THE LOSS OF YOUR ENTIRE INVESTMENT.




	 



	A purchase of the shares offered in this prospectus is highly speculative and involves significant risks. Any person who cannot afford the loss of his or her entire investment should not purchase the offered shares. Our business objectives are also speculative and we may be unable to satisfy those objectives. The shareholders of our company may be unable to realize a substantial return on their purchase of the offered shares, or any return whatsoever, and may lose their entire investment in our company. For this reason, each prospective purchaser of the offered shares should read this prospectus and all of its exhibits carefully and consult with their attorney, business advisor and/or investment advisor.



	 




	IN THE EVENT THAT OUR SHARES ARE PUBLICLY TRADED, OUR STOCK PRICE MAY BE VOLATILE.






	 



	In the event that our shares are publicly traded, the market price of our common stock is likely to be highly volatile and could fluctuate widely in price in response to various potential factors, many of which will be beyond the company's control, including the following: 



	 







	 





	·





	Changes in the reliability or availability of our proposed product by us or our potential competitors;






	 




	 




	 






	 





	·





	Additions or departures of key personnel;






	 




	 




	 






	 





	·





	The company's ability to execute its business plan;






	 




	 




	 






	 





	·





	Operating results that fall below expectations;






	 




	 




	 






	 





	·





	Industry developments;






	 




	 




	16













	 




	 
















	In addition, the securities markets have from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that are unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. These market fluctuations may also materially and adversely affect the market price of the company's common stock.



	 




	AS A PUBLIC COMPANY, WE WILL INCUR SUBSTANTIAL EXPENSES.






	 


	Upon declared effectiveness of this registration statement by the Securities and Exchange Commission, we will become subject to the information and reporting requirements of the U.S. securities laws. The U.S. securities laws require, among other things, review, audit, and public reporting of our financial results, business activities, and other matters. Recent Securities and Exchange Commission regulation, including regulation enacted as a result of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 has also substantially increased the accounting, legal, and other costs related to becoming and remaining a Securities and Exchange Commission reporting company. If we do not have current information about our company available to market makers, they will not be able to trade our stock. The public company costs of preparing and filing annual and quarterly reports, and other information with the Securities and Exchange Commission and furnishing audited reports to stockholders, will cause our expenses to be higher than they would be if we were privately-held. These increased costs may be material and may include the hiring of additional employees and/or the retention of additional advisors and professionals. As a result, we may not have sufficient funds to grow our operations. Additionally, our failure to comply with the U.S. securities laws could result in private or governmental legal action against the company and/or our officers and directors, which could have a detrimental effect on our business and finances, the value of our common stock, and the ability of stockholders to resell their stock.


	 



	WE HAVE NOT YET ADOPTED CERTAIN CORPORATE GOVERNANCE MEASURES.



	 


	The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as well as rule changes proposed and enacted by the Securities and Exchange Commission, the New York and American Stock Exchanges and the NASDAQ Stock Market, as a result of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, requires the implementation of various measures relating to corporate governance. These measures are designed to enhance the integrity of corporate management and the securities markets and apply to securities that are listed on those exchanges or the NASDAQ Stock Market. Because we are not presently required to comply with many of these corporate governance provisions and because we chose to avoid incurring the substantial additional costs associated with such compliance any sooner than necessary, we have not yet adopted these measures.


	 


	Because our sole director is non-independent, we do not currently have independent audit or compensation committees. As a result, our sole director has the ability, among other things, to determine his own level of compensation. Until we comply with such corporate governance measures, regardless of whether such compliance is required, the absence of such standards of corporate governance may leave our stockholders without protections against interested director transactions, conflicts of interest and similar matters and investors may be reluctant to provide us with funds necessary to expand our operations.


	 




	IN THE EVENT THAT OUR SHARES ARE PUBLICLY TRADED, THEY MAY TRADE UNDER $5.00 PER SHARE AND THUS WILL BE A "PENNY STOCK."




	 



	In the event that our shares are publicly traded, and our stock trades below $5.00 per share, our stock would be known as a "penny stock," which is subject to various regulations involving disclosures to be given prior to the purchase of any penny stock. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has adopted regulations which generally define a "penny stock" to be any equity security that has a market price of less than $5.00 per share, subject to certain exceptions. Depending on market fluctuations, our common stock could be considered to be a "penny stock." A penny stock is subject to rules that impose additional sales practice requirements on broker/dealers who sell these securities to persons other than established customers and accredited investors. For transactions covered by these rules, the broker/dealer must make a special suitability determination for the purchase of these securities. In addition, he must receive the purchaser's written consent to the transaction prior to the purchase. He must also provide certain written disclosures to the purchaser. Consequently, the "penny stock" rules may restrict the ability of broker/dealers to sell our securities, and may negatively affect the ability of holders of shares of our common stock to resell them. These disclosures require acknowledgement that the investor understands the risks associated with buying penny stocks and can absorb the loss of the entire investment. Penny stocks are low priced securities that do not have a very high trading volume. Consequently, the price of the stock is often volatile and an investor may not be able to buy or sell the stock when desired.



	 




	 




	17













	 




	 




	IN THE EVENT THAT OUR SHARES ARE PUBLICLY TRADED, FINRA RULES MAY LIMIT A STOCKHOLDER'S ABILITY TO BUY AND SELL OUR STOCK.






	 



	The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) has adopted rules that relate to the application of the Securities and Exchange Commission's "penny stock" rules and require that a broker/dealer have reasonable grounds for believing that the investment is suitable for that customer, prior to recommending the investment. Prior to recommending speculative, low priced securities to their non-institutional customers, broker/dealers must make reasonable efforts to obtain information about the customer's financial status, tax status, investment objectives and other information. Under interpretations of these rules, FINRA believes that there is a high probability that speculative, low priced securities will not be suitable for at least some customers. In the event that our shares are publicly traded and are considered to be a "penny stock," these FINRA requirements will make it more difficult for broker/dealers to recommend that their customers buy our common stock, which may have the effect of reducing the level of trading activity and liquidity of our common stock. Further, many brokers charge higher transactional fees for penny stock transactions. As a result, fewer broker/dealers may be willing to make a market in our common stock, reducing a shareholder's ability to resell shares of our common stock.



	 




	IF WE ARE DISSOLVED, IT IS UNLIKELY THAT THERE WILL BE SUFFICIENT ASSETS REMAINING TO DISTRIBUTE TO SHAREHOLDERS.




	 



	In the event of our dissolution, any proceeds realized from the liquidation of our assets will be distributed to shareholders only after all the claims of our creditors are satisfied. In that case, the ability of purchasers of the offered shares to recover any portion of the purchase price for the offered shares will depend on the amount of funds realized and the claims to be satisfied.



	 




	INVESTORS WILL PAY MORE FOR OUR COMMON STOCK THAN THE PRO RATA PORTION OF OUR ASSETS ARE WORTH. AS A RESULT, INVESTING IN OUR COMMON STOCK MAY RESULT IN AN IMMEDIATE LOSS.




	 



	The offering price and other terms and conditions regarding our shares have been arbitrarily determined by us and do not bear any relationship to assets, earnings, book value or any other objective criteria of value. Additionally, since we have recently formed and have only a limited operating history and no earnings, the price of the offered shares is not based on our past earnings. No investment banker, appraiser or other independent third party has been consulted concerning the offering price for the shares or the fairness of the offering price used for the shares.



	 



	The arbitrary offering price of $0.02 per common share is substantially higher than the net tangible book value of $0.00074 per share of our common stock. Our assets do not substantiate a share price of $0.02 per share. This premium in share price applies to the terms of this offering and does not attempt to reflect any forward-looking share price subsequent to our obtaining a listing on any exchange, or becoming quoted on either the Over-The-Counter Bulletin Board or the


	OTC Markets


	, if ever.



	 




	 




	18













	 




	 




	OUR MANAGEMENT COULD ISSUE ADDITIONAL SHARES OR CREATE AND ISSUE ADDITIONAL CLASSES OF SHARES, THEREBY DILUTING OUR CURRENT SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY.




	 



	We have 200,000,000 authorized shares of common stock with a par value of $0.001 per share, of which 10,000,000 shares of common stock are currently issued and outstanding. If this offering is fully subscribed, 19,000,000 shares of common stock will be issued and outstanding after the offering terminates. We only have a single class of shares (i.e., common stock) and do not anticipate creating any additional classes of shares in the foreseeable future. Our management could, without the consent of our then existing shareholders, issue substantially more shares or create and issue additional classes of shares, potentially causing a large dilution in the equity position of our then existing shareholders. Additionally, large share issuances by us would generally have a negative impact on our share price. It is possible that, due to additional share issuance or the creation and issuance of additional classes of shares, you could lose a substantial amount, or all, of your investment.



	 




	AS WE DO NOT HAVE AN ESCROW OR TRUST ACCOUNT FOR INVESTOR SUBSCRIPTIONS.




	 



	Invested funds for this offering will not be placed in an escrow or trust account. Accordingly, if we file for bankruptcy protection, or creditors file a petition for involuntary bankruptcy against us, investor funds will become part of the bankruptcy estate and administered according to the bankruptcy laws. As such, investors will lose their investment and their funds will be used to pay creditors and will not be used for developing our business.



	 




	WE DO NOT ANTICIPATE PAYING DIVIDENDS IN THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE.




	 



	We do not anticipate paying dividends on either our common stock, or on any class of preferred stock that may be created and issued, in the foreseeable future. Rather, we plan to retain earnings, if any, for the operation, growth and expansion of our business.

	The actual costs may differ from the estimated figures outlined above. For our expected timeline for completion of our Plan of Operations, see Page


	28



	.




	 


	The proceeds received from this offering will not be used, fully or in part, to pay salary or make any other payment to our sole officer and director, Mr. Wilaiphan. The estimated expenses to comply with our obligations under the federal securities laws in connection with the issuance and distribution of the securities in this offering are included in the $9,370 in expenses related to this offering as outlined above.



	 



	The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission registration fee has been calculated pursuant to sections 6(b), 13(e), or 14(g) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The fee is $100.70 per $1,000,000 (prorated for amounts less than $1,000,000). It is calculated by multiplying the aggregate offering amount by .00010070 ($180,000 x .00010070 = $18.13) and has been rounded up to $20 for the purpose of estimating our offering expenses.



	 



	There is no minimum amount we are required to raise in this offering and any funds received will be immediately available to us.



	 



	The above expenditures are defined as follows:



	 




	Expenses Related to this Offering:



	Fees paid to our attorney and independent auditors for the preparation and filing of documents required by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission with respect to this registration statement, and other State and Federal documents. Additionally, fees paid to third-party EDGAR services for filing these documents with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and fees paid to the transfer agent for issuing corporate stock and facilitating subsequent stock transactions and oversight, and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission registration fee described above.



	 




	Expenses to Maintain our Reporting Status for 12 Months after Effective Date:



	We expect to spend $10,000 per year for auditor's fees in relation to our annual audit and quarterly reviews. We expect to have annual costs related to EDGARization of $2,600 and XBRL mapping of $3,750.



	 



	For a more detailed description of the expenditures described above, please refer to our Plan of Operations on Page


	28



	.



	 



	There is no assurance that we will be able to raise the entire amount of this offering. The chart on Page 20


	 

	details how we will use the proceeds if we raise only 25% or 50% or 75% of this offering.



	 



	If less than 100% of this offering is sold, we will have to reduce both our development and marketing plans. In order to try to guarantee the success of the development of our business, in this situation we will prioritize spending based on the viability of the Company. Therefore, we will allocate the majority of the funds raised to first hire third-party software developers to develop our communications product and, second, to hire third-party web developers to develop our website. Thereafter, if sufficient funds are available, we will invest in hiring third parties to perform quality assurance testing, support services and Internet marketing.



	 



	DETERMINATION OF OFFERING PRICE



	 



	The price of the current offering is fixed at $0.02 per share. As there is no established public market for our shares, the offering price and other terms and conditions relative to our shares have been arbitrarily determined by us and do not bear any relationship to assets, earnings, book value, or any other objective criteria of value. In addition, no investment banker, appraiser, or other independent third party has been consulted concerning the offering price for the shares or the fairness of the offering price used for the shares.



	 




	 




	21













	 





	 





	DILUTION







	 



	The price of the current offering is fixed at $0.02 per share. This price is significantly greater than the price paid by our sole officer and director for common equity since the Company's inception on August 25, 2015. Our sole officer and director paid $0.001 per share, a difference of $0.019 per share lower than the share price in this offering. Anyone investing in our common stock through this offering will immediately have significant dilution of his or her common stock.



	 



	Dilution represents the difference between the offering price and the net tangible book value per share immediately after completion of this offering. Net tangible book value is the amount that results from subtracting total liabilities and intangible assets from total assets. Dilution arises mainly as a result of our arbitrary determination of the offering price of the shares being offered. Dilution of the value of the shares you purchase is also a result of the lower book value of the shares held by our existing shareholders. The following tables compare the differences of your investment in our shares with the investment of our existing shareholders.

	DESCRIPTION OF SECURITIES TO BE REGISTERED



	 



	Common Stock







	 



	Our authorized common stock consists of 200,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share. The holders of our common stock:





	 









	*








	have equal ratable rights to dividends from funds legally available if and when declared by our

	board of directors;








	 




	 




	 









	*








	are entitled to share ratably in all of our assets available for distribution to holders of common stock

	upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up of our affairs;



















	*








	do not have preemptive, subscription or conversion rights and there are no redemption or sinking

	fund provisions or rights; and



















	*








	are entitled to one non-cumulative vote per share on all matters on which stockholders may vote.








	 



	We refer you to the bylaws of our articles of incorporation and the applicable statutes of the State of Nevada for a more complete description of the rights and liabilities of holders of our securities.





	 



	Preferred Stock



	 



	At this time we have not created nor anticipate creating any class of preferred stock. The bylaws of our articles of incorporation authorize the board of directors, without stockholder action, to provide for the creation and issuance of preferred stock in one or more classes and to determine with respect to each such class the voting powers, if any (which voting powers, if granted, may be full or limited), designations, preferences, and relative, participating, option, or other special rights, and the qualifications, limitations, or restrictions relating thereto.



	 



	Preemptive Rights and Non-Cumulative Voting



	 



	Our stockholders do not have preemptive rights to acquire additional shares of stock or securities convertible into shares of stock issued by our company. Also our stockholders do not have cumulative voting rights, which means that the holders of more than 50% of the outstanding shares, voting for the election of directors, can elect all of the directors to be elected, if they so choose, and, in that event, the holders of the remaining shares will not be able to elect any of our directors. After this offering is completed, if fully subscribed, Arraya Wilaiphan, our present stockholder will own 52.63% of our outstanding shares.



	 




	 




	25













	 




	 



	Cash Dividends



	 



	As of the date of this prospectus, we have not declared or paid any cash dividends to stockholders. The declaration of any future cash dividend will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon our earnings, if any, our capital requirements and financial position, our general economic condition, and other pertinent conditions. It is our present intention not to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future, but rather to reinvest future earnings, if any, in our business operations.



	 



	Anti-Takeover Provisions



	 



	There are no Nevada anti-takeover provisions that may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in our control. Sections 78.378 through 78.3793 of the Nevada Revised Statutes relate to control share acquisitions that may delay, so as to make it more difficult to acquire our company or change the control of our company. However, these provisions only apply when we have 200 or more stockholders of record, at least 100 of whom have addresses in the State of Nevada appearing on our stock ledger, and we do business in Nevada directly or through an affiliated corporation. Neither of the foregoing events seems likely to occur. Currently, we have no Nevada shareholders and, since this offering will not be made in the State of Nevada, no shares will be sold to Nevada residents. Further, we do not do business in Nevada directly or through an affiliate corporation and we do not intend to do business in the State of Nevada in the


	future. Accordingly, there are no anti-takeover provisions that have the effect of delaying or preventing an acquisition or a change in our control.




	 





	STOCK TRANSFER AGENT



	 



	We have not engaged the services of a transfer agent at this time. However, within the next twelve months we anticipate doing so. Until a transfer agent is retained, we will act as our own transfer agent.



	 





	LEGAL PROCEEDINGS



	 



	We are not a party to any material legal proceedings and to our knowledge, no such proceedings are threatened or contemplated by any party.



	 



	DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS



	 



	Business Development



	 



	We are a development-stage company, incorporated on August 25, 2015 in the State of Nevada, with a fiscal year end of August 31. We do not own or lease any property.


	The only employee of the Company is its sole officer and director, Arraya Wilaiphan. We are a development-stage company that intends to develop, market and sell a subscription communications service providing secure point-to-point e-mail messages and attachments. To date, our operations have been limited to researching the marketplace for our proposed communications product and the issues entailed in developing this product, as well as the preliminary design and development of our website. We have not yet implemented our business model or undertaken development of our proposed communications product. To date, we have generated no revenues from our operations.



	 



	Our Business



	 



	We intend to develop, launch, market and sell (via subscription), what will be (depending on user preferences) the most secure, closed point-to-point e-mail system available today. At the present time, privacy breeches in communications between friends, family members, corporate employees and even lovers, are daily events. Malicious attacks on personal and corporate data are difficult to control, particularly given today's open communications services and cloud storage offerings. Our proposed closed messaging system will be designed to alleviate the majority of security concerns inherent in the most popular, open style, text and e-mail communications systems available today.



	 




	 




	26













	 




	 



	Our proposed messageBgone Application (MBA) is not an e-mail system

	per se

	(nor is it a replacement for conventional e-mail) and will not accept messages sent through other e-mail or communications providers. The MBA will also not permit messages to be sent via interface with other e-mail or communications providers. Only e-mail messages created within the MBA application and sent between MBA users will be allowed. This will create a completely closed and secure, point-to-point communications system between MBA subscribers, allowing them to send unlimited messages, in the format of e-mail, together with Portable Document Format (PDF) attachments, if desired. Once subscribed, an MBA user will be able to download either a Windows- or Mac-based software application that will facilitate the exchange of secure encrypted messages and attachments between MBA subscribers within the closed system.



	 



	Market Opportunity



	 



	Some of the weakest links in computer security result from the combination of computers utilizing operating systems such as Windows and OSI, together with web browsers such as Safari ™ and Explorer ™, with a multitude of known and ever-emerging security issues. Any messaging system running within a web browser can only be as secure as the browser itself and can readily lend itself to security breeches due to browser security shortcomings, rather than security issues with the computer program itself. Therefore, instead of being a web browser-based computer application, the MBA will function as a low-level application that will not interact with either computer operating systems or web browsers.



	 



	By writing low-level code that will operate independently, below a computer's operating system and outside of any web browser, there is little chance that a breech of the operating system or browser security will have any impact on the security of the MBA. For added security we intend to block the functionality of some operating system "hot keys" (such as "print screen" and "screen capture") to assist in the containment of the received message. We will also recommend other security precautions to our users in an effort to help them identify and remove malware, key-logging technologies and other types of spyware that could affect a MBA user's message security.



	 



	Every message and attachment sent via the MBA will be encrypted on the user's desktop utilizing AES 256 bit encryption and will then be uploaded to be stored on the messageBgone server, where it will remain encrypted until downloaded and unencrypted by the recipient MBA user. Additional security features will include no message logging, no password logging and no Internet Protocol logging or retention. Additionally, when a message is deleted from the messageBgone server it is truly gone forever. No copies of the message will ever be stored on either the sender's or the recipient's computer.



	 



	The MBA will allow a user to compose and send messages in the format of e-mail, attaching a PDF if desired, and view messages and PDF attachments only in the MBA. There will be no way to save a message or an attachment - only the ability to view it. Once the message's intended recipient downloads, unencrypts and views the message and/or attachment, it will be automatically deleted from the messageBgone server forever when the recipient closes their MBA. If a message is sent to a user and is undelivered for a period of five days (individual users may choose a shorter auto delete period), it will be also be permanently deleted from the server. The messageBgone server and the MBA will have no directory of users. Therefore, a message author will need to know the MBA address of the recipient and type it into the application on the creation of every message. Once a message is opened in the MBA it will remain on the user's screen for five minutes and will then permanently auto-delete. Additionally, the application will close in 120 seconds if there is no user interaction.



	 



	The Company will setup severs in various countries, depending on the most favorable hosting and security issues. (For example, Germany does not require severs to store a traffic logs of IP addresses and visitors.) The website that will be designed to allow customers to subscribe to and download the MBA service and will accept both traditional (Credit Cards, PayPal) and alternative (Bitcoins, hyper wallets) payment methods that will give customers additional levels of security with the option of total anonymity. If a MBA customer should choose to use an anonymous payment system such as Bitcoins, this MBA user would be anonymous even to us. Should an MBA user also choose to utilize their own one-time AES 256 bit encryption key for every message, they would enjoy the greatest level of security and anonymity available in the industry, as it could take hundreds or even thousands of years to decrypt a single message if it where ever to be intercepted.

	Employees and Employment Agreements



	 



	We have no employees other than our sole officer and director, Arraya Wilaiphan. Mr. Wilaiphan is also employed elsewhere, has the flexibility to work on our company approximately fifteen hours per week and may be prepared to devote additional time to our operations if required.



	 



	We presently do not have pension, health, annuity, insurance, stock options, profit sharing, or similar benefit plans; however, we may adopt such plans in the future. There are presently no personal benefits available to our director for time spent as a director.





	 





	MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OR PLAN OF OPERATION



	 



	The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our audited financial statements and the related notes that appear elsewhere in this registration statement and prospectus. The following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates and beliefs. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in these forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed below and elsewhere in this registration statement and prospectus, particularly in the section entitled "Risk Factors," which begins on Page


	10

	.



	 



	Our audited financial statements are stated in U.S. dollars and are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (US GAAP).





	 



	Company Overview



	 



	We are a development-stage company that intends to provide a subscription-based, highly secure, closed point-to-point communications service for messages and attachments. We have recently commenced business operations and have not generated any revenues to date.



	 



	Plan of Operations



	 



	Over the twelve-month period commencing upon the effective date of this prospectus, we intend to develop our corporate website and the messageBgone Application (MBA), in addition to launching sales and marketing activities.



	 



	Within 90 days of this prospectus becoming effective we intend to design the look and feel of our website. We will use a third party design service, like 99 Designs, or a similar service to design our website. Our anticipated expenditure on this effort is detailed in the table on Page 20.



	 



	Within 180 days of this prospectus becoming effective, we will hire a third party development firm to build our website and develop the MBA. We anticipate hiring a firm located in Eastern Europe, India or China to undertake these tasks. We expect the initial release of the MBA within 270 days of this prospectus becoming effective. We will initially develop the MBA for use on both the Windows and Mac platforms and will seek to develop the MBA for use on OSI and Android platforms in the future. Our anticipated expenditure on this effort is detailed in the table on Page 20



	.



	 




	 




	28













	 




	 



	Within 270 days of this prospectus becoming effective, we anticipate developing our marketing materials, user guide and sales guide. We will also research publications that cater to our target market and attempt to get editorials in these publications to create additional product awareness. Our marketing efforts will be primarily Internet-based and may include some or all of the following:



	 












	 





	·





	Display Advertising - Using web banners or banner advertisements placed on third-party websites to drive traffic to our website and thereby increase awareness for our proposed products.






	 




	 




	 






	 





	·





	Search Engine Marketing - Promoting our website by increasing its visibility in search engines through the use of paid placement, contextual advertising, and paid inclusion, or through the use of free search engine optimization techniques.






	 




	 




	 






	 





	·





	Search Engine Optimization - Improving the visibility of our website in search engines via "natural" or un-paid ("organic" or "algorithmic") search results.






	 




	 




	 






	 





	·





	Social Media Marketing – Seeking to increase and gain traffic and attention to our website through creating and maintaining a presence on a variety of social media sites.






	 







	Traditional e-product marketing utilizing social media, non-spam e-mail, fax blasts and press releases will also be utilized to increase product awareness. Our anticipated expenditure on this effort is detailed in the table on Page 20



	. We expect to complete this phase within 360 days of the effective date of this prospectus.



	 



	We may attempt to raise additional money through private placements, public offerings or long-term loans in order to expand and enhance our proposed product offerings, enhance our presence in the marketplace, enter into different facets of the marketplace, increase our product sales and grow our business. We will also continue to refine our proposed product and optimize our Interned-based marketing efforts from the market feedback we expect to receive. We do not, at this point in time, have cost or timing estimates for these endeavors.



	 



	At present, Arraya Wilaiphan, our sole officer and director, through his investment in our common stock, has invested $10,000 in our company. Mr. Wilaiphan is willing to make additional financial commitments if required, but the total amount that he is willing to invest has not yet been determined. At the present time, we have not made any arrangements to raise additional cash other than through this offering; however, we intend to raise additional capital through private placements once we gain a quotation on the Over-The-Counter Bulletin Board or the OTC Markets, for which there is no assurance. If we need additional cash but are unable to raise it, we will either suspend development and marketing operations until we do raise the cash, or cease operations entirely. Other than as described in this paragraph, we have no other financing plans.



	 



	If we are unable to complete any phase of our development or marketing efforts because we do not have enough capital, we will cease our development and or marketing operations until we raise sufficient funds. Attempting to raise capital after failing in any phase of our development plan could be difficult. As such, if we cannot secure additional proceeds we will have to cease operations and investors would lose their entire investment.



	 



	We do not plan to hire additional employees at this time. Our sole officer and director will be responsible for the initial phases of our plan of operations. Once we are ready to begin development of our website and the MBA, we plan to hire independent consultants to do so.



	 



	We have no current plans, preliminary or otherwise, to merge with any other entity.



	 




	 




	29













	 




	 





	Liquidity and Capital Resources



	 



	As of August 31, 2015, we had $5,945 in cash on hand and in the bank. We believe that this amount will clearly not satisfy our cash requirements for the next twelve months and, as such, we will need to raise proceeds through this offering or our sole officer and director will need to make additional financial commitments to our company, neither of which is guaranteed. In order for us to completely satisfy our cash requirements for the next twelve months, if this offering is not fully subscribed, we will require additional equity financing, most likely in the form of private placements of common stock. There is no additional offering planned at present.



	 



	We believe that if subsequent private placements are successful, this may allow us to operate our business to a point where we are generating sales revenues. However, additional equity financing may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all, and thus we could fail to satisfy our cash requirements for the next twelve months.



	 



	If we are unsuccessful in raising the additional proceeds through private placements we will then have to seek additional funds through debt financing, which would be extremely difficult and perhaps impossible for a new development-stage company to secure. However, if such financing were to be available, because we are a development-stage company with little or no operations, we would likely have to pay additional costs associated with high-risk loans and be subject to above-market interest rates. At such time as these funds may be required, we would evaluate the terms of such debt financing and determine whether the business could sustain operations and growth in addition to managing the debt load. If we cannot raise additional proceeds through private placements or debt financings, we would be required to cease business operations. As a result, an investor would lose all of their investment.



	 



	The staged development of our business operations (including our website and the MBA) will continue over the twelve-month period immediately following the effective date of our Registration Statement. Other than hiring independent consultants to design and develop our website and the MBA and engage in marketing activities, we do not anticipate hiring any other independent consultants. We do not expect to purchase any significant equipment or facilities and we do not anticipate hiring any employees. Our current material commitments include the total costs of the planned offering as provided herein, estimated at $9,370.



	 



	Our auditors have issued a "going concern" opinion. This means that there is substantial doubt that we can continue as an ongoing business for the next twelve months unless we obtain additional capital to pay our bills. This is because we have not generated any revenues and no substantial revenues are anticipated until we have completed the financing anticipated in this offering. Accordingly, we must raise cash from sources other than from the sale of our proposed communications product. Our only other source for cash at this time is investments by others in this offering. We must raise cash to implement our business strategy and stay in business. If this offering is not fully subscribed, we will likely not have adequate funds for us to operate for at least twelve months. In addition to raising additional capital, our success or failure will be determined by our ability to launch our website, develop the MBA and successfully market and sell the MBA.



	 



	Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements



	 



	We currently have no off-balance sheet arrangements, including outstanding derivative financial statements, off-balance sheet guarantees, interest rate swap transactions or foreign currency contracts. We do not engage in trading activities involving non-exchange traded contracts.



	 



	Intellectual Property



	 



	We intend, in due course, subject to legal advice, to apply for trademark protection and/or copyright protection in the United States, Canada, and other jurisdictions.





	 



	We intend to aggressively assert our rights under trademark and copyright laws to protect our intellectual property, including product design, product research and concepts and recognized trademarks. These rights are protected through the acquisition of trademark registrations, the maintenance of copyrights, and, where appropriate, litigation against those who are, in our opinion, infringing these rights.





	 




	 




	30













	 




	 



	While there can be no assurance that registered trademarks and copyrights will protect our proprietary information, we intend to assert our intellectual property rights against any infringer. Although any assertion of our rights can result in a substantial cost to, and diversion of effort by, our company, we believe that the protection of our intellectual property rights is a key component of our operating strategy.



	 



	Regulatory Matters



	 



	We are unaware of and do not anticipate having to expend significant resources to comply with any governmental regulations of data storage. In general, the development and operation of our business is not subject to special regulatory and/or supervisory requirements.



	 



	Environmental Laws



	 



	We have not incurred and do not anticipate incurring any expenses associated with environmental laws.







	 





	MARKET FOR COMMON EQUITY AND RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS



	 



	There is currently no trading market for our common stock. We do not have any common stock subject to outstanding options or warrants and there are no securities outstanding that are convertible into our common stock. None of our issued and outstanding common stock is eligible for sale pursuant to Rule 144 under the Securities Act of 1933. Rule 144, as currently in effect, allows a person who has beneficially owned shares of a company's common stock for at least twelve months to sell within any three-month period a number of shares that does not exceed the greater of:



	 








	1.



	One percent of the number of shares of the subject company's common stock then outstanding which, in our case, will equal 5,000 shares as of the date of this prospectus; or,















	1.



	The average weekly trading volume of the subject company's common stock during the four calendar weeks preceding the filing of a notice on Form 144 with respect to the sale.








	 



	Sales of common stock under Rule 144 are also subject to manner of sale provisions, notice requirements, and the subject company must be current in its public information filings.



	 



	Under Rule 144(k), a person who is not one of the subject company's affiliates at any time during the three months preceding a sale, and who has beneficially owned the shares proposed to be sold for at least two years, is entitled to sell shares without complying with the manner of sale, public information, volume limitation or notice provisions of Rule 144.



	 



	As of the date of this prospectus, persons who are our affiliates hold 10,000,000 shares of our common stock that may be sold pursuant to Rule 144 after August 25, 2016. Rule 144 applies to the 10,000,000 shares of our common stock except that subparagraph (k) of Rule 144 states that all shares owned by affiliates will continue to be subject to the resale limitations imposed by Rule 144 for so long as the shareholder remains an affiliate of our company. Three months after such persons cease to be affiliates of our company, sales may be made after the two-year period from the issue date without Rule 144 limitations under Rule 144(k).



	 



	We are registering 9,000,000 shares of our common stock under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, for sale. There is currently one holder of record of our common stock.



	 



	We have not declared any dividends on our common stock since the inception of our company. There is no restriction in our articles of incorporation or bylaws that will limit our ability to pay dividends on our common stock. However, we do not anticipate declaring and paying dividends to our shareholders in the near or foreseeable future.



	 




	 




	31













	 




	 



	Shares of our common stock may be subject to rules adopted by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, which regulate broker/dealer practices in connection with transactions in "penny stocks." "Penny stock" is defined to be any equity security that has a market price less than $5.00 per share or an exercise price of less than $5.00 per share, subject to certain exceptions. If we establish a trading market for our common stock, our common stock will most likely be covered by the penny stock rules, which impose additional sales practice requirements on broker/dealers who sell to persons other than established customers and "accredited investors." The term "accredited investor" refers generally to institutions with assets in excess of $5,000,000 or individuals with a net worth in excess of $1,000,000 or an annual income exceeding $200,000 (or $300,000 jointly with their spouse). The penny stock rules require a broker/dealer, prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from the rules, to deliver a standardized risk disclosure document in a format prescribed by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. This document provides information about penny stocks and the nature and level of risks in the penny stock marketplace. The broker/dealer must also provide the customer with current bid and offer quotations for the penny stock, the compensation of the broker/dealer and its salesperson in the transaction and monthly account statements showing the market value of each penny stock held in the customer's account. The bid and offer quotations, and the broker/dealer and salesperson compensation information, must be given to the customer orally or in writing prior to effecting the transaction and must be given to the customer in writing before or with the customer's confirmation. In addition, the penny stock rules require that prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from these rules the broker/dealer must make a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive the purchaser's written agreement to the transaction. These disclosure requirements may have the effect of reducing the level of trading activity in the secondary market for the stock that is subject to these penny stock rules. Consequently, these penny stock rules may affect the ability of broker/dealers to trade our securities.

	NOTE 1 – NATURE OF OPERATIONS AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION




	 



	MessageBgone, Inc. was incorporated in the State of Nevada as a for-profit Company on August 25, 2015 and established a fiscal year end of August 31. The Company


	intends to develop, market and sell the most secure, closed point-to-point messaging system available today.



	 




	Going concern




	 



	To date the Company has generated no revenues from its business operations and has incurred operating losses since inception of $2,555. As at August 31, 2015, the Company has working capital equity of $7,445. The Company will require additional funding to meet its ongoing obligations and to fund anticipated operating losses. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent on raising capital to fund its initial business plan and ultimately to attain profitable operations. Accordingly, these factors raise substantial doubt as to the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. The Company intends to continue to fund its business by way of private placements and advances from related parties as may be required. As of August 31, 2015 the Company has funded initial expensed through advances from the president. These financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts, or amounts and classification of liabilities that might result from this uncertainty.



	 




	NOTE 2 – SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES




	 




	Basis of presentation




	 



	The financial statements present the balance sheet, statements of operations, stockholders' equity and cash flows of the Company. These financial statements are presented in the United States dollars and have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.



	 




	Use of Estimates and Assumptions




	 



	Preparation of the financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect certain reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the period. Accordingly, actual results could differ from those estimates.



	 




	Cash and Cash Equivalents




	 



	Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand and on deposit at banking institutions as well as all highly liquid short-term investments with original maturities of 90 days or less. The Company did not have cash equivalents as of August 31, 2015.



	 




	Financial Instruments




	 



	All significant financial assets, financial liabilities and equity instruments of the Company are either recognized or disclosed in the financial statements together with other information relevant for making a reasonable assessment of future cash flows, interest rate risk and credit risk. Where practical the fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities have been determined and disclosed; otherwise only available information pertinent to fair value has been disclosed.



	 




	 




	38













	 




	 




	Loss per Common Share




	 



	The basic earnings (loss) per share are calculated by dividing the Company's net income available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares during the year. The diluted earnings (loss) per share is calculated by dividing the Company's net income (loss) available to common shareholders by the diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding during the year. The diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding is the basic weighted number of shares adjusted for any potentially dilutive debt or equity. Diluted earnings (loss) per share are the same as basic earnings (loss) per share due to the lack of dilutive items in the Company.



	 




	Income Taxes




	 



	The Company follows the liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax balances and tax loss carry-forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted or substantially enacted tax rates expected to apply to the taxable income in the years in which those differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the date of enactment or substantive enactment.



	 




	Stock-based Compensation




	 



	The Company follows


	ASC 718-10, "


	Stock Compensation


	",


	which addresses the accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services


	,


	with a primary focus on transactions in which an entity obtains employee services in share-based payment transactions


	. ASC 718-10


	is a revision to


	SFAS


	No


	. 123, "


	Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation


	,"


	and supersedes Accounting Principles Board


	("APB")


	Opinion




	No


	. 25, "


	Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees


	,"


	and its related implementation guidance


	. ASC 718-10


	requires measurement of the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant-date fair value of the award


	(


	with limited exceptions


	).


	Incremental compensation costs arising from subsequent modifications of awards after the grant date must be recognized


	.


	The Company has not adopted a stock option plan and has not granted any stock options


	.


	As at August 31, 2015 the Company had not adopted a stock option plan nor had it granted any stock options. Accordingly no stock-based compensation has been recorded to date.



	 




	Recent Accounting Pronouncements




	 



	In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-15, "Presentation of Financial Statements – Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40): Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity's Ability to Continue as a Going Concern" ("ASU 2014-15"). ASU 2014-15, which is effective for annual reporting periods ending after December 15, 2016, extends the responsibility for performing the going-concern assessment to management and contains guidance on how to perform a going-concern assessment and when going-concern disclosures would be required under U.S. GAAP. The Company does not anticipate that the adoption of ASU 2014-15 will have a material impact on its financial statements.



	 



	In June 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") No. 2014-10, "Development Stage Entities (Topic 915): Elimination of Certain Financial Reporting Requirements, Including an Amendment to Variable Interest Entities Guidance in Topic 810, Consolidation," ("ASU 2014-10"). ASU 2014-10 removes the definition of a development stage entity from the ASC, thereby removing the financial reporting distinction between development stage entities and other reporting entities from GAAP. In addition, ASU 2014-10 eliminates the requirements for development stage entities to (1) present inception-to-date information in the statements of operations, cash flows, and stockholders' equity, (2) label the financial statements as those of a development stage entity, (3) disclose a description of the development stage activities in which the entity is engaged, and (4) disclose in the first year in which the entity is no longer a development stage entity that in prior years it had been in the development stage. ASU 2014-10 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2014, and interim periods therein. Early adoption is permitted. The Company has elected to adopt ASU 2014-10 effective with this registration statement on Form S-1 and its adoption resulted in the removal of previously required development stage disclosures.

	NOTE 2 – SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)




	 




	Recent Accounting Pronouncements (continued)




	 



	The Company has implemented all new accounting pronouncements that are in effect and that may impact its financial statements and does not believe that there are any other new accounting pronouncements that have been issued that might have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations.





	 




	NOTE 3 – CAPITAL STOCK




	 



	The Company's capitalization is 200,000,000 common shares with a par value of $0.001 per share. No preferred shares have been authorized or issued.



	 



	As of August 31, 2015, the Company has not granted any stock options and has not recorded any stock-based compensation.



	 



	On August 25, 2015, the Company issued 10,000,000 common shares at $0.001 per share to the sole director and president of the Company for cash proceeds of $10,000.



	 






	NOTE 4 – INCOME TAXES




	 



	A reconciliation of the provision for income taxes at the United States federal statutory rate compared to the Company's income tax expense as reported is as follows:



	 





	 



	 






	August 31,

	$


	–



	 






	 




	 




	40













	 




	  



	The significant components of deferred income tax assets at August 31, 2015 are as follows:



	 







	 



	 






	August 31,






	2015






	 







	Net operating loss carry-forward

	Valuation allowance





	 




	 



	(894


	)




	 



	 




	 




	 




	 







	Net deferred income tax asset





	 



	$


	–



	 






	 



	The amount taken into income as deferred income tax assets must reflect that portion of the income tax loss carry forwards that is more likely-than-not to be realized from future operations. The Company has chosen to provide a full valuation allowance against all available income tax loss carry forwards. The Company has recognized a valuation allowance for the deferred income tax asset since the Company cannot be assured that it is more likely than not that such benefit will be utilized in future years. The valuation allowance is reviewed annually. When circumstances change and which cause a change in management's judgment about the realizability of deferred income tax assets, the impact of the change on the valuation allowance is generally reflected in current income.



	 



	As of August 31, 2015, the Company has no unrecognized income tax benefits. The Company's policy for classifying interest and penalties associated with unrecognized income tax benefits is to include such items as tax expense. No interest or penalties have been recorded during the year ended August 31, 2015 no interest or penalties have been accrued as of August 31, 2015. As of August 31, 2015, the Company did not have any amounts recorded pertaining to uncertain tax positions.



	 



	The tax year from 2015 and forward remain open to examination by federal and state authorities due to net operating loss and credit carry forwards. The Company is currently not under examination by the Internal Revenue Service or any other taxing authorities.

	CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS





	 



	Except as described below, none of the following parties have, since our date of incorporation, had any material interest, direct or indirect, in any transaction with us or in any presently proposed transaction that have or will materially affect us, other than as noted in this section:

	DISCLOSURE OF THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION POSITION ON




	INDEMNIFICATION FOR SECURITIES ACT OF 1933 LIABILITIES





	 



	Our bylaws provide that we shall, to the maximum extent permitted by Nevada law, have the power to indemnify each of our representatives against expenses and shall have the power to advance to each such representative expenses incurred in defending any proceeding to the maximum extent permitted by Nevada law.



	 



	Under our bylaws, the term "representative" includes any person who is or was a director, officer, employee or other representative of our company; or is or was serving at the request of our company as a director, officer, employee or representative of another foreign or domestic corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise; or was a director, officer, employee or representative of a foreign or domestic corporation which was a predecessor corporation of our company or of another enterprise at the request of such predecessor corporation. The term "proceeding" means any threatened, pending or completed action or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative. The term "expenses" includes, without limitation, attorney fees, judgments, fines, settlements, and other amounts actually and reasonably incurred in connection with any proceeding arising by reason of the fact any such person is or was a representative of our company.



	 



	Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act of 1933 may be permitted to directors, officers and controlling persons of our company under Nevada law or otherwise, our company has been advised that the opinion of the Securities and Exchange Commission is that such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and is, therefore, unenforceable.

	INDEMNIFICATION OF DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS





	Nevada corporation law provides that:


	 








	 





	·





	A corporation may indemnify any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, except an action by or in the right of the corporation, by reason of the fact that he is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, against expenses, including attorneys' fees, judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by him in connection with the action, suit or proceeding if he acted in good faith and in a manner which he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe his conduct was unlawful;






	 




	 




	 






	 





	·





	A corporation may indemnify any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action or suit by or in the right of the corporation to procure a judgment in its favor by reason of the fact that he is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise against expenses, including amounts paid in settlement and attorneys' fees actually and reasonably incurred by him in connection with the defense or settlement of the action or suit if he acted in good faith and in a manner which he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation. Indemnification may not be made for any claim, issue or matter as to which such a person has been adjudged by a court of competent jurisdiction, after exhaustion of all appeals therefrom, to be liable to the corporation or for amounts paid in settlement to the corporation, unless and only to the extent that the court in which the action or suit was brought or other court of competent jurisdiction determines upon application that in view of all the circumstances of the case, the person is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity for such expenses as the court deems proper; and,






	 




	 




	 






	 





	·





	To the extent that a director, officer, employee or agent of a corporation has been successful on the merits or otherwise in defense of any action, suit or proceeding, or in defense of any claim, issue or matter therein, the corporation shall indemnify him against expenses, including attorneys' fees, actually and reasonably incurred by him in connection with the defense.






	 












	We may make any discretionary indemnification only as authorized in a specific case upon which a determination that indemnification of the director, officer, employee or agent is proper in the circumstances. The determination must be made:


	 







	 





	·





	By our stockholders;






	 




	 




	 






	 





	·





	By our board of directors by majority vote of a quorum consisting of directors who were not parties to the action, suit or proceeding;






	 




	 




	 






	 





	·





	If a majority vote of a quorum consisting of directors who were not parties to the action, suit or proceeding so orders, by independent legal counsel in a written opinion;






	 




	 




	 






	 





	·





	If a quorum consisting of directors who were not parties to the action, suit or proceeding cannot be obtained, by independent legal counsel in a written opinion; or,






	 




	 




	 






	 





	·





	By court order.






	 




	 




	48













	 




	 









	Our bylaws provide that we shall, to the maximum extent permitted by Nevada law, have the power to indemnify each of our representatives against expenses and shall have the power to advance to each such representative expenses incurred in defending any such proceeding to the maximum extent permitted by that law.



	 



	Under our bylaws, the term "representative" includes any person who is or was a director, officer, employee or other representative of our company; or is or was serving at the request of our company as a director, officer, employee or representative of another foreign or domestic corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise; or was a director, officer, employee or representative of a foreign or domestic corporation which was a predecessor corporation of our company or of another enterprise at the request of such predecessor corporation. The term "proceeding" means any threatened, pending or completed action or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative. The term "expenses" includes, without limitation, attorneys' fees, judgments, fines, settlements, and other amounts actually and reasonably incurred in connection with any proceeding arising by reason of the fact any such person is or was a representative of our company.



	 



	Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act of 1933 may be permitted to directors, officers and controlling persons of our company under Nevada law or otherwise, we have been advised the opinion of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is that such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act of 1933 and is, therefore, unenforceable. In the event a claim for indemnification against such liabilities (other than payment by us for expenses incurred or paid by a director, officer or controlling person of our company in successful defense of any action, suit, or proceeding) is asserted by a director, officer or controlling person in connection with the securities being registered, we will, unless in the opinion of our independent legal counsel the matter has been settled by controlling precedent, submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction, the question of whether such indemnification by us is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act of 1933 and will be governed by the final adjudication of such issue.



	 



	RECENT SALES OF UNREGISTERED SECURITIES





	 



	On August 25, 2015 we issued 10,000,000 shares of common stock to Arraya Wilaiphan, our sole officer and director, for cash proceeds of $10,000, or $0.001 per share. We issued these 10,000,000 shares of common stock relying on Section 4(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.

	UNDERTAKINGS





	 



	The undersigned registrant hereby undertakes:



	 






	1.



	To file, during any period in which it offers or sells securities, a post-effective amendment to this, the effective registration statement, to:








	 








	a.



	Include any prospectus required by Section 10(a)(3) of the Securities Act of 1933;















	b.



	Reflect in the prospectus any facts or events which, individually or together, represent a fundamental change in the information in the effective registration statement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any increase or decrease in the volume of securities offered (if the total dollar value of securities offered would not exceed that which is registered) and any deviation from the low- or high-end of the estimated maximum offering range may be reflected in the form of prospectus filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) if, in the aggregate, the changes in volume and price represent no more than a 20% change in the maximum aggregate offering price set forth in the "Calculation of Registration Fee" table in the effective registration statement; and,















	c.



	To include any additional or changed material information on the plan of distribution.








	 






	2.



	For determining any liability under the Securities Act of 1933, treat each post-effective amendment as a new registration statement of the securities offered, and the offering of the securities at that time to be the initial bona fide offering.











	3.



	File a post-effective amendment to remove from registration any of the securities that remain unsold at the end of the offering.











	4.



	For determining liability of the registrant under the Securities Act of 1933 to any purchaser in the initial distribution of securities, the undersigned issuer undertakes that in a primary offering of securities of the registrant pursuant to this registration statement, regardless of the underwriting method used to sell the securities to the purchaser, if the securities are offered or sold to such purchasers by means of the following communications, the registrant will be a seller to the purchaser and will be considered to offer or sell such securities to such purchaser:








	 








	a.



	Any preliminary prospectus or prospectus of the registrant relating to the offering required to be filed pursuant to Rule 424;















	b.



	Any free writing prospectus relating to the offering prepared by or on behalf of the registrant or used or referred to by the registrant;















	c.



	The portion of any free writing prospectus relating to the offering containing material information about the registrant or its securities provided by or on behalf of the registrant; and,















	d.



	Any other communication that is an offer (in the offering) made by the registrant to the purchaser.





	 









	5.



	In the event that a claim for indemnification against such liabilities (other than the payment by the registrant of expenses incurred or paid by a director, officer, or controlling person of the registrant in the successful defense of any action, suit, or proceeding) is asserted by such director, officer, or controlling person connected with the securities being registered, the registrant will, unless in the opinion of its independent legal counsel the matter has been settled by controlling precedent, submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction the question whether such indemnification by it is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act of 1933 and will be governed by the final adjudication of such issue.











	6.



	Each prospectus filed pursuant to Rule 424(b) as part of a registration statement relating to an offering, other than registration statements relying on Rule 430B or other than prospectuses filed in reliance on Rule 430A shall be deemed to be part of and included in the registration statement as of the date it is first used after effectiveness; provided however, that no statement made in a registration statement or prospectus that is a part of the registration statement or made in a document incorporated or deemed incorporated by reference into the registration statement or prospectus that is part of the registration statement will, as to a purchaser with a time of contract of sale prior to such first use, supersede or modify any statement that was made in the registration statement or prospectus that was part of the registration statement or made in any such document immediately prior to such date of first use.

	RE:



	Legal Opinion Pursuant to SEC Form S-1 for messageBgone, Inc., a Nevada corporation




	 


	Ladies and Gentlemen:


	 


	I have acted as special counsel to messageBgone, Inc. (The "Company ") for the limited purpose of rendering this opinion in connection with the Registration Statement on Form S-1 and the Prospectus included there in (collectively the "Registration Statement") which is being filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Act") on or about November 11, 2015, with respect to the registration and proposed sale of up to 9,000,000 shares of Common Stock, par value $0.001 per share, which may be sold at a price of $0.02 per share.


	 


	In my capacity as special counsel to the Company, I have examined instruments, documents, and records, which I have deemed relevant and necessary for the basis of my opinion, including, but not l imited to, the Certificate of Incorporation of the Company, the By-Laws of the Company, and the records' of corporate proceedings relating to the issuance of Shares. Additionally, I have reviewed and made such other examinations of law and fact as I have deemed relevant to form the opinion hereinafter expressed.


	 


	I have examined such documents in light of the applicable laws of the State of Nevada, including the Nevada Constitution, all applicable provisions of Nevada statutes, and reported judicial decisions interpreting those laws.


	 


	In such examinations, I have assumed the legal capacity of all natural persons, the authenticity and completeness of all instruments submitted to me as original documents, the conformity to the authentic originals of all documents supplied to me as certi fied or photostatic or faxed copies, and the genuineness of all signatures contained in the records, documents, instruments, and certificates I have reviewed.


	 


	In conducting my examination of documents executed by parties other than the Company, I have assumed that such parties had the power, corporate, limited liability company or other, to enter into and perform all obligations thereunder and have also assumed the due authorization by all requisite action, corporate, limited liability company or other, and the due execution and delivery by such parties of such documents and that, to the extent such documents purport to constitute agreements, such documents constitute valid and bind ing obligations of such parties.

	Based upon and subject to the foregoing, I make the followi ng opinion on the legality of the securities being registered. I am of the opinion that:


	 


	1.  The Company has an authorized capital ization of 200,000,000 shares of Common Stock, $0.001 par value, and no shares of Preferred Stock.


	 


	2. The 9,000,000 shares that are being offered by the Company, upon the due execution by the Company and the registration by its registrar of such shares, the sale thereof by the Company i n accordance with the terms of the Registration Statement and after the effectiveness of the Registration Statement, and the receipt of consideration therefore in accordance with the terms of the Registration Statement, such shares will be duly and validly issued and authorized, fully paid and non-assessable.


	 


	This opinion letter is Limited to the status of shares to be issued under the Registration Statement, and no opinion is implied or may be inferred beyond the matters expressly stated.


	 


	I hereby consent to the filing of this opinion with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission as an Exhibit to the Registration Statement and to the reference to this firm under the heading "Experts" in the Prospectus. In giving this consent, I do not hereby admit that I am an "Expert" under the Act, or the rules and regulations of the SEC issued thereunder, with respect to any part of the Registration Statement, including this exhibit. Further, in giving this consent I do not admit that I come within the category of persons whose consent is required under Section 7 of the Act or the rules and regulations of the SEC promulgated therein or Item 509 of Regulation S-K.
