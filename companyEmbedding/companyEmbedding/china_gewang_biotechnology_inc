Based on a per share offering price of $[?], we estimate that the net proceeds
from the sale of 2,500,000 shares of our common stock in the offering will be
approximately $11,040,000 million after deducting the estimated underwriting
discounts and expenses of 8%.

We intend to use the net proceeds from this offering according to the following
table:

                                                           $12,000,000        
Item                                                    (USD)            %    
Underwriting discounts and commissions                   960,000        8.00 %
Net Proceeds                                          11,040,000              
Opening Selenium Product Experience Stores(1)          2,309,000       20.91 %

Working Capital                                         780,000         7.07 %
Total                                                 11,040,000         100 %

(1) The Company has projected that this amount of funds will be sufficient to
    open 26 new Selenium Product Experience Stores in provincial capitals in
    China, bringing our total to 30 stores. 

(2) The Company projects spending up to $8,400,000 on “promotional fees” in the
    2017 fiscal year to increase sales, $5,626,000 of which is expected to come
    from the proceeds of this offering with the remainder to come from
    operations.

(3) Funds for R&D of selenium products will be paid directly to the Academy to
    support continued research in selenium products.

Other than as indicated in this Use of Proceeds section, we cannot specify with
certainty the exact amounts that will be used for each purpose. The amounts and
timing of our actual expenditures will depend on numerous factors, including the
status of our development efforts, sales and marketing activities, the amount of
cash generated or used by our operations and competition. We may find it 
necessary or advisable to use portions of the proceeds for other purposes, and
we will have broad discretion in the application of the net proceeds. We have no
current intentions to acquire any other businesses. Pending these uses, the
proceeds may be invested in short-term, investment grade, interest-bearing
securities.


There are a limited number of name brands of selenium supplements in China, as
the industry is in its early development period. In the markets where we do face
competition, we emphasize the high quality of the Jindanli products such as the
following:

. The Jindanli Selenium Capsule is designed using carageenan capsules to offer
  rapid absorption and high quality, yielding a product useful for all persons
  in need of added selenium in their diet.

. The Jindanli Selenium - Glossy Ganoderma Capsules offer an attractive 
  combination of contemporary biotechnology with traditional healing. We source
  pure ganoderma spore powder from Mount Taishan wood, combine it with Jindanli
  selenium and package it in a carageenan capsule.     

. The Jindanli Organic Selenium Powder provides the benefits of selenium to 
  infants and the infirm, for whom swallowing capsules is difficult. 

While the industry has grown significantly, we believe the market is still in
its early stages which is why we believe the market is fragmented and lacking a
nationally recognized brand of selenium supplements.

Due to the fragmented market comprised of small players, many potential 
customers’ initial experiences with selenium supplements are with what we 
believe to be inferior products, many of which make unsupportable health claims.
According to the Chinese Selenium Supplements Association, this has led to a
lack of confidence in the selenium supplements among the Chinese people.
Therefore, our marketing strategy must include education and strong prudent
promotion, coupled with publicity to build confidence in the industry and our
brands.

We believe that the quality of our products, along with our association with top
quality manufacturers and chain stores, will enable us to compete effectively
and gain market share, as the selenium supplement industry grows.


Company Description
Guangdong Gewang is engaged in the sale of selenium supplements and selenium
products within China.

Guangdong Gewang sells its proprietary selenium capsules and selenium powder,
along with eighty nine types of selenium fortified food products from other
manufacturers and other health related


 products through our branded stores and
through our distribution channels to large supermarket chains and similar large
chain stores.

Guangdong Gewang initiated its business by cooperating with the Academy of
Agricultural Sciences of Shandong Province (the “Academy”) in the research and
development of formulas for three selenium supplements: a selenium capsule, a
capsule combining selenium with glossy ganoderma (a therapeutic mushroom), and a
selenium powder. The Academy has given Guangdong Gewang an exclusive license to
contract for the manufacture and marketing of these three products. As a result
of our relationship with the Academy, Guangdong Gewang has not needed to conduct
its own research and development in the past two years.

In March 2016, Gewang entered into cooperation agreements with several selenium
enriched food product manufacturers for the sale of selenium enriched food
through chain stores which further expanded the Company’s market share.

Guangdong Gewang was founded in June 2010 in Guangzhou City, China Our home
office is located at Floor 29 No. 334, Huanshi East Road, Yuexiu District,

(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis  Results of Operations for the Year Ended November 30, 2016 Compared with the Year Ended November 30, 2015  The following table sets forth key components of our results of operations during the years ended November 30, 2016 and 2015, and the percentage changes between 2016 and 2015.   Fiscal Year Fiscal Year 2016 2015 Change (US $) (US $) % Net revenue $ 45,519,999 $ 4,184,255 988 % Cost of Sales (28,765,888 ) (1,186,461 ) 2,325 % Gross profit 16,754,111 2,997,794 459 % Selling and marketing expenses 3,044,135 836,040 264 % General and administrative expenses 1,005,385 528,627 90 % Research and development 605,816 - - Total operating expenses 4,655,336 1,364,667 241 % Operating income 12,098,775 1,633,127 640 % Other income 14,868 13,508 10 % Income before provision for income taxes 12,113,643 1,646,635 635 % Provision for income taxes 3,075,733 457,922 571 % Equity in income of investee 4,536,760 - - Net income before noncontrolling interests 13,574,670 1,188,713 1,042 % Noncontrolling interests (326,213 ) (61,790 ) 427 % Net income attributable to common stockholders $ 13,348,457 $ 1,126,923 1,075 %  Sales  Our sales increased to $45,519,999 for the fiscal year ended November 30, 2016 from $4,184,255 for the year ended November 30, 2015, an increase of $41,335,744 or 988%. We did not increase the prices of any of our products. However, we have begun to wholesale products manufactured by other companies through our distribution network and have also increased the volume of sales of our Jindanli branded products. Since March 2016, we have signed agreements with eight distributors to distribute selenium products to hundreds of retail stores, and we made net sales of selenium and selenium-related products totaling $41,160,605 to these distributors during fiscal year 2016. The following factors had the greatest impact on our increase in sales:  ? Total wholesale sales, including of our Jindanli branded products and products manufactured by other companies, to our distribution network of 16 wholesale customers and distributors by our headquarters marketing personnel increased by $38,215,165, primarily due to an increase in the number of sales personnel during fiscal year 2016.  ? Of the total increase in wholesale sales during the year ended November 30 2016, $32,559,461 was attributable to the wholesale of 89 selenium product types manufactured by other companies. In fiscal year 2015, we did not wholesale any products other than our Jindanli branded products. Of the total increase in wholesale sales during fiscal year 2016, $32,559,461 is attributable to new wholesale customers. Since March 2016, we have signed agreements with eight distributors to distribute selenium products to hundreds of retail stores, and this expansion of our customer base has greatly increased our volume of sales.  ? Of the total increase in wholesale sales during the year ended November 30, 2016, $5,654,374 is attributable to an increase in the volume of our three Jindanli branded selenium supplements, from $2,945,440 during fiscal year 2015, an increase of 192%. The increase is related to an expansion of our sales staff, which has increased the volume of sales of our existing products.  ? Retail sales increased by $3,085,289, or 249% during the year ended November 30, 2016. Due to increased rent and unsatisfactory pedestrian flow, we closed our Changcheng, Xiamen and Changsha stores on May 31, 2016 and opened stores in Foshan, Longyan and Zhuzhou and a flagship store in Guangzhou on June 1, 2016. The new stores are located in areas with better pedestrian flow, resulting in a sharp increase in retail sales. In addition, the new stores stock an inventory of over 90 selenium products, whereas the previous stores stocked only our three selenium supplements.  During the summer of 2016, we commenced franchising the use of our trademark, name identification and other business resources. The franchisees were required to pay us a franchise fee and monthly management fees. During the year ended November 30, 2016, two franchisees signed with us. However, we terminated the franchises in the fall of 2016 and do not plan to carry on franchise operations in the near future.  The following table shows the source of our revenue in the comparable periods:   Fiscal Year 2016 Fiscal Year 2015 Sales % of total Sales % of total Headquarters wholesale-selenium supplements $ 8,599,814 18.89 % $ 2,945,440 70.39 % Headquarters wholesale-selenium products 32,559,461 71.53 % - - Headquarters retail store 241,466 0.53 % 505,406 12.08 % Changcheng retail store 265,612 0.58 % 621,025 14.84 % Xiamen retail store 196,419 0.43 % 93,618 2.23 % Changsha retail store 161,315 0.35 % 18,766 0.45 % Foshan retail store 485,773 1.07 % - - Longyan retail store 431,392 0.95 % - - Zhuzhou retail store 411,304 0.90 % - - Flagship retail store 2,130,683 4.68 % - - Franchise and management fees 35,290 0.08 % - - $ 45,519,999 100 % $ 4,184,255 100 %  Gross Profit  For the past three years we have sold our three selenium supplements, and only in March 2016 began to resell a wide variety of selenium-related products that we purchase at wholesale. After increasing over the past two fiscal years, the unit prices that we pay to our manufacturers for the selenium supplements stabilized in the second quarter of fiscal 2016. As a result, our gross margin for selenium supplements was not significantly changed: 71.4% in fiscal year 2016 compared to 71.6% in fiscal year 2015. However, the selenium-related products that we resold during fiscal year 2016 yielded a gross margin of only 25%. As a result, our overall gross margin during fiscal year 2016 declined to 36.8% from 71.6% recorded on the sale of selenium supplements alone during fiscal year 2015.  Selling expenses  Our selling and marketing expenses increased by 459% to $3,044,135 for the year ended November 30, 2016 from $836,040 for the year ended November 30, 2015. Our selling expenses include rent, transportation expenses, advertising expenses and salaries incurred for the sales function, all of which will tend to increase as our sales increase. In fiscal 2016, we incurred RMB 3,790,000 (US$574,000) in advertising expense, which is significantly higher than we incurred in the past. We are committed to paying our current rate of advertising costs until March 31, 2017.  General and administrative expenses  Our general and administrative ("G&A") expenses increased by 90% to $1,005,385 for the year ended November 30, 2016 from $528,627 for the year ended November 30, 2015. The largest components of our G&A expenses are the salaries of administrative personnel and fringe benefits provided to all of our staff. The change in G&A expenses occurred primarily as a result of the expansion of our business over the prior year, as reflected in the growth of our sales, which led to increases in travel and entertainment expenses. In addition, to enable us to manage our expanding operations, we added administrative personnel.  Income from operations  Because the sharp increase in our sales generated a material increase in our gross profit, our operating income increased by 640% to $12,098,775 for the year ended November 30, 2016, from $1,633,127 for the year ended November 30, 2015.  As we have very little debt, our other income for the years ended November 30, 2016 and 2015 consisted of interest income earned on our bank balances of $14,868 and $13,508. Our pre-tax income, therefore, was $12,113,643 and $1,646,635 for the years ended November 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  Net income  Due to the increase in our pre-tax income, our provision for income taxes increased by 639% to $3,075,733 for the year ended November 30, 2016 from $457,922 for the year ended November 30, 2015. In this period, our effective tax rate was the same as the statutory rate of 25%. We also recorded equity investment income of $4,536,760, representing our 30% interest in the net income reported by Tianmei Australia for the year ended November 30, 2016. After deducting the provision for income taxes and adding equity in income of investee, China Gewang reported net income before noncontrolling interests of $13,574,670 and $1,188,713 for the year ended November 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  Before August 8, 2016, the VIE Agreements assigned to Gewang Selenium 95% of the net income of Guangdong Gewang. On August 8, 2016, Gewang Selenium purchased 98% of the registered equity of Guangdong Gewang. Our non-controlling interest, therefore, was reduced from 5% to 2%. We recorded a deduction for noncontrolling interests of $326,213 and $61,790 for the years ended November 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, after which our net income attributable to common stockholders was $13,248,457 ($0.20 per share) and $1,126,923 ($0.03 per share) for the years ended November 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  Foreign Currency Translation Adjustment  Our reporting currency is the U.S. dollar. Our local currency, the Renminbi (RMB), is our functional currency. Results of operations and cash flow are translated at average exchange rates during the period being reported upon, and assets and liabilities are translated at the unified exchange rate as quoted by the People's Bank of China on the balance sheet date. Translation adjustments resulting from this process are included in other comprehensive income. For the years ended November 30, 2016 and 2015, foreign currency translation adjustments of $(1,455,633) and $(315,020), respectively, have been reported as other comprehensive loss in the consolidated statement of income and comprehensive income (loss). The loss during year ended November 30, 2016 was primarily due to devaluation of the PRC currency of approximately 3.5% in August 2015 and further devaluations aggregating 7.5% through November 2016. Additional devaluations could occur in the future and affect our results.  RMB is not freely convertible into the currency of other nations. All such exchange transactions must take place through authorized institutions. There is, therefore, no guarantee the RMB amounts could have been, or could be, converted into US dollars at the rates used in translation. Substantially all of our assets are located in the PRC which makes it difficult for any funds to be utilized outside the PRC.  Results of Operations for the Year Ended November 30, 2015 Compared with the Year Ended November 30, 2014  The following table sets forth key components of our results of operations during the years ended November 30, 2015 and 2014, and the percentage changes between 2015 and 2014.   November 30, November 30, 2015 2014 Change (US $) (US $) % Revenue $ 4,184,255 $ 2,368,016 77 % Cost of Sales (1,186,461 ) (725,449 ) 64 % Gross profit 2,997,794 1,642,567 83 % Selling and marketing expenses 836,040 473,670 77 % General and administrative expenses 528,627 150,154 252 % Total operating expenses 1,364,667 623,824 119 % Income from operations 1,633,127 1,018,743 60 % Other income 13,508 2,900 366 % Income before provision for income taxes 1,646,635 1,021,643 61 % Provision for income taxes 457,922 264,553 73 % Net income before noncontrolling interests 1,188,713 757,090 57 % Noncontrolling interests (61,790 ) (38,952 ) 59 % Net income attributable to common stockholders $ 1,126,923 $ 718,138 57 %  Sales. Our sales increased to $4,184,255 for the year ended November 30, 2015 from $2,368,016 for the year ended November 30, 2014, an increase of $1,816,239 or 77%. In addition to the beneficial effects of our marketing efforts, the primary causes of the increase were:  ? Increased demand for our products allowed us to implement a 30% increase in our wholesale prices. Our average unit price in and before March 2014 was $81 (RMB 500) and increased to $105 (RMB 650) from April 2014.  ? During the first half of fiscal 2014, our sales were made exclusively from the head office, mostly to wholesale customers but with modest retail sales. During the latter part of fiscal 2014, we increased retail sales from our head office and opened our first physical store in Chancheng. In June 2015, we opened a second store in Xiamen. In October 2015, we opened a third store in Changsha. Retail sales were 30% and 18% of total sales for the years ended November 30, 2015 and 2014. The retail average unit selling price during fiscal 2015 was $222 (RMB 1,380).  The following table shows the source of our revenue in the comparable periods:   Year ended Nov. 30, 2015 Year Ended Nov. 30, 2014 Sales % of total Sales % of total Office wholesale $ 2,945,440 70 % $ 1,930,057 82 % Office retail 505,406 12 % 380,368 16 % Changcheng store retail 621,025 15 % 57,591 2 % Xiamen store retail 93,618 2 % - 0 % Changsha store retail 18,766 <1 % - 0 % $ 4,184,255 100 % $ 2,368,016 100 %  Gross profit. Our cost of sales increased during the two years ended November 30, 2015 due to increased unit prices paid to our manufacturers. Although our cost for "Organic Selenium Powder" increased by 44% in April 2014, the increase in cost for our two best selling products was less than the 30% overall increase in our sales price: our unit purchase price for the "Xikang Capsule" increased by 22% to $35; the unit purchase price of our "Xizhi Capsule" increased by 25% to $32. Therefore, our gross profit margin increased by 2% to 71.6% for the year ended November 30, 2015.  Selling expenses. Our selling expenses increased by 77% to $836,040 for the year ended November 30, 2015 from $473,670 for the year ended November 30, 2014. Our selling expenses will not increase in strict proportion to an increase in sales, because a large component of our selling expenses is a fixed license fee that we pay to the Shandong Academy of Agriculture for use of the selenium formulae developed by the Academy. On the other hand, our selling expenses include rent, transportation expenses, advertising expenses and salaries incurred for the sales function, all of which will tend to increase as our sales increase. In addition, one specific reason for the increase in our selling expenses was the opening of our retail stores in Foshan, Xiamen and Changsha since September 2014.  General and administrative expenses. Our general and administrative ("G&A") expenses increased by 252% to $528,627 for the year ended November 30, 2015 from $150,154 for the year ended November 30, 2014. The largest components of our G&A expenses are the salaries of administrative personnel and government-mandated benefits provided to all of our staff. The change in G&A expenses from year to year occurred primarily as a result of the expansion of our business in the past year, as reflected in the growth of our sales.  Pre-tax income. Because our operating expenses increased at a faster rate than our gross profit during the year ended November 30, 2015, our operating income increased by only 60%, to $1,633,127 in the year ended November 30, 2015 from $1,018,743 in the year ended November 30, 2014, respectively, less than the 83% increase in our gross profit.  As we have very little debt, our only other income consisted entirely of interest income earned on our bank balances: $13,508 and $2,900 during the years ended November 30, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Our pre-tax income, therefore, was $1,646,635 and $ 1,021,643 for the years ended November 30, 2015 and 2014 respectively.  Net income. Due to the 61% increase in our pre-tax income for year ended November 30, 2015, our provision for income taxes increased to $457,922 for the year ended November 30, 2015 from $264,553 for the year ended November 30, 2014. Our effective tax rate was the same as the statutory rate of 25% for the years ended November 30, 2015 and 2014. After deducting the provision for income taxes and noncontrolling interests, China Gewang reported net income before noncontrolling interests of $1,188,713 and $757,090 for the years ended November 30, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Because the VIE Agreements assigned to Gewang Selenium only 95% of the net income of Guangdong Gewang, we recorded a deduction for noncontrolling interests, after which our net income attributable to common stockholders was $1,126,923 ($0.02 per share) for the year ended November 30, 2015 and $718,138 ($0.02 per share) for the year ended November 30, 2014.  Foreign Currency Translation Adjustment. For the years ended November 30, 2015 and 2014, foreign currency translation adjustments of $(315,020) and $1,333, respectively, have been reported as other comprehensive income (loss) in the consolidated statement of income and comprehensive income (loss). The loss during year ended November 30, 2015 was primarily due to devaluation of the PRC currency of approximately 3.5% in August 2015. Additional devaluations could occur in the future and affect our results.  RMB is not freely convertible into the currency of other nations. All such exchange transactions must take place through authorized institutions. There is, therefore, no guarantee the RMB amounts could have been, or could be, converted into US dollars at the rates used in translation. Substantially all of our assets are located in the PRC which makes it difficult for any funds to be utilized outside the PRC.  Liquidity and Capital Resources  We have financed our operations primarily through cash flows from operations and sale of our common stock. As a result, at November 30, 2016, our only debt was $237,639 in loans from a stockholder and $228,238 in loans from a third party, all of which consisted of US Dollars loaned to pay our administrative expenses in the U.S.  During the year ended November 30, 2016, the increase in our working capital was approximately equal to the sum of our net income for the period less net income attributable to the increase in value of our investment in Guangdong Tianmei, supplemented by the proceeds of two private placements of common stock (together generating net proceeds of $9,848,200). Our working capital as of November 30, 2016 was $25,145,721, which represented an increase of $16,256,017 during fiscal year 2016. The approximation of our net income from the operations of Guangdong Gewang (plus capital paid-in during the period) to the increase in our working capital occurs because our operations, which involve no manufacturing and limited real estate, require very modest capital investments and, as a result, almost all of our assets (other than our investment in Guangdong Tianmei) and all of our liabilities are current. Until we further implement our plan to open a series of dedicated retail stores, which will add depreciable capital assets to our balance sheet, net income should continue to increase our working capital.  For the same reasons, during the year ended November 30, 2015, the increase in working capital was approximately equal to the sum of our net income for the year and the proceeds of a private placement of common stock for $5,000,000. Our working capital as of November 30, 2015 was $8,889,704, which represented an increase of $5,839,436 during the fiscal year then ended.  For the year ended November 30, 2016, our principal investing activity was the purchase of a 30% interest in Tianmei Australia for $995,811. In addition, we purchased equipment for $123,352. Our investing cash flows for the years ended November 30, 2015 and 2014 consisted of the purchase of fixed assets for $52,485 and $6,676, respectively. As we develop our physical presence by investing in retail stores, cash used in investing activities will increase, and may require expansion of our cash flows from financing activities.  For the years ended November 30, 2016 and 2015, our financing activities provided $9,848,200 and $5,000,000, respectively, which represented the proceeds of two private placements of our common stock during fiscal year 2016 and one during fiscal year 2015. We had no financing activities during the year ended November 30, 2014.  During the year ended November 30, 2016, although we recorded net income of $13,574,670, our operations used $2,835,968 in net cash. The primary reasons for the difference were:  ? Our net income included $4,536,760 attributable to our investment in Guangdong Tianmei, which represents our 30% equity interest in the net income of Guangdong Tianmei for the year.  ? The marked increase in our sales volume during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 caused our accounts receivable balance at November 30, 2016 to significantly increase by approximately $10,937,143. All of these receivables have been collected since the fiscal year-end.  ? In anticipation of further growth, we increased the balance of our prepaid expenses by $5,338,682, to assure delivery of inventories as needed. Included in that amount was $4,929,890 in promotion fees prepaid to certain of our distributors. Those prepaid fees will be amortized over the terms of our distribution agreements.  These uses of cash were partially offset by a $3,367,174 increase in our accounts payable and a $725,217 increase in our tax payable, both of which reflect the growth in our operations.  In contrast, during the year ended November 30, 2015, when the level of our operations was modest, our operations yielded $1,188,713 in net income and provided $1,037,620 in cash, as the increase in our accounts receivable during that year was modest. Likewise, our operations for the year ended November 30, 2014 yielded $793,656 in net income and provided $728,904 in cash.  We have no long-term debt or any debt other than to our shareholder. Our most significant capital commitments for the next year are:  ? Our greatest capital commitments in the long term are our quarterly payments to the Academy for a selenium enrichment technology and research research related to advanced selenium-enrichment techniques. Currently, we have committed to paying the Academy RMB 600,000 (US$86,724) per year for the next four years for selenium-enrichment technology and RMB 4,000,000 (US$578,160) quarterly for research related to advanced selenium-enrichment techniques for the next ten years. We expect to fund these fees from operations.  ? In the short term, over the next year we expect to renew all of our current leases, which will require prepayment of RMB 2,820,000 (US$407,603), which we expect to pay from operations. We also hope to open up to 26 new retail stores, which will require a capital commitment of US$2,309,000.  ? During fiscal year 2016 we expended $4,607,301 on promotion fees to distributors. These fees are generally paid up front on an annual basis. Because of the increase in our sales, which we believe has resulted in part from our sales team seeking out new wholesale customers and paying these promotion fees, we plan to spend more on promotion fees in the upcoming fiscal year. We have projected that we could spend up to RMB 58,104,000 (US$8,398,000) in promotion fees in the 2017 fiscal year.  We have ample cash and our operations are profitable. In addition, we expect our recent success in collecting our entire accounts receivable balance within 60 days to be replicated, due to our close relationship with our customers. For these reasons, we do not anticipate incurring significant additional debt. Therefore, our liquidity should be adequate to sustain the full implementation of our business plan for at least the next twelve months and the foreseeable future. We intend to apply a portion of our cash resources to an increase in the number of distributors with which we have relationships. Since the settlement period for payment of invoices by the distributors is, in some cases, as long as 90 days, our cash resources will be needed to offset the gap between the cash collections and cash payments.  Application of Critical Accounting Policies  In preparing our financial statements, we are required to formulate working policies regarding valuation of our assets and liabilities and to develop estimates of those values. In our preparation of the financial statements for fiscal 2016, there was one estimate made which was (a) subject to a high degree of uncertainty and (b) material to our results:  ? The determination, described in Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements, to record as an asset the full value of prepaid promotional fees totaling $4,275,602 included in our prepaid expenses at November 30, 2016. The determination was based on our prior experience with the distributors to whom the fees were paid and our expectation of the continuation of those relationships.  We made no material changes to our critical accounting policies in connection with the preparation of financial statements for fiscal 2016.  Operating Segments  We have performed an internal analysis to identify the our reportable operating segments. Various factors were assessed and we concluded that all streams of revenue use the same resources (management, HR, fixed assets, advertising, etc.). The chief operating decision maker is only provided with a breakdown of wholesale and retail revenues. Due to the operations and management being the same for both revenue streams, we believe that segmental reporting is not required.  Impact of Recent Accounting Pronouncements  . . .

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
