The goal of Cancer Prevention Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (CPP) is to develop “prevention therapies” for people with elevated risk for cancer.
CPP’s approach is: “Don’t wait until you get cancer. Treat the risk factors.”
Treating risk factors has saved lives in heart disease, neurovascular disease, and infectious diseases; but has yet to be applied to cancer.
We were founded by some of the most highly respected leaders in preclinical and clinical cancer prevention research. The CPP team has well over 100 years of combined drug development, research, and commercialization experience. We work closely with the National Cancer Institute (NCI), the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) to make prevention therapies a reality for those at-risk for cancer.




We believe the time is right to apply "Risk Reduction" paradigms to cancer
Potential to Impact Cancer Death Rates in a Significant Way
Lessons from cholesterol-lowering medicines, blood-pressure medicines, and vaccines.
Traditional chemotherapy and even newer "targeted therapy" appear to make only marginal improvements.
Biomarkers and Critical Path Initiative
The age of biomarkers and regulatory receptivity.
FDA receptive to surrogate endpoints such as high risk polyps and biomarkers.
Others are on the way.
Economics
Reimbursement rules are changing for expensive treatments with incremental improvements in survival.
"We can't afford not to prevent."

Cancer Prevention Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Key Developments

Cancer Prevention Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Launches Phase 2 Clinical Trial at Vanderbilt University Medical Center
Jul 17 17
Cancer Prevention Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (CPP) announced the launch of a Phase 2 clinical trial at Vanderbilt University Medical Center to evaluate CPP-1X in patients with precancerous gastric lesions who are at high risk for gastric cancer. The trial is funded by the National Cancer Institute (NCI) and run in collaboration with Keith T. Wilson, M.D., and Douglas R. Morgan, M.D., MPH, of Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, and the Vanderbilt-Ingram Cancer Center. This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled pharmaco-prevention trial will enroll 300 patients. Each patient will receive daily treatment for 18 months to determine the drug’s effectiveness in ameliorating DNA damage in patients with premalignant atrophic gastritis or intestinal metaplasia. This trial is an initial step in a program to determine if CPP-1X can prevent gastric cancer. CPP’s pharma partners have certain rights to CPP’s combination product CPP-1X/sulindac. CPP-1X as a standalone therapy is owned exclusively by CPP.

Sucampo Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Enters into Exclusive Option and Collaboration Agreement with Cancer Prevention Pharmaceuticals, Inc. for Development of Late-Stage Cpp-1X/Sulindac Combination for Familial Adenomatous Polyposis
Jan 11 16
Sucampo Pharmaceuticals, Inc. announced an option and collaboration agreement under which Cancer Prevention Pharmaceuticals, Inc. has granted Sucampo the sole option to acquire an exclusive license to commercialize CPP-1X/sulindac combination product in North America. This product is currently in a Phase 3 clinical trial for the treatment of familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP). There are currently no approved treatments for FAP and no other products in late-stage development. A genetic disease, FAP typically develops into colon cancer if left untreated. Current treatment paradigms require patients to undergo the progressive removal of colon and rectum, ongoing endoscopies of the GI tract, and additional surgery throughout life.  As a result, patients with FAP experience poor quality of life, inconvenience and significant cost.  FAP has been designated an orphan indication in the U.S. and Europe, with a prevalence of about 1 in 10,000, and approximately 30,000 cases currently in the United States. CPP-1X/sulindac oral combination product has demonstrated robust Phase 2 data in sporadic colon adenoma, additional evidence of efficacy in FAP with CPP-1X combinations, and has shown to be well-tolerated.  The ongoing Phase 3 study is a 150-patient, three-arm, double-blind, randomized trial of the combination agent and the single agent comparators.  Enrollment in the study is expected to be complete in the first half of 2016 and the trial is expected to conclude in 2018, with potential for approval in 2019.  In addition, co-formulation activities are ongoing.  The product also has additional opportunities in sporadic colon adenoma therapy (CAT), which is currently in a Phase 3 clinical trial with the National Cancer Institute and SWOG (formerly Southwest Oncology Group), as well as other potential GI and oncology indications. Under the terms of the agreement, Sucampo will invest $5.0 million in CPP in the form of a convertible note, with a planned additional $5.0 million equity investment in CPP’s next qualified financing, which will be either an IPO or a private financing as defined by the agreement.  In addition, Sucampo will pay CPP an option fee of up to $7.5 million, payable in two tranches.  CPP will complete the ongoing Phase 3 trial under the oversight of a joint steering committee.  Upon exercise of its exclusive option, Sucampo would acquire an exclusive license to the product and would be obligated to pay CPP up to an aggregate of $190 million in license fees and milestone payments upon the achievement of specified clinical development and sales milestones.  Under the terms of the license, Sucampo and CPP would share equally in profits from the sale of approved products.

We estimate that we will receive net proceeds of approximately $14.2 million (or
approximately $16.5 million if the underwriters’ exercise their over-allotment
option in full) from the sale of the shares of common stock offered by us in
this offering, based on an assumed initial public offering price of $13.00 per
share (the mid-point of the price range set forth on the cover page of this
prospectus), and after deducting the estimated underwriting discounts and
commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us. A $1.00 increase
(decrease) in the assumed initial public offering price of $13.00 per share
would increase (decrease) the net proceeds to us from this offering by
approximately $1.2 million, assuming that the number of shares offered by us, as
set forth on the cover page of this prospectus, remains the same and after
deducting the estimated underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated
offering expenses payable by us. Similarly, a 250,000 share increase (decrease)
in the number of shares offered by us, as set forth on the cover of this
prospectus, would increase (decrease) the net proceeds to us by $3.0 million,
assuming the assumed initial public offering price of $13.00 per share (the
mid-point of the price range set forth on the cover of this prospectus) remains
the same, and after deducting estimated underwriting discounts and commissions
and estimated offering expenses payable by us.

The principal purposes of this offering are to obtain additional capital to
support our operations, to create a public market for our common stock and to
facilitate our future access to the public equity markets. We anticipate that we
will use the net proceeds from this offering for the following purposes:

• up to $10.0 million (or possibly more, depending on the extent of funding  
  available from current agreements with Tillotts and Sucampo) to support our
  Phase 3 clinical trial of CPP-1X/sul for FAP as currently contemplated and 
  additional studies necessary for filing an NDA with the FDA; provided that,
  the completion of this Phase 3 clinical trial will depend on the extent of 
  funding available from additional sources, including current agreements    
  with Tillotts and Sucampo;                             

• up to $1.0 million (or possibly more, depending on the extent of funding   
  available from current agreements with Tillotts and Sucampo) to support our
  efforts developing other indications for CPP-1X/sul, to advance any        
  additional product candidates that we select, to expand our internal       
  research and development capabilities to explore new product candidates. We
  currently intend to use a portion of such proceeds to continue to support  
  the following research and development initiatives: (i) a Phase 1          
  investigator-sponsored clinical trial for early onset of type 1 diabetes,  
  which we expect to support through completion of Phase 1 by contributing   
  drug supply and scientific and regulatory support; (ii) Phase 1 NANT study 
  in relapsed refractory neuroblastoma, which we expect to support through   
  completion of Phase 1 by contributing drug supply, scientific and          
  regulatory support and bioanalytical testing support; and (iii) a gastric  
  cancer prevention study with Vanderbilt University, which we expect to     
  support through completion of Phase 2a by contributing drug supply,        
  scientific and regulatory support and bioanalytical testing support; and   

• the remainder to fund working capital and for other general corporate 
  purposes, including for costs and expenses associated with being a public  
  company.                                                                   

We may also use a portion of the net proceeds from this offering to in-license,
acquire, or invest in complementary businesses, technologies, products or
assets.

Our expected use of net proceeds from this offering represents our current
intentions based upon our present plans and business condition. Our primary use
of proceeds is for completion of our Phase 3 clinical trial of CPP-1X/sul for
FAP and if it should require additional funding beyond the estimates above, we
will likely terminate our support of the other research and development referred
to above. As of the date of this prospectus, we cannot predict with certainty
all of the particular uses for the net proceeds to be received upon the
completion of this offering, or the amounts that we will actually spend on the
uses set forth above. We may find it necessary or advisable to reallocate the
net proceeds of this offering; however any such reallocation would be
substantially limited to the categories set forth above as we do not intend to
use the net proceeds for other purposes. The amounts and timing of our actual
use of the net proceeds will vary depending on numerous factors. As a result,
our management will have broad discretion in the application of the net 
proceeds, and investors will be relying on our judgment regarding the
application of the net proceeds from this offering.

Pending their use, we plan to invest the net proceeds from this offering in
short- and intermediate-term, interest-bearing obligations, investment-grade
instruments, certificates of deposit or direct or guaranteed obligations of the
U.S. government.


There are a growing number of biotechnology companies in this space and a few
large pharmaceutical companies with internal programs.

Universities and public and private research institutions are also potential
competitors. While these organizations primarily have educational objectives,
they may develop proprietary technologies related to the drug delivery field or
secure protection that we may need for development of our technologies and
products. We may attempt to license one or more of these proprietary
technologies, but these licenses may not be available to us on acceptable terms,
if at all.

Some of our competitors have substantially greater resources and experience,
manufacturing capabilities, regulatory expertise, sales and marketing resources,
and established collaborative arrangements with pharmaceutical companies. Our 
competitors, either alone or with their collaboration partners, may succeed in 
developing product candidates that are similar or preferable in effectiveness, 
safety, cost and ease of commercialization, and our competitors may obtain IP 
protection or commercialize competitive products sooner than we do.

We evaluate the competition for our products within each individual market
segment it is pursuing:

FAP — We believe four companies are currently developing treatments for FAP:
Marina Biotech, Inc., SLA Pharma AG, Thetis Pharmaceuticals, LLC, and
StemSynergy Therapeutics, Inc.

• Marina Biotech is developing an RNAi-based therapeutic targeted to a 
  B-catenin. They have received orphan drug status for the use of their CEQ508 
  for the treatment of FAP. This program has not yet entered clinical trials and
  we believe is well behind our own stage of development.         

• SLA Pharma AG, a U.K.-based company, is developing a purified “fish oil” 
  product to treat polyposis. In clinical studies, this agent has been shown to
  reduce polyposis by 20 – 25%, which is equivalent to a past Celecoxib paradigm
  that did not achieve market success.                              

• Thetis Pharmaceuticals, LLC is developing an oral chemoprevention therapy for 
  FAP (TP-252), which is a derivative of eicosapentaenoic acid (“EPA”) in the 
  free fatty acid form to minimize the occurrence and recurrence of problematic 
  polyps associated with FAP. According to Thetis, the potential efficacy of 
  TP-252 for treatment of FAP was demonstrated in a randomized, 
  placebo-controlled trial conducted by SLA Pharma using 2 grams per day of EPA
  as the free fatty acid (EPA-FFA) for 6 months in patients with FAP. In the SLA
  study, polyp number, polyp size and overall polyp burden all decreased after 
  treatment.                                                 

• StemSynergy Therapeutics has published results of preclinical studies with a 
  pyrvinium agent that are relevant to FAP and in January 2015 was granted 
  “orphan” drug status for pyrvinium in the treatment of FAP.                

CAT — We currently know of no other companies that are developing CAT drugs.
Celecoxib, sulindac, aspirin, folic acid, other NSAIDs, other nutritional
supplements and “lifestyle” approaches, however, continue to be studied in large
multi-centered trials.

NB — To our knowledge, there has never been a pharmaceutical agent approved for
preventing relapse in NB. There are a number of experimental agents that have
been, or continue to be, tested in this indication. The most promising and
advanced experimental offering appears to be a chimerical antibody (ch 14.18)
developed by the National Institutes of Health (“NIH”)-funded Children’s
Oncology Group. This agent has shown success in a Phase 3 clinical trial as an
NB treatment, yielding 20% improvement in subsequent relapses compared to a
placebo. United Therapeutics licensed this drug from the NCI and recently
received FDA approval. Other therapeutics in development for NB include
Nifurtimox and an anti-GD2 antibody (3F8). The latter has been tested
exclusively at Memorial Sloan-Kettering for many years.

We believe that the lack of commercial drug development efforts in our
concentrated spaces are likely the result of regulatory challenges for orphan
pediatric indications like Neuroblastoma, coupled with the small incidence
relative to other indications.


Company Description
We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company formed primarily to develop
and commercialize therapeutic agents for the treatment and prevention of certain
pre-cancerous conditions, orphan diseases (i.e., rare diseases) and
gastrointestinal conditions. We have achieved target enrollment in our


 Phase 3
clinical trial with our product candidate CPP-1X/sul for the treatment of
familial adenomatous polyposis (“FAP”), a rare inherited condition that can
cause the growth of thousands of colorectal adenomas (i.e., adenomatous polyps),
which are recognized as a key risk factor for colon cancer, and we are a
regulatory and commercial collaborator in a Phase 3 clinical trial funded by the
National Cancer Institute (the “NCI”) for the study of colon cancer risk
reduction and colon adenoma therapy (“CAT”), a preventative treatment approach
for survivors of colorectal cancer or those who have high-risk colon polyps. In
addition, our therapeutic agent has been used in several investigator-sponsored
trials and company-sponsored preclinical trials including: (1) Phase 1 and Phase
2 investigator-sponsored clinical trials for the treatment of Neuroblastoma
(“Neuroblastoma” or “NB”), a particularly deadly cancer affecting children,
funded by nonprofit organizations; (2) Phase 1 investigator-sponsored clinical
trial for the treatment of early-onset type 1 diabetes funded by the Juvenile
Diabetes Research Foundation; (3) Phase 2a investigator-sponsored clinical trial
expected to be initiated this year for treatment of gastric cancer funded by the
NCI; and (4) preclinical studies that we have sponsored in the orphan disease
and cancer fields.

Our lead investigational new drug product, CPP-1X/sul, is a combination of the
polyamine synthesis inhibitor CPP-1X (also known as eflornithine or
difluoromethylornithine (“DFMO”)) and the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug
sulindac. We believe our investigational drug is unique in that it is designed
to treat the risk factors (e.g., polyps) that are hypothesized to lead to colon
cancer and therefore may have the ability to prevent various types of colon
cancer. Unlike other therapies used to treat FAP and for use with CAT,
CPP-1X/sul is an oral, non-surgical and non-invasive option that, we believe,
has the potential to both improve patients’ quality of life and reduce the
sizeable expenses associated with current treatment protocols.

CPP-1X/sul and CPP-1X have received orphan drug designation status for FAP in
the United States and Europe. In addition, we have received orphan drug
designation status for CPP-1X as a single agent for Neuroblastoma in the United
States and Europe and for gastric cancer in the United States. We are also
pursuing orphan drug designation status for CPP-1X as a single agent for gastric
cancer in Europe. By targeting and treating precursor conditions to colorectal
cancer (“CRC”), our product candidates address an important and largely unmet
medical need, with a market opportunity that we believe is between $300 and $800
million in the United States and the European Union for FAP (based on internal
studies of the U.S. and E.U. market and an external study conducted by
Bridgehead International with respect to certain countries in Europe, we
conducted an analysis of potential pricing scenarios in which we considered,
among other factors, the higher cost to patients for cancer care in the U.S.
compared to the E.U., the worldwide prevalence rate reported by several peer
reviewed journals, pricing of orphan drugs and of new oncology related
therapies, current estimated costs of caring for FAP patients and potential
health care system savings due to the elimination and/or reduction of surgical
and surveillance procedures, reduced doctor visits and end-stage disease costs)
and $1 billion for CAT (based on a modest fraction of the estimated 600,000
prevalence in the United States reported by the American Cancer Society and
pricing scenarios similar to FAP). Both of the principal active ingredients in
our investigational drug candidates (eflornithine and sulindac) have been
previously approved individually but not in combination for other uses by the
U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”) and have shown limited side
effects at the dosages we are studying. Eflornithine, the active ingredient in
CPP-1X, has never been approved in oral form, is not on the market in any
systemic dosage form, and is not available in any generic form. The combination
of eflornithine and sulindac delivered in an oral form, to which we have
exclusive license rights to commercialize from the Arizona Board of Regents of
the University of Arizona (the “University of Arizona”) and which we refer to as
our “Combination Therapy,” showed promising results in an NCI supported
randomized, placebo-controlled Phase 2/3 clinical trial to prevent recurrent
colon adenomas — particularly high-risk pre-cancerous polyps. It is our
understanding that the reduction of adenoma occurrence demonstrated in the
eflornithine/sulindac Phase 2/3 clinical trial is the largest seen in any
similar prevention trial to date (this understanding is based on peer reviewed
journals and neither the FDA nor any other regulatory agency has formally
evaluated this conclusion).

We have achieved target enrollment in our 150 patient double-blind randomized
Phase 3 clinical trial for the use of CPP-1X/sul in the treatment of FAP. The
trial, conducted at 21 sites in North America and Europe, is being partially
funded by the proceeds of a co-development and license agreement we entered into
with Tillotts Pharma AG (“Tillotts”), a subsidiary of Zeria Pharmaceuticals
Company, Ltd. (“Zeria”) and the proceeds of the option and collaboration
agreement and securities purchase agreement that we entered into with Sucampo
AG, a wholly owned subsidiary of Sucampo Pharmaceuticals, Inc., which is a
global biopharmaceutical company (“Sucampo”), on January 9, 2016. The agreement
with Tillotts provides Tillotts with European and Japanese rights to develop and
commercialize the combination of CPP-1X/sul for the treatment of FAP and other
gastrointestinal conditions. The option and collaboration agreement with Sucampo
provides Sucampo with an option to enter into an exclusive license to develop
and commercialize the combination of CPP-1X/sul in North America for the
treatment, prevention and diagnosis of human diseases and conditions.

In addition, we have also sponsored with the NCI a Phase 3 clinical trial for
the use of CPP-1X/sul to prevent the recurrence of colon cancer or high-risk
adenoma. A grant award made to SWOG funds and supports this Phase 3 clinical
trial, which has been initiated and seeks a target enrollment of 1,340 colon
cancer patients at SWOG’s large network of clinical sites throughout the United
States. SWOG is a NCI sponsored cancer research cooperative group that designs
and conducts multidisciplinary clinical trials to improve the practice of 
medicine in preventing, detecting, and treating cancer, and to enhance the 
quality of life for cancer survivors. SWOG has been awarded this grant by the 
NCI as a member of the NCI National Clinical Trials Network. We have also 
supported investigator sponsored trials using CPP-1X for NB and there are 
several of these clinical studies currently enrolling and treating patients.

According to United States Cancer Statistics published by the American Cancer
Society, in the United States in 2015, it is estimated that CRC will be the
third most commonly occurring cancer among males and females and the third
leading cause of cancer-related deaths. High-risk adenomatous polyps are
considered the key risk factor for CRC. In 2015, the disease will be responsible
for an estimated 49,700 deaths in the United States. An even higher rate of
incidence occurs in the European Union, where approximately 152,000 people per
year die from CRC according to the Globocan 2012 Fact Sheets.

Cancer Prevention Pharmaceuticals files S-1 for $29 M IPO on the NYSE

					Posted on Thu/31/DecemberFri/25/March  by AZBio 


Colorectal cancer biotech Cancer Prevention Pharmaceuticals files for a $29 million IPO
Cancer Prevention Pharmaceuticals, which is developing treatments for colorectal cancer risk factors, filed on December 23, 2015 with the SEC to raise up to $29 million in an initial public offering.

The goal of Cancer Prevention Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (CPP) is to develop “prevention therapies” for people with elevated risk for cancer. CPP’s approach is: “Don’t wait until you get cancer. Treat the risk factors.”
Treating risk factors has saved lives in heart disease, neurovascular disease, and infectious diseases; but has yet to be applied to cancer. Founded by some of the most highly respected leaders in preclinical and clinical cancer prevention research, the CPP team has well over 100 years of combined drug development, research, and commercialization experience. CPP works  closely with the National Cancer Institute (NCI), the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) to make prevention therapies a reality for those at-risk for cancer.

Cancer Prevention’s S-1 states plans to use the proceeds of the offering to fund clinical trials, develop additional product candidates and fund working capital and general corporate purposes.
The company lists Meyskens Pharmaceutical Investors, Gerner Pharmaceutical Investors, Tierney Family Trust and Arizona based Translational Accelerator LLC as its principal stockholders.
Cancer Prevention’s new drug product is designed to treat the risk factors that lead to colon cancer and may have the ability to prevent various types of colon cancer.

Sucampo Enters Into Exclusive Option and Collaboration Agreement With Cancer Prevention Pharmaceuticals for Development of Late-Stage CPP-1X/Sulindac Combination for Familial Adenomatous Polyposis

Addresses Significant Patient Need Aligned With GI Expertise, Strategic Focus Phase 3 Study Expected to be Complete in 2018 ROCKVILLE, Md., Jan.  11, 2016  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Sucampo Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Sucampo) (NASDAQ:SCMP), a global biopharmaceutical company, today announced an option and collaboration agreement under which Cancer Prevention Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (CPP) has granted Sucampo the sole option to acquire an exclusive license to commercialize CPP-1X/sulindac combination product in North America.  This product is currently in a Phase 3 clinical trial for the treatment of familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP). “We are very excited to enter into this agreement with Cancer Prevention Pharmaceuticals, as it aligns with our vision to acquire late-stage programs with the potential to have a significant impact on patient lives,” said Peter Greenleaf, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Sucampo.  “We believe that this product represents a substantial market opportunity and, given clinical results to date, could be a valuable asset for Sucampo that leverages our gastrointestinal expertise and strategic focus.” There are currently no approved treatments for FAP and no other products in late-stage development.  A genetic disease, FAP typically develops into colon cancer if left untreated.  Current treatment paradigms require patients to undergo the progressive removal of colon and rectum, ongoing endoscopies of the GI tract, and additional surgery throughout life.  As a result, patients with FAP experience poor quality of life, inconvenience and significant cost.  FAP has been designated an orphan indication in the U.S. and Europe, with a prevalence of about 1 in 10,000, and approximately 30,000 cases currently in the United States. CPP-1X/sulindac oral combination product has demonstrated robust Phase 2 data in sporadic colon adenoma, additional evidence of efficacy in FAP with CPP-1X combinations, and has shown to be well-tolerated.  The ongoing Phase 3 study is a 150-patient, three-arm, double-blind, randomized trial of the combination agent and the single agent comparators.  Enrollment in the study is expected to be complete in the first half of 2016 and the trial is expected to conclude in 2018, with potential for approval in 2019.  In addition, co-formulation activities are ongoing.  The product also has additional opportunities in sporadic colon adenoma therapy (CAT), which is currently in a Phase 3 clinical trial with the National Cancer Institute and SWOG (formerly Southwest Oncology Group), as well as other potential GI and oncology indications. Under the terms of the agreement, Sucampo will invest $5.0 million in CPP in the form of a convertible note, with a planned additional $5.0 million equity investment in CPP’s next qualified financing, which will be either an IPO or a private financing as defined by the agreement.  In addition, Sucampo will pay CPP an option fee of up to $7.5 million, payable in two tranches.  CPP will complete the ongoing Phase 3 trial under the oversight of a joint steering committee.  Upon exercise of its exclusive option, Sucampo would acquire an exclusive license to the product and would be obligated to pay CPP up to an aggregate of $190 million in license fees and milestone payments upon the achievement of specified clinical development and sales milestones.  Under the terms of the license, Sucampo and CPP would share equally in profits from the sale of approved products. About FAP Familial Adenomatous Polyposis (FAP) is a rare hereditary disease characterized by cancer of the colon and rectum. Patients with the classic presentation of FAP begin to develop multiple benign polyps in the colon in their early teenage years.  Eventually, the colon becomes covered with hundreds to thousands of polyps that typically become cancerous if left untreated. Current medical practice recommends the removal of the colon and sometimes the rectum in the formative years for the typical FAP patient.  CPP’s lead product candidate, CPP-1X/sulindac, is being developed to minimize the occurrence and/or recurrence of polyps and tumors associated with FAP and offers the potential of a non-surgical pharmacopreventive therapy across the spectrum of FAP patients. About Sucampo Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Sucampo Pharmaceuticals, Inc. is focused on the development and commercialization of medicines that meet major unmet medical needs of patients worldwide.  Sucampo has one marketed product – AMITIZA – and a pipeline of product candidates in clinical development.

CPP’s approach has been used with great success in other disease categories such as cardiovascular, neurovascular and infectious disease.  CPP is co-sponsoring a large Phase 3 trial in colon cancer survivors (with NCI and SWOG) and a Phase 3 clinical trial in patients with Familial Adenomatous Polyposis (FAP).  CPP is also working collaboratively with non-profit groups to support their clinical trials in neuroblastoma (childhood cancer) for the prevention of relapse, in gastric cancer, and in early-onset type 1 diabetes.

These statements are based on management's current expectations and involve risks and uncertainties, which may cause results to differ materially from those set forth in the statements. The forward-looking statements include statements regarding Sucampo’s option agreement with CPP, including financial terms of a potential license agreement, and the expected timing of clinical trials. The following factors, among others, could cause actual results to differ from those set forth in the forward-looking statements: the impact of pharmaceutical industry regulation and health care legislation; the ability of Sucampo to successfully develop and commercialize product candidates; Sucampo's ability to accurately predict future market conditions; and the exposure to litigation and/or regulatory actions. No forward-looking statement can be guaranteed and actual results may differ materially from those projected. Sucampo undertakes no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise. Forward-looking statements in this press release should be evaluated together with the many uncertainties that affect Sucampo's business, particularly those mentioned in the risk factors and cautionary statements in Sucampo's most recent Form 10-K as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 9, 2015 as well as its filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Forms 8-K and 10-Q since the filing of the Form 10-K, all of which Sucampo incorporates by reference. Contact:

Cancer Prevention Pharma Files for a $29 Million IPO  











Tweet








12/23/2015 7:24:41 AM




December 23, 2015

By Alex Keown, BioSpace.com Breaking News Staff

TUCSON, Ariz. – Arizona-based Cancer Prevention Pharmaceuticals, Inc., a company developing therapeutics that reduce the risk of cancer, filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to raise up to $29 million in an initial public offering, IPO Investment Manager Renaissance Capital announced this morning.

Cancer Prevention Pharmaceuticals, had sales of $4 million for the 12 months that ended Sept. 30. The company, which was founded in 2009, plans to list on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol CPP.   Aegis Capital Corp. is the sole bookrunner on the deal, Renaissance Capital posted. No pricing terms were disclosed.

Currently Cancer Prevention Pharmaceuticals is currently sponsoring a Phase III double-blind trial studying the efficacy and safety of the experimental CPP-1X/sulindac (eflornithine/sulindac) compared with CPP-1X and sulindac as single agents in 150 patients with Familial Adenomatous Polyposis. Each patient will undergo daily treatment for two years to minimize the occurrence and/or recurrence of problematic polyps and tumors associated with the debilitating disease. CPP began enrolling patients for this trial earlier this month. CPP is working with Japan-based Zeria Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. in the development of CPP-1X/sulindac for the treatment of FAP. The company struck a development and commercialization deal with Zeria in early 2014 that could be worth up to $100 million.

FAP is an inherited disorder often characterized by cancer of the colon and rectum. The disease can begin as polyps forming in the large intestine that could become cancerous. Currently, there are no approved pharmacologic treatments for FAP. Often those with FAP must have their colon removed.

Cancer Prevention Pharmaceuticals is also studying its CPP-1X/sulindac for use in colon cancer risk reduction. That study is currently in a Phase III trial.

CPP is studying CPP-1X for therapeutic use in gastric cancer. That study is currently in Phase I trials.
In addition to its work with FAP, Cancer Prevention Pharmaceuticals is also working on therapies for neuroblastoma, a form of cancer that starts in certain types of very primitive developing nerve cells found in an embryo or fetus. This type of cancer occurs in infants and young children. It is rarely found in children older than 10. Based on preclinical and early phase studies, CPP’s lead product, CPP-1X, holds promise to treat/prevent tumors associated with neuroblastoma, the company said on its website. The company shows two Phase I clinical trials for neuroblastoma and one Phase II trial

CPP also has therapeutic prevention approaches for prostate cancer, breast cancer and skin cancers.

Peer Review Committees

	Experts and advocates in the field of cancer research, product development and cancer prevention are provisionally appointed to the peer review committees by CPRIT’s Chief Executive Officer and approved by the Oversight Committee. To minimize the potential for conflicts of interest in the review process, all research and prevention peer reviewers live and work outside of the state. Peer review members are assigned to panels in their area of expertise. At least one advocate reviewer is assigned to each panel.

	The review of all research, product development and prevention proposals are led by the Scientific Review Council, the Product Development Review Council and the Prevention Review Council.

	Reviewers are divided into three groups: product development reviewers, prevention reviewers and research reviewers.

Antioxidants and Cancer Prevention (Fact Sheet)

What are free radicals, and do they play a role in cancer development? 
Free radicals are highly reactive chemicals that have the potential to harm cells. They are created when an atom or a molecule (a chemical that has two or more atoms) either gains or loses an electron (a small negatively charged particle found in atoms). Free radicals are formed naturally in the body and play an important role in many normal cellular processes (1,2). At high concentrations, however, free radicals can be hazardous to the body and damage all major components of cells, including DNA, proteins, and cell membranes. The damage to cells caused by free radicals, especially the damage to DNA, may play a role in the development of cancer and other health conditions (1,2).
Abnormally high concentrations of free radicals in the body can be caused by exposure to ionizing radiation and other environmental toxins. When ionizing radiation hits an atom or a molecule in a cell, an electron may be lost, leading to the formation of a free radical. The production of abnormally high levels of free radicals is the mechanism by which ionizing radiation kills cells. Moreover, some environmental toxins, such as cigarette smoke, some metals, and high-oxygen atmospheres, may contain large amounts of free radicals or stimulate the body's cells to produce more free radicals.
Free radicals that contain the element oxygen are the most common type of free radicals produced in living tissue. Another name for them is “reactive oxygen species,” or “ROS” (1,2).
What are antioxidants?
Antioxidants are chemicals that interact with and neutralize free radicals, thus preventing them from causing damage. Antioxidants are also known as “free radical scavengers.”
The body makes some of the antioxidants it uses to neutralize free radicals. These antioxidants are called endogenous antioxidants. However, the body relies on external (exogenous) sources, primarily the diet, to obtain the rest of the antioxidants it needs. These exogenous antioxidants are commonly called dietary antioxidants. Fruits, vegetables, and grains are rich sources of dietary antioxidants. Some dietary antioxidants are also available as dietary supplements (1,3).
Examples of dietary antioxidants include beta-carotene, lycopene, and vitamins A, C, and E (alpha-tocopherol). The mineral element selenium is often thought to be a dietary antioxidant, but the antioxidant effects of selenium are most likely due to the antioxidant activity of proteins that have this element as an essential component (i.e., selenium-containing proteins), and not to selenium itself (4).
Can antioxidant supplements help prevent cancer?
In laboratory and animal studies, the presence of increased levels of exogenous antioxidants has been shown to prevent the types of free radical damage that have been associated with cancer development. Therefore, researchers have investigated whether taking dietary antioxidant supplements can help lower the risk of developing or dying from cancer in humans.
Many observational studies, including case–control studies and cohort studies, have been conducted to investigate whether the use of dietary antioxidant supplements is associated with reduced risks of cancer in humans. Overall, these studies have yielded mixed results (5). Because observational studies cannot adequately control for biases that might influence study outcomes, the results of any individual observational study must be viewed with caution.   
Randomized controlled clinical trials, however, lack most of the biases that limit the reliability of observational studies. Therefore, randomized trials are considered to provide the strongest and most reliable evidence of the benefit and/or harm of a health-related intervention. To date, nine randomized controlled trials of dietary antioxidant supplements for cancer prevention  have been conducted worldwide. Many of the trials were sponsored by the National Cancer Institute. The results of these nine trials are summarized following.    
Linxian General Population Nutrition Intervention Trial: This trial was the first large-scale randomized trial to investigate the effects of antioxidant supplements on cancer risk. In the trial, healthy Chinese men and women at increased risk of developing esophageal cancer and gastric cancer were randomly assigned to take a combination of 15 milligrams (mg) beta-carotene, 30 mg alpha-tocopherol, and 50 micrograms (μg) selenium daily for 5 years or to take no antioxidant supplements. The initial results of the trial showed that people who took antioxidant supplements had a lower risk of death from gastric cancer but not from esophageal cancer. However, their risks of developing gastric cancer and/or esophageal cancer were not affected by antioxidant supplementation (6).
In 2009, 15-year results from this trial were reported (10 years after antioxidant supplementation ended). In the updated results, a reduced risk of death from gastric cancer was no longer found for those who took antioxidant supplements compared with those who did not (7).

What is cancer?








Cancer is the uncontrolled growth of abnormal cells in the body. Cancer develops when the body’s normal control mechanism stops working. Old cells do not die and instead grow out of control, forming new, abnormal cells. These extra cells may form a mass of tissue, called a tumor. Some cancers, such as leukemia, do not form tumors.
What are the most common forms of cancer?
Cancer may occur anywhere in the body. In women, breast cancer is one of the most common. In men, it’s prostate cancer. Lung cancer and colorectal cancer affect both men and women in high numbers. 
There are five main categories of cancer:

Carcinomas begin in the skin or tissues that line the internal organs. 
Sarcomas develop in the bone, cartilage, fat, muscle or other connective tissues.
Leukemia begins in the blood and bone marrow.
Lymphomas start in the immune system.
Central nervous system cancers develop in the brain and spinal cord.

How is cancer treated?
Treatment options depend on the type of cancer, its stage, if the cancer has spread and your general health. The goal of treatment is to kill as many cancerous cells while reducing damage to normal cells nearby. Advances in technology make this possible.
The three main treatments are:

Surgery: directly removing the tumor 
Chemotherapy: using chemicals to kill cancer cells
Radiation therapy: using X-rays to kill cancer cells

The same cancer type in one individual is very different from that cancer in another individual. Within a single type of cancer, such as breast cancer, researchers are discovering subtypes that each requires a different treatment approach.
What can you do to manage the side effects of cancer treatment?
Supportive care services describe a broad range of therapies designed to combat side effects and maintain well-being. Treating cancer requires focusing on more than the disease alone; it must also address the pain, fatigue, depression and other side effects that come with it.
Supportive care services include:

Nutrition therapy to help prevent malnutrition and reduce side effects
Naturopathic medicine to use natural remedies to boost energy and reduce side effects
Oncology rehabilitation to rebuild strength and overcome some of the physical effects of treatment
Mind-body medicine to improve emotional well-being through counseling, stress management techniques and support groups

What does the future hold for cancer treatment?
The future of cancer treatment lies in providing patients with an even greater level of personalization. Doctors are beginning to offer treatment options based on the genetic changes occurring in a specific tumor.
An innovative new diagnostic tool, the genomic tumor assessment, examines a patient’s tumor genetically to identify the mechanism that caused the cancer. Genomic tumor assessment may result in a more personalized approach to cancer treatment.

CEO Jeff Jacob Talks About FAP Trial
learn more ›
















The goal of Cancer Prevention Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (CPP) is to develop “prevention therapies” for people with elevated risk for cancer.
CPP’s approach is: “Don’t wait until you get cancer. Treat the risk factors.”
Treating risk factors has saved lives in heart disease, neurovascular disease, and infectious diseases; but has yet to be applied to cancer.
We were founded by some of the most highly respected leaders in preclinical and clinical cancer prevention research. The CPP team has well over 100 years of combined drug development, research, and commercialization experience. We work closely with the National Cancer Institute (NCI), the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) to make prevention therapies a reality for those at-risk for cancer.




We believe the time is right to apply "Risk Reduction" paradigms to cancer
Potential to Impact Cancer Death Rates in a Significant Way
Lessons from cholesterol-lowering medicines, blood-pressure medicines, and vaccines.
Traditional chemotherapy and even newer "targeted therapy" appear to make only marginal improvements.
Biomarkers and Critical Path Initiative
The age of biomarkers and regulatory receptivity.
FDA receptive to surrogate endpoints such as high risk polyps and biomarkers.
Others are on the way.
Economics
Reimbursement rules are changing for expensive treatments with incremental improvements in survival.
"We can't afford not to prevent."
