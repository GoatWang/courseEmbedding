Insight Capital - Debt Collection Scam




Date Posted: Thursday, October 29, 2015
Updated: October 29, 2015

Originally posted: February 29, 2012


  Scammers posing as: Insight Capital, TTG Services 


The Washington State Department of Financial Institutions (DFI) warns consumers to verify the identity of anybody attempting to collect a debt.  DFI also warns consumers to verify that the debt that being collected is debt that the consumer actually owes.  DFI urges consumers to verify this information before making payment arrangements or giving nonpublic personal information to anybody attempting to collect a debt.  


DFI has received numerous complaints about what appears to be a debt collection scam.  Consumers report receiving phone calls from individuals claiming to collect debt owed to Insight Capital/TTG Services.  The consumers report that they do not owe debt to Insight Capital/TTG Services.  


The callers use harassing collection methods, including threats of criminal prosecution and threats to come to consumers’ places of employment.  In at least one case, the consumer began making payments on the purported debt.  However, the consumer continued to receive harassing collection calls. 

Verify Licenses

DFI strongly recommends that consumers deal only with those lenders that are properly licensed to conduct business.  Consumers can determine whether lenders are properly licensed using the "Verify a License" feature at DFI’s website, www.dfi.wa.gov. 


Consumers can determine whether collection agencies are properly licensed at the Washington State Department of Licensing’s website.  Go to www.dol.wa.gov/business/checkstatus.html and click “Search business and professional licenses.” 

Debt Collection Laws

Collection activities are subject to the federal Fair Debt Collection Practices Act.  Therefore, if you have questions regarding debt collection laws please contact the Federal Trade Commission at 382-4357 (1-877-FTC HELP), or online at www.ftc.gov.  

Report Fraud

Washington State residents, if you are suspicious of unlicensed activity by a payday lender please contact DFI at 1-877-RING-DFI (746-4334), or online at www.dfi.wa.gov.  If you are suspicious of a collection agency, you may also contact the Washington State Department of Licensing or the Washington State Attorney General’s Office.  For more information, go to www.dol.wa.gov/business/collectionagency/colrights.html.  


If you live in another state,   find the regulator in your home state on the NMLS website.


If you feel you have been the victim of a loan scam please contact the Federal Trade Commission at 1-877-FTC-HELP (382-4357) or online at www.ftc.gov; or contact the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (855) 411-CFPB (2372) or online at www.consumerfinance.gov.  Because the scammers have access to bank account information and social security numbers, victims should consider themselves victims of identity theft and take appropriate precautions. The Federal Trade Commission has information for victims of identity theft available online at www.ftc.gov.


If you feel you have been the victim of a loan scam involving the Internet please contact the Internet Crime Complaint Center online at www.ic3.gov.


If you feel you have been the victim of a loan scam and are concerned about your personal financial information, contact your banking institution, and the three major credit bureaus.

Toll-free                         12Next0Mad30 May 2012 | 4 repliesThis number identifies itself as "Amway" or "Amway LLC".  It's a collection company for Insight Capital, LLC, a scam payday loan company.  They call three to four times back-to-back, say they have your bank on the other line and your bank is on the other line confirming their claim, that they will have the sheriff's deputy come by your place of work to serve you with papers, and on and on.  But when you ask them what it's for, they don't have an answer, and they won't provide anything in writing.  I've reported the scam to our state's attorney general and the BBB, but I think these guys need to be sued, especially if they're railroading people into paying something they don't owe.

Caller: amway Call type: Debt collector  Reply!0SomeGuy31 May 2012 | 1 replyI got some male voice leaving messages about some guy name Jamie Tollson about some obscure legal matters, some case number which was not provided.  I got Unknown from caller id so I don't answer but they leave messages.  I don't answer because my cell phone is being called and I don't want to waste my minutes on it.Reply!0Zombie debt collectors replies to SomeGuy1 Jun 2012Great article on these types of zombie debt collectors:http://www.forbes.com/2008/10/31/debt-credito ... opedia_inl.htmlReply!0The wrong guy29 Nov 2012 | 1 replyHahahahah I just got a call from someone claiming to be an attorney working for Insite Capital. They are in the process of suing me for a payday loan that i received, that i didn’t authorize.  I actually contacted the company 5 times via email and phone that same day. I receive email that they are reversing loan (Nov. 4, 2012). Nov. 5, 2012 funds are removed; today Nov 28 i get same call. I’m glade I was taught to keep all records of anything I do.  The payment of the loan isn’t even due until Dec.1, 2012. They played with the wrong person this time. I will be turning them into all the proper authorities, and if no action is taken. I am more than willing to have my own personal investigation conducted, on the company, and anyone that is employed under this sham company. I told them to bring it,  I have friends that are lawyers, cops, and family in pentagon. For their sake they should hope that their home base is in international waters or somewhere that can grant them safety from the same harassment that they are doing. I plan to keep yall informed on progress of findings and actions taken. Best Wishes from,Vindictive until DeathReply!0Erica13 Dec 2012 | 1 replyI have paid these people $1708 so far and they were going to be taking $356 more out of my account on Dec. 21st. They called me at work telling me they were coming to serve me papers for bank fraud because we had the first account they were taking from closed down. They said I would owe $12,000 in court if I did not make payments. What do I do? I have not done anything wrong but I'm super scared and very gulable I guess, I believe anything anyone says. Someone please help.  Call type: Debt collector  Reply!0Erica replies to The wrong guy13 Dec 2012Hey please read my post below yours they have taken me for $1708!!Reply!0amy9 Jan 2013These people are liars ,they are using scare tactics to get you to give them money. My advice if this a valid debt. Then. Let them send the paper. Work. And go from there because.they can't take criminal action against a Payday loan but these people are debt collections and can lie about who they are.they called me acting.  Like she was calling from the sheriff's office then when I caught her in a lie,she got angry and started. Calling. Me names, lol..so I wouldn't worry about these people let them take you to court cause it wont happen and if it does. You would responsible to pay what you owe and nothing else.Every state has different laws. And can be illegal. Depending on where you stay.  Caller: insight capital  Reply!0jay replies to Erica9 Jan 2013You need to contact an attorney.  You're past the point of asking for advise on how to best handle your situation from anyone but a professonal..Reply!0stressedoutinhere25 May 2013 | 1 replyI've been harassed by insight capital. I never took out a loan with them and my ssn was stolen and they were taking money out of my account. So I froze it and closed it. Since then they have called my work and my cell saying they are from the state attorney's office and from the police dept. I called the court house and they said they have nothing on file for me. I called the police dept and made a report and they said to change my number. They kept calling me threatening me saying they are down the road from my house and they were going to arrest me. Finally I turned off my cell. And 8 months later they found out my house number and they are doing the same thing all over again. Its stressing me out because I keep telling them I never did take out a loan and to leave me alone and that I've spoken with the police dept. and they want proof and everything. I really do not know what to do anymore. Any advice on this?

He claims he is a mediator for the company insight capital whom I supposedly received a cash advance from in 2011 with threats of now taking me to court for theft,  well I know for a fact I've never received a loan from this company nor ever heard of them,  they hung up on me 3 separate  times when I expressed anger for being contacted on bogus allegations and demanded their information and the fake company information, he would not give a phone number or address for for "insight capital",  he basically  said they don't want to talk to me anymore! He hung up when my husband got on the phone.  While I don't think I will hear from them anymore I'm going to find every complaint site that I can to post, so that people are not scammed into giving  away money they do not owe.
