History and expansion[edit]




Joseph Howe portrait, 1881 $5 Bill Bank of Nova Scotia


The 19th century[edit]




William Lawson, 1st president of Bank of Nova Scotia, by Robert Field


The bank was incorporated by the Legislative Assembly of Nova Scotia on March 30, 1832, in Halifax, Nova Scotia, with William Lawson (1772–1848) serving as the first president.[6] Scotiabank was founded in Halifax, Nova Scotia, in 1832 under the name of The Bank of Nova Scotia. The bank intended to facilitate the trans-Atlantic trade of the time.[7] Later, in 1883, The Bank of Nova Scotia acquired the Union Bank of Prince Edward Island,[8] although most of the bank's expansion efforts in the century took the form of branch openings.
The bank launched its branch banking system by opening in Windsor, Nova Scotia. The expansion was limited to the Maritimes until 1882, when the bank moved west by opening a branch in Winnipeg, Manitoba. The Manitoba branch later closed but the bank continued to expand into the American Midwest. This included opening a branch in Minneapolis in 1885 which later transferred to Chicago in 1892. Following the collapse of the Commercial Bank of Newfoundland and Union Bank of Newfoundland on December 10, 1894; The Bank of Nova Scotia established on December 15, 1894, in Newfoundland,[6]
In 1899, the bank opened a branch in Boston, Massachusetts.
In the meantime, the bank opened a branch in Kingston, Jamaica, in 1889 to facilitate the trading of sugar, rum and fish. This was Scotiabank's first move into the Caribbean and historically the first branch of a Canadian bank opened outside of the United States or the United Kingdom.[7][8] By the end of the 19th century, the bank was represented in all of the Maritimes, Quebec, Ontario and Manitoba.
In 1900, the bank's headquarters were moved to Toronto, Ontario.[9][8]
The 20th and 21st century[edit]

The bank continued to expand in the 20th century, although its growth now took the form of acquisitions rather than branch openings.

1906 – The bank opened a branch in Havana, Cuba. By 1931, it had five branches in Havana, and one branch each in Camagüey, Cienfuegos, Manzanillo, and Santiago de Cuba. In 1960, the Government of Cuba nationalized all banks in Cuba and the Scotiabank withdrew services from all eight branches.
1907 – The bank opened a branch in New York City.
1910 – The bank opened a branch in San Juan, Puerto Rico.
1913 – The Bank of Nova Scotia merged with the Bank of New Brunswick.[8]
1914 – Toronto-based Metropolitan Bank was acquired, making Scotiabank the fourth largest financial institution in Canada.[8]
1919 – The bank opened a branch in Fajardo, Puerto Rico, located in Puerto Rico's northeast.
1919 – Bank of Ottawa was amalgamated.[8]
1920 – The bank opened a branch in London, and another in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic.
1961 – The bank became the first Canadian bank to appoint women bank managers on September 11, 1961.[6]
1962 – The bank expanded into Asia with the opening of a Representative Office in Japan.[8]
1978 – The bank and Canadian Union of Public Employees signed the first collective agreement between a Canadian bank and a union on September 28, 1978, in Toronto.[6]
2000 – Scotiabank's stake in Mexican bank Grupo Financiero Inverlat is increased to 55 percent. The Mexican bank is subsequently renamed to Grupo Financiero Scotiabank Inverlat.[8]
2003 -The bank's Guangzhou Branch was awarded the first licence to a Canadian bank by the Chinese government to deal in Chinese currency.[6]
2003–2004 – The bank acquired Inverlat banking house in Mexico, taking over all of its branches and establishing a strong presence in the country.
2010 – The bank arrived in Bogotá.
2012 - Scotiabank enters into an agreement to acquire ING Direct Bank of Canada from ING Groep N.V.

In its early expansion, the bank clearly followed trade and its customers' businesses rather than pursuing a strategy of expansion into international financial centres. Scotiabank is a member of the Global ATM Alliance, a joint venture of several major international banks that allows customers of the banks to use their ATM cards or check cards at certain other banks within the Global ATM Alliance without fees when traveling internationally. Other participating banks are Barclays (United Kingdom), Bank of America (United States), BNP Paribas (France and Ukraine through UkrSibbank), Deutsche Bank (Germany), and Westpac (Australia and New Zealand).[10]
The 21st century[edit]
One of the biggest challenges according to Scotia's CEO Rick Waugh is electronic espionage. It is thought that China and Russia engage in electronic spying, and scotia has devoted enormous resources in its effort to protect the privacy of its customers.
Scotia has also spent almost $100 million, implementing a controversial system to report to the United States the account holdings of close to one million Canadians of American origin, and their Canadian born spouses. Scotia has been forced to implement this system in order to comply with FATCA. According to the Financial Post FATCA requires Canadian banks to provide information to the United States including total assets, account balances, account numbers, transactions and more, and includes assets held jointly with Canadian-born spouses and other family members.[11][12]

Portfolio evolution[edit]




Scotiabank traded under ticker BNS on TSX and NYSE.


Throughout the 20th century, the bank grew not only in size, but also in breadth of products and services. Progress was conditioned by changing consumer needs, legal changes, or acquisitions of external service providers. A short list follows:[8]

1954 – Passage of the National Housing Act led Scotiabank to create a mortgage department.
1958 – Changes to Bank Act of 1954 enabled Scotiabank to introduce a consumer credit program.
1986 – Scotia Securities is formed to provide discount brokerage and security underwriting services.
1988 – Brokerage firm McLeod Young Weir Ltd. is acquired.
1994 – Scotiabank acquires Montreal Trustco Inc.
1997 – National Trustco Inc. is acquired for C$1.25 billion.
2012 - ING Direct is acquired for C$3.13 billion (renamed Tangerine in April 2014).

Controversies[edit]
Wrongful dismissal lawsuit[edit]
In June 2005, David Berry, a very successful Canadian Scotiabank trader who had built a $75M/year business in trading preferred shares was fired on the grounds that he had committed securities regulatory violations.[14]
At the time, as part of a 20% direct drive deal, he was making more than double the CEO's salary and Scotiabank management had already taken steps to limit his compensation.[15]
The regulatory violation allegations from his former employer, left him unemployable to Scotia's competitors despite the appeal of potentially adding more than $75M/year to their equity trading profits.[15]
Documents delivered to the media showing that Scotia management had sought advice on terminating Berry prior to the Investment Industry Regulatory Organization of Canada (IIROC) violation accusation, and the results of questioning during the IIROC inquiries strongly suggest that the securities charges were part of a plan by Scotiabank senior management to remove Berry from his position and simultaneously prevent him from becoming their competitor.[16]
In a ruling on January 15, 2013, more than seven years after the initial accusation, a hearing panel of the IIROC dismissed all charges against Berry.[17][18]
David Berry has a filed a $100M wrongful dismissal lawsuit against Scotiabank. As of January 2015, and nine years after Berry was terminated, Scotia settled with Berry on an amount that cannot be disclosed. Barry Critchley, who has been following the story since inception, published an article on November 6, 2014, in which he believes Scotia's $55 million reported legal charges would likely be connected to the $100 million lawsuit; but it is unlikely to be ever found out. [19]
Unpaid overtime lawsuit[edit]
In 2014 a settlement deal in a class-action lawsuit was reached . The agreement would cover thousands of workers for more than a decade of unpaid overtime.The lawsuit included 16,000 Scotiabank employees across Canada who worked as personal banking officers, senior personal banking officers, financial advisors, and small business account managers from January 1, 2000, to December 1, 2013. The lawsuit was filed in 2007, along with a similar class-action filed by CIBC bank teller Dara Fresco of Toronto. Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce said previously that it intends to go to trial.
Employees would receive 1.5 times their standard wage at the time, but no interest. Scotiabank will also pay legal fees of $10.45 million in the case. Plaintiffs' counsels were David O'Connor of Roy O'Connor and Louis Sokolov of Sotos LLP.[20][21]
Fraud in Mexico[edit]
In 2001, $14 million was discovered missing in from one of Scotia's branches in Mexico during an investigation into the murder of a branch manager, Maru Oropesa. Initially, the investigators found that Oropesa and Jaime Ross, her former boss, had illegally transferred $5 million from client investment accounts. The money was eventually transferred to the United States where it was used to purchase three aircraft. As the investigation continued, a total of $14 million was found missing and 16 other bank employees were involved in the fraud.[22] [23] Ross was convicted of fraud and money laundering for his role and sentenced to 15 years.[24] The other 16 bank employees were fired by Scotiabank but were not prosecuted.[22]

History and expansion[edit]




Joseph Howe portrait, 1881 $5 Bill Bank of Nova Scotia


The 19th century[edit]




William Lawson, 1st president of Bank of Nova Scotia, by Robert Field


The bank was incorporated by the Legislative Assembly of Nova Scotia on March 30, 1832, in Halifax, Nova Scotia, with William Lawson (1772–1848) serving as the first president.[6] Scotiabank was founded in Halifax, Nova Scotia, in 1832 under the name of The Bank of Nova Scotia. The bank intended to facilitate the trans-Atlantic trade of the time.[7] Later, in 1883, The Bank of Nova Scotia acquired the Union Bank of Prince Edward Island,[8] although most of the bank's expansion efforts in the century took the form of branch openings.
The bank launched its branch banking system by opening in Windsor, Nova Scotia. The expansion was limited to the Maritimes until 1882, when the bank moved west by opening a branch in Winnipeg, Manitoba. The Manitoba branch later closed but the bank continued to expand into the American Midwest. This included opening a branch in Minneapolis in 1885 which later transferred to Chicago in 1892. Following the collapse of the Commercial Bank of Newfoundland and Union Bank of Newfoundland on December 10, 1894; The Bank of Nova Scotia established on December 15, 1894, in Newfoundland,[6]
In 1899, the bank opened a branch in Boston, Massachusetts.
In the meantime, the bank opened a branch in Kingston, Jamaica, in 1889 to facilitate the trading of sugar, rum and fish. This was Scotiabank's first move into the Caribbean and historically the first branch of a Canadian bank opened outside of the United States or the United Kingdom.[7][8] By the end of the 19th century, the bank was represented in all of the Maritimes, Quebec, Ontario and Manitoba.
In 1900, the bank's headquarters were moved to Toronto, Ontario.[9][8]
The 20th and 21st century[edit]

William D. Lawrence (ship) carved into The Bank of Nova Scotia Building (1931), Hollis Street, Halifax, Nova Scotia.


The bank continued to expand in the 20th century, although its growth now took the form of acquisitions rather than branch openings.

1906 – The bank opened a branch in Havana, Cuba. By 1931, it had five branches in Havana, and one branch each in Camagüey, Cienfuegos, Manzanillo, and Santiago de Cuba. In 1960, the Government of Cuba nationalized all banks in Cuba and the Scotiabank withdrew services from all eight branches.
1907 – The bank opened a branch in New York City.
1910 – The bank opened a branch in San Juan, Puerto Rico.
1913 – The Bank of Nova Scotia merged with the Bank of New Brunswick.[8]
1914 – Toronto-based Metropolitan Bank was acquired, making Scotiabank the fourth largest financial institution in Canada.[8]
1919 – The bank opened a branch in Fajardo, Puerto Rico, located in Puerto Rico's northeast.
1919 – Bank of Ottawa was amalgamated.[8]
1920 – The bank opened a branch in London, and another in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic.
1961 – The bank became the first Canadian bank to appoint women bank managers on September 11, 1961.[6]
1962 – The bank expanded into Asia with the opening of a Representative Office in Japan.[8]
1978 – The bank and Canadian Union of Public Employees signed the first collective agreement between a Canadian bank and a union on September 28, 1978, in Toronto.[6]
2000 – Scotiabank's stake in Mexican bank Grupo Financiero Inverlat is increased to 55 percent. The Mexican bank is subsequently renamed to Grupo Financiero Scotiabank Inverlat.[8]
2003 -The bank's Guangzhou Branch was awarded the first licence to a Canadian bank by the Chinese government to deal in Chinese currency.[6]
2003–2004 – The bank acquired Inverlat banking house in Mexico, taking over all of its branches and establishing a strong presence in the country.
2010 – The bank arrived in Bogotá.
2012 - Scotiabank enters into an agreement to acquire ING Direct Bank of Canada from ING Groep N.V.

In its early expansion, the bank clearly followed trade and its customers' businesses rather than pursuing a strategy of expansion into international financial centres. Scotiabank is a member of the Global ATM Alliance, a joint venture of several major international banks that allows customers of the banks to use their ATM cards or check cards at certain other banks within the Global ATM Alliance without fees when traveling internationally. Other participating banks are Barclays (United Kingdom), Bank of America (United States), BNP Paribas (France and Ukraine through UkrSibbank), Deutsche Bank (Germany), and Westpac (Australia and New Zealand).[10]
The 21st century[edit]
One of the biggest challenges according to Scotia's CEO Rick Waugh is electronic espionage. It is thought that China and Russia engage in electronic spying, and scotia has devoted enormous resources in its effort to protect the privacy of its customers.
Scotia has also spent almost $100 million, implementing a controversial system to report to the United States the account holdings of close to one million Canadians of American origin, and their Canadian born spouses. Scotia has been forced to implement this system in order to comply with FATCA. According to the Financial Post FATCA requires Canadian banks to provide information to the United States including total assets, account balances, account numbers, transactions and more, and includes assets held jointly with Canadian-born spouses and other family members.[11][12]

Portfolio evolution[edit]




Scotiabank traded under ticker BNS on TSX and NYSE.


Throughout the 20th century, the bank grew not only in size, but also in breadth of products and services. Progress was conditioned by changing consumer needs, legal changes, or acquisitions of external service providers. A short list follows:[8]

1954 – Passage of the National Housing Act led Scotiabank to create a mortgage department.
1958 – Changes to Bank Act of 1954 enabled Scotiabank to introduce a consumer credit program.
1986 – Scotia Securities is formed to provide discount brokerage and security underwriting services.
1988 – Brokerage firm McLeod Young Weir Ltd. is acquired.
1994 – Scotiabank acquires Montreal Trustco Inc.
1997 – National Trustco Inc. is acquired for C$1.25 billion.
2012 - ING Direct is acquired for C$3.13 billion (renamed Tangerine in April 2014).

Controversies[edit]
Wrongful dismissal lawsuit[edit]
In June 2005, David Berry, a very successful Canadian Scotiabank trader who had built a $75M/year business in trading preferred shares was fired on the grounds that he had committed securities regulatory violations.[14]
At the time, as part of a 20% direct drive deal, he was making more than double the CEO's salary and Scotiabank management had already taken steps to limit his compensation.[15]
The regulatory violation allegations from his former employer, left him unemployable to Scotia's competitors despite the appeal of potentially adding more than $75M/year to their equity trading profits.[15]
Documents delivered to the media showing that Scotia management had sought advice on terminating Berry prior to the Investment Industry Regulatory Organization of Canada (IIROC) violation accusation, and the results of questioning during the IIROC inquiries strongly suggest that the securities charges were part of a plan by Scotiabank senior management to remove Berry from his position and simultaneously prevent him from becoming their competitor.[16]
In a ruling on January 15, 2013, more than seven years after the initial accusation, a hearing panel of the IIROC dismissed all charges against Berry.[17][18]
David Berry has a filed a $100M wrongful dismissal lawsuit against Scotiabank. As of January 2015, and nine years after Berry was terminated, Scotia settled with Berry on an amount that cannot be disclosed. Barry Critchley, who has been following the story since inception, published an article on November 6, 2014, in which he believes Scotia's $55 million reported legal charges would likely be connected to the $100 million lawsuit; but it is unlikely to be ever found out. [19]
Unpaid overtime lawsuit[edit]
In 2014 a settlement deal in a class-action lawsuit was reached . The agreement would cover thousands of workers for more than a decade of unpaid overtime.The lawsuit included 16,000 Scotiabank employees across Canada who worked as personal banking officers, senior personal banking officers, financial advisors, and small business account managers from January 1, 2000, to December 1, 2013. The lawsuit was filed in 2007, along with a similar class-action filed by CIBC bank teller Dara Fresco of Toronto. Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce said previously that it intends to go to trial.
Employees would receive 1.5 times their standard wage at the time, but no interest. Scotiabank will also pay legal fees of $10.45 million in the case. Plaintiffs' counsels were David O'Connor of Roy O'Connor and Louis Sokolov of Sotos LLP.[20][21]
Fraud in Mexico[edit]
In 2001, $14 million was discovered missing in from one of Scotia's branches in Mexico during an investigation into the murder of a branch manager, Maru Oropesa. Initially, the investigators found that Oropesa and Jaime Ross, her former boss, had illegally transferred $5 million from client investment accounts. The money was eventually transferred to the United States where it was used to purchase three aircraft. As the investigation continued, a total of $14 million was found missing and 16 other bank employees were involved in the fraud.[22] [23] Ross was convicted of fraud and money laundering for his role and sentenced to 15 years.[24] The other 16 bank employees were fired by Scotiabank but were not prosecuted.[22]

History and expansion[edit]




Joseph Howe portrait, 1881 $5 Bill Bank of Nova Scotia


The 19th century[edit]




William Lawson, 1st president of Bank of Nova Scotia, by Robert Field


The bank was incorporated by the Legislative Assembly of Nova Scotia on March 30, 1832, in Halifax, Nova Scotia, with William Lawson (1772–1848) serving as the first president.[6] Scotiabank was founded in Halifax, Nova Scotia, in 1832 under the name of The Bank of Nova Scotia. The bank intended to facilitate the trans-Atlantic trade of the time.[7] Later, in 1883, The Bank of Nova Scotia acquired the Union Bank of Prince Edward Island,[8] although most of the bank's expansion efforts in the century took the form of branch openings.
The bank launched its branch banking system by opening in Windsor, Nova Scotia. The expansion was limited to the Maritimes until 1882, when the bank moved west by opening a branch in Winnipeg, Manitoba. The Manitoba branch later closed but the bank continued to expand into the American Midwest. This included opening a branch in Minneapolis in 1885 which later transferred to Chicago in 1892. Following the collapse of the Commercial Bank of Newfoundland and Union Bank of Newfoundland on December 10, 1894; The Bank of Nova Scotia established on December 15, 1894, in Newfoundland,[6]
In 1899, the bank opened a branch in Boston, Massachusetts.
In the meantime, the bank opened a branch in Kingston, Jamaica, in 1889 to facilitate the trading of sugar, rum and fish. This was Scotiabank's first move into the Caribbean and historically the first branch of a Canadian bank opened outside of the United States or the United Kingdom.[7][8] By the end of the 19th century, the bank was represented in all of the Maritimes, Quebec, Ontario and Manitoba.
In 1900, the bank's headquarters were moved to Toronto, Ontario.[9][8]
The 20th and 21st century[edit]

The bank continued to expand in the 20th century, although its growth now took the form of acquisitions rather than branch openings.

1906 – The bank opened a branch in Havana, Cuba. By 1931, it had five branches in Havana, and one branch each in Camagüey, Cienfuegos, Manzanillo, and Santiago de Cuba. In 1960, the Government of Cuba nationalized all banks in Cuba and the Scotiabank withdrew services from all eight branches.
1907 – The bank opened a branch in New York City.
1910 – The bank opened a branch in San Juan, Puerto Rico.
1913 – The Bank of Nova Scotia merged with the Bank of New Brunswick.[8]
1914 – Toronto-based Metropolitan Bank was acquired, making Scotiabank the fourth largest financial institution in Canada.[8]
1919 – The bank opened a branch in Fajardo, Puerto Rico, located in Puerto Rico's northeast.
1919 – Bank of Ottawa was amalgamated.[8]
1920 – The bank opened a branch in London, and another in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic.
1961 – The bank became the first Canadian bank to appoint women bank managers on September 11, 1961.[6]
1962 – The bank expanded into Asia with the opening of a Representative Office in Japan.[8]
1978 – The bank and Canadian Union of Public Employees signed the first collective agreement between a Canadian bank and a union on September 28, 1978, in Toronto.[6]
2000 – Scotiabank's stake in Mexican bank Grupo Financiero Inverlat is increased to 55 percent. The Mexican bank is subsequently renamed to Grupo Financiero Scotiabank Inverlat.[8]
2003 -The bank's Guangzhou Branch was awarded the first licence to a Canadian bank by the Chinese government to deal in Chinese currency.[6]
2003–2004 – The bank acquired Inverlat banking house in Mexico, taking over all of its branches and establishing a strong presence in the country.
2010 – The bank arrived in Bogotá.
2012 - Scotiabank enters into an agreement to acquire ING Direct Bank of Canada from ING Groep N.V.

In its early expansion, the bank clearly followed trade and its customers' businesses rather than pursuing a strategy of expansion into international financial centres. Scotiabank is a member of the Global ATM Alliance, a joint venture of several major international banks that allows customers of the banks to use their ATM cards or check cards at certain other banks within the Global ATM Alliance without fees when traveling internationally. Other participating banks are Barclays (United Kingdom), Bank of America (United States), BNP Paribas (France and Ukraine through UkrSibbank), Deutsche Bank (Germany), and Westpac (Australia and New Zealand).[10]
The 21st century[edit]
One of the biggest challenges according to Scotia's CEO Rick Waugh is electronic espionage. It is thought that China and Russia engage in electronic spying, and scotia has devoted enormous resources in its effort to protect the privacy of its customers.
Scotia has also spent almost $100 million, implementing a controversial system to report to the United States the account holdings of close to one million Canadians of American origin, and their Canadian born spouses. Scotia has been forced to implement this system in order to comply with FATCA. According to the Financial Post FATCA requires Canadian banks to provide information to the United States including total assets, account balances, account numbers, transactions and more, and includes assets held jointly with Canadian-born spouses and other family members.[11][12]

Portfolio evolution[edit]




Scotiabank traded under ticker BNS on TSX and NYSE.


Throughout the 20th century, the bank grew not only in size, but also in breadth of products and services. Progress was conditioned by changing consumer needs, legal changes, or acquisitions of external service providers. A short list follows:[8]

1954 – Passage of the National Housing Act led Scotiabank to create a mortgage department.
1958 – Changes to Bank Act of 1954 enabled Scotiabank to introduce a consumer credit program.
1986 – Scotia Securities is formed to provide discount brokerage and security underwriting services.
1988 – Brokerage firm McLeod Young Weir Ltd. is acquired.
1994 – Scotiabank acquires Montreal Trustco Inc.
1997 – National Trustco Inc. is acquired for C$1.25 billion.
2012 - ING Direct is acquired for C$3.13 billion (renamed Tangerine in April 2014).

Controversies[edit]
Wrongful dismissal lawsuit[edit]
In June 2005, David Berry, a very successful Canadian Scotiabank trader who had built a $75M/year business in trading preferred shares was fired on the grounds that he had committed securities regulatory violations.[14]
At the time, as part of a 20% direct drive deal, he was making more than double the CEO's salary and Scotiabank management had already taken steps to limit his compensation.[15]
The regulatory violation allegations from his former employer, left him unemployable to Scotia's competitors despite the appeal of potentially adding more than $75M/year to their equity trading profits.[15]
Documents delivered to the media showing that Scotia management had sought advice on terminating Berry prior to the Investment Industry Regulatory Organization of Canada (IIROC) violation accusation, and the results of questioning during the IIROC inquiries strongly suggest that the securities charges were part of a plan by Scotiabank senior management to remove Berry from his position and simultaneously prevent him from becoming their competitor.[16]
In a ruling on January 15, 2013, more than seven years after the initial accusation, a hearing panel of the IIROC dismissed all charges against Berry.[17][18]
David Berry has a filed a $100M wrongful dismissal lawsuit against Scotiabank. As of January 2015, and nine years after Berry was terminated, Scotia settled with Berry on an amount that cannot be disclosed. Barry Critchley, who has been following the story since inception, published an article on November 6, 2014, in which he believes Scotia's $55 million reported legal charges would likely be connected to the $100 million lawsuit; but it is unlikely to be ever found out. [19]
Unpaid overtime lawsuit[edit]
In 2014 a settlement deal in a class-action lawsuit was reached . The agreement would cover thousands of workers for more than a decade of unpaid overtime.The lawsuit included 16,000 Scotiabank employees across Canada who worked as personal banking officers, senior personal banking officers, financial advisors, and small business account managers from January 1, 2000, to December 1, 2013. The lawsuit was filed in 2007, along with a similar class-action filed by CIBC bank teller Dara Fresco of Toronto. Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce said previously that it intends to go to trial.
Employees would receive 1.5 times their standard wage at the time, but no interest. Scotiabank will also pay legal fees of $10.45 million in the case. Plaintiffs' counsels were David O'Connor of Roy O'Connor and Louis Sokolov of Sotos LLP.[20][21]
Fraud in Mexico[edit]
In 2001, $14 million was discovered missing in from one of Scotia's branches in Mexico during an investigation into the murder of a branch manager, Maru Oropesa. Initially, the investigators found that Oropesa and Jaime Ross, her former boss, had illegally transferred $5 million from client investment accounts. The money was eventually transferred to the United States where it was used to purchase three aircraft. As the investigation continued, a total of $14 million was found missing and 16 other bank employees were involved in the fraud.[22] [23] Ross was convicted of fraud and money laundering for his role and sentenced to 15 years.[24] The other 16 bank employees were fired by Scotiabank but were not prosecuted.[22]

History and expansion[edit]




Joseph Howe portrait, 1881 $5 Bill Bank of Nova Scotia


The 19th century[edit]




William Lawson, 1st president of Bank of Nova Scotia, by Robert Field


The bank was incorporated by the Legislative Assembly of Nova Scotia on March 30, 1832, in Halifax, Nova Scotia, with William Lawson (1772–1848) serving as the first president.[6] Scotiabank was founded in Halifax, Nova Scotia, in 1832 under the name of The Bank of Nova Scotia. The bank intended to facilitate the trans-Atlantic trade of the time.[7] Later, in 1883, The Bank of Nova Scotia acquired the Union Bank of Prince Edward Island,[8] although most of the bank's expansion efforts in the century took the form of branch openings.
The bank launched its branch banking system by opening in Windsor, Nova Scotia. The expansion was limited to the Maritimes until 1882, when the bank moved west by opening a branch in Winnipeg, Manitoba. The Manitoba branch later closed but the bank continued to expand into the American Midwest. This included opening a branch in Minneapolis in 1885 which later transferred to Chicago in 1892. Following the collapse of the Commercial Bank of Newfoundland and Union Bank of Newfoundland on December 10, 1894; The Bank of Nova Scotia established on December 15, 1894, in Newfoundland,[6]
In 1899, the bank opened a branch in Boston, Massachusetts.
In the meantime, the bank opened a branch in Kingston, Jamaica, in 1889 to facilitate the trading of sugar, rum and fish. This was Scotiabank's first move into the Caribbean and historically the first branch of a Canadian bank opened outside of the United States or the United Kingdom.[7][8] By the end of the 19th century, the bank was represented in all of the Maritimes, Quebec, Ontario and Manitoba.
In 1900, the bank's headquarters were moved to Toronto, Ontario.[9][8]
The 20th and 21st century[edit]

The bank continued to expand in the 20th century, although its growth now took the form of acquisitions rather than branch openings.

1906 – The bank opened a branch in Havana, Cuba. By 1931, it had five branches in Havana, and one branch each in Camagüey, Cienfuegos, Manzanillo, and Santiago de Cuba. In 1960, the Government of Cuba nationalized all banks in Cuba and the Scotiabank withdrew services from all eight branches.
1907 – The bank opened a branch in New York City.
1910 – The bank opened a branch in San Juan, Puerto Rico.
1913 – The Bank of Nova Scotia merged with the Bank of New Brunswick.[8]
1914 – Toronto-based Metropolitan Bank was acquired, making Scotiabank the fourth largest financial institution in Canada.[8]
1919 – The bank opened a branch in Fajardo, Puerto Rico, located in Puerto Rico's northeast.
1919 – Bank of Ottawa was amalgamated.[8]
1920 – The bank opened a branch in London, and another in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic.
1961 – The bank became the first Canadian bank to appoint women bank managers on September 11, 1961.[6]
1962 – The bank expanded into Asia with the opening of a Representative Office in Japan.[8]
1978 – The bank and Canadian Union of Public Employees signed the first collective agreement between a Canadian bank and a union on September 28, 1978, in Toronto.[6]
2000 – Scotiabank's stake in Mexican bank Grupo Financiero Inverlat is increased to 55 percent. The Mexican bank is subsequently renamed to Grupo Financiero Scotiabank Inverlat.[8]
2003 -The bank's Guangzhou Branch was awarded the first licence to a Canadian bank by the Chinese government to deal in Chinese currency.[6]
2003–2004 – The bank acquired Inverlat banking house in Mexico, taking over all of its branches and establishing a strong presence in the country.
2010 – The bank arrived in Bogotá.
2012 - Scotiabank enters into an agreement to acquire ING Direct Bank of Canada from ING Groep N.V.

In its early expansion, the bank clearly followed trade and its customers' businesses rather than pursuing a strategy of expansion into international financial centres. Scotiabank is a member of the Global ATM Alliance, a joint venture of several major international banks that allows customers of the banks to use their ATM cards or check cards at certain other banks within the Global ATM Alliance without fees when traveling internationally. Other participating banks are Barclays (United Kingdom), Bank of America (United States), BNP Paribas (France and Ukraine through UkrSibbank), Deutsche Bank (Germany), and Westpac (Australia and New Zealand).[10]
The 21st century[edit]
One of the biggest challenges according to Scotia's CEO Rick Waugh is electronic espionage. It is thought that China and Russia engage in electronic spying, and scotia has devoted enormous resources in its effort to protect the privacy of its customers.
Scotia has also spent almost $100 million, implementing a controversial system to report to the United States the account holdings of close to one million Canadians of American origin, and their Canadian born spouses. Scotia has been forced to implement this system in order to comply with FATCA. According to the Financial Post FATCA requires Canadian banks to provide information to the United States including total assets, account balances, account numbers, transactions and more, and includes assets held jointly with Canadian-born spouses and other family members.[11][12]

Portfolio evolution[edit]




Scotiabank traded under ticker BNS on TSX and NYSE.


Throughout the 20th century, the bank grew not only in size, but also in breadth of products and services. Progress was conditioned by changing consumer needs, legal changes, or acquisitions of external service providers. A short list follows:[8]

1954 – Passage of the National Housing Act led Scotiabank to create a mortgage department.
1958 – Changes to Bank Act of 1954 enabled Scotiabank to introduce a consumer credit program.
1986 – Scotia Securities is formed to provide discount brokerage and security underwriting services.
1988 – Brokerage firm McLeod Young Weir Ltd. is acquired.
1994 – Scotiabank acquires Montreal Trustco Inc.
1997 – National Trustco Inc. is acquired for C$1.25 billion.
2012 - ING Direct is acquired for C$3.13 billion (renamed Tangerine in April 2014).

Controversies[edit]
Wrongful dismissal lawsuit[edit]
In June 2005, David Berry, a very successful Canadian Scotiabank trader who had built a $75M/year business in trading preferred shares was fired on the grounds that he had committed securities regulatory violations.[14]
At the time, as part of a 20% direct drive deal, he was making more than double the CEO's salary and Scotiabank management had already taken steps to limit his compensation.[15]
The regulatory violation allegations from his former employer, left him unemployable to Scotia's competitors despite the appeal of potentially adding more than $75M/year to their equity trading profits.[15]
Documents delivered to the media showing that Scotia management had sought advice on terminating Berry prior to the Investment Industry Regulatory Organization of Canada (IIROC) violation accusation, and the results of questioning during the IIROC inquiries strongly suggest that the securities charges were part of a plan by Scotiabank senior management to remove Berry from his position and simultaneously prevent him from becoming their competitor.[16]
In a ruling on January 15, 2013, more than seven years after the initial accusation, a hearing panel of the IIROC dismissed all charges against Berry.[17][18]
David Berry has a filed a $100M wrongful dismissal lawsuit against Scotiabank. As of January 2015, and nine years after Berry was terminated, Scotia settled with Berry on an amount that cannot be disclosed. Barry Critchley, who has been following the story since inception, published an article on November 6, 2014, in which he believes Scotia's $55 million reported legal charges would likely be connected to the $100 million lawsuit; but it is unlikely to be ever found out. [19]
Unpaid overtime lawsuit[edit]
In 2014 a settlement deal in a class-action lawsuit was reached . The agreement would cover thousands of workers for more than a decade of unpaid overtime.The lawsuit included 16,000 Scotiabank employees across Canada who worked as personal banking officers, senior personal banking officers, financial advisors, and small business account managers from January 1, 2000, to December 1, 2013. The lawsuit was filed in 2007, along with a similar class-action filed by CIBC bank teller Dara Fresco of Toronto. Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce said previously that it intends to go to trial.
Employees would receive 1.5 times their standard wage at the time, but no interest. Scotiabank will also pay legal fees of $10.45 million in the case. Plaintiffs' counsels were David O'Connor of Roy O'Connor and Louis Sokolov of Sotos LLP.[20][21]
Fraud in Mexico[edit]
In 2001, $14 million was discovered missing in from one of Scotia's branches in Mexico during an investigation into the murder of a branch manager, Maru Oropesa. Initially, the investigators found that Oropesa and Jaime Ross, her former boss, had illegally transferred $5 million from client investment accounts. The money was eventually transferred to the United States where it was used to purchase three aircraft. As the investigation continued, a total of $14 million was found missing and 16 other bank employees were involved in the fraud.[22] [23] Ross was convicted of fraud and money laundering for his role and sentenced to 15 years.[24] The other 16 bank employees were fired by Scotiabank but were not prosecuted.[22]

The Bank of Nova Scotia Principal Protected Notes (PPNs)
BNS Principal Protected Notes are deposit notes issued by the Bank of Nova Scotia with returns linked to a variety of underlying assets. As with all other deposits issued by the Bank, an investors principal amount is 100% guaranteed by the Bank at the maturity date of their investment. Principal Protected Notes typically offer the potential for variable returns in excess of traditional bonds based on the performance of the underlying assets. Potential assets include equities, equity indices, interest rates, commodities, currencies or mutual funds. These variable returns may be combined with fixed coupon payments and may be paid during the life of the investment or as a lump sum payment at maturity.
BNS Principal Protected Notes can be customized to meet investor requirements for term, underlying assets, payout features or currency.
To determine if BNS Principal Protected Notes are suitable for your investment needs and objectives, please consult with an investment professional.

The Bank of Nova Scotia Principal at Risk Notes (PaRs)
BNS Principal at Risk Notes are issued by the Bank of Nova Scotia with returns linked to a variety of underlying assets. Principal at Risk Notes do not guarantee repayment of an investors principal amount at maturity. Instead, investors can gain the potential for variable returns in excess of traditional bonds based on the performance of the underlying assets. Potential assets include equities, equity indices, bonds, commodities, currencies, exchange traded funds or mutual funds. The variable returns of Principal at Risk Notes are generally enhanced  by putting some, or all, of an investors principal at risk, based on the performance of the underlying assets during the life of the note.
BNS Principal at Risk Notes can be customized to meet investor requirements for term, underlying assets, payout features or currency.
To determine if BNS Principal at Risk Notes are suitable for your investment needs and objectives, please consult with an investment professional

History and expansion[edit]




Joseph Howe portrait, 1881 $5 Bill Bank of Nova Scotia


The 19th century[edit]




William Lawson, 1st president of Bank of Nova Scotia, by Robert Field


The bank was incorporated by the Legislative Assembly of Nova Scotia on March 30, 1832, in Halifax, Nova Scotia, with William Lawson (1772–1848) serving as the first president.[6] Scotiabank was founded in Halifax, Nova Scotia, in 1832 under the name of The Bank of Nova Scotia. The bank intended to facilitate the trans-Atlantic trade of the time.[7] Later, in 1883, The Bank of Nova Scotia acquired the Union Bank of Prince Edward Island,[8] although most of the bank's expansion efforts in the century took the form of branch openings.
The bank launched its branch banking system by opening in Windsor, Nova Scotia. The expansion was limited to the Maritimes until 1882, when the bank moved west by opening a branch in Winnipeg, Manitoba. The Manitoba branch later closed but the bank continued to expand into the American Midwest. This included opening a branch in Minneapolis in 1885 which later transferred to Chicago in 1892. Following the collapse of the Commercial Bank of Newfoundland and Union Bank of Newfoundland on December 10, 1894; The Bank of Nova Scotia established on December 15, 1894, in Newfoundland,[6]
In 1899, the bank opened a branch in Boston, Massachusetts.
In the meantime, the bank opened a branch in Kingston, Jamaica, in 1889 to facilitate the trading of sugar, rum and fish. This was Scotiabank's first move into the Caribbean and historically the first branch of a Canadian bank opened outside of the United States or the United Kingdom.[7][8] By the end of the 19th century, the bank was represented in all of the Maritimes, Quebec, Ontario and Manitoba.
In 1900, the bank's headquarters were moved to Toronto, Ontario.[9][8]
The 20th and 21st century[edit]

The bank continued to expand in the 20th century, although its growth now took the form of acquisitions rather than branch openings.

1906 – The bank opened a branch in Havana, Cuba. By 1931, it had five branches in Havana, and one branch each in Camagüey, Cienfuegos, Manzanillo, and Santiago de Cuba. In 1960, the Government of Cuba nationalized all banks in Cuba and the Scotiabank withdrew services from all eight branches.
1907 – The bank opened a branch in New York City.
1910 – The bank opened a branch in San Juan, Puerto Rico.
1913 – The Bank of Nova Scotia merged with the Bank of New Brunswick.[8]
1914 – Toronto-based Metropolitan Bank was acquired, making Scotiabank the fourth largest financial institution in Canada.[8]
1919 – The bank opened a branch in Fajardo, Puerto Rico, located in Puerto Rico's northeast.
1919 – Bank of Ottawa was amalgamated.[8]
1920 – The bank opened a branch in London, and another in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic.
1961 – The bank became the first Canadian bank to appoint women bank managers on September 11, 1961.[6]
1962 – The bank expanded into Asia with the opening of a Representative Office in Japan.[8]
1978 – The bank and Canadian Union of Public Employees signed the first collective agreement between a Canadian bank and a union on September 28, 1978, in Toronto.[6]
2000 – Scotiabank's stake in Mexican bank Grupo Financiero Inverlat is increased to 55 percent. The Mexican bank is subsequently renamed to Grupo Financiero Scotiabank Inverlat.[8]
2003 -The bank's Guangzhou Branch was awarded the first licence to a Canadian bank by the Chinese government to deal in Chinese currency.[6]
2003–2004 – The bank acquired Inverlat banking house in Mexico, taking over all of its branches and establishing a strong presence in the country.
2010 – The bank arrived in Bogotá.
2012 - Scotiabank enters into an agreement to acquire ING Direct Bank of Canada from ING Groep N.V.

In its early expansion, the bank clearly followed trade and its customers' businesses rather than pursuing a strategy of expansion into international financial centres. Scotiabank is a member of the Global ATM Alliance, a joint venture of several major international banks that allows customers of the banks to use their ATM cards or check cards at certain other banks within the Global ATM Alliance without fees when traveling internationally. Other participating banks are Barclays (United Kingdom), Bank of America (United States), BNP Paribas (France and Ukraine through UkrSibbank), Deutsche Bank (Germany), and Westpac (Australia and New Zealand).[10]
The 21st century[edit]
One of the biggest challenges according to Scotia's CEO Rick Waugh is electronic espionage. It is thought that China and Russia engage in electronic spying, and scotia has devoted enormous resources in its effort to protect the privacy of its customers.
Scotia has also spent almost $100 million, implementing a controversial system to report to the United States the account holdings of close to one million Canadians of American origin, and their Canadian born spouses. Scotia has been forced to implement this system in order to comply with FATCA. According to the Financial Post FATCA requires Canadian banks to provide information to the United States including total assets, account balances, account numbers, transactions and more, and includes assets held jointly with Canadian-born spouses and other family members.[11][12]

Portfolio evolution[edit]




Scotiabank traded under ticker BNS on TSX and NYSE.


Throughout the 20th century, the bank grew not only in size, but also in breadth of products and services. Progress was conditioned by changing consumer needs, legal changes, or acquisitions of external service providers. A short list follows:[8]

1954 – Passage of the National Housing Act led Scotiabank to create a mortgage department.
1958 – Changes to Bank Act of 1954 enabled Scotiabank to introduce a consumer credit program.
1986 – Scotia Securities is formed to provide discount brokerage and security underwriting services.
1988 – Brokerage firm McLeod Young Weir Ltd. is acquired.
1994 – Scotiabank acquires Montreal Trustco Inc.
1997 – National Trustco Inc. is acquired for C$1.25 billion.
2012 - ING Direct is acquired for C$3.13 billion (renamed Tangerine in April 2014).

Controversies[edit]
Wrongful dismissal lawsuit[edit]
In June 2005, David Berry, a very successful Canadian Scotiabank trader who had built a $75M/year business in trading preferred shares was fired on the grounds that he had committed securities regulatory violations.[14]
At the time, as part of a 20% direct drive deal, he was making more than double the CEO's salary and Scotiabank management had already taken steps to limit his compensation.[15]
The regulatory violation allegations from his former employer, left him unemployable to Scotia's competitors despite the appeal of potentially adding more than $75M/year to their equity trading profits.[15]
Documents delivered to the media showing that Scotia management had sought advice on terminating Berry prior to the Investment Industry Regulatory Organization of Canada (IIROC) violation accusation, and the results of questioning during the IIROC inquiries strongly suggest that the securities charges were part of a plan by Scotiabank senior management to remove Berry from his position and simultaneously prevent him from becoming their competitor.[16]
In a ruling on January 15, 2013, more than seven years after the initial accusation, a hearing panel of the IIROC dismissed all charges against Berry.[17][18]
David Berry has a filed a $100M wrongful dismissal lawsuit against Scotiabank. As of January 2015, and nine years after Berry was terminated, Scotia settled with Berry on an amount that cannot be disclosed. Barry Critchley, who has been following the story since inception, published an article on November 6, 2014, in which he believes Scotia's $55 million reported legal charges would likely be connected to the $100 million lawsuit; but it is unlikely to be ever found out. [19]
Unpaid overtime lawsuit[edit]
In 2014 a settlement deal in a class-action lawsuit was reached . The agreement would cover thousands of workers for more than a decade of unpaid overtime.The lawsuit included 16,000 Scotiabank employees across Canada who worked as personal banking officers, senior personal banking officers, financial advisors, and small business account managers from January 1, 2000, to December 1, 2013. The lawsuit was filed in 2007, along with a similar class-action filed by CIBC bank teller Dara Fresco of Toronto. Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce said previously that it intends to go to trial.
Employees would receive 1.5 times their standard wage at the time, but no interest. Scotiabank will also pay legal fees of $10.45 million in the case. Plaintiffs' counsels were David O'Connor of Roy O'Connor and Louis Sokolov of Sotos LLP.[20][21]
Fraud in Mexico[edit]
In 2001, $14 million was discovered missing in from one of Scotia's branches in Mexico during an investigation into the murder of a branch manager, Maru Oropesa. Initially, the investigators found that Oropesa and Jaime Ross, her former boss, had illegally transferred $5 million from client investment accounts. The money was eventually transferred to the United States where it was used to purchase three aircraft. As the investigation continued, a total of $14 million was found missing and 16 other bank employees were involved in the fraud.[22] [23] Ross was convicted of fraud and money laundering for his role and sentenced to 15 years.[24] The other 16 bank employees were fired by Scotiabank but were not prosecuted.[22]

History and expansion[edit]




Joseph Howe portrait, 1881 $5 Bill Bank of Nova Scotia


The 19th century[edit]




William Lawson, 1st president of Bank of Nova Scotia, by Robert Field


The bank was incorporated by the Legislative Assembly of Nova Scotia on March 30, 1832, in Halifax, Nova Scotia, with William Lawson (1772–1848) serving as the first president.[6] Scotiabank was founded in Halifax, Nova Scotia, in 1832 under the name of The Bank of Nova Scotia. The bank intended to facilitate the trans-Atlantic trade of the time.[7] Later, in 1883, The Bank of Nova Scotia acquired the Union Bank of Prince Edward Island,[8] although most of the bank's expansion efforts in the century took the form of branch openings.
The bank launched its branch banking system by opening in Windsor, Nova Scotia. The expansion was limited to the Maritimes until 1882, when the bank moved west by opening a branch in Winnipeg, Manitoba. The Manitoba branch later closed but the bank continued to expand into the American Midwest. This included opening a branch in Minneapolis in 1885 which later transferred to Chicago in 1892. Following the collapse of the Commercial Bank of Newfoundland and Union Bank of Newfoundland on December 10, 1894; The Bank of Nova Scotia established on December 15, 1894, in Newfoundland,[6]
In 1899, the bank opened a branch in Boston, Massachusetts.
In the meantime, the bank opened a branch in Kingston, Jamaica, in 1889 to facilitate the trading of sugar, rum and fish. This was Scotiabank's first move into the Caribbean and historically the first branch of a Canadian bank opened outside of the United States or the United Kingdom.[7][8] By the end of the 19th century, the bank was represented in all of the Maritimes, Quebec, Ontario and Manitoba.
In 1900, the bank's headquarters were moved to Toronto, Ontario.[9][8]
The 20th and 21st century[edit]

The bank continued to expand in the 20th century, although its growth now took the form of acquisitions rather than branch openings.

1906 – The bank opened a branch in Havana, Cuba. By 1931, it had five branches in Havana, and one branch each in Camagüey, Cienfuegos, Manzanillo, and Santiago de Cuba. In 1960, the Government of Cuba nationalized all banks in Cuba and the Scotiabank withdrew services from all eight branches.
1907 – The bank opened a branch in New York City.
1910 – The bank opened a branch in San Juan, Puerto Rico.
1913 – The Bank of Nova Scotia merged with the Bank of New Brunswick.[8]
1914 – Toronto-based Metropolitan Bank was acquired, making Scotiabank the fourth largest financial institution in Canada.[8]
1919 – The bank opened a branch in Fajardo, Puerto Rico, located in Puerto Rico's northeast.
1919 – Bank of Ottawa was amalgamated.[8]
1920 – The bank opened a branch in London, and another in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic.
1961 – The bank became the first Canadian bank to appoint women bank managers on September 11, 1961.[6]
1962 – The bank expanded into Asia with the opening of a Representative Office in Japan.[8]
1978 – The bank and Canadian Union of Public Employees signed the first collective agreement between a Canadian bank and a union on September 28, 1978, in Toronto.[6]
2000 – Scotiabank's stake in Mexican bank Grupo Financiero Inverlat is increased to 55 percent. The Mexican bank is subsequently renamed to Grupo Financiero Scotiabank Inverlat.[8]
2003 -The bank's Guangzhou Branch was awarded the first licence to a Canadian bank by the Chinese government to deal in Chinese currency.[6]
2003–2004 – The bank acquired Inverlat banking house in Mexico, taking over all of its branches and establishing a strong presence in the country.
2010 – The bank arrived in Bogotá.
2012 - Scotiabank enters into an agreement to acquire ING Direct Bank of Canada from ING Groep N.V.

In its early expansion, the bank clearly followed trade and its customers' businesses rather than pursuing a strategy of expansion into international financial centres. Scotiabank is a member of the Global ATM Alliance, a joint venture of several major international banks that allows customers of the banks to use their ATM cards or check cards at certain other banks within the Global ATM Alliance without fees when traveling internationally. Other participating banks are Barclays (United Kingdom), Bank of America (United States), BNP Paribas (France and Ukraine through UkrSibbank), Deutsche Bank (Germany), and Westpac (Australia and New Zealand).[10]
The 21st century[edit]
One of the biggest challenges according to Scotia's CEO Rick Waugh is electronic espionage. It is thought that China and Russia engage in electronic spying, and scotia has devoted enormous resources in its effort to protect the privacy of its customers.
Scotia has also spent almost $100 million, implementing a controversial system to report to the United States the account holdings of close to one million Canadians of American origin, and their Canadian born spouses. Scotia has been forced to implement this system in order to comply with FATCA. According to the Financial Post FATCA requires Canadian banks to provide information to the United States including total assets, account balances, account numbers, transactions and more, and includes assets held jointly with Canadian-born spouses and other family members.[11][12]

Portfolio evolution[edit]




Scotiabank traded under ticker BNS on TSX and NYSE.


Throughout the 20th century, the bank grew not only in size, but also in breadth of products and services. Progress was conditioned by changing consumer needs, legal changes, or acquisitions of external service providers. A short list follows:[8]

1954 – Passage of the National Housing Act led Scotiabank to create a mortgage department.
1958 – Changes to Bank Act of 1954 enabled Scotiabank to introduce a consumer credit program.
1986 – Scotia Securities is formed to provide discount brokerage and security underwriting services.
1988 – Brokerage firm McLeod Young Weir Ltd. is acquired.
1994 – Scotiabank acquires Montreal Trustco Inc.
1997 – National Trustco Inc. is acquired for C$1.25 billion.
2012 - ING Direct is acquired for C$3.13 billion (renamed Tangerine in April 2014).

Controversies[edit]
Wrongful dismissal lawsuit[edit]
In June 2005, David Berry, a very successful Canadian Scotiabank trader who had built a $75M/year business in trading preferred shares was fired on the grounds that he had committed securities regulatory violations.[14]
At the time, as part of a 20% direct drive deal, he was making more than double the CEO's salary and Scotiabank management had already taken steps to limit his compensation.[15]
The regulatory violation allegations from his former employer, left him unemployable to Scotia's competitors despite the appeal of potentially adding more than $75M/year to their equity trading profits.[15]
Documents delivered to the media showing that Scotia management had sought advice on terminating Berry prior to the Investment Industry Regulatory Organization of Canada (IIROC) violation accusation, and the results of questioning during the IIROC inquiries strongly suggest that the securities charges were part of a plan by Scotiabank senior management to remove Berry from his position and simultaneously prevent him from becoming their competitor.[16]
In a ruling on January 15, 2013, more than seven years after the initial accusation, a hearing panel of the IIROC dismissed all charges against Berry.[17][18]
David Berry has a filed a $100M wrongful dismissal lawsuit against Scotiabank. As of January 2015, and nine years after Berry was terminated, Scotia settled with Berry on an amount that cannot be disclosed. Barry Critchley, who has been following the story since inception, published an article on November 6, 2014, in which he believes Scotia's $55 million reported legal charges would likely be connected to the $100 million lawsuit; but it is unlikely to be ever found out. [19]
Unpaid overtime lawsuit[edit]
In 2014 a settlement deal in a class-action lawsuit was reached . The agreement would cover thousands of workers for more than a decade of unpaid overtime.The lawsuit included 16,000 Scotiabank employees across Canada who worked as personal banking officers, senior personal banking officers, financial advisors, and small business account managers from January 1, 2000, to December 1, 2013. The lawsuit was filed in 2007, along with a similar class-action filed by CIBC bank teller Dara Fresco of Toronto. Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce said previously that it intends to go to trial.
Employees would receive 1.5 times their standard wage at the time, but no interest. Scotiabank will also pay legal fees of $10.45 million in the case. Plaintiffs' counsels were David O'Connor of Roy O'Connor and Louis Sokolov of Sotos LLP.[20][21]
Fraud in Mexico[edit]
In 2001, $14 million was discovered missing in from one of Scotia's branches in Mexico during an investigation into the murder of a branch manager, Maru Oropesa. Initially, the investigators found that Oropesa and Jaime Ross, her former boss, had illegally transferred $5 million from client investment accounts. The money was eventually transferred to the United States where it was used to purchase three aircraft. As the investigation continued, a total of $14 million was found missing and 16 other bank employees were involved in the fraud.[22] [23] Ross was convicted of fraud and money laundering for his role and sentenced to 15 years.[24] The other 16 bank employees were fired by Scotiabank but were not prosecuted.[22]

History and expansion[edit]




Joseph Howe portrait, 1881 $5 Bill Bank of Nova Scotia


The 19th century[edit]




William Lawson, 1st president of Bank of Nova Scotia, by Robert Field


The bank was incorporated by the Legislative Assembly of Nova Scotia on March 30, 1832, in Halifax, Nova Scotia, with William Lawson (1772–1848) serving as the first president.[6] Scotiabank was founded in Halifax, Nova Scotia, in 1832 under the name of The Bank of Nova Scotia. The bank intended to facilitate the trans-Atlantic trade of the time.[7] Later, in 1883, The Bank of Nova Scotia acquired the Union Bank of Prince Edward Island,[8] although most of the bank's expansion efforts in the century took the form of branch openings.
The bank launched its branch banking system by opening in Windsor, Nova Scotia. The expansion was limited to the Maritimes until 1882, when the bank moved west by opening a branch in Winnipeg, Manitoba. The Manitoba branch later closed but the bank continued to expand into the American Midwest. This included opening a branch in Minneapolis in 1885 which later transferred to Chicago in 1892. Following the collapse of the Commercial Bank of Newfoundland and Union Bank of Newfoundland on December 10, 1894; The Bank of Nova Scotia established on December 15, 1894, in Newfoundland,[6]
In 1899, the bank opened a branch in Boston, Massachusetts.
In the meantime, the bank opened a branch in Kingston, Jamaica, in 1889 to facilitate the trading of sugar, rum and fish. This was Scotiabank's first move into the Caribbean and historically the first branch of a Canadian bank opened outside of the United States or the United Kingdom.[7][8] By the end of the 19th century, the bank was represented in all of the Maritimes, Quebec, Ontario and Manitoba.
In 1900, the bank's headquarters were moved to Toronto, Ontario.[9][8]
The 20th and 21st century[edit]

The bank continued to expand in the 20th century, although its growth now took the form of acquisitions rather than branch openings.

1906 – The bank opened a branch in Havana, Cuba. By 1931, it had five branches in Havana, and one branch each in Camagüey, Cienfuegos, Manzanillo, and Santiago de Cuba. In 1960, the Government of Cuba nationalized all banks in Cuba and the Scotiabank withdrew services from all eight branches.
1907 – The bank opened a branch in New York City.
1910 – The bank opened a branch in San Juan, Puerto Rico.
1913 – The Bank of Nova Scotia merged with the Bank of New Brunswick.[8]
1914 – Toronto-based Metropolitan Bank was acquired, making Scotiabank the fourth largest financial institution in Canada.[8]
1919 – The bank opened a branch in Fajardo, Puerto Rico, located in Puerto Rico's northeast.
1919 – Bank of Ottawa was amalgamated.[8]
1920 – The bank opened a branch in London, and another in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic.
1961 – The bank became the first Canadian bank to appoint women bank managers on September 11, 1961.[6]
1962 – The bank expanded into Asia with the opening of a Representative Office in Japan.[8]
1978 – The bank and Canadian Union of Public Employees signed the first collective agreement between a Canadian bank and a union on September 28, 1978, in Toronto.[6]
2000 – Scotiabank's stake in Mexican bank Grupo Financiero Inverlat is increased to 55 percent. The Mexican bank is subsequently renamed to Grupo Financiero Scotiabank Inverlat.[8]
2003 -The bank's Guangzhou Branch was awarded the first licence to a Canadian bank by the Chinese government to deal in Chinese currency.[6]
2003–2004 – The bank acquired Inverlat banking house in Mexico, taking over all of its branches and establishing a strong presence in the country.
2010 – The bank arrived in Bogotá.
2012 - Scotiabank enters into an agreement to acquire ING Direct Bank of Canada from ING Groep N.V.

In its early expansion, the bank clearly followed trade and its customers' businesses rather than pursuing a strategy of expansion into international financial centres. Scotiabank is a member of the Global ATM Alliance, a joint venture of several major international banks that allows customers of the banks to use their ATM cards or check cards at certain other banks within the Global ATM Alliance without fees when traveling internationally. Other participating banks are Barclays (United Kingdom), Bank of America (United States), BNP Paribas (France and Ukraine through UkrSibbank), Deutsche Bank (Germany), and Westpac (Australia and New Zealand).[10]
The 21st century[edit]
One of the biggest challenges according to Scotia's CEO Rick Waugh is electronic espionage. It is thought that China and Russia engage in electronic spying, and scotia has devoted enormous resources in its effort to protect the privacy of its customers.
Scotia has also spent almost $100 million, implementing a controversial system to report to the United States the account holdings of close to one million Canadians of American origin, and their Canadian born spouses. Scotia has been forced to implement this system in order to comply with FATCA. According to the Financial Post FATCA requires Canadian banks to provide information to the United States including total assets, account balances, account numbers, transactions and more, and includes assets held jointly with Canadian-born spouses and other family members.[11][12]

Portfolio evolution[edit]




Scotiabank traded under ticker BNS on TSX and NYSE.


Throughout the 20th century, the bank grew not only in size, but also in breadth of products and services. Progress was conditioned by changing consumer needs, legal changes, or acquisitions of external service providers. A short list follows:[8]

1954 – Passage of the National Housing Act led Scotiabank to create a mortgage department.
1958 – Changes to Bank Act of 1954 enabled Scotiabank to introduce a consumer credit program.
1986 – Scotia Securities is formed to provide discount brokerage and security underwriting services.
1988 – Brokerage firm McLeod Young Weir Ltd. is acquired.
1994 – Scotiabank acquires Montreal Trustco Inc.
1997 – National Trustco Inc. is acquired for C$1.25 billion.
2012 - ING Direct is acquired for C$3.13 billion (renamed Tangerine in April 2014).

Controversies[edit]
Wrongful dismissal lawsuit[edit]
In June 2005, David Berry, a very successful Canadian Scotiabank trader who had built a $75M/year business in trading preferred shares was fired on the grounds that he had committed securities regulatory violations.[14]
At the time, as part of a 20% direct drive deal, he was making more than double the CEO's salary and Scotiabank management had already taken steps to limit his compensation.[15]
The regulatory violation allegations from his former employer, left him unemployable to Scotia's competitors despite the appeal of potentially adding more than $75M/year to their equity trading profits.[15]
Documents delivered to the media showing that Scotia management had sought advice on terminating Berry prior to the Investment Industry Regulatory Organization of Canada (IIROC) violation accusation, and the results of questioning during the IIROC inquiries strongly suggest that the securities charges were part of a plan by Scotiabank senior management to remove Berry from his position and simultaneously prevent him from becoming their competitor.[16]
In a ruling on January 15, 2013, more than seven years after the initial accusation, a hearing panel of the IIROC dismissed all charges against Berry.[17][18]
David Berry has a filed a $100M wrongful dismissal lawsuit against Scotiabank. As of January 2015, and nine years after Berry was terminated, Scotia settled with Berry on an amount that cannot be disclosed. Barry Critchley, who has been following the story since inception, published an article on November 6, 2014, in which he believes Scotia's $55 million reported legal charges would likely be connected to the $100 million lawsuit; but it is unlikely to be ever found out. [19]
Unpaid overtime lawsuit[edit]
In 2014 a settlement deal in a class-action lawsuit was reached . The agreement would cover thousands of workers for more than a decade of unpaid overtime.The lawsuit included 16,000 Scotiabank employees across Canada who worked as personal banking officers, senior personal banking officers, financial advisors, and small business account managers from January 1, 2000, to December 1, 2013. The lawsuit was filed in 2007, along with a similar class-action filed by CIBC bank teller Dara Fresco of Toronto. Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce said previously that it intends to go to trial.
Employees would receive 1.5 times their standard wage at the time, but no interest. Scotiabank will also pay legal fees of $10.45 million in the case. Plaintiffs' counsels were David O'Connor of Roy O'Connor and Louis Sokolov of Sotos LLP.[20][21]
Fraud in Mexico[edit]
In 2001, $14 million was discovered missing in from one of Scotia's branches in Mexico during an investigation into the murder of a branch manager, Maru Oropesa. Initially, the investigators found that Oropesa and Jaime Ross, her former boss, had illegally transferred $5 million from client investment accounts. The money was eventually transferred to the United States where it was used to purchase three aircraft. As the investigation continued, a total of $14 million was found missing and 16 other bank employees were involved in the fraud.[22] [23] Ross was convicted of fraud and money laundering for his role and sentenced to 15 years.[24] The other 16 bank employees were fired by Scotiabank but were not prosecuted.[22]

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion

Data Format: N-Triples RDF

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
