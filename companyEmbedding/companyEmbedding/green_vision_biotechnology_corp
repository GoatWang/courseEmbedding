Changes Resulting from the Investment
Transaction


The closing of the Investment Transaction occurred on May 12,
2017, resulting in a change of control of GVBT. Prior to closing
of the Investment Transaction, GVBT had a total of 60,790,000
shares of common stock issued and outstanding. As a result of the
closing of the Investment Transaction, GVBT now has a total of
160,790,000 shares of its common stock issued and outstanding, of
which 60,790,000 shares, or approximately 37.8%, are owned by the
previous existing shareholders of GVBT, with the balance of
100,000,000 shares, or approximately 62.2%, owned by the previous
shareholders of Lutu International, with certain shares held in
escrow to the Escrow Agreement.


Following the closing of the Investment Transaction, GVBT will
carry on the business of the Lutu Group. The Lutu Group, with its
operation primarily located in the Shanxi Province of China, is
engaged in the biotechnology industry, in particular, the
production and distribution of bio-fertilizers. Revenues of the
Lutu Group are currently generated from China.


The shareholding structure of GVBT after the Investment
Transaction is as follows:











Page 7 of 93











Changes to the Board of Directors and
Officers


Simultaneous with the closing of the Investment Transaction,
there was a change in the officers and directors of GVBT. As
authorized by the bylaws, the existing director of GVBT, Mr. Ma
Wai Kin, appointed two (2) additional members to the Board of
GVBT. Such members are Mr. Lam Ching Wan (also known as William
Lam) and Mr. Leung Kwong Tak (also known as Dr. Michael Leung).
Mr. Ma also appointed Mr. William Lam as GVBTs Chief Executive
Officer and Mr. Lo Kwok Leung as GVBTs Chief Financial Officer.
Mr. Lo Kwok Leung is not related to Dr. Michael Leung.


All members of the Board shall hold their respective offices for
a term of one year from their respective dates of appointment, or
until the election and qualification of their successors, and
thereafter to resign as a director of GVBT. In accordance with
the bylaws, officers are elected by the board of directors and
serve at the discretion of the board of directors.



Accounting Treatment


The Investment Transaction is being accounted for as a
reverse-merger and recapitalization. For financial reporting
purposes, Lutu International is the acquirer and GVBT is the
acquired company. Consequently, the assets, liabilities and
operations of GVBT that will be reflected in the historical
financial statements prior to the Investment Transaction will be
those of Lutu International and will be recorded at the
historical cost basis of Lutu International.


Tax Treatment and SEC Filer Status: Small Business
Issuer


The Investment Transaction is intended to constitute a
reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the
Code), or such other tax free reorganization
exemptions that may be available under the Code. Immediately
following the Investment Transaction, the filer status of GVBT
will be a smaller reporting company as defined in Item 10(f)(1)
of Regulation S-K, as promulgated by SEC.


Implications of Being an Emerging Growth
Company


As a company with less than $1.0 billion in revenue during our
last fiscal year, we qualify as an “emerging growth company” as
defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or
the JOBS Act. An emerging growth company may take advantage of
reduced reporting and other burdens that are otherwise applicable
generally to public companies. These provisions include:






a requirement to have only two years of audited financial
statements and only two years of related Management’s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations disclosure; and








an exemption from the auditor attestation requirement in the
assessment of our internal control over financial reporting
to the Sarbanes- Oxley Act of 2002.




We may take advantage of these provisions until the end of the
fiscal year ending after the fifth anniversary of our initial
public offering or such earlier time that we are no longer an
emerging growth company, and if we do, the information that we
provide to the stockholders may be different than you might get
from other public companies in which you hold equity. We would
cease to be an emerging growth company if we have more than $1.0
billion in annual revenue, have more than $700 million in market
value of our ordinary shares held by non-affiliates, or issue
more than $1.0 billion of non-convertible debt over a three-year
period. The JOBS Act permits an “emerging growth company” like
us to take advantage of an extended transition period to comply
with new or revised accounting standards applicable to public
companies.

Green Vision Biotechnology Corp. (the Company), formerly known as
Vibe Wireless Corp., formerly known as Any Translation Corp., was
incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on July 5,
2012. We were founded to be in the business of translation and
interpretation. The Company undertook translation and
interpretation projects for various fields from business,
economics, to science issues. The Company later adopted a
business plan to pursue business opportunities in the global
telecommunications industry.


On September 2, 2015, a change in control of the Company took
place by virtue of the Company’s largest shareholder and sole
officer and director at that time, selling 4,000,000 shares of
the Company’s common stock to Forestbay Capital Partners II,
LLC, a Delaware limited liability company. Such shares
represented 65.8% of the Company’s total issued and outstanding
shares of common stock. As part of the sale of the shares,
Forestbay Capital Partners arranged with the former officer and
director, prior to his resignation as the sole officer and
director of the Company Board, to appoint Mr. Edward Mooney as
the sole officer and director of the Company. Mr. Mooney is the
Manager of Forestbay Capital Partners II, LLC.


On November 12, 2015, we changed our name to Vibe Wireless Corp
in connection with merging with our wholly-owned subsidiary. This
name change and our ticker symbol change was acknowledged by
FINRA and effected in the market on November 23, 2015.


The Company was originally incorporated under the laws of the
State of Nevada on July 5, 2012 as Any Translation Corp.


On September 30, 2016, the Company filed a Certificate of
Amendment with the Nevada Secretary of State (the Nevada SOS)
whereby it amended its Articles of Incorporation by increasing
the Companys authorized number of shares of common stock from 75
million to 750 million and increasing all of its issued and
outstanding shares of common stock at a ratio of ten (10) shares
for every one (1) share held. The Companys Board of Directors
approved this amendment on September 30, 2016.


On September 30, 2016, the Company filed Articles of Merger with
the Nevada SOS whereby it entered into a statutory merger with
its wholly-owned subsidiary, Green Vision Biotechnology Corp. to
Nevada Revised Statutes 92A.200 et. seq. The effect of such
merger is that the Company is the surviving entity and changed
its name to Green Vision Biotechnology Corp.

2016.


The investment transaction under the share exchange agreements
and contractual agreements as described above in Section 1.01 of
this current report on Form 8-K (collectively the
Transaction Agreements) entered into between
each of the Shareholders of Lutu International and GVBT (the
Investment Transaction) was completed on May 10,
2017. As a result of closing the Investment Transaction, GVBT
acquired part of the shares of Lutu International and assumed
management of the Lutu Group.


1. Overview


Shanxi Lutu was incorporated in 2006 in the Shanxi Province of
China as a domestic company. It was acquired by Hong Kong
Prolific and was converted into a wholly foreign-owned enterprise
(WFOE) in 2012. Its mission is to strive for
production of fertilizer products in China which are
ecologically, socially and economically friendly. Its production
activities and products are based on the Principles of Organic
Agriculture.


Figure 1- Jinzhong City, Shanxi Province










Page 11 of 93











2. Corporate History and
Background


Microbiologists working for Shanxi Lutu have spent years
developing a mixture of microorganisms to manufacture
bio-fertilizers from locally available mineral shale which
originally cannot be used as fertilizers. They arrived at a
mixture of various strains of microorganisms and invented a new
product of mineral-based bio-fertilizers (the
MBF). Shanxi Lutu currently holds a patent in
PRC on the production method of the MBF produced (Patent number:
ZL200910073705.5) and hence believes possesses the microbial
technology to manufacture MBF directly from mineral shale.


In 2011, Shanxi Lutu purchased a piece of industrial land with
34,256 square meters to expand its production capacity. In the
same year, an approval to produce 500,000 tons per annum of
fertilizers was granted by the PRC Government. After several
rounds of corporate transactions and fundraising, Shanxi Lutu is
now a WFOE owned by Hong Kong Prolific with the current
shareholding structure described in the following section. At
present, Shanxi Lutu has a production capacity of 100,000 tons
per annum.


3. The Fertilizers Industry


3.1 Essential Plant Nutrients


Nutrients are essential for healthy plant growth. Plants need the
right combination of nutrients to live, grow and reproduce. Three
(3) non-mineral nutrients, carbon (C), hydrogen (H) and Oxygen
(O), are supplied by air (in the form of carbon dioxide) and
water. Fifteen (15) essential mineral nutrients are supplied by
the soil system. Mineral nutrients in the soil are classified
into macro-nutrients and micro-nutrients depending on the
quantity required. Macro-nutrients are further categorized into
primary and secondary nutrients. Primary nutrients are needed in
large quantities and are usually in deficiency. They are Nitrogen
(N), Phosphorus (P) and Potassium (K). Secondary nutrients are
also needed in large quantities but are usually in sufficient
supply in the soil. They are Calcium (Ca), Magnesium (Mg) and
Sulphur (S). Micronutrients are needed in small amounts. Examples
of micronutrients are Copper (Cu), Boron (B), Iron (Fe),
Manganese (Mn), Chlorine (Cl), Molybdenum (Mo) and Zinc (Zn).

Fertilizers are mainly classified according to three essential
crop nutrients: Nitrogen (N), Phosphate (P) and Potassium (K).
Each nutrient plays a distinct role in plant development:
Nitrogen is a major component of chlorophyll for photosynthesis.
Phosphates can promote the development of healthy roots, flowers,
and fruits and help plants to mature promptly. Potassium can
increase water intake of crops and increase crop resistance to
disease and heat (Deloitte: Chemical quarterly
2013-Q2).


To make sure the amounts of mineral nutrients are sufficient for
continuing growth of plants and crops, fertilizers containing
primary nutrients are usually added to the soil to replenish the
lacking of natural supply nutrients after crops harvest. Blended
NPK fertilizers for easier application are also found nowadays.

3.2 World Total Fertilizer Nutrients (NPK) Production
and Consumption


According to IFADATA, the world total fertilizer (NPK) production
was around 194 million tons in 2014. China was the largest global
producer of total NPK fertilizers, and produced around 58 million
tons which represented about 30% of global production share in
year 2014 (Figures 1 and 2).

According to the PotashCorp Market Overview presented at the TFI
World Fertilizer Conference, September 2015 (the
PotashCorp Market Report), the major consumption
countries of world fertilizer nutrients (NPK) are the developing
countries in Asia and Latin America. Together with North America,
these major fertilizer-consuming regions account for more than
80% of world fertilizer consumption. Nitrogen and Phosphate use
are more heavily concentrated in China and India, while the
Potash consumption is dstributed among a number of major regions.
Figure 5 depicts the world individual fertilizer consumption
distribution by region in 2014. Potash is any of various mined
and manufactured salts that contain potassium in water-soluble
form. Common potash compounds include potassium chloride,
potassium sulfate or potassium nitrate.

Conference, September 2015


According to the Potash Corp Market Report, the steady growth in
crop production serves as a key driver of fertilizer demand.
World consumption of grains and oilseeds has grown at an
annualized rate of approximately 2.2% from the period of 1995 to
2015. The fertilizer consumption has risen at an average annual
rate of approximately 2% over the past same periods, with the
rate of Potash consumption growing most quickly among the primary
nutrients. Figure 6 indicates the trend of world crop production
and fertilizer consumption over the period from 1995 to 2015.

3.3 World Fertilizer Nutrients (NPK) Consumption
Outlooks


According to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United
Nations (FAO), the total fertilizer nutrient (NPK) consumption is
estimated at 185 million tons in 2014 and is forecast to reach
187 million tons in 2015. Meanwhile, the consumption is expected
to reach 199 million tons by the end of 2019 with a successive
growth of 1.6% per year. Figure 6 shows the forecasts of world

3.4 China Fertilizer Nutrients (NPK)
Consumption


According to the PotashCorp Market Report, China has expanded its
Nitrogen and Phosphate capacity over the past two decades. As a
result, China is self-sufficient in both Nitrogen and Phosphate
nutrients, and in recent years became a significant net exporter
of both. In 2015, Chinas consumption of Nitrogen and Phosphate
were estimated at approximately 34 million tons and 13 million
tons respectively. On the other hand, Chinas consumption of
Potash nutrients was estimated at 14 million tons and it needs to
import about 55% of Potash in order to meet its Potash
requirement in 2015. In recent years, China has increased its
domestic production of Potash nutrient through the ramp-up of
domestic capacities. However, additional capacity growth could be
limited by the amount of space on the salt lakes and the quality
of known reserves in the Qinghai Province of China.

Conference, September 2015


3.5 World Bio-Fertilizer Outlook


The excessive application of agrochemicals on crops has led to
soil contamination and other environmental hazards. The
bio-fertilizers, being as an eco-friendly option, help to
maintain soil and crop health. Nitrogen-fixing,
Phosphate-solubilizing and Potash-mobilizing are currently key
bio-fertilizer types.


The NOVONOUS report Global Bio-Fertilizer 2016-2020 estimates
that global bio-fertilizer market will grow at a CAGR of 13.9% by
2020. The growth drivers are mainly due to increasing penetration
of bio-fertilizers in agriculture, increasing demand for organic
products and easy availability of affordable bio-fertilizer
products to end users. The report found that most of the growth
in bio-fertilizers can be attributed to the affordable cost of
bio-fertilizer, increasing concern on sustainable farming, rising
governmental support and environmental regulations.








Page 19 of 93











According to the NOVONOUS report, Nitrogen-fixing and
Phosphate-solubilizing bio-fertilizers dominate the first and
second largest market share in the global bio-fertilizer market.
NOVONOUS estimates that the global Nitrogen-fixing and global
Phosphate-solubilizing bio-fertilizer markets are expected to
grow at a CAGR of 13.25% and 20.75% respectively till 2020.


In terms of bio-fertilizers by microorganism type,
Azospirillum-based and Azotobacter-based bio-fertilizers
currently dominate the first and second largest market share in
global bio-fertilizers. As per NOVONOUS estimates, global
Azospirillum and Azotobacter bio-fertilizers market are expected
to grow at a CAGR of 11% and 13% respectively till 2020.


In terms of geographical location, the North America and Europe
bio-fertilizer markets dominate the first and second largest
market share in global bio-fertilizers. NOVONOUS estimates that
the North America and Europe bio-fertilizer markets are expected
to grow at a CAGR of 16.65% and 14.90% respectively till 2020.
The Asia Pacific bio-fertilizer market captures the third largest
market share in global bio-fertilizer market. NOVONOUS estimates
that the Asia Pacific bio-fertilizer market is expected to grow
at a CAGR of 11.40% till 2020.


3.6 Trend of Using Organic
and Bio-fertilizers in
China


According to the report Major Results of Investigation and
Assessment of Agricultural Land Classes throughout the Country
released by the PRC Ministry of Land and Resources, about 70.6%
of the agricultural land in China was classified as medium to low
classes in terms of soil nutrient conditions, indicating that the
fertility of soil in China has been degenerating and affecting
the quality of produce and food.


In the last three decades, chemical fertilizers accounted for
more than 80% of the fertilizer market in China, and it was
commonly believed that it was one of the most important factors
attributing to the continuous and serious degeneration of soil
fertility in China. Many agronomists in China now believe that
the increasing use of organic and bio-fertilizers will be the
upcoming solution to improve the soil nutrient quality of
farmland in China.


On 29th July 2015, the PRC Ministry of Industry and
Information Technology published a policy document titled
Instructive Opinion about the Changing Development of Chemical
Fertilizer Industry in China, encouraging the development of new,
effective and environmentally friendly fertilizers, and looking
forward to increasing the use of new fertilizers (non-chemical
fertilizers) from 10% to 30% for fertilizer applications in
China.








Page 20 of 93











In addition, the PRC Ministry of Agriculture pronounced in its
annual prominent Document No. 1 in 2016 that the zero-growth of
chemical fertilizers in China target has to be achieved by 2020
in China. Parallel with this policy, the increasing uses of
microbial compound fertilizer, liquid-type, specialized,
slow-release and controlled-release fertilizers would become the
future trend in the fertilizer market in China in the upcoming
years.


3.7 Classification of Fertilizers in the China
Market


There are many ways to classify fertilizers. Fertilizers are
usually divided into inorganic fertilizers, organic fertilizers
and microbial fertilizers. Currently, inorganic fertilizers have
a decisive market share and impact in the fertilizer market
followed by organic fertilizer. In contrast, microbial
fertilizers have a lesser share of the fertilizer market.


According to the rules and regulations under the Measures for the
Administration of Fertilizer Registration, PRC National Standard
for Fertilizer and Soil Conditioner Terminology (GB/T 6274-1997),
PRC Agricultural Industry Standards NY 525-2012, NY884-2012 and
NY/T 798-2015, the following terms shall have the following
meanings in Chinas fertilizers market:






i.


Fertilizer: its main function is to provide nutrients for
plants. (GB/T 6274-1997)








ii.


Inorganic [mineral] fertilizer: its nutrients are in the form
of inorganic salt fertilizer, which is made by the
extraction, physical and/or chemical industrial method
(sulfur, calcium cyanamide, urea and its contraction, and
bone powder superphosphate are usually classified as
inorganic fertilizers). (GB/T 6274-1997)








iii.


Complex fertilizer: a fertilizer manufactured only by
chemical method, and its components are specified with at
least 2 out of the 3 nutrients, namely Nitrogen, Phosphorus,
Potassium. (GB/T 6274-1997)








iv.


Organic fertilizer: a fertilizer containing carbon, its
components mainly made from plants and/or animals. (NY
525-2012)








v.


Microbial fertilizer: it refers to fertilizer products which
contain specific living microorganisms and have specific
fertilizers effects when applied to agricultural production.
The specific fertilizers effects include the provision of
good conditions of soil and plant environment, and include
the provision of necessary nutrients to crops, together with
beneficial effects from metabolism of these microorganisms
upon plants. (Measures for the Administration of Fertilizer
Registration)








vi.


Organic microbial fertilizer: it is made by combining
microorganisms which have specific function, and organic
materials (mainly animal and plant residues such as livestock
and poultry manure, crop stalks, etc.) which are disinfected
and decomposed. They possess the functions of both microbial
fertilizers and organic fertilizers. (NY884-2012)








vii.


Compound microbial fertilizer: it is a vivo microbial product
with a combination of specific microorganisms and nutrients,
which can provide, maintain or improve plant nutrition,
improve the yield of agricultural products or improve the
quality of agricultural products. (NY / T 798-2015)









Page 21 of 93











3.8 Classification of our Fertilizers


Currently, our fertilizer products have passed the product
standard promulgated by the Ministry of Agriculture and hence
have obtained the registration certificate of compound microbial
fertilizers from the Ministry of Agriculture (as described in
Section 5.1 and 5.2 below) to the Measures for the Administration
of Fertilizer Registration. In other words, our products are
fertilizer products which contain specific living microorganisms
and have specific effects when applied in agricultural
production. The specific effects include the provision of
nutrients to soil and crops and beneficial effects on the
metabolism of plants.


4. Production of
Mineral-based Bio-fertilizer
(MBF)


As discussed above, China lacks high-quality soluble Potash
resources. Almost all the current proven Potash resources (i.e.
soluble ones) are in the remote Provinces of Qinghai and
Xinjiang. These Potash resources mainly exist as brine in salt
lakes instead of in rock salt mines common in Canada or FSU. Such
resources are generally lower in grading and more polluting
during the extraction process. China has abundant resources in
insoluble Potash. However, it is difficult to convert such
insoluble Potash resources into fertilizers under existing
technology.


Figure 9 Distribution of Potash Resources in China










Page 22 of 93











Most common chemical Potash fertilizers are readily available in
China. However, the overuse of chemical Potash fertilizers in
general can cause pollution problems, deterioration in soil
quality including soil hardening and alkalinity, and exhaustion
of other secondary and micronutrients not added in chemical
fertilizers. All these further reduce soil fertility and
ultimately making it barren.


Through repeated research and testing, we developed and invented
our MBF out of a mixture of microorganisms from locally available
mineral shale which originally cannot be used as fertilizers.


Certain bacteria, called Potash solubilizing bacteria, are
capable of decomposing minerals in feldspar and mica crystals
present in soils and rocks to release the Potassium contained
therein.


A wide range of bacteria has been reported to release K from
K-bearing minerals in soils, but little information is available
on Potassium solubilization by bacteria, their mechanisms of
solubilization and effect of such bacteria inoculation on
nutrient availability in soils and growth of different crops.


The efficiency of K solubilization was found to vary with various
factors, including:







the nature of Potassium bearing minerals;





the bacterial strains used;





acidity; and





aerobic conditions.




A lot of researchers and scholars around the world are carrying
out studies in this regard, including China and India where
Potash is in serious shortage.








Page 23 of 93











Our new product of MBF is a proven product that can serve as a
low cost alternative for China, that is suitable for various
applications, and that is sustainable and environmentally
friendly. Shanxi Lutu currently holds a patent in PRC on the
production method of the MBF produced (Patent number:
ZL200910073705.5).


4.1 Production Process


Shanxi Lutus MBF are manufactured from mineral shale which
contains a significant amount of unavailable Potassium and other
minerals beneficial to plants. Microorganisms are added to
release such minerals to become rapidly available nutrients and
slowly available nutrients in the soil. Our fertilizers can also
be doses of Potassium solubilizing bacteria to be applied
directly to crops and soils to release unavailable minerals and
Potassium already present in the field. Our MBF production
process is shown in the following figure:


Figure 10 Mineral-based Bio-Fertiizer Manufacturing Process





* Potassium Solubilising Bacteria and Phosphate Solubilising
Bacteria include Bacillus megairiusdebary, Bacillus mucilaginosus
and/or Bacillussubtilis.








Page 24 of 93











4.2 Raw Material Sourcing for Manufacturing of
our Mineral-based
Bio-fertilizer


The sources of raw materials are elaborated below:





Mineral Shale




Historical Procurement: According to news reports, Shanxi
Province ranks as one of the top provinces in China in
terms of the reserve of mineral shale. Apart from Shanxi,
mineral shale are mainly found in Guizhou Province.






Bacteria




The mixture of strains of bacteria that is most suitable
for application to the local mineral shale was tested and
tried by our scientists and researchers in the past years.
Our scientists and researchers currently safeguard the
exact details of the strains of bacteria used and have been
in storage. These act as seed strains which can be later
used and multiplied in the production facilities when
production starts.






Humic Acid




Humic acid is obtained after processing the matters
obtained from the decay of organic matter. Humic acid is in
abundant supply and easily obtained in the Shanxi
(especially in the cities of Yangquan, Jinzhong, Xinzhou,
Lvliang and Linfen),Yunnan and Guizhou Provinces.






Ammonium Chloride, Urea, MAP, MOP




These are common chemical fertiliser ingredients and are
either industrial products or imported. They are widely
available on the market.





4.3 Existing Facility


We acquired a piece of industrial land in Jinzhong city in Shanxi
Province in 2011 as a manufacturing plant. The industrial land
use right lasts until 2054. The size of the manufacturing plant
is 34,256 square meters. We have completed the phase 1 facilities
with an annual production capacity of 100,000 tons per annum. The
facilities were tested and adjusted, and are now ready for full
scale production.


According to the laws of the PRC, the government owns all the
land in the PRC. Companies or individuals are authorized to
possess and use the land only through the land use rights granted
by the government. The land use rights represent cost of the
rights to use the land in respect of properties located in the
PRC.


Lutu currently owns the land use right of the production plant.
The expiry date of the land use right is May 8, 2054. The
building and land use right are under the name of “Shanxi Lutu”
or Shanxi Green Biotechnology Industry Limited. Regarding the
cost of the land use right and building, please refer to Audit
Report F21 and F22: the cost of Land use rights is USD 1,158,222
and Buildings are USD 2,877,610. The address of Lutus production
plant is Chang Ning Town West, Chang Ning Village, Yuci District,
Jinzhong City, Shanxi Province, China.


Once we have entered into full operation, we would like to
further expand our existing production facilities from the
present phase I (100,000 tons per annum) to phase II (200,000
tons per annum), and then to Phase III (500,000 tons per annum)
to address the existing needs of the customers, to grab market
share and to expand into other markets such as the soil amendment
market.

5.2 Specialized
Mineral-based
Bio-fertilizer for Rice Production


Rice is the major staple food in southern China. According to
STATISTA, the statistics portal, China is the largest consumption
country of rice in the world in 2015/16, followed by India. Both
China and India, the two countries with the first and second
largest population, consume the largest amount of rice in
2015/06. Figure 13 indicates the ranking of rice consumption
amongst 10 major countries in 2015/16.

https://www.statista.com/statistics/255971/top-countries-based-on-rice-consumption-2012-2013/


According to the report Chinas agricultural challenges-Roads to
be travelled (October 2015; USDA PWC Report) (the PWC
Report), milled rice productions in China has been
increasing gradually for the period from 2004/05 to 2014/15.
However, the increase of milled rice consumption in China has
exceeded its production since 2012/13, and therefore China has to
increase its milled rice import since 2012/13. Figure 14 depicts
the trend of milled rice productions and consumption in China
from 2004/05 to 2014/15.

During the growth of rice, there are certain peak periods for
absorption of nutrients. In addition, there is uniqueness in the
nutrients required during the growth of rice in which trace
elements like Zinc and Silicon are essential.








Page 31 of 93











Shanxi Lutus specialized fertilizers for rice are designed
according to the growth characteristics of rice and the nutrients
required. According to the field trial conducted by the Soil and
Fertilizer Station of Jinzhong City, Shanxi for the period from
April 2015 to November 2015, there was a 26.2% increase in output
of rice when our 25% Lu Kun Dan microbial compound fertilizer was
applied in the field. Our fertilizers also contain major
nutrients and trace elements such as Zinc and Silicon, which are
essential elements to the proper and normal growth of rice. Our
specialized fertilizers for rice have gone through field trial
for a full harvesting season. Results of the field trial in
Shanxi and reports from some users showed that, by applying our
specialized rice fertilizers, the output of rice is higher.


5.3 Clients and Trials


The use of fertilisers affects crop yield significantly, and
fertilisers of low quality or with impurities may in fact pollute
the soil and kill or inhibit seed germination or plant growth
instead. Therefore farmers are very careful when they switch
fertilisers and have asked us to provide samples for field trial
before extensive use of our fertilizers.


Shanxi Lutu has approached several clients and provided them with
samples for field trials throughout 2015 after a small scale
production at the plant facilities is possible. Potential clients
have designated a small area of their farmland as trial zones and
apply fertilizers from us instead of their usual fertilisers,
while the rest of their farmland have continued using their usual
fertilisers as a control. Germinating and growing condition of
the crops are studied during the period, and yield and produce
analysis are done after harvest.


Some of our clients have produced internal official reports to
evaluate the performance of our fertilizers as shown below. Those
reports were in Chinese format and we did not have the translated
copies. In summary, our fertilizers generated a positive feedback
from field trial around crop yield and the performance results
varied from similar performance to significant increase in
performance in comparison with the currently available
fertilizers in the market.

6.Our Marketing and Sales Strategy


6.1 Marketing Strategy


As of 2017, Shanxi Lutu is at the development stage of selling
its products. Sales of the fertilizers mainly concentrate in
various vegetables, fruit crops, rice and maize. As China has
over 30 million hectare of rice fields (National Bureau of
Statistics of China), consumption of fertilizers was estimated to
be in the range of 20-30 million tons per annum.


In 2017, the marketing strategy of Shanxi Lutu in China will be
adjusted and will include the following major aspects:-






(1)


focusing on the sales of specialized fertilizers for rice;








(2)


continuing to develop the organic fertilizers market for
vegetables and fruits; and








(3)


continuing to develop the organic bio-fertilizers market.




7. Customers


After years of research and preparation, Shanxi Lutu has begun
production and has established a sales team to carry out sales
and marketing activities in 2016. Most sales transactions are
done through distributorships at the moment. Our major
distributors at this stage are as follows:






a)


Heilongjiang based distributor, which is distributing our
products in 10 counties in the Heilongjiang Province;








b)


Shanxi based distributors, who are distributing our products
in 5 counties in the Shanxi Province; and








c)


Distributors in other provinces: Hainan, Fujian, Inner
Mongolia, Hebei, and Yunnan.




Since China is a big country with huge territories, our marketing
strategy is to secure more distributorship deals from nation-wide
distributors to penetrate into the markets of different regions
in China. In addition to the distributors in the provinces
mentioned above, we are developing our sales network in the
Provinces of Jilin, Jiangxi, Sichuan, Hunan and Hubei. We are
actively looking for distributors in these provinces.


8. Product Delivery


There are two means of transportation for fertilizers in China.
If the destination is over 300 km away, rail transportation is
preferred. If the destination is within 300 km, road
transportation is preferred.


8.1 Rail Transportation


According to the Notice on Adjusting Railway Freight Price to
Further Improve Price Formation Mechanism promulgated by the
National Development and Reform Commission, the national rail
freight benchmark rate of goods is increased by an average of 1
cent per ton of kilometers, that is, from the current 14.51 cents
to 15.51 cents.


There are also other costs including loading fees, railway
station service fees, railway handling costs and other expenses.
The freight fees are usually borne by the purchaser.


8.2 Road Transportation


The purchaser normally arranges for the transportation and pays
for the freight fees.








Page 37 of 93











8.3 Timing


The location of the client determines their fertiliser
application schedule and needs. Farmers in Northern provinces of
China need to apply fertilisers in spring. They generally have
only one harvest in a year and delivery needs to be made around
March. Farmers in southern provinces of China can produce two to
three harvests a year and generally order year round.


.4 Logistics Arrangements and
Pricing


Shanxi Lutu generally prices its orders free on board in Taiyuan.
We can make logistics arrangements on behalf of the client or
deliver the product to designated locations at the cost of the
client, either by charging the cost directly back to the client
or building the cost into an elevated mark-up unit price.


8.5 Payment Terms


In line with the current practice of payments in the fertilizers
industry in China, our clients general will settle the majority
of payments with us after harvest, when the produce is sold on
the market and their working capital is recouped. This is
especially true for clients in the north-eastern provinces as
crop growths is slower and produce only one harvest during the
year. However, some users (usually the smaller distributors) may
agree to paying an upfront payment of around 30-100%, given they
can have multiple harvests during the year. Therefore, there is a
significant working capital requirement upfront to start
production.


9. Employees


Shanxi Lutu currently has about 28 employees in various
departments: production, engineering and maintenance,
administration, sales and marketing, finance and accounting.
Shanxi Lutu usually retains around 50 individuals in the capacity
of independent contractors during the peak season to assist
production.


10. Competition


10.1 Competitive Advantages


Our developing experience and technology combine to obtain
several competitive advantages as follows:





1.


Nature of MBF:










Page 38 of 93
















Through the life activities of microorganisms, Shanxi Lutus
MBF are able to promote crop growth, improve the resistance
of crops to pests, improve the quality of crops and provide
soil amendment directly or indirectly.









Our MBF can reduce the usage of chemical fertilizers and
pesticides significantly and are proven more efficient than
other brands of fertilizers in decomposing the existing
chemical fertilizers and pesticides accumulated in soil.
(See Figure 16: Trial Results and Promotion Notice of a
Heilongjiang based Client and Figure 17: Trial Results of a
Chongqing based Client).








2.


Patents were granted for MBF production.









We obtained a patent of the production method of MBF in 2012.








We also have two other patent applications pending the
approval of State Intellectual Property Office in the PRC and
one patent application which is in the process of PCT and is
prepared to be submitted to United States Patent and
Trademark Office (USPTO) for registration.








Once the approval procedures of these patent applications are
completed, we can benefit from more tax reductions under the
policies of the PRC government.







3.


Our bio-fertiliser products have received positive feedback
from clients









Our products have been tested in several locations in China
with local farmers and users, and have received favourable
feedbacks.







4.


We do not currently observe the emergence of other
significant competitors in the market.









We have already established our phase I production facilities
of 100,000 tons per annum and operations.








We have not yet been aware that there is another significant
competitor within the Shanxi Province with comparable scale
or product quality. We do not guarantee that there will be no
emergence of other significant competitors in the future.







5.


Our research and development capability allows further
expansion to other parts of China.









We have research and development capability and have
successfully landed on breakthroughs with further patent
applications in 2014 after the initial patent.








We are able to perform studies on the feasibility of
utilising mineral resources in other parts of China to
establish production facilities outside of our initial
facilities.







6.


Our MBF benefits from the following Chinas state policies of
enhancing the potential of the organic and bio-fertilizers
markets in China. These state policies highlight the
conservation of agricultural environment and emphasize that
preventive measures tackling agricultural pollution should be
stepped up and zero growth of the usage of chemical
fertilizers should be achieved.









Page 39 of 93
















The Action Plan of Achieving Zero Growth of Chemical
Fertilizers Usage at 2020 promulgated by the Ministry of
Agriculture in February, 2015.








CPC Central Committee on National Economic and Social
Development Five-Year Plan published in November, 2015.








Certain Opinions on Implementing New Ideas of Development and
Accelerating Modernization of Agriculture to Realize the Goal
of Comprehensive Water Conservancy published in December,
2015 and Prevention of Soil Pollution Action Plan published
in May, 2016.







7.


Our products which benefit from the Tax Reductions Policy
favors organic fertilizers in China.









According to the Notice Concerning the Clarification of
Enforcement Standard of Organic Fertilizers published by the
State Administration of Taxation in January, 2016, taxpayers
can be exempted from VAT if they engage in the production,
distribution or retail of organic fertilizer products.
Accordingly, we are exempted from paying the VAT tax, which
is currently 17%.








In addition, after Shanxi Lutu has obtained the
above-mentioned two patents, it is believed that we will be
categorized as Advanced Technology Companies and can benefit
from profit tax reductions from the current rate of 25% to
15%.







8.


We believe we are poised to become one of the largest
mineral-based bio-fertiliser and compound bio-fertiliser
manufacturers with consistent product quality and competent
quality control.








We believe that there are not many competitors in China which
can provide the same comprehensive fertilizing solution to
farmers with complete provision of macronutrients (N, P, K),
secondary nutrients and micronutrients.




10.2 Competitive Disadvantages





1.


We need to fully utilize our production capacity.









Some of our clients wish to order more. But we lack the
working capital to start production to meet our clients
demands.










Page 40 of 93














2.


We have limited sales networks.









We need to expand the sales networks to diversify our sales
and penetrate into different regions in China.







3.


Our research and development capability is limited.









Although we have developed several fertilizer products, we
still need to recruit more scientists and researchers to
develop new products.




11. Intellectual Property


11.1 Our Key Technology


Shanxi Lutu possesses the technology to produce organic
microbiological (multi-element compound microorganism)
fertilizers, which can serve as a low cost alternative of
fertilizers for China, that are suitable for various
applications, and that are sustainable and environmentally
friendly. The microbial ingredients of our patented technology
have the effect to solubilize the insoluble minerals (including
Phosphorus and Potassium) in the soil or in Potash shale through
bio-degradation. This technology allows us to extract insoluble
minerals (including Potassium) from Potash shale. As mentioned,
the ability to extract insoluble minerals (including Potassium)
from mineral shale effectively reduces production cost and allows
us to utilize reliable raw materials. It also shortens the
manufacturing process by replacing chemical Potash extraction
processes with bio-degradation.


The microbial ingredients can also be added to the fertilizer
products sold to customers. The microbial contents added to the
fertilizer products can solubilize the insoluble Phosphorus and
Potassium in the soil. As a result, the now soluble Phosphorus
and Potassium can be easily absorbed by crops or plants.
Therefore, the fertilizer products of Shanxi Lutu are also soil
conditioners with the effect of amending and improving soil
qualities. Such result cannot be achieved by chemical
fertilizers. Hence, our fertilizer products have a competitive
edge over chemical fertilizers.


Shanxi Lutu produces various fertilizers through the combination
of various percentages of minerals, humic acid, bacteria and
other supplementary ingredients. We can undergo raw material
procurement for organic microbiological fertilizer production.


The minerals shale is currently available in different provinces
in China. Shanxi Lutu has signed an agreement with a village in
Shanxi to utilize such mineral shale. Local workers from the
village can be hired to extract the mineral shale without
significant difficulties. Humic acid is a by-product of coal
mines and is abundantly present in the markets in many provinces
of China. Other supplements are usually commonly available and
purchased at the market.








Page 41 of 93











The currently marketed products are designed to be in pellet
forms that would be easy for farmers to apply. Both products have
obtained the necessary fertilizer registration certificates from
the Ministry of Agriculture.

12. Research and Development


In order to further improve and enhance our fertilizer products,
we have collaborated with what we believe are reputable academic
institutions in China and Hong Kong to carry out further research
and tests to our fertilizer products. We have recently started a
trial program with the Rice Crops Research Laboratory of the
Guangdong Agricultural Science Institute to test our various
fertilizer products as applied to different types of rice seeds
in the Guangdong Province. The objective of the test is to find
out the best combinations of rice seeds and fertilizers
(especially organic bio-fertilizers) for rice production in terms
of both quality and quantity.


One of our fertilizer products, Lutu Brand Microbial Organic
Fertilizers specialized for vegetable and fruit crops, was
approved as an organic fertilizer by the Organic Food Development
and Certification Centre of China (the OFDC) in
2015. The OFDC is a specialized certification body registered at
the PRC Certification and Accreditation Administration (CNCA) and
is both nationally (China National Accreditation Service for
Conformity Assessment — CNAS) and internationally (International
Federation of Organic Agriculture Movements – IFOAM) accredited.
The further development of our fertilizer products will be in
line with the direction of our mission, namely, the adoption of
ecological, social and economical systems that are based on the
Principles of Organic Agriculture.


Also consistent with our mission, we have since 2015 become a
member of the California Institute of Food and Agricultural
Research (CIFAR) at the University of California at Davis. We
look forward to collaborating with CIFAR and other members to
undertake further projects relating to agricultural developments.

13. Growth Strategy


13.1 Expansion of Production Capacity


Shanxi Lutu started a larger scale of production of fertilizers
in 2015. We would like to further expand the existing production
facilities as soon as possible to address the existing needs of
our clients, to grab market share and to expand into other
markets such as the soil amendment market.


Previous marketing efforts of the Company have concluded that our
products are widely accepted in various locations among local
farmers. Since our production cost is significantly lower than
the cost of the conventional production method to produce
compound fertiliser, we are confident that the production
capacity can be fully utilized soon after the expansions are
completed.


An expansion is planned for the existing facilities in 2 phases,
each of which we believe will provide an additional 200,000 ton
per annum of production capacity to the plant.


A portion of the land plot that Shanxi Lutu owns is currently
vacant and a vacant land plot of c.20,000 sqm (30 Mu) is also
available adjacent to the existing site, for the expansion of
Phase 2. Phase 3 will also be located in a location potentially
adjacent to the source of mineral shale.


After these expansions, we expect the total capacity of the
production facilities of the Company will reach 500,000 tons per
annum.

Regulations related to the manufacturing of
bio-fertilizers


According to the Measures for the Administration of Fertilizer
Registration (MOA decree No. 32, 2000) promulgated by the
Ministry of Agriculture of PRC China, companies are required to
obtain registration for fertilizer products in China prior to
importing, manufacturing, selling and using them in China.


There are two types of fertilizer registrations. They are
temporary registration (one year validity, could be only renewed
twice) and formal registration (5 years validity, could be
renewed without limits). To ensure the quality and safety of
fertilizers, the reviewing body under the Ministry of Agriculture
needs a comprehensive understanding of the producer and the
product. The applicants are required to undertake a series of
tests and prepare different data depending on the origin and the
category of products.


If the fertilizer product has undergone the plot trial stage and
requires a field trial or marketing trial, temporary registration
will be required. In order to obtain temporary registration for a
particular fertilizer, the manufacturer needs to submit an
application form and samples of the fertilizer. In the
application form, the manufacturer needs to submit the following
information:






o


background information of the manufacturer;








o


background information related to the fertilizer product;








o


particulars of the product proving that the product meets the
national or industry quality standard of the corresponding
product type;








o


labeling of the product;








o


field trial results within the last 3 years;








o


toxicity report; and








o


appraisal report of the microorganism if it is microbial
fertilizer.




If the product wants to be marketed as a commercial product after
field trials or marketing trials are completed, the producer
should apply for formal registration. In order to obtain formal
registration for a particular fertilizer, the manufacturer needs
to submit an application form and samples of the fertilizer.
According to Article 11 of the Measures for the Administration of
Fertilizer Registration, it is required to conduct standardized
demonstrative field trials in institutions recognized by the
Ministry of Agriculture before applying for formal registration.
In the application form, the manufacturer needs to submit the
following information:






(1)


field trial results within the last 4 years in not less than
2 different provinces;








(2)


other information that the Ministry of Agriculture requires
to supplement the information submitted in applying for
temporary registration.

Foreign Currency Exchange


The principal regulation governing foreign currency exchange in
China is the Foreign Currency Administration Rules (1996) as
amended in 2008 (the Rules). Under the Rules,
Renminbi is freely convertible for current account items, such as
trade and service-related foreign exchange transactions, but not
for capital account items, such as direct investment, loan or
investment in securities outside China unless the prior approval
of, and/or registration with, the State Administration of Foreign
Exchange of the Peoples Republic of China
(SAFE), or its local counterparts (as the case
may be), is obtained.


to the Rules, foreign invested enterprises
(FIEs) in China may purchase foreign currency
without the approval of SAFE for trade and service-related
foreign exchange transactions by providing commercial documents
evidencing these transactions. They may also retain foreign
exchange (subject to a cap approved by SAFE) to satisfy foreign
exchange liabilities or to pay dividends. In addition, if a
foreign company acquires a subsidiary in China, the acquired
company will also become an FIE. However, the relevant PRC
government authorities may limit or eliminate the ability of FIEs
to purchase and retain foreign currencies in the future. In
addition, foreign exchange transactions for direct investment,
loan and investment in securities outside China are still subject
to limitations and require approvals from, and/or registration,
with SAFE.


Dividend Distribution


Under applicable PRC regulations, FIEs in China may pay dividends
only out of their accumulated profits, if any, determined in
accordance with PRC accounting standards and regulations. In
addition, a FIE in China is required to set aside at least 10% of
its after-tax profit based on PRC accounting standards each year
to its general reserves until the cumulative amount of such
reserves reach 50% of its registered capital. These reserves are
not distributable as cash dividends.


The Enterprise Income Tax Law and its implementing rules
generally provide that a 10% withholding tax applies to
China-sourced income derived by non-resident enterprises for PRC
enterprise income tax purposes unless the jurisdiction of
incorporation of such enterprises shareholder has a tax treaty
with China that provides for a different withholding arrangement.
Shanxi Lutu is considered a FIE as it is directly held by Hong
Kong Prolific. According to a 2006 tax treaty between the
Mainland and Hong Kong, dividends payable by an FIE in China to a
company in Hong Kong that directly holds at least 25% of the
equity interest in the FIE will be subject to no more than 5%
withholding tax. We expect that such 5% withholding tax will
apply to dividends paid to Hong Kong Prolific by Shanxi Lutu, but
this treatment will depend on our status as a non-resident
enterprise.

Item 1A. Risk Factors


Risk factors related to our business


In order to grow at the pace expected by management,
we will require additional capital to support our long-term
growth strategies. If we are unable to obtain additional capital,
we may be unable to proceed with our plans and we may be forced
to curtail our operations.


We will require additional working capital to support our
long-term growth strategies and better utilize our production
capacity, which includes development of marketing and research
and development of new products. Our working capital requirements
and the cash flow provided by future operating activities, if
any, may vary greatly from quarter to quarter, depending on the
volume of business during the period, and other matters. We may
not be able to obtain adequate levels of additional financing,
whether through equity financing, debt financing or other
sources. Additional financings could result in significant
dilution to our earnings per share or the issuance of securities
with rights superior to our current outstanding securities. If we
are unable to raise additional financing, we may be unable to
implement our long-term growth strategies, develop or enhance our
products and services, take advantage of future opportunities or
respond to competitive pressures on a timely basis, or at all.
Even if additional financings are available, they may be on terms
that we deem unacceptable or are materially adverse to your
interests with respect to dilution of book value, dividend
preferences, liquidation preferences, or other terms.


Substantially all of our business, assets and
operations are located in the PRC.


Substantially all of our business, assets and operations are
located in the PRC. The economy of the PRC differs from the
economies of most developed countries in many respects. The
economy of the PRC has been transitioning from a planned economy
to a market-oriented economy. Although in recent years the PRC
government has implemented measures emphasizing the utilization
of market forces for economic reform, the reduction of state
ownership of productive assets and the establishment of sound
corporate governance in business enterprises, a substantial
portion of productive assets in the PRC are still owned by the
PRC government. In addition, the PRC government continues to play
a significant role in regulating industry by imposing industrial
policies. It also exercises significant control over the PRCs
economic growth through the allocation of resources, controlling
payment of foreign currency-denominated obligations, setting
monetary policy and providing preferential treatment to
particular industries or companies. Some of these measures
benefit the overall economy of the PRC, but may have a negative
effect on us.








Page 48 of 93











Our planned expansion could be delayed or adversely
affected by, among other things, difficulties in obtaining
sufficient financing, technical difficulties, or human or other
resource constraints.


Our planned expansion in our production capacity in
bio-fertilizers could be delayed or adversely affected by, among
other things, difficulties in obtaining sufficient financing,
technical difficulties, or human or other resource constraints.
Moreover, the costs involved in these projects may exceed those
originally contemplated. Costs savings and other economic
benefits expected from these projects may not materialize as a
result of any such project delays, cost overruns or changes in
market circumstances. Failure to obtain intended economic
benefits from these projects could adversely affect our business,
financial condition and operating performances.


Our limited operating history may not serve as an
adequate basis to judge our future prospects and results of
operations.


Our limited operating history may not provide a meaningful basis
for evaluating our business. The Company entered into business in
2012. We cannot guarantee that we will achieve profitability or
that we will not incur net losses in the future. We will continue
to encounter risks and difficulties that companies at a similar
stage of development frequently experience, including the
potential failure to:








obtain sufficient working capital to support our expansion;











expand our product offerings and maintain the high quality
of our products;











manage our expanding operations and continue to fill
customers orders on time;











maintain adequate control of our expenses allowing us to
realize anticipated income growth;











implement our product development, sales, and acquisition
strategies and adapt and modify them as needed;











successfully integrate any future acquisitions; and











anticipate and adapt to changing conditions in the
electronics and information technology industry resulting
from changes in government regulations, mergers and
acquisitions involving our competitors, technological
developments and other significant competitive and market
dynamics.





If we are not successful in addressing any or all of the
foregoing risks, our results of operations may be materially and
adversely affected.








Page 49 of 93











We will incur significant costs to ensure compliance
with United States corporate governance and accounting
requirements.


We will incur significant costs associated with our public
company reporting requirements, costs associated with newly
applicable corporate governance requirements, including
requirements under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and other rules
implemented by the SEC. Since we had no obligations as a public
company prior to completion of the Investment Transaction, we did
not have any such expenses prior to that date. We expect all of
these applicable rules and regulations to significantly increase
our legal and financial compliance costs and to make some
activities more time consuming and costly. We also expect that
these applicable rules and regulations may make it more difficult
and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer
liability insurance and we may be required to accept reduced
policy limits and coverage or incur substantially higher costs to
obtain the same or similar coverage. As a result, it may be more
difficult for us to attract and retain qualified individuals to
serve on our board of directors or as executive officers. We are
currently evaluating and monitoring developments with respect to
these newly applicable rules, and we cannot predict or estimate
the amount of additional costs we may incur or the timing of such
costs.


The audit report included in this Annual Report was
prepared by auditors who are not inspected by the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board and, as a result, you are deprived of
the benefits of such inspection


The independent registered public accounting firm that issues the
audit reports included in our annual reports filed with the SEC,
as auditors of companies that are traded publicly in the United
States and a firm registered with the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB“) is
required by the laws of the United States to undergo regular
inspections by the PCAOB to assess its compliance with the laws
of the United States and professional standards. Because our
auditors are located in the PRC, a jurisdiction where the PCAOB
is currently unable to conduct inspections without the approval
of the PRC authorities, our auditors are not currently inspected
by the PCAOB.


Inspections of other firms that the PCAOB has conducted outside
China have identified deficiencies in those firms’ audit
procedures and quality control procedures, which may be addressed
as part of the inspection process to improve future audit
quality. The inability of the PCAOB to conduct inspections in
China prevents the PCAOB from regularly evaluating our auditor’s
statements, audits and quality control procedures. As a result,
investors may be deprived of the benefits of PCAOB inspections.


The inability of the PCAOB to conduct inspections of auditors in
China makes it more difficult to evaluate the effectiveness of
our auditor’s quality control and audit procedures as compared
to auditors outside of China that are subject to PCAOB
inspections. Investors may lose confidence in our reported
financial information and procedures and the quality of our
financial statements.








Page 50 of 93











We may not be able to meet the internal control
reporting requirements imposed by the SEC resulting in a possible
decline in the price of our common stock and our inability to
obtain future financing.


As directed by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the SEC
adopted rules requiring each public company to include a report
of management on the companys internal controls over financial
reporting in its annual reports. Although the Dodd-Frank Wall
Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act exempts companies with
a public float of less than $75 million from the requirement that
our independent registered public accounting firm attest to our
financial controls, this exemption does not affect the
requirement that we include a report of management on our
internal control over financial reporting and does not affect the
requirement to include the independent registered public
accounting firms attestation if our public float exceeds $75
million.


While we expect to expend significant resources in developing the
necessary documentation and testing procedures required by
Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, there is a risk that we
may not be able to comply timely with all of the requirements
imposed by this rule. Regardless of whether we are required to
receive a positive attestation from our independent registered
public accounting firm with respect to our internal controls, if
we are unable to do so, investors and others may lose confidence
in the reliability of our financial statements and our stock
price and ability to obtain equity or debt financing as needed
could suffer.


In addition, in the event that our independent registered public
accounting firm is unable to rely on our internal controls in
connection with its audit of our financial statements, and in the
further event that it is unable to devise alternative procedures
in order to satisfy itself as to the material accuracy of our
financial statements and related disclosures, it is possible that
we would be unable to file our Annual Report on Form 10-K with
the SEC, which could also adversely affect the market for and the
market price of our common stock and our ability to secure
additional financing as needed.


We depend on a network of distributors to sustain our
business. If our relationship with our distributors is disrupted,
our revenue will be reduced, and our business could become
unprofitable.


Our sales to our distributors remain the main source of our
revenues. If a distributor terminated its relationship with us,
or if its sales of our products were seriously impaired for any
reason, our overall sales results would be diminished. In
addition, if our distributors were to act in concert to change
the economic terms of our relationship with them, the result
could have a negative effect on our profitability.








Page 51 of 93











Our demands are seasonal and our production capacity
has not been utilized, we need to expand our sales and have
better production planning


Some of our customers will usually only place orders during the
sowing season, which usually lasts for only one to two months.
During the non-sowing season of our clients, we may not be able
to utilize our production capacity due to a lack of orders.
Currently, most of our orders come from Hailongjiang, which
orders will only come in around February and March.


The sowing and harvesting cycle is different across China. For
illustrations, users from Xinjiang province need to apply a
significant amount of base fertilizers after each fall harvest
before the soil is frozen to recondition and increase the
fertility of the generally sandy soil, therefore a significant
portion of the orders will need to be delivered around September
or October. Users in the Northeastern part of China usually apply
fertilizers in spring during the sowing season. They generally
have only one harvest in a year and delivery needs to be made
around March. Plantations in the southern and south-western parts
of China can produce two to three harvests a year and generally
they place orders all year around. Therefore, we need to expand
our sales networks to different parts of China. Only by doing so,
we would have to potential of securing orders all year around and
hence have a greater potential of utilizing our production
capacity.


There is a time gap between placements of orders and
payment from clients, we may face liquidity problems during this
time gap


It is market practice in China that customers usually only place
orders in the sowing season and settle the majority of payments
with the Company after harvest, when the crops are sold on the
market and their working capital is recouped. This is especially
true for the north-eastern part of China or Xinjiang province as
crop growth is slower and there is only one harvest during the
year. Some users may agree to paying an upfront payment of around
30%, given they can have multiple harvests during the year.


Therefore, there is a significant working capital requirement
upfront to start production due to the time gap between placement
of orders and payments. We need to raise more working capital to
provide more liquidity to the Company and to help the Company pay
production costs more easily. Our failure to raise sufficient
working capital would have a material adverse effect on our
results of operations and financial condition.








Page 52 of 93











If Able Lead cannot repay the Outstanding Loan, we
may not be able to acquire the majority shares of Lutu
International without any encumbrances.


As mentioned above, under the Majority Interest Exchange
Agreement, Able Lead needs to repay the Outstanding Loan in the
sum of $4.43 million before we can acquire the 89% of shares in
Lutu International through the share exchange. There is a risk
that Able Lead cannot raise enough funds and there will be a
delay for us to acquire all the outstanding shares of Lutu
International, or we may not be able to acquire all the
outstanding shares of Lutu International.


Our current dependence on a limited number of
customers may cause significant fluctuations or declines in our
revenues.


Consequently, any one of the following events may cause material
declines in our revenues and have a material adverse effect on
our results of operations:







reduction, delay or cancellation of orders from one or more
of our significant customers due to a reduction in our
customers’ product sales, or other reasons;





selection by one or more of our significant customers of our
competitors’ products;





decision by one or more of our significant customers to
self-produce products that are currently provided by us;





loss of one or more of our significant customers and our
failure to obtain additional or replacement customers to
replace the lost sales volume; and





failure of any of our significant customers to make timely
payment for our products.




Failure to make strategic acquisitions and to
establish and maintain strategic relationships, could have a
material adverse effect on our revenue growth and
prospects.


We may make strategic acquisitions and establish and maintain
strategic relationships with third parties. In addition, we may
enter into strategic relationships with third parties to gain
access to capital or funding for research and development
programs, process development programs and commercialization
activities, or to reduce the risk of developing and scaling-up
for commercial production of our anticipated pipeline of
products.


We cannot assure you, however, that we will be able to
successfully make such strategic acquisitions or establish
strategic relationships with third parties that will prove to be
beneficial for our business. Our inability in this regard could
have a material adverse effect on our revenue growth and
prospects. In addition, strategic acquisitions and relationships
with third parties could subject us to a number of risks,
including but not limited to:







our inability to integrate new operations, products,
personnel, services or technologies;





unforeseen or hidden liabilities;





disagreement with our strategic relationship partners;









Page 53 of 93















our inability to generate sufficient revenues to offset the
costs and expenses of strategic acquisitions or other
strategic relationships; and





potential loss of, or harm to, employees or customer
relationships.




Any of these events could impair our ability to manage our
business, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on
our financial condition and results of operations. Such risks
could also result in our failure to derive the intended benefits
of the strategic acquisitions or strategic relationships and we
may be unable to recover our investment in such initiatives.


Risk factors in doing business in China


Fluctuations in exchange rates could adversely affect
our business and the value of our securities.


The value of our common stock will be indirectly affected by the
foreign exchange rate between the U.S. Dollar and Renminbi, and
between those currencies and other currencies in which our sales
may be denominated. Appreciation or depreciation in the value of
Renminbi relative to the U.S. Dollar would affect our financial
results reported in U.S. Dollar terms without giving effect to
any underlying change in our business or results of operations.
Fluctuations in the exchange rate will also affect the relative
value of any dividend we may issue that will be exchanged into
U.S. Dollars as well as earnings from, and the value of, any U.S.
Dollar-denominated investments we may make in the future.


Since July 2005, Renminbi is no longer pegged to the U.S. Dollar.
Although the Peoples Bank of China regularly intervenes in the
foreign exchange market to prevent significant short-term
fluctuations in the exchange rate, Renminbi may appreciate or
depreciate significantly in value against the U.S. Dollar in the
medium to long term. Moreover, it is possible that in the future
PRC authorities may lift restrictions on fluctuations in the
Renminbi exchange rate and lessen intervention in the foreign
exchange market.


Very limited hedging transactions are available in China to
reduce our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations. To date, we
have not entered into any hedging transactions. While we may
enter into hedging transactions in the future, the availability
and effectiveness of these transactions may be limited, and we
may not be able to successfully hedge our exposure at all. In
addition, our foreign currency exchange losses may be magnified
by PRC exchange control regulations that restrict our ability to
convert Renminbi into foreign currencies.







Page 54 of 93











Restrictions under PRC law on
ShanxiLutus
ability to make dividends and other distributions could
materially and adversely affect our ability to grow, make
investments or acquisitions that could benefit our business, pay
dividends to you, and otherwise fund and conduct our
businesses.


Practically all of our revenues are earned by Shanxi Lutu. PRC
regulations restrict the ability of Shanxi Lutu to make dividends
and other payments to its offshore parent company. PRC legal
restrictions permit payments of dividends by Shanxi Lutu only out
of its accumulated after-tax profits, if any, determined in
accordance with PRC accounting standards and regulations. Shanxi
Lutu also is required under PRC laws and regulations to allocate
at least 10% of its annual after-tax profits determined in
accordance with PRC GAAP to a statutory general reserve fund
until the amounts in said fund reaches 50% of its registered
capital. Allocations to these statutory reserve funds can only be
used for specific purposes and are not transferable to us in the
form of loans, advances or cash dividends. Any limitations on the
ability of Shanxi Lutu to transfer funds to us could materially
and adversely limit our ability to grow, make investments or
acquisitions that could be beneficial to our business, pay
dividends and otherwise fund and conduct our business.


Uncertainties with respect to the PRC legal system
could limit the legal protections available to you and
us.


We conduct substantially all of our business through our
operating subsidiaries and affiliate in the PRC. Our principal
operating subsidiaries, Shanxi Lutu and Shenzhen Lutu, are
subject to laws and regulations applicable to foreign investments
in China and, in particular, laws applicable to foreign-invested
enterprises. The PRC legal system is based on written statutes,
and prior court decisions may be cited for reference but have
limited precedential value. Since 1979, a series of new PRC laws
and regulations have significantly enhanced the protections
afforded to various forms of foreign investments in China.
However, since the PRC legal system continues to evolve rapidly,
the interpretations of many laws, regulations and rules are not
always uniform and enforcement of these laws, regulations and
rules involves uncertainties, which may limit legal protections
available to you and us. In addition, any litigation in China may
be protracted and result in substantial costs and diversion of
resources and management attention. As a result, it could be
difficult for investors to effect service of process in the
United States or to enforce a judgment obtained in the United
States against our operations, subsidiaries and affiliates in
China.


Restrictions on currency exchange may limit our
ability to receive and use our sales revenue
effectively.


All our sales revenue and expenses are denominated in Renminbi.
Under PRC law, Renminbi is currently convertible under the
current account, which includes dividends and trade and
service-related foreign exchange transactions, but not under the
capital account, which includes foreign direct investment and
loans. The relevant PRC government authorities may limit or
eliminate our ability to purchase foreign currencies in the
future. Since a significant amount of our future revenue will be
denominated in Renminbi, any existing and future restrictions on
currency exchange may limit our ability to utilize revenue
generated in Renminbi to fund our business activities outside
China that are denominated in foreign currencies.








Page 55 of 93











Foreign exchange transactions by our PRC operating subsidiary
under the capital account continue to be subject to significant
foreign exchange controls and require the approval of or need to
register with PRC government authorities, including SAFE. In
particular, if our PRC operating subsidiary borrows foreign
currency through loans from us or other foreign lenders, these
loans must be registered with SAFE, and if we finance the
subsidiary by means of additional capital contributions, these
capital contributions must be approved by certain government
authorities, including the Ministry of Commerce, or their
respective local counterparts. These limitations could affect
their ability to obtain foreign exchange through debt or equity
financing.


We may be exposed to liabilities under the Foreign
Corrupt Practices Act and PRC
anti-corruption law, and any determination that we violated these
laws could have a material adverse effect on our
business.


We are subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act
(FCPA) and other laws that prohibit improper
payments or offers of payments to foreign governments and their
officials and political parties by U.S. persons and issuers for
the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. We are also
subject to the PRC anti-corruption law, which strictly prohibits
the payment of bribes to government officials.


We principally have operations, agreements with third parties and
make sales in China, which may experience corruption. Our
activities in China create the risk of unauthorized payments or
offers of payments by one of our employees, consultants or
distributors, because these parties are not always subject to our
control. We believe that to date we have complied in all material
respects with the provisions of the FCPA and PRC anti-corruption
law. However, our existing safeguards and any future improvements
may prove to be less than effective, and our employees,
consultants or distributors may engage in conduct for which we
might be held responsible. Violations of the FCPA or PRC
anti-corruption law may result in severe criminal or civil
sanctions, and we may be subject to other liabilities, which
could negatively affect our business, operating results and
financial condition. In addition, the government may seek to hold
us liable for successor liability FCPA violations committed by
companies in which we invest or that we acquire.








Page 56 of 93











Risks Relating to the VIE Structure


Our ability to manage and operate Lutu
International under the Contractual Arrangements may not be as
effective as direct ownership.


We obtain the management of Lutu International by adopting a VIE
structure through the Contractual Arrangements. Virtually all of
our revenues will be generated through Lutu International. Our
plans for future growth are based substantially on growing the
operations of Lutu International. However, the Contractual
Arrangements may not be as effective in providing us with
management control over Lutu International as direct ownership.
Under the Contractual Arrangement, as a legal matter, if Lutu
International fails to perform its obligations under these
contractual arrangements, we may have to (i) incur substantial
costs and resources to enforce such arrangements, and (ii) rely
on legal remedies under the laws of Cayman Islands, which we
cannot be sure would be effective. Therefore, if we are unable to
effectively control Lutu International, it may have an adverse
effect on our ability to achieve our business objectives and grow
our revenues.


Shareholders of Able Lead
have potential conflicts of interest with us, which
may adversely affect our business.


Dr. Leung Kwong Tak, Michael (Dr. Leung), the
sole shareholder of Able Lead, which owns 89% of Lutu
Internationals outstanding equity interests, is also a beneficial
owner of the common stock of GVBT. Equity interests held by Dr.
Leung in GVBT is less than its interest in Lutu International as
a result of the Investment Transaction. In addition, the
shareholders equity interest in GVBT may be further diluted as a
result of any future offering of equity securities. Conflicts of
interest may arise as a result of such dual shareholding and
governance structure.


If such conflicts arise, Dr. Leung may not act in our best
interests, and such conflicts of interest may not be resolved in
our favor. In addition, Dr. Leung may breach or cause Lutu
International to breach or refuse to renew the Contractual
Arrangements that allow us to exercise effective control over
Lutu International and to receive economic benefits from Lutu
International. If we cannot resolve any conflicts of interest or
disputes between us and such shareholders or any future
beneficial owners of Lutu International, we would have to rely on
arbitral or legal proceedings to remedy the situation. Such
arbitral and legal proceedings may cost us substantial financial
and other resources and result in disruption of our business, the
outcome of which may adversely affect GVBT.


Our proposed acquisition of shares of Lutu
International from Able Lead is subject to the repayment of the
Outstanding Loan


Our proposed acquisition of shares of Lutu International from
Able Lead is conditional upon the shares of Lutu International
being free from encumbrances. Therefore, it is critical whether
Able Lead can repay the Outstanding Loan before the maturity
date. There is a risk that the current VIE structure has to be
continued for an indefinite period of time.








Page 57 of 93











Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property


If we are unable to protect our proprietary rights or
to defend against infringement claims, we may not be able to
compete effectively or operate profitably.


Our success will depend, in part, on our ability to obtain
patents, protect our existing patent, operate without infringing
the proprietary rights of others, and maintain trade secrets,
both in China and other countries. Patent matters in the
biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries can be highly
uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions.
Accordingly, the validity, breadth and enforceability of our
patent, and any s and the existence of potentially blocking
patent rights of others cannot be predicted, either in China or
other countries.


In addition, competitors may manufacture and sell our potential
products in those foreign countries where we have not filed for
patent protection or where patent protection may be unavailable,
not obtainable or ultimately not enforceable. In addition, even
where patent protection is obtained, third-party competitors may
challenge our patent claims in the patent office of China. The
ability of such competitors to sell such products in the United
States or in foreign countries where we have obtained patents is
usually governed by the patent laws of the countries in which the
product is sold.


We will incur significant ongoing expenses in maintaining our
patent and our patent applications. Should we lack the funds to
maintain our patent and patent applications, or to enforce our
rights against infringers, we could be adversely impacted. Even
if claims of infringement are without merit, any such action
could divert the time and attention of management and impair our
ability to access additional capital and/or cost us significant
funds to defend.


Currently, we have one patent issued in the name of Shanxi Lutu,
which expires January 20, 2019. Our patent applications are
pending and there is a risk that these patent applications are
eventually unsuccessful.


Intellectual property rights do not necessarily
address all potential threats to our competitive
advantage.


The degree of future protection afforded by our intellectual
property rights is uncertain because intellectual property rights
have limitations, and may not adequately protect our business, or
permit us to maintain our competitive advantage. The following
examples are illustrative:








Others may be able to make alternative technology and
processes which can also produce potash bio-fertilizers
that are substitutes for our products but that are not
covered by the claims of our patent, our patent
applications, or other technology or processes that we may
in the future either own or exclusively license.










Page 58 of 93















Others may independently develop similar or alternative
technologies or duplicate any of our technologies without
infringing our intellectual property rights.





The patents of others may have an adverse effect on our
business.




We may be subject to litigation with respect to the
ownership and use of intellectual property that will be costly to
defend or pursue and uncertain in its outcome
in China


Our success also will depend, in part, on our refraining from
infringing patents or otherwise violating intellectual property
owned or controlled by others. Pharmaceutical companies,
biotechnology companies, universities, research institutions and
others may have filed patent applications or have received, or
may obtain, issued patents in the United States or elsewhere
relating to aspects of our technology. It is uncertain whether
the issuance of any third-party patents will require us to alter
our products or processes, obtain licenses, or cease certain
activities. Some third-party applications or patents may conflict
with our issued patent or pending applications. Any such conflict
could result in a significant reduction of the scope or value of
our issued patent, any patents that may result from our patent
applications, or any license rights we may have with respect to
patents or technology of others.


Our patents may be challenged under the PRC Patent
System



Competitors may successfully challenge our patents. Our patent
may be challenged, invalidated or held unenforceable, which could
materially and adversely harm our business and results of
operations. Our pending patent applications may not be approved
or the scope of claims may be restricted in the final approvals,
which may provide insufficient protection for our technologies,
processes or products.


In addition, it is possible that competitors could, under PRC
patent law, apply for and obtain a compulsory license to our
patent, and any future patents we may obtain, should we refuse to
grant a license for those patents on reasonable terms.
Furthermore, the existence of a patent does not provide assurance
that the production, sale or use of our products does not
infringe the patent rights of another. Third parties may also
have blocking patents that could be used to prevent us from
marketing products utilizing our patented technologies or
processes.


Furthermore, it is possible that our technologies, processes or
products may infringe on patents that have not yet been issued.
Specifically, in China and many other jurisdictions, patent
protection starts from the date the application is first filed.
Therefore our attempt to enforce any PRC patent may be defeated
by third-party patents issued on a later date if the applications
for those patents were filed before ours and the technologies or
processes underlying such patents are the same or substantially
similar to ours. In such a case, a third party with an earlier
application could force us to pay to license its patented
technology, sue us for patent infringement and challenge the
validity of our patent, and any future patents we may obtain.

Risks Related to the Market for Our Stock
Generally


There is only a very limited market for our common
stock.


While our common stock is listed for quotation on the OTC Pink
Market, there is currently no trading in our common stock. We
cannot provide any assurances as to when, or if, an active market
will develop for our common stock.


Our common stock is subject to penny stock
rules.


Our common stock is subject to Rule 15g-1 through 15g-9 under the
Exchange Act, which imposes certain sales practice requirements
on broker-dealers which sell our common stock to persons other
than established customers and accredited investors (generally,
individuals with net worth’s in excess of $1,000,000 or annual
incomes exceeding $200,000 (or $300,000 together with their
spouses)). For transactions covered by this rule, a broker-dealer
must make a special suitability determination for the purchaser
and have received the purchaser’s written consent to the
transaction prior to the sale. This rule adversely affects the
ability of broker-dealers to sell our common stock and the
ability of our stockholders to sell their shares of common stock.


Additionally, our common stock is subject to the SEC regulations
for penny stock. Penny stock includes any equity security that is
not listed on a national exchange and has a market price of less
than $5.00 per share, subject to certain exceptions. The
regulations require that prior to any non-exempt buy/sell
transaction in a penny stock, a disclosure schedule set forth by
the SEC relating to the penny stock market must be delivered to
the purchaser of such penny stock. This disclosure must include
the amount of commissions payable to both the broker-dealer and
the registered representative and current price quotations for
the common stock. The regulations also require that monthly
statements be sent to holders of penny stock that disclose recent
price information for the penny stock and information of the
limited market for penny stocks. These requirements adversely
affect the market liquidity of our common stock.

You may experience dilution of your ownership
interests because of the future issuance of additional shares of
the common stock.


In the future, we may issue our authorized but previously
unissued equity securities, resulting in the dilution of the
ownership interests of our present stockholders and the
purchasers of common stock offered hereby. We are currently
authorized to issue an aggregate of 750,000,000 shares of capital
stock consisting of shares of common stock. As of the closing of
the Share Exchange, there will be 160,790,000 shares of our
common stock outstanding. We may also issue additional shares of
our common stock or other securities that are convertible into or
exercisable for our common stock in connection with hiring or
retaining employees, future acquisitions, future sales of its
securities for capital raising purposes, or for other business
purposes. The future issuance of any such additional shares of
our common stock may create downward pressure on the trading
price of the common stock. There can be no assurance that we will
not be required to issue additional shares, warrants or other
convertible securities in the future in conjunction with any
capital raising efforts, including at a price (or exercise
prices) below the price at which shares of the common stock will
be initially quoted on the OTC Pink market.


We are an emerging growth company and we cannot be
certain if the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to
emerging growth companies will make our common stock less
attractive to investors.


The JOBS Act permits “emerging growth companies” like us to
rely on some of the reduced disclosure requirements that are
already available to companies having a public float of less than
$75 million, for as long as we qualify as an emerging growth
company. During that period, we are permitted to omit the
auditor’s attestation on internal control over financial
reporting that would otherwise be required by the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act. Companies with a public float of $75 million or more must
otherwise procure such an attestation beginning with their second
annual report after their initial public offering. For as long as
we qualify as an emerging growth company, we are also excluded
from the requirement to submit “say-on-pay”, “say-on-pay
frequency” and “say-on-parachute” votes to our stockholders
and may avail ourselves of reduced executive compensation
disclosure compared to larger companies. In addition, as an
emerging growth company we can take advantage of an extended
transition period to comply with new or revised accounting
standards applicable to public companies. Until such time as we
cease to qualify as an emerging growth company, investors may
find our common stock less attractive because we may rely on
these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less
attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market
for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile.

Item 2. Financial Information


Overview


The Company was incorporated in the State of Nevada on July 5,
2012. Since incorporation, the Company has been engaged in
organizational efforts and obtaining initial financing. The
Company was formed as a vehicle to pursue a possible business
combination.


Following the closing of Investment Transaction, the Companys
principal business became the business of Lutu International.
After the consummation of the Investment Transaction, the Company
currently has 160,790,000 shares of common stock issued and
outstanding.


Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates


The Companys consolidated financial statements which are filed as
exhibits to this Current Report on Form 8-K, have been prepared
using the going concern basis of accounting which contemplates
the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in
the normal course of business.


Going Concern


As of December 31, 2016, the Lutu Group (the Company, we, our,
us) has an accumulated deficit of $3,199,950, and its current
liabilities exceed its current assets resulting in negative
working capital of $7,333,603. In view of the matters described
above, recoverability of a major portion of the recorded asset
amounts and realization of the portion of current liabilities
into revenue shown in the accompanying balance sheets are
dependent upon continued operations of the Company, which in turn
are dependent upon the Company’s ability to raise additional
financing and to succeed in its future operations. The Company
may need additional cash resources to operate during the upcoming
12 months, and the continuation of the Company may be dependent
upon the continuing financial support of investors, directors
and/or stockholders of the Company. However, there is no
assurance that equity or debt offerings will be successful in
raising sufficient funds to assure the eventual profitability of
the Company. These financial statements do not include any
adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of
recorded asset amounts or amounts and classification of
liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable
to continue as a going concern.


Management has taken the following steps to revise its operating
and financial requirements, which it believes are sufficient to
provide the Company with the ability to continue as a going
concern. The Company is actively pursuing additional funding
which would enhance capital employed and strategic partners which
would increase revenue bases or reduce operation expenses.
Management believes that the above actions will allow the Company
to continue its operations throughout this fiscal year.







Page 62 of 93











Use of Estimates


The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
during the reporting period. Actual results could materially
differ from those estimates.


Significant estimates and judgments inherent in the preparation
of these consolidated financial statements include, among other
things, accounting for asset impairments, allowances for doubtful
accounts, depreciation and amortization, the collection of
revenues from the Agricultural Cooperative.


Economic and Political risks


The Companys operations are mainly conducted in Hong Kong and
China and a large number of customers are located in Northern
China. Accordingly, the Companys business, financial condition
and results of operations may be influenced by the political,
economic and legal environment in Hong Kong and China, and by the
general state of the economy in Hong Kong and China.


The Companys operations and customers in Hong Kong and Northern
China are subject to special considerations and significant risks
not typically associated with companies in North America and
Western Europe. These include risks associated with, among
others, the political, economic and legal environments, and
foreign currency exchange. The Companys results may be adversely
affected by changes in the political and social conditions in
Hong Kong and China, and by changes in governmental policies with
respect to laws and regulations, anti-inflationary measures,
currency conversion, remittances abroad, and rates and methods of
taxation, among other things.


Foreign Currency Translation


The Companys financial statements are presented in the U.S.
Dollar ($), which is the Companys reporting currency, while its
functional currency are Renminbi (RMB) and Hong Kong Dollar
(HKD). Transactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded
at the functional currency rate ruling at the date of
transaction. Any differences between the initially recorded
amount and the settlement amount are recorded as a gain or loss
on foreign currency transaction in the consolidated statements of
income. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign
currency are translated at the functional currency rate of
exchange ruling at the balance sheet date. Any differences are
taken to profit or loss as a gain or loss on foreign currency
translation in the statements of income.








Page 63 of 93











In accordance with ASC 830, Foreign Currency Matters, the Company
translated the assets and liabilities into U.S. Dollar using the
rate of exchange prevailing at the applicable balance sheet date
and the statements of income and cash flows are translated at an
average rate during the reporting period. Adjustments resulting
from the translation are recorded in shareholders equity as part
of accumulated other comprehensive income.

Revenue Recognition


The Company earns revenue by selling merchandise to end using
customers primarily through distribution agent and directly to
customers.


Revenue is recognized when merchandise is purchased by and
delivered to the customer and confirmed and collectability is
reasonably assured. Revenue from wholesale agent is recognized
after goods delivered, amount fixed or determined and
collectability is reasonably assured.


All revenues are shown net of estimated returns during the
relevant period represented by estimated allowance for sales
returns based upon historical experience.


The Company records sales tax collected from its customers on a
net basis, and therefore it was excluded from revenue as defined
in ASC 605, Revenue Recognition.


During the year ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, the provision
of sales return were $Nil and $Nil respectively.







Page 64 of 93











Cost of Goods
Sold


Cost of goods sold includes the cost of materials, labor, and
relevant manufacturing expenses.


Selling Expenses


Selling expenses include packaging and shipping costs, as well as
advertising and certain expenses associated with operating the
Companys corporate headquarters.


Advertising Costs


The Company expensed all advertising costs as incurred.
Advertising expense, net of reimbursement from suppliers,
amounted to $53,938 and $22,798 for fiscal years 2016 and 2015,
respectively. Advertising expense is included in selling expense
and general and administrative expenses in the accompanying
consolidated statements of income.


Leases


The Company accounts for its leases under the provisions of ASC
840, Leases. Certain of the Companys operating leases provide for
minimum annual payments that change over the life of the lease.
The aggregate minimum annual payments are expensed on the
straight-line basis over the minimum lease term. The Company
recognizes a deferred rent liability for minimum step rents when
the amount of rent expense exceeds the actual lease payments and
it reduces the deferred rent liability when the actual lease
payments exceeds the amount of straight-line rent expense. Rent
holidays and tenant improvement allowances for office remodels
are amortized on the straight-line basis over the initial term of
the lease and any option period that is reasonably assured of
being exercised.


The Company did not have a lease that met the criteria of a
capital lease. Leases that do not qualify as a capital lease are
classified as an operating lease. Operating lease rental expenses
included in selling, general and administrative expenses for the
year ended December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015 were $17,890
and $9,541, respectively.








Page 65 of 93











Accounts Receivable


Accounts receivable is recognized and carried at the original
invoice amount less allowance for any uncollectible amounts. An
allowance for doubtful accounts is maintained for all customers
based on a variety of factors, including the industry practice,
the length of time the receivables are past due, significant
one-time events and historical experience. The Company is selling
products delivered to certain customers which are closed to
Agriculture Cooperatives as defined by ASC 905 Agriculture. The
collection cycle may be varied and depended on the growing crops
cycle.


Management reviews and adjusts this allowance periodically based
on historical experience and its evaluation of the collectability
of outstanding accounts receivable. The Company evaluates the
credit risk of its customers utilizing historical data and
estimates of future performance. Bad debts are written off as
incurred. During the reporting years 2016 and 2015, the bad debts
incurred were $29,198 and $Nil respectively.


Outstanding account balances are reviewed individually for
collectability. The Company does not charge any interest income
on trade receivables. Accounts balances are charged off against
the allowance after all means of collection have been exhausted
and the potential for recovery is considered remote. To date, the
Company has not charged off any balances as it has yet to exhaust
all means of collection.


During the year ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, the provision
of doubtful debts were $Nil and $Nil respectively. The Company
did not have collected enough information on doubtful debt;
however, the Company will provide adequate provision according to
the requirement of ASC 310 Receivable upon the build-up of
history.


Inventories


Inventories primarily consist of merchandise inventories and are
stated at lower of cost or market and net realizable value. Cost
of inventories is calculated on the weighted average basis which
approximates cost.


Management regularly reviews inventories and records valuation
reserves for damaged and defective returns, inventories with
slow-moving or obsolescence exposure and inventories with
carrying value that exceeds market value. Because of its product
mix, the Company has not historically experienced significant
occurrences of obsolescence.


Inventory shrinkage is accrued as a percentage of revenues based
on historical inventory shrinkage trends. The Company performs
physical inventory count of its stores once per quarter and cycle
counts inventories at its distribution centers once per quarter
throughout the year. The reserve for inventory shrinkage
represents an estimate for inventory shrinkage for each store
since the last physical inventory date through the reporting
date.








Page 66 of 93











These reserves are estimates, which could vary significantly,
either favorably or unfavorably, from actual results if future
economic conditions, consumer demand and competitive environments
differ from expectations.


Property, Plant and Equipment


Property, plant and equipment are recorded at cost. Significant
additions or improvements extending useful lives of assets are
capitalized. Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as
incurred. Depreciation is provided over the estimated useful
lives, using the straight-line method with 5% scrape value as
follows:





Buildings





20 years






Machinery equipment





10 years






Office equipment





3 years






Motor vehicles





4 years





Land Use Rights


According to the laws of the PRC, the government owns all the
land in China. Companies or individuals are authorized to possess
and use the land only through the land use rights granted by the
government. The land use rights represent cost of the rights to
use the land in respect of properties located in the PRC. Land
use rights are carried at cost and amortized on a straight-line
basis over the period of rights of 50 years.


Goodwill


Goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over fair value
of net assets acquired. Under ASC 350, Intangibles Goodwill and
Other, goodwill is not amortized but evaluated for impairment
annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate
that the value may not be recoverable.


The Company performed an annual impairment test as of the end of
fiscal years 2016 and 2015, and determined that an impairment
loss in the amount of $Nil and $Nil were recorded in 2016 and
2015 respectively.


Long-lived Assets


The Company reviews long-lived assets for impairment annually or
whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the
carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.








Page 67 of 93











Long-lived assets are reviewed for recoverability at the lowest
level in which there are identifiable cash flows, usually at the
store level. The carrying amount of a long-lived asset is not
considered recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted
cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset. If the
asset is determined not to be recoverable, then it is considered
to be impaired and the impairment to be recognized is the amount
by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value
of the asset, determined using discounted cash flow valuation
techniques, as defined in ASC 360, Property, Plant, and
Equipment.


The Company determined the sum of the undiscounted cash flows
expected to result from the use of the asset by projecting future
revenue and operating expense for each store under consideration
for impairment. The estimates of future cash flows involve
management judgment and are based upon assumptions about expected
future operating performance. The actual cash flows could differ
from managements estimates due to changes in business conditions,
operating performance and economic conditions.


During the reporting periods, the Company performed the
evaluation and there was no impairment loss.


Cash and Concentration of Credit
Risk


The Company maintains cash in bank deposit accounts in Hong Kong
and China, and considers all highly liquid investments purchased
with original maturities of three months or less to be cash
equivalents. The Company performs ongoing evaluations of the
institution to limit its concentration risk exposure.


The Companys customers mainly located in the Northeast China.
Because of this, the Company is subject to regional risks, such
as the economy, regional financial conditions and unemployment,
weather conditions, power outages, and other natural disasters
specific to the region in which the Company operates.


Retirement Benefit Plans


Full time employees of the Company in China participate in a
government mandated defined contribution plan, to which certain
pension benefits, medical care, employee housing fund and other
welfare benefits are provided to employees. PRC labor regulations
require the Company to make contributions to the government for
these benefits based on certain percentages of the employees
salaries. The Company accounts the mandated defined contribution
plan under the vested benefit obligations approach based on the
guidance of ASC 715, CompensationRetirement Benefits.


The total amounts for such employee benefits which were expensed
were $17,804 and $10,523 for the years ended December 31, 2016
and 2015, respectively.








Page 68 of 93











Income Taxes


The Company accounts for income tax using an asset and liability
approach and allows for recognition of deferred tax benefits in
future years. Under the asset and liability approach, deferred
taxes are provided for the net tax effects of temporary
differences between the carrying amounts of assets and
liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used
for income tax purposes. A valuation allowance is provided for
deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not these items
will either expire before the Company is able to realize their
benefits, or that future realization is uncertain.


Comprehensive income


Comprehensive income is defined to include all changes in equity
except those resulting from investments by owners and
distributions to owners. Among other disclosures, all items that
are required to be recognized under current accounting standards
as components of comprehensive income are required to be reported
in a financial statement that is presented with the same
prominence as other consolidated financial statements. The
Companys current component of comprehensive income is the net
income and foreign currency translation adjustment.


Segment Reporting


The Company operates in one industry segment, operating
manufacturing and selling of organic bio-fertilizer. ASC 280,
Segment Reporting, establishes standards for reporting
information about operating segments. Given the economic
characteristics of the similar nature of the products sold, the
type of customer and the method of distribution, the Company
operates as one reportable segment as defined by ASC 280, Segment
Reporting.


Basic and diluted earnings (loss) per share


In accordance with ASC No. 260 (formerly SFAS No. 128), Earnings
Per Share, the basic earnings (loss) per common share is computed
by dividing net earnings (loss) available to common stockholders
by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding.
Diluted earnings (loss) per common share is computed similarly to
basic earnings (loss) per common share, except that the
denominator is increased to include the number of additional
common shares that would have been outstanding if the potential
common shares had been issued and if the additional common shares
were dilutive.

Recent Pronouncements


We have reviewed all recently issued, but not yet effective,
accounting pronouncements and do not believe the future adoptions
of any such pronouncements may be expected to cause a material
impact on our financial condition or the results of operations.


Results of Operations


Our revenue for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016 and 2015
was $1,276,722 and $289,798, respectively. Our net income (loss)
for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 was
$(1,049,897) and $(848,394), respectively. Our comprehensive
income (loss) for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016 and
2015 was $(1,172,894) and $(982,646), respectively. Through
December 31, 2016 our cumulative net losses and cumulative
comprehensive loss were $(3,199,950) and $(174,098),
respectively.


Results of Operations for the Fiscal Year Ended
December 31, 2016 Compared to Fiscal Year Ended December 31,
2015


(References to 2016 and 2015 are to the fiscal years ended
December 31, 2016 and 2015 respectively, unless otherwise
specified.)


Revenue increased $986,924 (340.6%) from $289,798 for 2015 to
$1,276,722 for 2016. The increase is due to an increased sales
volume during 2016 as compared to 2015. We anticipate that our
growth will continue as we believe biotechnology fertilizers are
a superior product than chemical fertilizers with nutrient
balances and less soil pollution.


Cost of revenue increased $661,210 (233.0%) from $283,777 in 2015
to $944,987 in 2016. The increase was due to production
increasing to meet the sales revenue increasing. In terms of
percentage of revenue, cost of revenue was 74% in 2016 as
compared to 97.9% in 2015. The decrease was due to certain fixed
costs did not have significant increase even though the variable
cost increased upon the production level increased.


Gross profit increased $325,714 (54,096%) from $6,021 in 2015 to
$331,735 in 2016. The increase reflected the reduction of cost of
production as certain fixed cost did not have significant changes
as variable cost increased. In terms of percentage of revenue,
the gross profit percentage increased to 26.0% for 2016 as
compared to 2.1% for 2015. The increase was due to cost
production percentage reduce as cost of production did not
increase at the same percentage of sales of revenue because of
fixed and variable costs did not increase at the same percentage.
Moreover, the 2016 cost of raw materials was also decreased on
purchases in higher volume.








Page 70 of 93











Selling expenses increased $52,107 (75.6%) from $68,955 for 2015
to $121,062 for 2016. The increase is generally due to an
increase of $45,034 in the marketing expenses and $36,047 in
shipping and transportation expenses which offset by a decrease
of $24,092 in packing expenses.


General and administrative expenses increased $422,050 (50.5%)
from $835,293 for 2015 to $1,257,343 for 2016. The increase is
generally due to an increase in the operating activities we made
in 2016 as compared to 2015


The following is a summary of general and administrative expenses
for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015.

Our most significant expenses are consulting fees, salary and
payroll expenses, professional fees, travel and entertainment
expenses, and depreciation and amortization.


Consulting fees increased $149,163 (129.7%) from $115,031 in 2015
to $264,194 in 2016 owing to hiring external consultants to
improve the Companys operating activities.


Our salary and payroll expenses increased due to the carrying out
of more production activity in 2016 than 2015. We anticipate that
salary and payroll expenses will continue to rise in future
periods as it becomes necessary to increase our staff in order to
continue to increase our production activities.


Professional fees increased $231,110 (22,179%) from $1,042 in
2015 to $232,152 in 2016. The increase of professional fees was
due to the hiring of more independent professional experts such
as international lawyers and accountants.








Page 71 of 93











Travel and entertainment expenses decreased $73,425 (35.1%) from
$209,028 in 2015 to $135,603 in 2016. The decrease directly
relates to the reduction of project based travelling activities.


Other expenses include items such as office expenses, software
related costs, telephone and a variety of other miscellaneous
expenses. None of these expenses individually increased
significantly as the difference was $11,261 (5.8%), a minor rise
from $194,471 in 2015 to $205,732 in 2016.


We anticipate that we will incur higher general and
administrative expenses as a public company. We expect that our
professional fees, cost of transfer agent, investor relations
costs and other stock related costs will increase.


We also anticipate that selling, general and administrative
expenses will concurrently increase with our increased activity
in the future but will not increase in the same proportion to
that of revenue.


Our loss from operations increased $148,443 (16.5%) from $898,227
in 2015 to $1,046,670 in 2016.


Non-operating income (expenses) decreased $53,060 (106.5%) from
$49,833 in 2015 to $(3,227) in 2016, of which the other income
decreased $50,517 (96.2%) from $52,508 in 2015 to $1,991 in 2016.


The net loss increased $201,503 (23.8%) from $848,394 in 2015 to
$1,049,897 in 2016.


Liquidity and Capital Resources


At December 31, 2016, we had a working capital deficit of
$7,333,603, as compared to a working capital deficit of
$6,720,075 at December 31, 2015. Of the working capital deficit
at December 31, 2016, $10,362,992 was amount due to related
parties and holding company and $1,814,133 was due from related
parties. Excluding the amounts due to/from related parties and
holding company, we would have had a working capital surplus of
$1,215,256 at December 31, 2016. The amount due from related
parties are unsecured, interest free and repayable on demand.
Lutu is working with the related parties and expects to have the
amounts offset or settled on or before Jun 30, 2017.


During the year ended December 31, 2016, operating activities
used cash of $356,612, and for the year ended December 31, 2015,
operating activities used cash in operations of $5,066. The use
of cash in operating activities was derived from 2016 net loss
$1,049,897 with non-cash item $274,935 in depreciation and
amortization; moreover, there were $778,555 increase in accounts
receivable; $69,502 decrease in advances from customer; $59,883
decrease in other payable, $20,438 decrease in accounts payable
which were offset by the increase in amount due to related

Summary


In the fertilizer industry financial success is based upon user
acceptance of the products, which further relies upon the cost of
production and the nutrient balances with less soil pollutions.
Although we believe our biotechnology fertilizers are performing
better than the chemical fertilizers in terms of aspects
including product yield, eco-friendliness, environmental
protection and etc., there can be no guarantee that our products
will be widely accepted by the agricultural industry in the short
term future. The Company is working hard to increase the market
share and sales revenue, to improve the products quantity, and to
minimize the production cost and operating expenses. The Company
is also looking for funding opportunity to improve the financing
resources. There can be no guarantee that all the above
objectives can be achieved.


Off Balance Sheet Arrangements


At December 31, 2016 there are no obligations that would qualify
as off-balance sheet arrangements.

Market Information


There is a limited public market for our common shares. Our
common shares are not quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board at this
time.Trading in stocks quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board is often
thin and is characterized by wide fluctuations in trading prices
due to many factors that may be unrelated to a companys
operations or business prospects. We cannot assure you that there
will be a market in the future for our common stock.


OTC Bulletin Board securities are not listed or traded on the
floor of an organized national or regional stock exchange.
Instead, OTC Bulletin Board securities transactions are conducted
through a telephone and computer network connecting dealers in
stocks. OTC Bulletin Board issuers are traditionally smaller
companies that do not meet the financial and other listing
requirements of a regional or national stock exchange.

an exchange or on the OTC Marketplace.

ITEM 3.02 UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY
SECURITIES.


Reference is made to the disclosure set forth under Item 2.01 of
this Current Report on Form 8-K, which disclosure is incorporated
herein by reference.


ITEM 4.01 CHANGES IN REGISTRANTS
CERTIFYING ACCOUNTANT.


Since June 8, 2015, GVBTs independent registered public
accounting firm has been LBB Associates Ltd., LLP, with offices
located in Houston, Texas (LBB). Lutu Internationals independent
registered public accounting firm that audited its annual
financial statements for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2016
and 2015, has been Centurion ZD CPA Limited, an independent
registered public accounting firm with offices in Hong Kong
(Centurion). As a result of the acquisition referenced above in
Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive
Agreement, whereby all of the issued and outstanding
shares of Lutu International acquired by GVBT, Lutu International
is deemed to be the acquiring entity for accounting purposes.
GVBT and Lutu International have decided that Centurion will
continue as the independent registered public accounting firm for
Lutu International in place of LBB. Such election requires that
the following disclosures be made to Item of 304 of Regulation
S-K.








Page 88 of 93











(a) Through May 12, 2017, LBB
was GVBTs independent registered public accounting firm. As of
May 12, 2017, in connection with the completion of the reverse
takeover of GVBT by Lutu International as contemplated by the
agreements described in Item 1.01 Entry into a Material
Definitive Agreement, LBB has been dismissed as GVBTs
independent registered public accounting firm.


Other than an explanatory paragraph included in LBBs audit report
for GVBTs fiscal years ended January 31, 2017 and 2016, relating
to the uncertainty of GVBTs ability to continue as a going
concern, the audit report of LBB on GVBT financial statements for
fiscal years ended January 31, 2017 and 2016, did not contain an
adverse opinion or a disclaimer of opinion, nor was it qualified
or modified as to uncertainty, audit scope or accounting
principles.


During GVBTs fiscal years ended January 31, 2017 and 2016 and
through May 12, 2017, there were no disagreements (as defined in
item 304 of Regulation S-K) with LBB on any matter of accounting
principles or practices, financial statement disclosure, or
auditing scope or procedure, which disagreements, if not resolved
to the satisfaction of LBB, would have caused it to make
reference to the subject matter of the disagreements in
connection with their report.


GVBT furnished LBB with a copy of this disclosure on May 12,
2017,providing LBB with the opportunity to furnish GVBT with a
letter addressed to the Commission stating whether they agree
with the statements made by GVBT herein in response to Item
304(a) of Regulation S-K and, if not, stating the respect in
which they do not agree. A copy of LBBS letter addressed to the
Commission is filed as Exhibit 16.1 to this Report.


(b) As of May 12, 2017, GVBT has engaged Centurion as its
independent accountant to audit its financial statements and to
perform reviews of interim financial statements. During the
fiscal years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 and then through
May 12, 2017, neither GVBT nor anyone acting on its behalf
consulted with Centurion regarding (i) either the application of
any accounting principles to a specific completed or contemplated
transaction of GVBT, or the type of audit opinion that might be
rendered by LBB on GVBTs financial statements; or (ii) any matter
that was either the subject of a disagreement with LBB or a
reportable event with respect to LBB.


ITEM 5.01 CHANGE IN CONTROL OF REGISTRANT


Reference is made to the disclosure set forth under Item 2.01 of
this Current Report on Form 8-K, which disclosure is incorporated
herein by reference.







Page 89 of 93











ITEM 5.02 DEPARTURE OF DIRECTORS OR CERTAIN OFFICERS;
ELECTION OF DIRECTORS; APPOINTMENT OF CERTAIN OFFICERS;
COMPENSATORY ARRANGEMENTS OF CERTAIN OFFICERS


Reference is made to the disclosure set forth under Item 2.01 of
this Current Report on Form 8-K, which disclosure is incorporated
herein by reference.


ITEM 5.03 AMENDMENTS TO ARTICLES OF INCORPORATION OR
BYLAW; CHANGE OF FISCAL YEAR


The fiscal year-end for Lutu International is December 31. On
[Date], the board of directors of the GVBT approved changing the
fiscal year-end of GVBT from January 31 to December 31 in
connection with the Investment Transaction.


ITEM 5.06 CHANGE IN SHELL COMPANY STATUS


As a result of the consummation of the Investment Transaction
described in Item 2.01 of this Current Report on Form 8-K, we
believe that we are no longer a shell corporation as that term is
defined in Rule 405 of the Securities Act and Rule 12b-2 of the
Exchange Act.
