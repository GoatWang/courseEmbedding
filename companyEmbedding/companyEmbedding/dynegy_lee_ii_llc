Item 1.01        Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
On July 10, 2017, Dynegy Inc. ("Dynegy") entered into a Membership Interest
Purchase Agreement (the "Agreement") with Bruce Power, LLC (the "Purchaser"), a
Delaware limited liability company and wholly owned subsidiary of Rockland Power
Partners III, LP ("Rockland"). Subject to the terms and conditions of the
Agreement, the Purchaser will purchase from one of Dynegy's subsidiaries all of
the issued and outstanding limited liability company interests of Dynegy Lee II,
LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (the "Acquired Company"), for a
purchase price of $180 million in cash, subject to certain adjustments.
The Agreement includes customary representations, warranties and covenants by
the parties and customary closing conditions, including approval by the Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission ("FERC") and the expiration or early termination of
the applicable waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act.
In addition, each party has agreed to indemnify the other for breaches of
representations, warranties and covenants and for certain other matters, subject
to certain exceptions and limitations.
Each of Dynegy and the Purchaser are permitted to terminate the Agreement under
certain circumstances, including if the closing does not occur within 180 days
after the filing of the FERC approval application (subject to certain extension
rights if necessary to obtain any outstanding regulatory approvals).
In connection with the execution of the Agreement, Rockland delivered a limited
guaranty in favor of Dynegy, pursuant to which, subject to the terms and
conditions set forth therein, Rockland guarantees certain of the Purchaser's
obligations under the Agreement.
The foregoing description of the Agreement and the transactions contemplated
thereby is not complete and is subject to, and qualified in its entirety by
reference to, the full text of the Agreement, a copy of which is attached as
Exhibit 2.1 hereto and the terms of which are incorporated herein by reference.


Item 8.01        Other Events.



On July 11, 2017, the Company issued a press release announcing Dynegy's entry
into the Agreement. A copy of the press release is filed herewith as
Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.

               and between Dynegy Inc. and Bruce Power, LLC*
