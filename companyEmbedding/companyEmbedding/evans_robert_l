I hired an attorney, but she mismanaged the matter horribly, and I was beside myself, not knowing what to do. On a Sunday morning I decided to look in the phonebook for a new attorney, and I found Jim Mietzel. I called him, and we chatted. I made an appointment to see him, and from that moment on the problems began to disappear. Since that time, as a local professional in private practice, I have consulted Jim on a variety of matters, both business and personal, and have always received superb counsel. Since that time, I have referred literally hundreds of people to Jim Mietzel for help, and I have never had a single one of them report back that they were less than satisfied. Jim has a wealth of legal expertise, is well connected with the local legal community, knows the ropes, and is a straight shooter who will always tell you the practical points of your situation and never lead you down "the primrose path" just to collect bigger fees.Jim is a combat veteran of the Vietnam War, a Purple Heart recipient, and a guy who has never backed down from a fight in his life. If you get him on your side, you can be sure that you are being well represented.Jim's wonderful wife, Anne, practices with him and specializes in probate.Give them a call, and you will be glad you did.Howard Alan Kitay Law Officesaaddison511 ratedI had gone into the grocery store for ice and normally you pay for it at the register and they would go get it because it was this really strange ice chest. This time the lady told me to go get it myself. I slipped and fell, and I hit the ground so hard I couldn't move for what seemed like eternity. I fractured my knee, and they told me that my knee will never heal right. That it was going to have to be replaced. I had just started physical therapy when and infection set in and they thought they were going to have to remove my knee for a year, which would put me in a wheel chair for a year. Instead they sent me to the Surgical Wound Center where they treated me for about 4 months. Evdentally when I fell, I also injured my neck, it just didn't hurt as bad as my knee so I didn't notice. My spinal fluid stopped flowing. The day I was discharged for my knee, I woke up paralyzed on my left side. So they had to do emergency surgery. Howard was always availible to me, anytime anything came up, he was right there to answer. He did really well with me and I would HIGHLY recommend him to anyone and everyone.Law Offices of Andrew H.

After being taken advantaged, literally robbed financially by two, white collar criminals, incompetent attorneys- Duff and Stacy, I had lost faith in the attorney ethics, and professionalism. Mr.Griffith is outstanding, caring, and very knowledgeable. It is my wish to have him as my attorney in real state related matters until God calls me in, because he is the BEST. He is also bilingual, Spanish and English and his office staff are a projection of him,professional, knowledgeable and courteous. I am in debt for helping me succed in my Chapter 11. If can be of further help or provide a recommenddation, I will gladly and loyally will! May God provide him with long health, plenty of monies, and much deserved appreciation, and acknowledgement by the San Diego Courts. LOVE, Raquel H. Barrios.Howard Alan Kitay Law Officesfvdzsg5484 ratedI was driving my truck down the road and a 94 year old woman ran a stop sign and t-boned my truck, completely spun me around. I had to go through therapy and surgery on my left shoulder. The insurance company and Howard helped me through all that and got me a nice settlement. I want to thank Howard for helping me get the award and get my sum and get my life and body back to normal. They wanted to give me next to nothing for the accident, Howard was able to come in and fight for me, and was able to give me the settlement that I needed to get all my doctor bills paid for. When all is said and done, I wouldn't have been able to do that without him. I would not hesitate to recommend somebody else to him, 'cause he can do that job. He's very knowledgeable about the law and that's what it's all about. Someone you can rely on, someone you can trust, and someone you can depend on to get the job done and get you what you need as far as the compensation.Howard Alan Kitay Law Officesjasminee99 ratedI was in an accident about 4 years ago. I was driving home from work and I was stopped in rush hour traffic, and a car came, from behind, at 50 miles an hour without stopping. The car hit me, pushed me into the car in front of me, and totalled my vehicle. I was injured and not able to get our of my car at the time. I ended up in the hospital, just for the night, but I ended up having residual back and neck pain. The other driver was under-insured, she only had $5,000 worth of insurance and we ended up having to sue her insurance company, and her as well. We ended up taking it to court and won our case. I was referred to Mr. Kitay by my niece, who had also been in an accident, and had positive results. Him, his staff, his entire team, were always accessible, they were very professional, they were compassionate, and very helpful in helping me get through the court experience. Most definitely recommend Howard Kitay to anybody.Howard Alan Kitay Law Officesashleya8 ratedI was involved in an auto accident. It was a 6 car collision. My vehicle was number 3. I was injured in my right knee and left shoulder. My friends recommended Howard Kitay as an auto accident specialist. Everyone was very friendly; they took on my case and I didn't have to worry about anything. The case almost went to trial but wound up settling out of the court, for a good undisclosed amount. I was very satisfied with this settlement. I would highly recommend to anybody who was involved in an auto accident. He and his team are very professional.

Here are some of the most common attorneys individuals seek out when they require legal aid:Criminal Lawyer
A criminal defense lawyer is probably the attorney the average person imagines. Criminal attorneys are the men and women who defend individuals accused of a crime. The lawyer may work pro bono - for the public good - so the accused is certain to have representation, even if he or she cannot afford an attorney.Criminal lawyers are experts in the criminal justice system. They help their clients decide how to plead when first charged by the police and guide them through trial procedures. Defense lawyers must use every bit of their knowledge and resources to get their clients the fairest results from criminal proceedings.Business Lawyer
If you are a small business owner or the head of a larger corporation, you may come into contact with a business lawyer. Many big companies keep a legal staff on payroll to deal with the daily operations of running and maintaining a large enterprise. Business lawyers may have more specific specialties like copyright law, product liability and mergers and acquisitions.Business attorneys may focus their practices on certain industries. There are entertainment lawyers to guide artists through royalties and media contracts, while hospitals employ malpractice attorneys to protect doctors from aggressive litigation.Employment Lawyer
When you work for a company, you may find yourself in need of an employment lawyer - especially if the relationship between you and your employer sours. An employment attorney prevents people from losing their jobs due to unfair reasons. Workers' compensation lawyers help maintain safe employment conditions and ensure workers receive fair compensation after workplace injury or discrimination.Finance Lawyer
A personal finance attorney can protect and manage your investments and securities. You may use a finance lawyer to help you prepare your taxes, but you might be better off working with an accountant. A tax attorney is more commonly contacted after a business or individual runs into trouble with the IRS or state regulators.Real Estate Lawyer
Your family may keep a lawyer on retainer to guide you through the major expenses that come up in life. When buying a home, you could work with a real estate lawyer to make sure you get the best deal and won't get taken advantage of by tricky mortgage agreements or unfair landlords. An estate attorney can help you plan for the worst by creating a will and preparing your finances for after your death.Bankruptcy Lawyer
A bankruptcy lawyer is essential to help you resolve your financial difficulties when they start to spin out of control. Certain attorneys help create strategies to bring you out of debt and speak to your creditors. A lawyer can advise you on which type of bankruptcy you should file for.Civil Lawyer
If you are suing someone or being sued, you need a civil lawyer. Civil attorneys - and criminal lawyers - are the legal representatives who argue on your behalf in a courtroom setting. Civil lawyers may represent you on matters of business, finance or a wide variety of other specialized needs.One of the most common types of civil attorneys is a personal injury lawyer. When you're hurt by an outside party and you would like to hold them legally responsible, a personal injury attorney conducts litigation and negotiates settlements to compensate for your pain and suffering. Sometimes many wronged people will join together with a single civil lawyer or law office to form a class action lawsuit.Family/Divorce Lawyer
Most people will turn to a lawyer during a divorce to navigate the emotionally charged legal proceedings. A divorce attorney can assist in determining grounds for separation, division of property and custody of children.Family attorneys deal with much more personal matters. If you're getting married, a family lawyer can help you prepare a prenuptial agreement or other family planning paperwork such as adoption or inheritance documents.Questions One Should Ask a Lawyer Before Hiring ThemTo ensure you find a competent attorney who won't abuse your trust or drain your finances, you have to make the proper inquiries. There are several questions you should ask, but the majority will fall under three general topics:Training and Experience Questions
One of the best ways to determine quality is to examine an attorney's history. When you first step into a lawyer's office, you should check for the appropriate certifications and diplomas. You have to ask how long he or she has practiced law and request information that demonstrates the practice's success. Look for precise details such as percentage of cases settled out of court.Once you inquire about the broad details of their legal career, you should ask questions about their experience that pertains to your specific issue. You should ask how many similar cases they have handled and if they have special skills or training that applies specifically to your needs. Lawyers can't mention clients by name, but you should ask for basic details about identical past cases.Financial Questions
You need to ask about every possible fee that will come up when working with an attorney. You should request a list of all costs in advance so you won't be surprised by additional expenses like overhead. Also determine exactly when you will start being billed. You want to inspect paperwork carefully. If the attorney charges you for his or her experience, you need to make sure he or she will perform tasks personally and not hand it off to an assistant.Find out if the attorney has a flat fee or charges by the hour. Many civil lawyers work on contingency. Whatever the payment plan, make inquiries about how the lawyer plans to provide service for your money and what you can do if you start to feel unsatisfied with his or her performance.Lawyer/Client Relationship Questions
When you hire a lawyer, you're agreeing to work with someone over a certain period of time. You need to ask questions about how the attorney will communicate with you and what responsibilities you hold in the relationship. The attorney should let you know the best channel for quick communication and you need to inform him or her when you want updates.You should also ask questions to get to know the attorney as an individual in order to ensure this is a person you can trust. Ask about their legal philosophy and how he or she views the lawyer/client relationship. Great questions to start off with are ones that will make your life easier, such as how to keep fees down or what daily disruptions you should expect from a long legal battle. The more forthcoming the lawyer appears to be with individual needs, the better.Top Reasons to Hire a LawyerYou may keep a lawyer on retainer or you could turn to an attorney during specific situations. Here are some common reasons people begin seeking legal representation or advice:You Know Your Limitations
If you sign documents and you come across a word you don't recognize, you need assistance. You may need a third party to help you navigate important employment or real estate paperwork. It's essential you fully understand the terms of any legally binding documentation or activity you become a part of. If you are not an expert in a given field, you'll want to hire an attorney who is.A lawyer may find legal implications or opportunities you might miss. If you find yourself in a civil or criminal matter, a proper attorney ensures you don't receive a harsh punishment for a small mistake.You're Facing an Important Event/Decision
When making decisions critical to your financial stability or personal life, you may want a lawyer with expertise in your situation to make sure you do everything you can to arrive at the proper resolution. This is especially true when you become involved in a criminal case and your freedom is on the line.It's not just a matter of legal knowledge; lawyer's have access to numerous resources you do not. They have staff ready to work around the clock and experts in a variety of fields to give your important issues the attention they deserve.You Can't Be Impartial
During times when personal matters intersect with legal proceedings, you may need to have an advocate to prevent your emotions from getting in the way of level-headed thinking. For example, divorce lawyers can mediate a heated argument and help both partners get on with their lives.Emotional investment could be subtle. You may want to have a lawyer look over an investment opportunity that looks too good to be true or investigate the merits of a possible civil suit when you feel wronged.You're Out of Options
Many people turn to lawyers when they are in trouble. If you've been accused of a crime or are in a terrible financial situation, you can find an attorney who will work with what you have available to assist you as you deal with your problems.Personal injury lawyers find solutions for people who can no longer work under their own power and bankruptcy attorneys prevent people from giving in to debt. If you find yourself in a situation where you can't find a solution, a lawyer may be able to offer the counsel you need.How to Choose a LawyerWhen it comes time to choose a lawyer, you should start by searching close to home. While you probably don't want the conflict of interest that comes from being represented by a family member, friends and loved ones can recommend lawyers who served them well in the past. If you do have attorneys you are familiar with, ask who they believe would be best for you.After going through personal references - especially from individuals who had similar needs - you should broaden your search through public information resources. You can call your area's attorney referral service or check legal organizations like Martindale-Hubbell. There are other resources available online. You should check websites for client reviews and other third-party forms of approval.When you build a list of possible candidates, perform a background check on each one. See if you can find information on their history and success record. Once you find a possible lawyer, you should call to arrange a consultation so you can ask your important questions in person.By performing the necessary research and taking every available precaution, you can narrow your search to the attorney most suited to your needs.

Overview
The Nag Hammadi Texts and the Bible places in synoptic form parallel texts from Nag Hammadi and from the Bible. This will enable scholars of Coptic Gnosticism, as well as scholars concerned with early Christian biblical interpretation, to make the comparisons necessary to determine relationships and what dependence, if any, there may be between these two bodies of material. This volume should facilitate the discussion concerning the origin, antiquity, and relationship of Gnosticism to Christianity.
Not all proposed relationships between parallel texts are as firmly determined as others. The goal of this work is not to present a definitive guide to all parallels between the Nag Hammadi texts and Scripture, but rather to present potential and probably parallels in a convenient and helpful manner in order to further scholarly discussion. In light of the heated debate that revolves around these issues, Nag Hammadi Texts and the Bible functions as a tool for helping students and scholars examine these complex issues and draw their own conclusions on questions of relationships, origins, chronology, and direction of influence in the various parallels gathered in this volume.
The volume also contains an extensive bibliography of materials relevant to this topic with a Scripture index that will make it possible for the reader to find any desired passage quickly. All those who are interested in the function of biblical literature in the Nag Hammadi Library, the relationship of the biblical writings to Gnosticism, and the history of interpretative traditions will appreciate the efforts that Craig Evans, Robert Webb, and Richard Wiebe have contributed toward creating this superior resource.


Key Features

Parallel English synopsis of the Nag Hammadi texts and the Bible
Additional references to biblical texts with thematic labels
Cross-references to other Nag Hammadi and Biblical texts discussed



Praise for the Print Edition
This volume will be of great use not only to scholars and students of Gnosticism but also to those interested in the history of biblical interpretation. It deserves a place on the shelves of every research library.
—Birger A. Pearson, Religious Studies Review, 1995
