This report is not for commercial use. Thorough reviews have been conducted to assure this data accurately reflects disclosures. However for a complete and definitive understanding of the pay practices of any company, users should refer directly to the actual, complete proxy statement. 
Use of Data / Disclaimer
The information shown here is a reporting of information included in the company's proxy statement. The proxy statement includes footnotes and explanations of this information plus other information that is pertinent in assessing the overall value and appropriateness of the compensation information. For those interested in conducting a detailed compensation analysis, we recommend that you review the entire proxy statement. You may retrieve the full proxy statement by going to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) website at www.sec.gov and entering the company's name and then looking in the first column for an entry of "Form DEF 14A" (or any similar code). You may also find the annual proxy statement by going directly to the company's website.
What is a proxy statement?
A proxy statement (or "proxy") is a form that every publicly traded U.S. company is required to file with the U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) within 120 days after the end of its fiscal year. The proxy must be sent to every shareholder in advance of the company's annual shareholders meeting. All proxy statements are public filings made available to the general public by the SEC.
The proxy statement's main purpose is to alert shareholders to the annual meeting and provide them information about the issues that will be voted on during the annual meeting, including decisions such as electing directors, ratifying the selection of auditors, and other shareholder-related decisions, including shareholder-initiated initiatives. Also, proxies must disclose specific detailed information regarding the pay practices for certain executives.

Socio-Cognitive Dynamics in a Product Market

University of Illinois Dept. of Business Admin. Working Paper No. 99-0106

Abstract
This paper explores the origins and evolution of product markets from a socio-cognitive perspective. Product markets are defined as socially-constructed knowledge structures (i.e., product conceptual systems) that are shared among produces and consumers--sharing that allows consumers and producers to interact in the market. Our fundamental thesis is that product markets are neither imposed nor orchestrated by producers or consumers, but evolve from producer-consumer interaction feedback effects. Starting as unstable, incomplete, and disjointed conceptual systems held by market actors--which are revealed in the cacophony of uses, claims, and product standards that characterize emerging product markets--we propose that product markets become coherent as a result of consumers and producers making sense of one another's behaviors. We further argue that the sensemaking process is revealed in the stories that consumer magazines and producers tell one another in published media, such as industry newspapers and consumer magazines, which we use as date sources. Specific hypothesis pertaining to the use of product category labels in published sources and the acceptability of different product category members throughout the development process are tested for the minivan market between 1982 and 1988. Our findings suggest that category labels for emerging and pre-existing categories. Our findings also show that as stabilization occurred around a category prototype, the acceptability of particular models changed without any physical changes to the models.
