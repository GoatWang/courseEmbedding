Customer Testimonials





Supporting business growth"The use of an electronic parts and logistics research service played a key role in winning over $40 million in defense orders. With IHS Haystack® Gold, we can get far more detailed information in 30 seconds. Because the tool is interactive, we can browse through the data to make sure the answers are what we are looking for.”Ensuring value pricing“I love using IHS Haystack® Gold. It helps us justify our pricing. That’s what I use Haystack for more than anything else - price justification. I work in the Emergency Buy Department and sometimes the pricing isn’t as good as we would like it to be. We need further justification. That’s when I go to Haystack to get my pricing and my justification. It helps with my documentation too. I love it for that.”Delivering savings"Upon searching for alternate sources through Procurement History in IHS Haystack® Gold, the part was found sitting on a shelf for a cost of $29,000. Even if we have the part refurbished, a saving of $18,000 is still achieved.”
