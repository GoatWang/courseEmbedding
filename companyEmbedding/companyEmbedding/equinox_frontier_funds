*For each fund with at least a three-year history, Morningstar calculates a Morningstar Rating™ based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a funds’ monthly performance (including the effects of sales charges, loads, and redemption fees), placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of funds in each category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. (Each share class is counted as a fraction of one fund within this scale and rated separately, which may cause slight variations in the distribution percentages.) The Overall Morningstar Rating for a fund is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, and ten-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics.

About Equinox Funds

At Equinox Funds, we are pioneers in developing investor-friendly alternatives, such as the first multi-strategy managed futures mutual fund. We started with managed futures because we believe they are the single most powerful diversifier for a portfolio of stocks and bonds. But we’ve also moved into other alternative assets such as hedged equities, which can potentially help reduce risk and enhance the returns of an overall portfolio over time.
With a deep research culture, our mission is to bring the potential benefits of alternatives to institutions and individuals by offering diverse investment strategies that can help meet the unique goals of each investor, including:  
Commodity Pools
Multi-Strategy Mutual Funds
Single-Strategy Mutual Funds
Specialized Institutional Solutions
In addition to our alternative investment offerings, specific services for institutions, family groups, trusts, charitable foundations and pension funds are provided through the Equinox Institutional Asset Management division. Equinox Institutional is an investment advisor that specializes in the construction, implementation and monitoring of multi-manager portfolios as well as the evaluation of traditional equity and fixed income strategies within an overall portfolio construction framework.
Averaging 20 years of hedge fund and managed futures investing experience, the Equinox Institutional portfolio management team has deep research capabilities and a strong track record managing large, multi-strategy portfolios across the entire spectrum of liquid alternatives, including:
Managed futures
Equity long-short
Arbitrage
Sector specific
Emerging managers
Customized institutional mandates
Research and Development
Our research and development group, Equinox Financial Solutions, is responsible for the design and customization of innovative products and solutions that seek to meet the needs of leading financial institutions across the globe.  The team’s broad research capabilities, industry connectivity and product development expertise facilitate the structuring of highly-customized products that attempt to meet bespoke needs that cannot be met through standard investment vehicles.  Led by John E. Pallat III, co-founder of Equinox Funds, our research and development team has been involved in the design of Equinox’s mutual funds and other offerings including but not limited to:
Structured products

Insights
Managed Futures During Equity "Crises"—An Update










Most individual and institutional portfolios generally have substantial (often 50% or larger) positions in equities and equity-related asset classes. Because the “risk” of these asset classes is generally quite high, the majority of the total risk of these portfolios is driven by equities. Hence, most financial crises, almost by definition, involve large declines in equities, accompanied by similar trends in other markets, as most investors resort to panic selling of risky assets all at the same time. Generally, market volatility also spikes during these times. Many equity market crises are also characterized by a "flight to safety," with increased investments into assets such as the US Dollar, precious metals, and US Treasury securities. These strong price trends and the accompanying volatility expansion can often prove to be an environment in which managed futures have thrived.
The Managed Futures asset class has acquired a reputation among investors for providing what is known as "crisis alpha" – the ability to generate returns at a time of market crisis.1
The latest example of this was the period December 2015 – January 2016, when the S&P 500® Total Return Index lost −6.5%, while the VIX® Index, a forward-looking measure of equity market volatility, spiked by more than 25% (increasing from about 16% at the end of November 2015 to more than 20% at the end of January 2016). The “crisis,” in this instance, has been attributed to Mario Draghi’s underwhelming stimulus measures announced in early December, perhaps exacerbated by the US Fed’s first rate hike, albeit widely anticipated and long overdue, since 2006. Over this period, the Barclay BTOP 50® Index, which is often used as a proxy for the managed futures asset class, gained approximately +1.3%.
Several commentators, including us, have addressed and analyzed this characteristic of managed futures during other past crises. Here, we update those results, using a slightly different and perhaps more “rigorous” definition of a crisis. We look for periods since 1987 when the VIX® Index has either shown an increase of 25% or greater, or has reached an absolute level of at least 30%. We then try to identify the qualitative reason for such an increase, e.g., the events of 9/11/2001, the Greek crisis, etc. Next, we examine the returns on the S&P 500® Total Return Index, equities, and the BTOP 50® Index, managed futures, over those periods.  
Our results are summarized below, and speak for themselves. In every single one of these crises, as we define them, equity markets trade lower, ranging from −6.5% to from −46.4%. Managed futures, by way of contrast, show only three periods with negative returns, ranging from −2.8% to −0.2%, but twelve periods with positive returns, ranging from +1.0% to +18.7%.

It is worth exploring possible explanations for these historical results. These are summarized succinctly in the paper by Kaminski, cited earlier, as follows:
Managed futures strategies tend to be highly liquid and trade almost exclusively in futures markets with minimal credit exposure; hence, they may be less susceptible to the illiquidity and credit traps that are generally prevalent during equity market crisis.
		 
They are dominated by systematic trading strategies, with no long equity bias; hence, they tend to be less susceptible to behavioral biases and the emotion-based or panic-driven selling that is often triggered when large losses are experienced.
		 
They trade across a wide range of sectors and markets, and can hold either long or short exposures, depending on perceived price trends; hence, they have the potential to profit from both up-trends and down-trends across multiple global futures markets.
Our evidence is based purely on historical data, and there is no assurance that these patterns will necessarily repeat during future crises. Further, managed futures as an asset class tend to have low correlations to most other asset classes, which means they have the potential to provide diversification benefits by lowering the overall risk of a portfolio. However, they should not be viewed as “hedges,” because a hedge is traditionally defined as an asset that has a high negative correlation.

PAST PERFORMANCE DATA QUOTED HERE REPRESENTS PAST PERFORMANCE. CURRENT PERFORMANCE MAY BE LOWER OR HIGHER THAN THE PERFROMANCE QUOTED ABOVE. PAST PERFORMANCE DOES NOT GUARANTEE FUTURE RESULTS.
Diversification does not ensure profit or prevent losses. An investment in Managed Futures is speculative and involves a high degree of risk. You can lose money in a Managed Futures Program. There is no guarantee that an investment in Managed Futures will achieve its objectives, goals, generate positive returns, or avoid losses.
A Word About Risk
	The purchase of a managed futures investment involves a high degree of risk. Specifically, you should be aware that, in addition to normal investment risks, managed futures investments entail certain risks, including, in all or some cases:
• Managed futures often engage in leveraging and other speculative investment practices that may increase the risk of investment loss.
	• Managed futures can be highly illiquid.
	• Managed futures are not required to provide periodic pricing or valuation information to investors.
	• Managed futures may involve complex tax structures and delays in distributing important tax information.
	• Managed futures are not subject to the same regulatory requirements as mutual funds.
	• Managed futures often charge high fees

Aspect Stays True to Trend


The Hedge Fund Journal sits down with Aspect Capital’s Anthony Todd, co-founder & CEO, and Martin Lueck, co-founder and Research Director, to discuss the Firm’s history, research process, and what they believe sets them apart from hundreds of other CTAs.
“Performance apart, what differentiates Aspect from the many hundreds of other CTAs and managed futures funds. Longevity is one factor. Aspect was co-founded in 1997 but its track record dates back much longer to the early 1980s.”
Aspect Capital is the commodity trading advisor for the Equinox Aspect Core Diversified Strategy Fund.

b. This Site is intended to be available only to persons that accept the T&Cs (as defined below). Such persons and duly authorized representatives are referred to in these T&Cs as “users” or “you” and by words of similar import. It is the responsibility of users to take reasonable steps to cause their respective representatives to comply with these T&Cs. Each user is requested to bring to our attention promptly any aspect of the material on, or the functionality of, this Site that is not to the user’s satisfaction or appears defective in any way.
c. The terms “Equinox Fund Management, LLC Web Site” and this “Site” mean the web site having a Uniform Resource Locator (or URL) of equinoxfunds.com, ctaperformance.com and onmanagedfutures.com.  We endeavor to maintain this Site and its operation to the highest standards, but we are not, and cannot be, responsible for the results of any defects that may exist in the Site or its operation.

These T&Cs apply to the use of this Site and to the use through this Site of the various features that are accessible, or may become accessible in the future, from this Site (collectively, “Features”). The use of some or all of the Features may be subject to disclosures or disclaimers that are contained within or linked to those Features.
b. There may be provisions in separate subscription and account agreements, if any, executed between Equinox Fund Management or its affiliates and you which govern aspects of the use of this Site. If there is an inconsistency between these T&Cs and any such agreements, the inconsistency will be resolved in favor of the agreements.
3. Content Does Not Consist of Investment Advice or Recommendations
a. This Site and its contents are for informational purposes only. If you wish to obtain further details about any information contained on this Site, please contact us using the information at “About Us.”
b. You alone will need to evaluate the merits and risks associated with the use of this Site. Decisions based on information obtained from this Site or the use of the Features are your sole responsibility, and before making any decision on the basis of this information, you should consider (with or without the assistance of a financial, legal, tax or other adviser) whether the information is appropriate in light of your particular investment needs, objectives and financial circumstances.
c. Although this Site may provide information relating to approaches to investing or types of securities and investments you might buy, sell or hold, no information available through this Site is intended or should be construed as any advice, recommendation or endorsement from us as to any legal, tax, investment or other matter. Nothing on this Site shall be considered a solicitation or offer to buy or sell any security, future, option or other financial instrument or to offer or provide any investment advice or service to any person in any jurisdiction. Nothing contained on this Site constitutes or should be construed as investment advice or an opinion with respect to the suitability of any security. In preparing the information contained in this Site, we have not taken into account the investment needs, objectives and financial circumstances of any particular person. Some or all alternative investment programs may not be suitable for certain investors.
d. Any views expressed on this Site by us were prepared based upon the information available to us at the time such views were written. Changed or additional information could cause such views to change. All information is subject to possible correction. Information may quickly become unreliable for various reasons, including changes in market conditions or economic circumstances. If an investment is denominated in a currency other than the recipient's currency, changes in the rates of exchange may have an adverse effect on value, price or income. The levels and bases of taxation may also change from time to time.
e. This Site contains performance information, which may include rates of return for the various Portfolios (as defined in Section 4 below), investment strategies forming a part thereof, statistical analyses and the like. You are cautioned that past performance is not necessarily indicative of future results. In addition, certain performance information set forth on this Site may be simulated or hypothetical. No representation is being made that any investment product will or is likely to achieve profits or losses similar to those shown.
f. The content and any materials made available through this web site are provided "as is" and without warranties of any kind, either express or implied. To the fullest extent permissible pursuant to applicable law, we disclaim all warranties, express or implied, including, but not limited to, all implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title and non-infringement. We do not warrant or make any representations regarding the use or the results of the use of the materials in this web site in terms of their correctness, accuracy, reliability or otherwise. The materials in this web site could include technical inaccuracies or typographical errors. These materials could become inaccurate as a result of developments occurring after their respective dates. We undertake no obligation to maintain the currency of such information.
4. Offer by Prospectus Only
The information on this Site does not constitute an offer of a partnership interest, share in a company, or a managed account in a portfolio (“Portfolios”, and each such interest, share or managed account, a “Portfolio Interest”) (or any other financial instrument), which offer may be made only by means of an approved Prospectus, as applicable. The Prospectus will not be sent to any person to whom it is unlawful to make an offer or solicitation. The material terms and risks associated with an investment in the PortfolioInterests are disclosed in the Prospectus.
5. Hypothetical Performance
Hypothetical performance results have many inherent limitations, some of which are described below. No representation is being made that any account will or is likely to achieve profits or losses similar to those shown. In fact, there are frequently sharp differences between hypothetical performance results and the actual results subsequently achieved by any particular trading program.
One of the limitations of hypothetical performance results is that they are generally prepared with the benefit of hindsight. In addition, hypothetical trading does not involve financial risk, and no hypothetical trading record can completely account for the impact of financial risk in actual trading. For example, the ability to withstand losses or to adhere to a particular trading program in spite of trading losses are material points which can also adversely affect actual trading results. There are numerous other factors related to the markets in general or to the implementation of any specific trading program which cannot be fully accounted for in the preparation of hypothetical performance results and all of which can adversely affect actual trading results.
6. Jurisdictional Information and Geographic Limitations
Unless otherwise specified, we control and operate this Site from our offices within the State of Colorado, United States of America. The information available at this Site, including the description of the services and products referred to on this Site, is restricted in certain jurisdictions. Not all products and services are available in all geographic areas. Your eligibility for particular products and services is subject to local law and regulation. Persons who access this Site do so on their own initiative. Accordingly, persons who access this Site are required by Equinox Fund Management to inform themselves about and observe such restrictions. This information is not intended for distribution to, or use within, any jurisdiction, or use by any person, where such distribution or use would constitute a violation of law or regulation or would subject Equinox Fund Management to any additional registration registration requirement within such jurisdiction beyond being registered as a commodity trading advisor with the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission and an affiliate registered as a broker-dealer in the state of Colorado. Persons interested in acquiring PortfolioInterests should inform themselves as to: (a) the legal requirements within the countries of their nationality, residence, ordinary residence or domicile for such acquisitions; (b) any foreign exchange restriction or exchange control requirements which they might encounter on acquisition or disposal of Portfolio Interests; and (c) the taxation consequences which might be relevant to the acquisition, holding or disposal of PortfolioInterests under the laws of the countries of their citizenship, residence or domicile.
7. Acceptance and Modification of T&Cs
These T&Cs are accepted either by selecting the "I Accept and Acknowledge" button provided or by continued use of the Site. Acceptance by any representative of an entity is acceptance by that entity.

18. Modification and Termination of Service
a. We reserve the right to modify or discontinue all or any portion of this Site or any Feature made available thereby at any time without prior notice. The Site may also be unavailable during periods of maintenance or for other reasons.

d. We reserve the right to prohibit or restrict a particular user’s access to this Site, without giving notice of, or a reason for, such action.
19. Internet Security
Equinox uses the latest encryption technology, SSL, to protect private information transferred between your computer and Equinox.  You can establish a private, 6+-digit PIN, which you can change anytime. That way, you’re in control of your PIN.  You can terminate online access at any time by telephone. You can reestablish this access anytime as well. For added security, access revoked by telephone must be reestablished by telephone. Online access will be suspended after three unsuccessful logon attempts.
a. How We Secure Online Account Access
To prevent unauthorized access to your Equinox account via your computer, sessions with equinoxllc.com are automatically terminated after 30 minutes of inactivity. If you’d like to continue after this point in time, simply log on again.
b. Physical Security
Equinox provides leading edge technology to ensure that all information transmitted is safe and secure. Information is stored on a secure record keeping system that is located in secured areas of the buildings we occupy. All record keeping systems are located in a controlled area, with physical access limited to authorized persons. Authorized personnel escort visitors into controlled areas at all times. Employees of Equinox may, from time to time, have access to this information in order to fulfill our service commitment to you. However, physical access to the controlled areas is logged and each employee, upon employment with Equinox, is required to sign a security agreement concerning their individual duty to safeguard confidential data.
c. Cookies
Equinox may assign your computer browser a unique random identifier called a “cookie.” Doing so does not compromise your privacy or security in any way. We will simply use the data collected by the cookie to improve your Web experience and to evaluate the site’s services and features.
d. Encryption Technology
Equinox policy ensures that all information traveling between our server and your browser is encrypted. The degree of encryption depends on the browser of the user. Netscape Navigator 7.1, Microsoft Internet Explorer 6.0 and America Online 9.0 all support 128-bit encryption (strongest security). If your browser is an older version of Netscape Navigator, for example, your browser may only support 40-bit encryption, which is not as secure. Newer versions of Netscape Navigator 7.1, Microsoft Internet Explorer 6.0 and America Online 9.0 are downloadable of the Internet. Each browser contains an icon describing whether the connection is secure or not. If you are using Netscape Navigator 3x, a "broken" key icon depicts an insecure connection while a "whole" key icon depicts a secure connection. Netscape Communicator, Microsoft Internet Explorer, and AOL all use an "open" lock icon to depict an insecure connection and a "closed" lock icon to depict a secure connection. An additional method of determining if a page is secure is to look at the address. If the address begins with HTTPS (rather than the standard HTTP) the page is secure.
e. Secure Socket Layer (SSL)
Equinox is currently using SSL to transmit secure documents. SSL is a Netscape developed technology that allows for the transfer of encrypted code from our server to your computer. The following is a list of some of the browsers that support SSL technology: Netscape Navigator 7.1, Microsoft Internet 6.0, and AOL Web browser 9.0.
f. Firewalls
For additional security, Equinox has installed firewalls that filter Internet traffic preventing the unauthorized access of personal data. If you have any question regarding any of the security features at Equinox please call 1-800-820-0888 between 8:00 a.m. and 5:00 p.m. MST Mondays through Fridays
20. Copy of T&Cs
You may use your browser to download and/or print out a copy of these T&Cs for your records. However, we reserve all our copyrights in the T&Cs.

About Equinox Funds

At Equinox Funds, we are pioneers in developing investor-friendly alternatives, such as the first multi-strategy managed futures mutual fund. We started with managed futures because we believe they are the single most powerful diversifier for a portfolio of stocks and bonds. But we’ve also moved into other alternative assets such as hedged equities, which can potentially help reduce risk and enhance the returns of an overall portfolio over time.
With a deep research culture, our mission is to bring the potential benefits of alternatives to institutions and individuals by offering diverse investment strategies that can help meet the unique goals of each investor, including:  
Commodity Pools
Multi-Strategy Mutual Funds
Single-Strategy Mutual Funds
Specialized Institutional Solutions
In addition to our alternative investment offerings, specific services for institutions, family groups, trusts, charitable foundations and pension funds are provided through the Equinox Institutional Asset Management division. Equinox Institutional is an investment advisor that specializes in the construction, implementation and monitoring of multi-manager portfolios as well as the evaluation of traditional equity and fixed income strategies within an overall portfolio construction framework.
Averaging 20 years of hedge fund and managed futures investing experience, the Equinox Institutional portfolio management team has deep research capabilities and a strong track record managing large, multi-strategy portfolios across the entire spectrum of liquid alternatives, including:
Managed futures
Equity long-short
Arbitrage
Sector specific
Emerging managers
Customized institutional mandates
Research and Development
Our research and development group, Equinox Financial Solutions, is responsible for the design and customization of innovative products and solutions that seek to meet the needs of leading financial institutions across the globe.  The team’s broad research capabilities, industry connectivity and product development expertise facilitate the structuring of highly-customized products that attempt to meet bespoke needs that cannot be met through standard investment vehicles.  Led by John E. Pallat III, co-founder of Equinox Funds, our research and development team has been involved in the design of Equinox’s mutual funds and other offerings including but not limited to:
Structured products
UCITS
Commodity Pools
Unit Investment Trusts

There is a substantial risk of loss in managed futures, and there can be no guarantee that any managed futures program or the Equinox Frontier Funds will meet their intended objective; accordingly, an investment in the Equinox Frontier Funds may not be suitable for everyone. The Funds are highly speculative and their success depends upon the ability of Equinox Fund Management, LLC to allocate assets to multiple strategies and commodity trading advisors (“CTAs”). The Funds also rely on each of the CTAs chosen in meeting the investment objectives. An investment in the Funds involve a high degree of risk due to substantial price volatility in domestic and foreign markets for financial instruments, currencies, energy, metals, and commodities and the uncertainty as to the ability of the CTAs to profit in the markets traded.
Futures, forward, and options trading are speculative, volatile, and highly leveraged; select markets and instruments may be subject to liquidity restrictions from time to time.
An investor could lose a substantial portion, or even all, of his or her investment.
An investor’s annual tax liability may exceed cash distributions.
There is no secondary markets for the units and the transfer of units is restricted. If you redeem all or portion of your class 1 units before the end of 12 months following your purchase, you will be charged a redemption fee of up to 2% of the purchase prices of the units being redeemed.
The Funds face the risk of non-performance by the counterparties to the OTC contracts.
The Equinox Frontier Funds are not mutual funds and are not subject to regulation under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended.
Investors should carefully consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the Funds. This and other important information about the Funds are in the relevant Prospectuses which can be obtained by calling 1.877.837.0600 The prospectus should be read carefully before investing.

View Performance




The investment philosophy of H2O is based on the conviction that value diversification is the most stable and robustsource of alpha over time. All-out diversification not only across assets, but also by investment horizon and manager expertise, gives us the ability to make better decisions and to produce more consistent risk adjusted performance. To generate alpha, H2O AM follows a top-down qualitative investment process and monitors the risk associated to calibrate the highly diversified strategies. No single position in itself has any meaning outside this overall risk/return context. A view is fed by a set of factors from seven fund managers and established as a risk-on, risk-off or diversifying strategy at a given horizon. The qualitative views are then translated into quantitative forecasts taking into account past volatilities and correlations and using Black & Litterman methodology as the key instrument enabling the conversion of views into positions. H2O AM fund managers take directional, relative value and specific/thematic positions in fixed income, currency and equity markets (no credit, no commodity exposure). The exposures are first decided in respect of each asset class: G4 govies, USD and equity markets. Relative value strategies are then constructed independently from the directional positions: they are "exposure-neutral". Finally, specific or thematic calls may be implemented separately. All the above strategies are invested using preferably derivatives. The Funds Under Management corresponds to the assets of the strategy.

The Multi-Strategy Program (MSP) is an approximate 50/50 combination of the Spread Trading Program (STP) and the Long-Short Commodity Program (LSCP). STP seeks non-correlated alpha through the spread and relative value trading of exchange-listed futures and options that are primarily commodity contracts. Quantitative research and significant discretion are used in trade selection and execution. The LSCP is a short to medium-term systematic program with a discretionary overlay that trades outright positions on 13 exchange-listed commodity futures contracts. The program uses multiple trend models on both outright and calendar spread data and analyzes historical spread levels to generate daily trade signals. The MSP is designed to generate returns that have a low to negative correlation to most CTA and commodity programs.

Portfolio holdings are as of the date stated, are subject to change, and should not be considered investment advice. The portfolio holdings do not include investments of the Equinox Frontier Funds (the “Trust”) cash management pool and the related allocation to the Quest Fixed Income Tracker-based Hedge Program (“QFIT”). QFIT is designed to produce investment returns that have a positive correlation to medium-term interest rates in the United States.  Equinox Fund Management, LLC is allocating to QFIT in order to hedge its cash management investments in U.S. Treasuries.  Such allocation is intended to mitigate duration risk and preserve capital in the Trust’s cash management pool, rather than generate capital appreciation as with the Trust’s other investments in CTA trading programs. The Trust’s total allocation to QFIT was $135 million, as of 3/31/2016.  Such allocation is shared pro-rata by each Fund of the Trust.

Equinox Investment Philosophy and Process
At Equinox Funds, we believe that alternative and traditional investment portfolios built around rigorous diversification and dynamic risk management can add long-term value to an investment strategy. With this philosophy in mind, the Equinox portfolio management team employs the following six-step investment process:




 SCREEN
After determining a Fund or Program’s goals and objectives, the Portfolio Team screens the manager universe for suitable candidates.


 ANALYZE
During this stage, the Portfolio Team seeks to rigorously evaluate historical performance and portfolio attributes as they relate to performance, volatility and strategy discipline.


 SELECT
The next step involves performing exhaustive due diligence on organization, personnel, investment process and operations.


 CONSTRUCT
At this stage of the process the anticipated portfolio is stressed using simulation tools for optimal return, risk, correlation and drawdown metrics.


 MANAGE
Once the initial candidates are identified, the Portfolio Team continually rebuilds the universe of managers and retests the portfolio dynamics.


 REBALANCE
Continuous monitoring of existing managers’ trading and performance seeks to detect style drift or other potential issues and rebalancing occurs as necessary.


Throughout the process, our goal is to provide investors with high-quality alternative investment portfolios that — when added to an asset allocation strategy — can potentially reduce risk and enhance returns over time.

Glossary







Commodity Trading Advisors (CTAs) provide advice and services related to trading and investment strategies utilizing futures contracts and options on futures contracts on a wide variety of physical goods such as agricultural products, forest products, metals, and energy, plus derivative contracts on financial instruments such as indices, bonds, and currencies. Each CTA is characterized by its respective trading strategy and the markets it trades. CTAs are regulated by the United States federal government through registration with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and membership in the National Futures Association (NFA)†.
The CTA information presented on www.ctaperformance.com was compiled by Equinox Fund Management, LLC, based upon information provided by each respective manager of commodity futures and foreign currency trading programs tracked by Equinox Fund Management and its affiliates. The CTA performance information does not contain opinion or analysis of Equinox Fund Management or any of its affiliates, and the completeness and accuracy of performance information reported to Equinox Fund Management cannot in all cases be independently verified. Please note that the CTA performance may not be reflective of actual fund performance. For the most recent performance figures, please refer to each respective commodity trading advisors website or marketing literature.
Performance information illustrated on this site is "net" of all fees and charges, and includes interest income applicable to the accounts comprising each composite performance summary. Performance results of individual accounts may vary as a result of differing fees, account size, the timing of entry of orders, and other factors. The performance results are not indicative of the results that may be achieved in the future.

View Performance




The investment philosophy of H2O is based on the conviction that value diversification is the most stable and robustsource of alpha over time. All-out diversification not only across assets, but also by investment horizon and manager expertise, gives us the ability to make better decisions and to produce more consistent risk adjusted performance. To generate alpha, H2O AM follows a top-down qualitative investment process and monitors the risk associated to calibrate the highly diversified strategies. No single position in itself has any meaning outside this overall risk/return context. A view is fed by a set of factors from seven fund managers and established as a risk-on, risk-off or diversifying strategy at a given horizon. The qualitative views are then translated into quantitative forecasts taking into account past volatilities and correlations and using Black & Litterman methodology as the key instrument enabling the conversion of views into positions. H2O AM fund managers take directional, relative value and specific/thematic positions in fixed income, currency and equity markets (no credit, no commodity exposure). The exposures are first decided in respect of each asset class: G4 govies, USD and equity markets. Relative value strategies are then constructed independently from the directional positions: they are "exposure-neutral". Finally, specific or thematic calls may be implemented separately. All the above strategies are invested using preferably derivatives. The Funds Under Management corresponds to the assets of the strategy.

The Multi-Strategy Program (MSP) is an approximate 50/50 combination of the Spread Trading Program (STP) and the Long-Short Commodity Program (LSCP). STP seeks non-correlated alpha through the spread and relative value trading of exchange-listed futures and options that are primarily commodity contracts. Quantitative research and significant discretion are used in trade selection and execution. The LSCP is a short to medium-term systematic program with a discretionary overlay that trades outright positions on 13 exchange-listed commodity futures contracts. The program uses multiple trend models on both outright and calendar spread data and analyzes historical spread levels to generate daily trade signals. The MSP is designed to generate returns that have a low to negative correlation to most CTA and commodity programs.

QFIT is designed to produce investment returns that have a positive correlation to medium-term interest rates in the United States.  Equinox Fund Management, LLC is allocating to QFIT in order to hedge its cash management investments in U.S. Treasuries.  Such allocation is intended to mitigate duration risk and preserve capital in the Trust’s cash management pool, rather than generate capital appreciation as with the Trust’s other investments in CTA trading programs. The Trust’s total allocation to QFIT was $135 million, as of 3/31/2016.  Such allocation is shared pro-rata by each Fund of the Trust.

There is a substantial risk of loss in managed futures, and there can be no guarantee that any managed futures program or the Equinox Frontier Funds will meet their intended objective; accordingly, an investment in the Equinox Frontier Funds may not be suitable for everyone. The Funds are highly speculative and their success depends upon the ability of Equinox Fund Management, LLC to allocate assets to multiple strategies and commodity trading advisors (“CTAs”). The Funds also rely on each of the CTAs chosen in meeting the investment objectives. An investment in the Funds involve a high degree of risk due to substantial price volatility in domestic and foreign markets for financial instruments, currencies, energy, metals, and commodities and the uncertainty as to the ability of the CTAs to profit in the markets traded.
Futures, forward, and options trading are speculative, volatile, and highly leveraged; select markets and instruments may be subject to liquidity restrictions from time to time.
An investor could lose a substantial portion, or even all, of his or her investment.
An investor’s annual tax liability may exceed cash distributions.
There is no secondary markets for the units and the transfer of units is restricted. If you redeem all or portion of your class 1 units before the end of 12 months following your purchase, you will be charged a redemption fee of up to 2% of the purchase prices of the units being redeemed.
The Funds face the risk of non-performance by the counterparties to the OTC contracts.
The Equinox Frontier Funds are not mutual funds and are not subject to regulation under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended.
Investors should carefully consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the Funds. This and other important information about the Funds are in the relevant Prospectuses which can be obtained by calling 1.877.837.0600 The prospectus should be read carefully before investing.

Equinox Investment Philosophy and Process
At Equinox Funds, we believe that alternative and traditional investment portfolios built around rigorous diversification and dynamic risk management can add long-term value to an investment strategy. With this philosophy in mind, the Equinox portfolio management team employs the following six-step investment process:




 SCREEN
After determining a Fund or Program’s goals and objectives, the Portfolio Team screens the manager universe for suitable candidates.


 ANALYZE
During this stage, the Portfolio Team seeks to rigorously evaluate historical performance and portfolio attributes as they relate to performance, volatility and strategy discipline.


 SELECT
The next step involves performing exhaustive due diligence on organization, personnel, investment process and operations.


 CONSTRUCT
At this stage of the process the anticipated portfolio is stressed using simulation tools for optimal return, risk, correlation and drawdown metrics.


 MANAGE
Once the initial candidates are identified, the Portfolio Team continually rebuilds the universe of managers and retests the portfolio dynamics.


 REBALANCE
Continuous monitoring of existing managers’ trading and performance seeks to detect style drift or other potential issues and rebalancing occurs as necessary.


Throughout the process, our goal is to provide investors with high-quality alternative investment portfolios that — when added to an asset allocation strategy — can potentially reduce risk and enhance returns over time.

There are substantial risks and potential conflicts of interest associated with managed futures programs. The success of an investment in such a program is dependent upon the ability of a commodity trading advisor (“CTA”) to identify profitable investment opportunities and successfully trade. The identification of attractive trading opportunities is difficult, requires skill, and involves a significant degree of uncertainty. The high degree of leverage often obtainable in futures trading can work against you as well as for you, and can lead to large losses. Returns generated from a CTA’s trading, if any, may not adequately compensate you for the business and financial risks you assume. You can lose all or a substantial amount of your investment. Managed futures accounts may be subject to substantial charges for management and advisory fees. It may be necessary for accounts that are subject to these charges to make substantial trading profits in order to avoid depletion or exhaustion of their assets. CTAs may trade highly illiquid markets, or on foreign markets, and may not be able to close or offset positions immediately upon request. You may have market exposure even after the CTA has a request for closure or liquidation.
PAST PERFORMANCE IS NOT NECESSARILY INDICATIVE OF FUTURE RESULTS. THERE IS RISK OF LOSS. YOU CAN LOSE MONEY IN A MANAGED FUTURES PROGRAM.

Equinox Announces Consolidation Under the "Equinox Funds" Brand, Along With Launch of New Website and Alternative Investment Education Program




















December 09, 2013 09:00 ET

 | Source: Equinox Funds





PRINCETON, N.J., Dec. 9, 2013 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Equinox Financial Group, LLC ("Equinox"), a leading provider of alternative investments, is pleased to announce the consolidation of multiple brand names under one corporate brand mark, "Equinox Funds", along with the launch of a new website platform and alternative investment education program, effective December 9th, 2013. The new program reflects Equinox Funds' goal of "Building Better Alternatives" and providing exceptional customer service and sales support for investors.

	As part of the initiative, all of Equinox's business affiliates, including, Equinox Fund Management, LLC, Equinox Group Distributors, LLC, Equinox Financial Solutions, LLC and Equinox Institutional Asset Management, LP, will fall under the Equinox Funds brand name umbrella. Product names for certain mutual fund and commodity pool investments offered through Equinox Funds will also change, incorporating the Equinox brand as follows:

	-- MutualHedge Frontier Legends Fund will change to Equinox MutualHedge Futures Strategy Fund

	-- The Frontier Fund family name will change to Equinox Frontier Funds 

	-- The three open funds offered through Equinox Frontier Funds will also change as follows:


		Frontier Masters Series will change to Equinox Frontier Masters Fund


		Frontier Diversified Series will change to Equinox Frontier Diversified Fund


		Frontier Long/Short* Commodity Series will change to Equinox Frontier Long/Short Commodity Fund


	Seeking to provide investors with a positive online experience, the new program offers access to industry-leading alternative investment information and education through three new web sites. In addition to the main EquinoxFunds.com web site featuring product information and thought leadership, Equinox Funds will sponsor a separate CTAperformance.com web site showcasing in-depth information on managed futures trading strategies. An investment education portal for advisors and investors named OnAlternatives.com is also scheduled to launch in January 2014. 

	"Our goal with this exciting initiative is to lend coherence to the entire sales, marketing and communications process at Equinox Funds, and ultimately provide financial advisors, institutions and investors with best-in-class client service and alternative investment education," stated Robert J. Enck, President and Chief Executive Officer of Equinox Funds. "We are delighted with the outcome of the initiative thus far," continued Mr. Enck, "and we look forward to continuing to provide investors with the necessary tools and information they need to become better informed about Equinox Funds and the potential benefits of investing in alternative strategies." 

	Equinox Funds has been an innovator in alternative investment product development and distribution since its founding in 2003. In December 2009, Equinox launched the Equinox MutualHedge Futures Strategy Fund ("MutualHedge") (ticker: MHFAX), the first actively managed mutual fund with exposure to Commodity Trading Advisor programs. Equinox also sponsors the Equinox EquityHedge US Strategy Fund, the Equinox Alternative Strategy Platform, a menu of single commodity trading advisor programs offered in a mutual fund format, and Equinox Frontier Funds, a public managed futures family of funds with daily liquidity.

*Long/Short – a strategy that seeks to minimize exposure to the market in general, and profit from a change in the difference, or spread in price, between two assets.  

Investors should carefully consider the investment objectives, risks, charges, and expenses of the Funds. These and other important information about the Funds are contained in the applicable Prospectus, which can be obtained by calling 1-888-643-3431. The Prospectus should be read carefully before investing.

	Securities offered through Equinox Group Distributors, LLC, Member FINRA. 47 Hulfish Street, Suite 510, Princeton, NJ 08542 1-877-837-0600

	Equinox MutualHedge Futures Strategy Fund, Equinox EquityHedge Strategy Fund, and Equinox Alternative Strategy Platform are distributed by Northern Lights Distributors, LLC, Member FINRA.   

	Equinox Financial Group, LLC, Equinox Fund Management, LLC, Equinox Group Distributors, LLC, Equinox Financial Solutions, LLC and Equinox Institutional Asset Management, LP, are not affiliated with Northern Lights Distributors, LLC
