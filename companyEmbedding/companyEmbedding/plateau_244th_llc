	Sammamish is a moderately sized city in the Seattle-Bellevue metro area of western Washington with a population of about 46,000. It is a part of King County.

	Sammamish is part of the Puget Sound region, but its main draw is Lake Sammamish. Between the lake, several other smaller lakes, Cougar Mountain and Squak Mountain natural areas, nature is never far away in Sammamish. Neighboring cities include Redmond, Klahanie, Carnation, and Issaquah.

	King County is the largest county in Washington state with a population of over 1.9 million people. It is located in northwestern Washington on the eastern shore of the Puget Sound. Major cities within the county include Seattle (the county seat and largest city in the state), Renton, Bellevue, Kent, Federal Way, Redmond, and Vashon Island. King County is between the cities of Vancouver, British Columbia, to the north, and Portland, Oregon, to the south.

	Seattle is perhaps the best known city in King County and in the Pacific Northwest. It is the site of landmarks such as the Space Needle and the Pike Place Market and is home to Boeing Company aircraft manufacturers.

	Though there are many large cities in King County, the majority of its population lives in the suburbs and commutes to work; the average commute time is about 27 minutes here. Residents may choose to live in the central or eastern part of the county for a quieter lifestyle and the potential for bigger properties. Homes in King County are about the same average age as the rest of Washington.

	Sammamish is a moderately sized city in the Seattle-Bellevue metro area of western Washington with a population of about 46,000. It is a part of King County. The 20-35 minute average commute to Seattle attracts families and business people who prefer a more suburban environment; homes here are quite new compared to the rest of Washington and offer bigger lot sizes than some of its other suburban neighbors.

	Sammamish is part of the Puget Sound region, but its main draw is Lake Sammamish. Between the lake, several other smaller lakes, Cougar Mountain and Squak Mountain natural areas, nature is never far away in Sammamish. Neighboring cities include Redmond, Klahanie, Carnation, and Issaquah.

	King County is the largest county in Washington state with a population of over 1.9 million people. It is located in northwestern Washington on the eastern shore of the Puget Sound. Major cities within the county include Seattle (the county seat and largest city in the state), Renton, Bellevue, Kent, Federal Way, Redmond, and Vashon Island. King County is between the cities of Vancouver, British Columbia, to the north, and Portland, Oregon, to the south.

	Seattle is perhaps the best known city in King County and in the Pacific Northwest. It is the site of landmarks such as the Space Needle and the Pike Place Market and is home to Boeing Company aircraft manufacturers.

	Though there are many large cities in King County, the majority of its population lives in the suburbs and commutes to work; the average commute time is about 27 minutes here. Residents may choose to live in the central or eastern part of the county for a quieter lifestyle and the potential for bigger properties. Homes in King County are about the same average age as the rest of Washington.

	Sammamish is a moderately sized city in the Seattle-Bellevue metro area of western Washington with a population of about 46,000. It is a part of King County. The 20-35 minute average commute to Seattle attracts families and business people who prefer a more suburban environment; homes here are quite new compared to the rest of Washington and offer bigger lot sizes than some of its other suburban neighbors.

	Sammamish is part of the Puget Sound region, but its main draw is Lake Sammamish. Between the lake, several other smaller lakes, Cougar Mountain and Squak Mountain natural areas, nature is never far away in Sammamish. Neighboring cities include Redmond, Klahanie, Carnation, and Issaquah.

Kitchen & Dining Furniture


		The right table and seating are essential elements in creating a dining space that is stylish, welcoming, and functional. Of course the dining table is the largest and most central piece, so it can be helpful to choose this first, as it can set the tone for the rest of the room’s furnishings. Most dining tables are used on a daily basis, and they can play host to everything from formal dinners or family meal time to after-hours work or kid’s crafts. When selecting a table for your space, be sure to account for how you and your household will make use of it, and select materials and finishes that will give you the level of durability you need and create the look you want.
		

		The seating that complements a table is the next crucial component, and it can make the difference between a dining space that is welcoming, and one that is just uncomfortable. While most people think of dining chairs when they discuss seating to go with the table, dining benches are also a great option. A dining bench brings an air of casual charm, and the open arrangement of the bench can also add a lot of flexibility to a seating arrangement by not pre-determining how many seats it provides. That being said, dining chairs are the traditional option for meal time seating, and they come in an enormous variety of styles. From fabric and leather upholstery, or solid materials ranging from oak to acrylic, there are choices to accommodate every taste. 
		

		Once you have the essentials of a dining table and seating, most spaces could use a bit of extra storage. A buffet or sideboard are both classic additions that work well in almost any dining room or breakfast nook.  Either of these pieces can add a large amount of storage for dishes, linens, and other tableware. Alternately, if your storage needs are more geared towards food and drink, a bar cart or kitchen island cart can provide extra space with the added bonus of portability.

About Bedroom Furniture

Whether you’re looking to design a peaceful retreat, a vibrant and colorful space or something uniquely you, our bedroom furniture selection includes everything you need to create a bedroom that is both stylish and functional.
Of course, every bedroom style include a bed. Your bed is the most important addition to the bedroom, and it’s usually the largest furniture piece in the ensemble. As such, it helps determine the overall style of the space. Bed frames, headboards and footboards are configured in a wide variety of styles and designs ranging from sleek platform beds with modern upholstered headboards to traditional four-poster frames and even classic luxuries like canopy beds.
Once you’ve selected a bed, you can also select additional bedroom furniture and storage to make for a more functional living space. Dressers, nightstands, armoires and jewelry armoires all offer different options for organizing everything from clothing and accessories to extra bed linens. Dressers and nightstands also provide valuable surface space for lighting and displaying decor. Finally, bedroom vanities and floor mirrors add depth and light, and help make sure you can head out looking your best.
If you’re looking to add or switch out all of these pieces for a completely new look, a bedroom set is a great way to get everything at once. Most collections even allow you to build a custom set that include only the furniture pieces you need.

About Living Room Furniture


		The living room is a central space that brings family and friends together; it acts as a venue for everything from birthday parties and family game nights to entertaining and even quiet nights in, and you’ll find an endless array of furnishings available to create a perfect living room design.
		

		Most living room furnishings fall into one of two categories: seating and storage. Seating is a must in nearly all entertaining spaces, and seating options are as varied as the living areas they occupy, from individual sofas, loveseats, chaises and recliners, to gorgeous coordinated living room sets in just about any style you could want.
		

		When it comes to storage, media chests and TV stands offer two different solutions to taming the cords, consoles, cable boxes and movie collections that take over most living rooms. TV stands provide a pedestal that sets the TV at the ideal height for viewing, while media chests offer a space for the television that are more centered around storing movie, game and music collections.
		

		For general storage, bookcases and étagères both provide a large amount of usable shelf space for storing books, board games collections and throw blankets. The open shelves of an étagère are great way to display photos or keepsakes. Of course, not all storage options require shelves; coffee tables, side tables and ottomans all offer a flat space where you can rest a tray, set remotes or place lighting (in the case of end tables). Some tables and ottomans also offer internal storage with drawers or a lift-up lid, so no matter the size of your space, you can always fit a bit more functionality.

You can think of these as two different company structures with very different tax requirements. Whichever way you choose to go, you're going to look more legit than the other guys. So just take a minute to consider your short-and long-term business goals to figure out which structure is best for you.
Advantages and Disadvantages
A limited liability company is a type of business structure that offers personal liability protections and a few tax advantages to boot. The "LL" in LLC is what protects your personal assets in the event of a judgment against your company. Corporations offer limited liability as well, so we're going to focus on the structural and taxation differences in the chart below.



Advantages of an LLC
Advantages of a Corporation




 No limit on the number of owners
 May issue shares of stock to attract investors


 Profit and loss are passed through to the owners' individual tax returns
 Corporate income splitting may help lower overall tax liability


 No annual meeting or minute book requirements
 






Disadvantages of an LLC
Disadvantages of a Corporation




 Cannot engage in corporate income splitting to lower tax liability
 C corp tax structure requires double taxation of corporate profits (s corp's does not)


 Cannot issue stock
 Must hold annual meetings and record minutes


 
 S corporations have restrictions on the number of owners



LLC or Corporation: Which One Is Right for Me?
Business goals aren't one size fits all, and neither is incorporating. When deciding which kind of corporation fits your business strategy, consider some of the differences that each kind offers. And take a deeper dive with our comprehensive comparison chart.
Find out which corporation is right for your business with our business wizard!

Along with picking the right entity type for your business, it's important to consider which state to incorporate in.
For most small business owners, the choice is simple: they incorporate in the state where their company is physically located, known as 'home state incorporation.' However, there are good reasons to consider forming your corporation or LLC in certain other states, including tax advantages, streamlined judicial processes, and easier business filing requirements.
For example, many business owners choose to incorporate in Delaware, which is a favored business jurisdiction for the previously mentioned and other reasons.

Delaware is widely considered to be one of the nation's most business-friendly jurisdictions. There are a number of reasons to incorporate your small business in Delaware, including:

Well-established and flexible business laws
Low franchise tax on small businesses
No tax on capital stock or assets
No state sales tax
A special business court (Court of Chancery) that minimizes the time and cost of commercial litigation
No residency requirement for shareholders, directors, and officers of a corporation or members or managers of an LLC
