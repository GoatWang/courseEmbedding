3.0 out of 5 starsWhere was the editor?ByPaul Harmonon November 21, 2016Red HillBy David PennySet in 1492 in Moorish Spain, Red Hill features Englishman physician Thomas Berrington. As physician to the Sultan, Berrington is given the additional task of solving murders committed within the palace. How's that for ingredients for a great adventurous novel...harem beauties, dashing fighting men, court intrigue, and the sights and sounds of 15th century Spain. Add to the mix, violent murders of women in the Sultans's harem and an exotic puzzle to be solved by the brilliant surgeon-physician. Although he is billed as brilliant he des not prove it in trying to solve the mystery of the murders. Here the plot suffers. Berrington makes one wrong assumption after another and breaks in the case come by chance and have little to do with crafty sleuthing. The writing style is serving the story well but isn't very inventive. I was bothered with too many typos and grammar errors as well. Where was the editor? All this to say the the novel was interesting as to the setting but the plot was rather mundane. Berrington is an interesting character with a backstory only partially revealed and will surely be expanded in the next two novels in an advertised trilogy. With Red Hill's flaws, I will try the sequels.

L.on May 3, 2017Format: Kindle Edition|Verified PurchaseAs the headline says, I got this as a free read from BookBub. I particularly like historicly based fiction, e.g. Pillars of the Earth, etc. BookBub's free offerings are meant to entice the reader into purchasing additional titles from the author. This is a legitimate marketing tool, very much like getting a free sample at Costo. Generally I have found the BookBub offerings to be somewhat less than first rate, not bad but not great. This book was actually quite good and I will be purchasing sequels in the series.0Comment|Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuseCommentInsert product linkPaste the product's web address below:Product not found.

A wonderfully detailed look inside a harem in Moorish Spain & the ultimate power of the Sultan over every aspect of life. The clues slowly emerging to finally expose a killer kept me thinking & turning the pages.0Comment|

Description



Description
An original antique print of Yosemite Vally by Thomas Hill.  Hill was born in Birmingham England and moved with his family to Taunton, Massachusetts in 1844. Hill studied at the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts under Peter F. Rothermel. Hill began his painting career as a New England artist along with a group of others artists/friends that included Asher B Durand, George Inness Benjamin Champney, Albert Bierstadt and others. Hill moved to California in 1861 for health reasons and painted Yosemite for the first time in 1862. From 1868 to 1870 Hill resided in Boston and exhibited his monumental painting of the Yosemite Valley. The painting was exhibited in Philadelphia at the Centennial Exhibition and was considered one of the best on display. The painting sold for a princely sum of $5000. Louis Prang, a color printer in Boston was so impressed with this painting that he ordered a small painted copy which Hill himself produced from which the chromolithograph was then made. The print was so well received by the public that Hills work became famous afterward. Hill returned to Yosemite to live and paint until his death in 1908.
Louis Prang was the most successful American publisher of chromolithographs. Born in Germany, Prang learned to print in color from his father, who was a calico printer. He immigrated to the United States in 1850 for political reasons. After a short-lived partnership as a chromolithographic printmaker with Julius Mayer (Prang & Mayer), Prang set up his own firm of L. Prang & Co. in 1860. His initial success came from his many small prints collected by members of the public and kept in albums. By the 1860s, Prang stated to issue color-printed copies of famous paintings and launched his magazine, Prang’s Chromo: A Journal of Popular Art. Prang’s prints based on oils and watercolors were highly praised by the press and many influential persons, and these art prints became hugely successful. Eventually Prang issued about 800 chromolithographs of this sort, which he advertised as: “PRANG’S AMERICAN CHROMOS. ‘THE DEMOCRACY OF ART’ . . . Our Chromo Prints are absolute FACSIMILES of the originals, in color, drawing, and spirit” Prang used the paintings of many of America’s leading artists to produce his prints, including those by A.F. Tait, Eastman Johnson, Thomas Moran, F.S. Church, and Albert Bierstadt. This print after the Thomas Hill painting is a superior example of the quality that chromolithography could achieve.

IRVING — Josh Thomas’ career with the Cowboys started with a telephone conversation that turned into a comic routine.Thomas, from Cedar Hill High School, thought it may have been another prank call when his phone rang Saturday afternoon. This time, it was Cowboys scouting director Tom Ciskowski, who said owner-general manager Jerry Jones would be next on the line.“Josh, are you there?” Jones asked.“Are you there?” said Thomas, at a loss for words.Jones laughed, told Thomas the Cowboys had taken him in the fifth round of the NFL draft and said that the club expected big things from him as a cornerback and special teams performer. Thomas was dazed.“I was in disbelief that I was talking to Jerry Jones,” said Thomas, the first area high school player to be drafted by the Cowboys since DeSoto’s Patrick Crayton in 2004.“It was surreal.”Thomas took the call at the Dallas home of his grandmother, Eva Robinson. She was a powerful influence on her grandson, helping raise him and form his character. She taught him to keep reaching for what he wanted.The home, which had been Thomas’ refuge, had recently been restored after being ravaged by a fire. He took the call from Jones while in the room where he often sat and dreamed of what his draft day would be like.“She has always been behind me as a backbone,” Thomas said of his grandmother. “ I call her my angel on earth, because that what she is.”The call continued Thomas’ remarkable journey.At Cedar Hill, Thomas volunteered to play free safety because the team had a surplus of cornerbacks, including Nebraska-bound Anthony Blue. Thomas played well but did not attract the high-level recruiting attention that coach Joey McGuire thought he deserved.Then-Buffalo coach Turner Gill, of Fort Worth, convinced Thomas to head north. Thomas became a starting cornerback almost as soon as he arrived on campus and held the position for four years.Thomas covered like a corner and hit like a safety. He had only two interceptions in four seasons but forced five fumbles in his final three seasons. The Cowboys were impressed with his workouts at the scouting combine and what he showed on “Dallas Day,” when area candidates were road-tested.“We like his measurable, but you also like what he’s all about,” Cowboys coach Jason Garrett said. “He’s a physical corner. He tackles. A good combination of physical traits and also the right kind of guy.”The term “right kind of guy” was a common theme throughout the draft for the Cowboys. Garrett puts a high value on character, and the Cowboys sought that out. Four choices were team captains last season: North Carolina linebacker Bruce Carter, Missouri State offensive tackle David Arkin, East Carolina wide receiver Dwayne Harris and Georgia fullback Shaun Chapas.Thomas has been “the right kind of guy” dating to his time at Cedar Hill.“An outstanding person,” McGuire said. “He was always respectful, hard-working and very humble. This is a great day for Cedar Hill. It helps us, because it shows the kids what can happen if you do what is asked and work toward a goal.”Do that, and the phone will ring. It did for Josh Thomas.Josh ThomasPosition: CornerbackCollege: BuffaloHt, wt: 5-10, 196Age: 21Hometown: Cedar HillNotable: An aggressive defensive player, Thomas started 24 
games at Buffalo, accumulating 29 pass breakups in four years. As a senior he 
accumulated 58 tackles, two sacks and an interception. During the NFL Combine, 
he ran the 40-yard dash in 4.46. Before arriving at Buffalo, Thomas was a 
standout player on Cedar Hill’s 2006 Class 5A state champion.Quotable: “I just wanted to be drafted to the team that wanted 
me the most. And that was Dallas. I couldn’t be more grateful.” — Josh

As Seen on Donnie Azoff (Jonah Hill) in The Wolf of Wall Street


 Enabling Sidekick:  					Jordan Belfort (Leonardo DiCaprio) is a New York City based stockbroker. With $49 million at age 26, he has money to burn and lives the 90s dream—yachts and the requisite white ensembles, pinstriped power suits, and a wife who looks and dresses like a model. But when you have so much money that you’re literally using it as wastepaper basketballs, ordinary perks of the rich aren't enough. With the help of his sidekick Donnie Azoff (Jonah Hill), Jordan finds unique ways to spend it all, including debauched parties complete with flying midgets and well-dressed monkeys. Too bad the FBI is after him and coming to shut it all down. With proof of Jordan’s $75,000/month paystubs in hand, Donnie Azoff (Jonah Hill) leaves his job and questionable multi-colored chambray choices behind for Wall Street uniforms and proves a quick study. Not only does he help Jordan’s new company make millions, Donnie seamlessly transitions into a professional wardrobe, later pulling off a gray suit with glorious lavender suspenders. He even gets the casual luxury look down, yachting in stripes and sweaters draped oh-so causally around the shoulders. Scroll down to see more clothes, outfits and products identified from The Wolf of Wall Street.

Product Description
This historic Texas home has a monumental dignity. When that direct Texas sun burnishes the brick of Thistle Hill, the structure rises up most impressively from the plain. I chose my spot, set up my easel and painted to my heart's content.
