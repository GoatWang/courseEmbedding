Exhibit 99.1 
 
Energy Focus to Reschedule Q3 2016 Earnings Release and 
Conference Call; Reports Revenue within Guidance 
 
SOLON, Ohio, Nov. 3, 2016 -- Energy Focus, Inc. (NASDAQ:EFOI), a leader in LED lighting 
technologies, today announced that it will reschedule its 2016 third quarter earnings 
release and conference call from Thursday, November 3, 2016, to Monday, November 
14, 2016, which is the deadline for filing its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, in order to 
allow for more time in finalizing its quarterly financial results. 
The Company is reviewing a recent development with a limited number of commercial 
end-users of the Company’s Intellitube® product who have experienced a product 
failure rate of 0.57%, which is higher than the Company’s historical non-Intellitube® 
commercial product failure rate of 0.19%. Based on the Company’s initial investigation 
it appears that product failures, which are not related to any health or safety matters, 
occur when the product is installed in a certain manner or with certain ballasts. Once 
fully investigated, the product failures will be covered through either replacement or 
repair under the Company’s standard warranty provisions for defects in materials and 
workmanship for a period of ten years from the date of purchase. 
Since its introduction in April 2015, the aggregate amount of the Company’s 
Intellitube® product sold as of September 30, 2016 is approximately $2.5 million. The 
total amount of this product sold to the end-users experiencing the notably higher failure 
rate is less than $600,000. No such increased product failure rates have been reported to 
the Company with respect to its military Intellitube® product or any other commercial 
products. 
The Company has commenced an in-depth review of this ongoing matter and is working 
with the end-users on a resolution, however, due to the limited time that the Company 
has had to review the matter, it has not yet been able to fully determine the root cause or 
assess the extent of the failures. Accordingly, the Company will continue investigating 
the product failures and assessing any probable or any estimable impact on the amount 
of its accrued warranty reserve and its results of operations as of September 30, 2016 
prior to the filing of its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
As only limited information has been reviewed to date, it is possible that the number of 
incidents could increase. A significant failure rate or corresponding contingency could 
have a material adverse impact on the Company’s business, financial condition, and 
results of operations. 
The Company also reported that Net sales for the quarter are expected to be $8.3 million, 
consisting of $3.6 million in commercial sales, and $4.7 million in military sales, 
compared to $18.3 million in the prior year’s period, principally consisting of $3.3 
million in commercial and $14.9 million in military sales.

The 2016 third quarter financial results are expected to be released before the 
commencement of trading on Monday, November 14, 2016 and management will then 
host a conference call at 11:00 AM Eastern Time to discuss the results with the 
investment community. The Company also intends to file its Quarterly Report on Form 
10-Q on that date. 
Details for the conference call will be provided as soon as available. 
The call will additionally be broadcast live and archived for 90 days over the internet 
accessible in the Investors portion of the Company's corporate website, under “Events 
and Presentations” at http://investors.energyfocusinc.com/events.cfm. 
Forward-Looking Statements: 
 
Forward-looking statements in this release are made pursuant to the safe harbor 
provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Generally, these 
statements can be identified by the use of words such as “believes,” “estimates,” 
“anticipates,” “expects,” “seeks,” “projects,” “intends,” “plans,” “may,” “will,” “should,” 
“could,” “would” and similar expressions intended to identify forward-looking 
statements, although not all forward-looking statements contain these identifying 
words. These forward-looking statements include all matters that are not historical 
facts and include statements regarding our current expectations concerning, among 
other things, our results of operations, financial condition, development capabilities, 
product performance and failure rate and warranty obligations. By their nature, 
forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties because they relate to 
events and depend on circumstances that may or may not occur in the future. 
Although we base these forward-looking statements on assumptions that we believe 
are reasonable when made, we caution you that forward-looking statements are not 
guarantees of future performance and that our actual results of operations, financial 
condition and liquidity, and product developments may differ materially from 
statements made in or suggested by the forward-looking statements contained in 
this release. We believe that important factors that could cause our actual results to 
differ materially from forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to: our 
historical product warranty experience compared to actual experience over a longer 
period; additional failure reports received from customers; our ability to achieve 
satisfactory resolution of warranty claims; our ability to respond to new lighting 
technologies and market trends with safe, reliable, energy-efficient and effective 
products and to bring such products to market in a timely manner and at an 
appropriate price point; satisfactory and timely testing and completion of product 
certification requirements; our ability to protect our intellectual property rights and 
the impact of any type of legal claim or dispute; our ability to obtain critical 
components and finished products from third-party suppliers on acceptable terms 
with reliable functionality; and our ability to maintain effective internal controls and 
otherwise comply with our obligations as a public company. In light of the foregoing, 
we caution you not to place undue reliance on our forward-looking statements. Any 
forward-looking statement that we make in this release speaks only as of the date of 
such statement, and we undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking

	Energy Focus, Inc. Reports First Quarter 2017 Results




	 









	SOLON, Ohio, May 4, 2017 -- Energy Focus, Inc. (NASDAQ:EFOI), a leader in LED lighting technologies, today announced financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2017.









	First Quarter 2017 Financial Summary













	•






	Net sales for the first quarter of 2017 were $4.1 million, consisting of $3.1 million in commercial and $1.0 million in military maritime sales, compared to $8.4 million, consisting of $4.6 million in commercial and $3.8 million in military maritime sales in the first quarter of 2016.
















	•






	Gross profit was $0.6 million or 13.7% of net sales for the quarter compared to $3.1 million, or 37.3% of net sales for the first quarter of 2016.
















	•






	Recognized $0.7 million in restructuring costs, principally related to severance and related costs
















	•






	First quarter net loss was $4.5 million, or $(0.39) per diluted share, compared to a net loss of $2.0 million, or $(0.17) per diluted share in the prior year’s quarter.
















	•






	Reduced gross inventory values by $0.9 million from December 31, 2016.
















	•






	Ended the quarter with $15.0 million in cash and no debt on the balance sheet.












	First Quarter 2017 Corporate Highlights













	•






	Sales from commercial and military products introduced during the last six months accounted for approximately 24% of first quarter revenue.
















	•






	Achieved a quarter-over-quarter operating expense reduction of $1.5 million.
















	•






	Cash used in operations for the first quarter of 2017 of $1.6 million was the lowest operational cash consumption for the previous four consecutive quarters.
















	•






	Shipped the first contract award for military LED lighting fixtures for new U.S. Navy ship construction.
















	•






	Penetrated the military base installation market with first LED lighting retrofit project.












	As previously announced, the Company implemented a restructuring initiative during the first quarter of 2017 with a goal of reducing annual operating costs by an estimated $10 million from the 2016 levels. The Company’s workforce was reduced approximately 15% and the offices in New York, New York, Arlington, Virginia and Rochester, Minnesota were shut down. Accordingly, during the first quarter, the Company recognized $0.7 million in restructuring costs, principally related to severance and related costs. As of March 31, 2017, the Company had vacated the Rochester leased office location, but had not fully vacated the New York and Arlington leased office spaces. During the second quarter of 2017, the Company expects to shut down these additional office facilities and recognize additional restructuring costs of approximately $0.4 million.









	Dr. Ted Tewksbury, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President, commented, “As expected, we continued to experience headwinds due to excess inventory in the channel, lackluster Navy demand and delays in commercial projects, but we are beginning to see signs that our restructuring efforts and five-point strategy will return the Company to profitable growth. First, while our overall sales levels were below that of the previous quarter, if we exclude the fourth quarter 2016 order required under the distribution agreement with our distributor to the U.S. Navy, our sales levels remained flat during a quarter of significant organizational restructuring activities and executive management changes. Second, the inventory level of our U.S. Navy product in the sales channel decreased significantly during the quarter. Third, we expanded military sales into new ship construction and N

	avy base installations. Fourth, new product sales of $1.0 million, or 24% of net revenue, in the first quarter exceeded total new product sales for the full year 2016. Lastly, the implementation of our restructuring plan in late February resulted in a sequential quarter over quarter reduction of operating expenses of $1.5 million and the slowing of our cash burn rate to the lowest level in four quarters.”









	“The Company recently announced the hiring of Larry Fallon as our Senior Vice President of Sales and Marketing. In looking for a sales and marketing leader we were keenly focused on finding an individual with the skills and experience to help implement our five-point strategy that we announced in February. Larry’s experience and proven results in the LED lighting, controls and IoT industries made him the perfect candidate to drive these strategic efforts,” continued Dr. Tewksbury.









	A further breakdown of net sales is shown below (in thousands):

	Financial Results:









	Net sales of $4.1 million for the first quarter of 2017 decreased 51% compared to the first quarter of 2016 due to lower sales across all our product lines. Net sales of our commercial products decreased 33% compared to the first quarter of 2016. First quarter 2016 commercial sales of $4.6 million represented the highest level of quarterly commercial sales during 2016 and included approximately $1.6 million of lighting projects through our energy service company, or ESCO, partners that did not repeat at the same levels during the first quarter of 2017. Net sales of our military maritime products decreased 73%, primarily due to the expiration of our exclusive distribution agreement that contained quarterly order commitments with our distributor for the U.S. Navy.









	Gross profit was $0.6 million, or 14 percent of net sales, for the first quarter of 2017, compared to $3.1 million, or 37 percent of net sales for the first quarter of 2016. The decrease in gross profit was due primarily to lower sales, unfavorably impacting our manufacturing and overhead absorption, and product mix, as the military maritime products sold in the first quarter of 2016 generally had a higher standard gross margin. The decrease in gross profit as a percentage of sales is primarily the result of lower revenue scale and a smaller percentage contribution of military maritime products, which have historically had higher standard margins than commercial products. In addition, we increased excess inventory reserves as we continue to evaluate potential excess inventory levels.









	As a result of our restructuring efforts, we recorded restructuring expenses totaling approximately $0.7 million during the three months ended March 31, 2017, primarily comprised of approximately $0.6 million for severance and related benefits.









	Operating loss, loss from continuing operations and net loss was $4.5 million for the quarter, including a $0.7 million restructuring charge, or negative $0.39 per share, compared to operating loss, loss from continuing operations and net loss of $2.0 million, or $0.17 per share, in last year’s same period.

	At March 31, 2017, our cash and cash equivalents balance was $15.0 million, compared to $16.6 million at December 31, 2016. Net cash used in operating activities of $1.6 million in the first quarter of 2017 resulted from the net loss, adjusted for non-cash items, including: depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, and the adjustment to the excess inventory reserve; and changes in working capital.









	Dr. Tewksbury concluded, “While this will be a multi-quarter turnaround and we have significant work ahead of us, our restructuring initiatives and the implementation of our strategy during the first quarter confirm that we are making great strides in our efforts to return the Energy Focus to profitable growth.”









	2017 Business Outlook:









	Given the continuing quarterly volatility in military maritime sales and the timing uncertainty in commercial sales growth, it is challenging for us to provide quarterly revenue guidance at this time. Our focus is to control our operating costs, so that we can reach our goal of returning to profitability by the end of 2017. Once our revenue achieves a more predictable growth rate, we will provide further guidance.














	Earnings Conference Call:

Generally, these statements can be identified by the use of words such as “believes,” “estimates,” “anticipates,” “expects,” “seeks,” “projects,” “intends,” “plans,” “may,” “will,” “should,” “could,” “would” and similar expressions intended to identify forward-looking statements, although not all forward-looking statements contain these identifying words. These forward-looking statements include all matters that are not historical facts and include statements regarding our current expectations concerning, among other things, our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity, prospects, growth, strategies, capital expenditures and the industry in which we operate. By their nature, forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties because they relate to events and depend on circumstances that may or may not occur in the future. Although we base these forward-looking statements on assumptions that we believe are reasonable when made, we caution you that forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and that our actual results of operations, financial condition and liquidity, and industry developments may differ materially from statements made in or suggested by the forward-looking statements contained in this release. We believe that important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to: (i) our history of operating losses and our ability to effectively implement cost-cutting measures and generate sufficient cash from operations or receive sufficient financing, on acceptable terms, to continue our operations; (ii) our reliance on a limited number of customers, in particular our historical sales of products for the U.S. Navy, for a significant portion of our revenue, and our ability to maintain or grow such sales levels; (iii) the entrance of new competitors in our target markets; (iv) general economic conditions in the United

NO HR department, just an executive admin promoted to manager to save money (no background in HR). Product development team is straight out of China, no processes in place for QA (except for the few engineers left in Solon).

They also have tons of inventory on hand without much business which makes me question the accuracy of stock prices/Wall Street. Ask the Cleveland Browns how they have performed over the past 5 years with all of their turnover. Do not consider working here unless you absolutely need a new job.Advice to ManagementSell the company, dissolve your assets, and get outta the lighting industry.

I never thought our managers were that good but we had enough accounts to keep things going.ConsThe company is doing terribly and losing sales by the day. Employees are losing faith in the leadership. Recent positive reviews were pushed by our management. The truth is this is not a good company to work for and most employees who are honest doubt it will be around in 12-18 months. I hope I'm wrong because I used to like it here, but check out how the company has been doing, it doesn't don't lie.Advice to ManagementWe need smart inspirational managers not people who yell, curse and argue all the time. I don't have confidence in our leaders, they don't seem to know how to actually run a company. They recently added a couple new people, not sure how they are yet, hopefully good.Share on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on WhatsAppShare via EmailCopy LinkLink Copied!Flag as InappropriateFlag as InappropriateHelpful (12) Energy Focus Response seconds agoEdit • Delete Energy Focus 2016-09-23 08:23 PDT Showing 29 of 29 reviewsReset FiltersPrevious123NextReviews > Energy Focus RSS Feed</>EmbedCloseOutline of two peoples' headsWork in HR or Marketing?Grow your employer brandGet a free employer accountCloseOutline of two peoples' headsWork in HR or Marketing?Grow your employer brandGet a free employer accountCompanies to Explore Company BenefitsHealth InsuranceAdd BenefitsSee AllSee All Job Seekers Also ViewedFocus Energy ReviewsStarStarStarStarStar 29 ReviewsHanna Cylinders ReviewsStarStarStarStarStar 2 ReviewsThe J.

Commercial Intellitube



The Energy Focus Intellitube Series LED retrofit tube is our all-in-one level tube providing the industry’s best performance at the lowest total cost for maximum energy savings.

DLC listed (Available for 2′ and 4′ versions only)
UL listed
Replaces T8 and T12 tubes

Intellitube offers direct-wire (ballast not required) and direct-fit (compatible with ballasts) functions. In direct fit, it can replace an existing fluorescent lamp. In the event of a ballast failure, in direct wire mode, will continue to provide efficiency and eliminate replacement of the ballast.  
The Intellitube Series is available in:

Clear lens:

(24”) 2’, 8 watt tube at 130 LPW
(48”) 4’, 13 watt tube at 130 LPW
(48”) 4’, 15 watt tube at 130 LPW
48”) 4’, 18 watt tube at 130 LPW


Frosted lens*:

(36″) 3′, 11 watt tube at 110 LPW
(36″) 3′, 11 watt tube at 120 LPW
(24”) 2’, 8 watt tube at 120 LPW
(48”) 4’, 13 watt tube at 120 LPW
(48”) 4’, 15 watt tube at 120 LPW
48”) 4’, 18 watt tube at 120 LPW



*The Frosted lens option diffuses the light for a softer appearance.   
Our LED tubes provide the highest durability factor, with a rated lifetime of 50,000 hours (L70) which is over 5 years of continuous (24/7) use or 17 years at 8 hours a day before the output declines to 70% of initial lumens (lm).  The durability factor includes utilizing extruded aluminum for the body, polycarbonate lens, no filaments, and no mercury – this means a more rugged, warp-proof, non-glass, non-hazardous structure.  
For the lowest total cost of ownership with maximum energy savings, retrofit lighting fixtures with Energy Focus LED tubes.

A Leader in Tubular LED Lighting
enlighten and inspire

Mission:
To enlighten and inspire everyone we work with and every customer we serve
Vision:
To be the trusted leader in LED lighting retrofit
Energy Focus, Inc. is a leading provider of energy efficient LED lighting products, and a developer of energy efficient lighting technology. Our solutions provide energy savings, aesthetics, safety and maintenance cost benefits over conventional lighting. Our long-standing relationship with the U.S. Government includes numerous research and development projects for the DOE and DARPA, creating energy efficient LED lighting systems for the U.S. Navy fleet.  Customers include national, state and local U.S. government agencies as well as Fortune 500 companies, the U.S. Navy and many others.

Values A-T-E-F-O-I:
Accountability – Our success is only possible by delivering superior, consistent results from successful people—our team members. The true, intrinsic value of our company is not the stock price but the spiritual and financial confluence of individual and joint efforts from each of our team members. Therefore, we make sure every project is ultimately “owned” by an individual, and we measure our performances and hold ourselves accountable—with rewards and consequences—to whatever we undertake and what we are measured against.
Trust – We believe trust is what bind our teams together, what makes whatever we do much more productive and efficient, and what facilitates a fulfilling and joyful working environment. Trust is critical in unlocking our individual as well as organizational potential. Without trust, we cannot be comfortable engaging in confrontations and debates that make best ideas possible. Without trust, teamwork is impossible. Therefore, before going into the details of any collaborative work, we make sure that we work with trustworthy people—the right people.
Extraordinariness – With all our heart and soul, we strive to do everything, small or large, individually or with our teams, the best we can, and more—because we believe that there is always room to improve and to be better. In practicing continuous improvement, we are able to tap into our creative potential and achieve unprecedented heights that make the lives of our company, our teams and ourselves amazing and extraordinary.
Fun – We all know life is short! There is no substitute of time and happiness in life. If there is no fun working here in Energy Focus—which takes half or even more of our time when we are awake—there is no reason working here. As individuals we need to constantly ask ourselves if we are enjoying our time, realizing our life’s aspirations, and making positive impact on the lives of others—colleagues, customers, vendors, partners and investors—working here. As a company we are obligated to make our company a fun, worthwhile place for our team members to spend their invaluable time with.
Openness – We believe that sincere, straightforward suggestions and creative, bold ideas are both critical in driving our company towards excellence. Therefore we encourage open suggestions, idea exchanges, and viewpoint debates so the best possible ideas can be discovered, generated and adopted. In addition, we believe in over-communications. For everything we say and everything we write, we strive for clarity and simplicity. In other words, when in doubt, communicate.
Integrity – Say what we do and do what we say. Integrity is not only the inevitable human fabric of a sustainable and respectable organization but also the essential element for ourselves and our organization to be one-hundred-percent focused on reaching our wildly important goals (WIGs). With integrity, we are able to build long-term, mutual trust that optimizes our personal and work life. With integrity, we are able to consistently allocate our resources—time, capital, network, effort, creativity—to projects and tasks according to the hierarchy of priorities. With integrity, we are able to make decisions, big or small, that help us reach individual and organizational goals.
