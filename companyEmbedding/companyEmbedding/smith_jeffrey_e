Other tests might include an eye muscle coordination exam, a check of pupil response and peripheral vision, slit lamp microscope test to look at the anterior segment of the eye, and an intraocular pressure assessment.How much does a visit with an ophthalmologist cost?Most eye doctors will charge different amounts for their services, but a basic eye exam with an ophthalmologist can range from $50 to $300. Additional tests and treatment will add to the price.What are some ophthalmology subspecialties?Ophthalmology subspecialties include strabismus/pediatric ophthalmology, neuro-ophthalmology, retina/uveitis ophthalmology, cornea/anterior segment ophthalmology, ophthalmic plastic surgery, and reconstruction.What types of diseases or conditions can ophthalmologists diagnose?Ophthalmologists can diagnose macular degeneration, glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy, ocular albinism, vitreous traction, cataracts, astigmatism, myopia, retinoblastoma, and many more.What are the most popular ophthalmology procedures?The most popular ophthalmology procedures are cataract, laser eye treatment, and glaucoma surgeries.What types of surgeries do ophthalmologists perform?Ophthalmologists can perform cataract and basic glaucoma surgeries as well as those pertaining to retinal detachments, strabismus (crossed-eyes) in children, and corneal transplant, among others.What type of insurance is required for ophthalmology services or surgery?The type of coverage in your healthcare plan may or may not include ophthalmologic services and procedures. Be sure to check which type of eye care is included and what must be paid for out of pocket.What education is required for an ophthalmologist?To become an ophthalmologist, students must complete undergraduate coursework, complete medical school, and participate in a three-year residency program. Once these requirements have been fulfilled, ophthalmologists must sit for and pass the board examination to earn their license to practice.What is the difference between an ophthalmologist, optometrist, and optician?While all concentrate on the eye, an ophthalmologist is the only one of these three professions that is licensed to perform surgical procedures. Optometrists fit in between ophthalmologists and opticians as they are able to diagnose eye conditions and prescribe corrective lenses. Opticians, on the other hand, design and fit eyeglasses, frames, and contact lenses based on prescriptions from optometrists and ophthalmologists.What is ophthalmology?Ophthalmology is medical science concerned with the diagnosis and treatment of disorders, conditions, and diseases of the eye.See more Tips & AdviceInserra Anthony531 Washington St Ste 3, Watertown, NY 13601(315) 681-5499WebsiteDirectionsMore InfoMcClusky Law Firm LLC8 Main St, Adams, NY 13605(315) 232-4551Our Experience Gives You Peace of MindWebsiteYP AdDirectionsMore InfoDeFrancisco & Falgiatano Law Firm6739 Myers Road East, East Syracuse, NY 13057(315) 479-9000"Experienced Personal Injury Lawyers!

How the BuildZoom Score works

Before you Hire

Here are some rules, regulations, and laws governing general contractors
in Washington:













Does Smith, Jeffrey E carry a valid contracting license?



Any work that impacts the value of real estate in Washington, requires a licensed contractor.
Smith, Jeffrey E currently holds license SMITHJE885K1 (Electrical Trainee), which was Active when we last checked. 











How important is contractor licensing in Washington?



The Washington State Department of Labor & Industries requires licensees to maintain a bond and liability insurance for the protection of consumers.











Your liability risk when hiring Smith, Jeffrey E



Licensed contractors in Washington are required to maintain general liability coverage that includes a $50,000 property damage policy and $200,000 public liability policy; or $250,000 combined single limit policy.











Financial recourse when hiring Smith, Jeffrey E



Licensed general contractors in Washington are required to maintain a $12,000 bond and specialty contractors are required to maintain a $6,000 bond. This provides consumers with financial recourse in case they perform defective work or violate license regulations.











How is the BuildZoom score calculated?



The BuildZoom score is based on a number of factors including the contractor's license status, insurance status, verified work history, standing with local consumer interest groups, verified reviews from other BuildZoom users and self-reported feedback from the contractor.











Why you should hire through BuildZoom



When it comes to major construction work or even minor alterations to your home, hiring the wrong contractor could result in incomplete or defective work. You may even find yourself dealing with huge liability claims. BuildZoom does the homework for you and helps you hire the right contractor.











You should get several bids before hiring a contractor



The standard board recommendation is to get at least three written bids before hiring a contractor. Do not automatically accept the lowest bid - an abnormally low bid may indicate the contractor made a mistake and is not including the same work quoted by their competitors. We've made the bid collection process extremely simple (and free). Just click here to get started.

About Jeffrey E. Smith





 Jeff first began in real estate development rehabilitating single family homes. He began developing multi-family and senior aged resident apartments under the Farmers Home program. In 1986 his focus changed, with the Tax Reform Act, to participation in the Federal Low Income Housing Tax Credit Program. In 1990, Jeff was instrumental in crafting the legislation for the Missouri Low Income Housing Tax Credit and later, the Missouri Historic Rehabilitation Tax Credit Program. He has since become one of the most active developers for affordable housing for families and seniors in the state.
Founded in the early 1980’s, JES Holdings, LLC includes Bear Land Development Company, Fairway Construction Company, Fairway Management Company, Capital Health Management, Inc., and Affordable Equity Partners, Inc.

JES Companies have developed more than 150 multi-family and senior aged housing properties with investments in another 12,000 units.
JES Companies have more than 30 years of experience in the real estate and housing business and have been an affordable housing advocate; implementing supportive service coordination for seniors and families.
