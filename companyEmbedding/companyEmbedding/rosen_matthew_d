Welcome


Raising children with special needs is not easy and finding the right kind of help can often be a daunting task.  While obtaining an accurate diagnosis and receiving effective treatment are good indicators of therapeutic success, in the end, it's all about connection.


As a child psychologist with over 35 years of experience, my goal is to establish a positive therapeutic connection that is based on mutual trust, understanding, and respect.  This can only be accomplished when both children and parents feel heard and understood.  When such a connection is established, people can then be inspired to think and act in ways that will be both beneficial and transformative, making them more able to achieve their goals and lead a more fulfilling and meaningful life.
If you have a child who is struggling academically, socially, and/or emotionally and are feeling overwhelmed by their struggles, I can help.


If your child has been diagnosed with ADHD, placed on medication, and continuing to struggle, perhaps he or she has been misdiagnosed. If your child has been in therapy, but is not progressing, there may be something missing in the therapeutic connection or in the accuracy of the diagnosis.  
If you're looking for support and guidance in better understanding your child, knowing how to best deal with your child's issues, and being able to effectively advocate for your child, I would welcome the opportunity to help you achieve your goals.  

Please call or e-mail me to see how I might be of service to you and your child.

"YOU CAN’T ALWAYS GET WHAT YOU WANT (BUT YOU CAN MAKE IT EASIER TO GET WHAT YOU WANT)"
