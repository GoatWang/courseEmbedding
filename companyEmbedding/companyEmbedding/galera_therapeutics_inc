Galera Therapeutics Expands Series B to $57 Million | Business Wire
























































Galera Therapeutics Expands Series B to $57 Million




- Sofinnova Ventures joins existing lead investors NEA, Novartis 
      Venture Fund and Novo Ventures -






November 28, 2016 08:00 AM Eastern Standard Time



MALVERN, Pa.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Galera Therapeutics, Inc., a clinical-stage biotechnology company 
      developing transformational new treatments for cancer patients, 
      announced today it has received $15 million in funding from new investor 
      Sofinnova Ventures, bringing its Series B financing total to $57 
      million. Sofinnova joins existing investors New Enterprise Associates, 
      Novartis Venture Fund, Novo Ventures, Correlation Ventures, Enso 
      Ventures and Galera Angels.
    


      The proceeds from the financing will be used to prepare the Company’s 
      lead product candidate, GC4419, for Phase 3 registration studies. GC4419 
      is currently in a randomized, placebo-controlled Phase 2b clinical trial 
      to evaluate its effects on the incidence, duration and intensity of 
      severe oral mucositis in head and neck cancer patients undergoing 
      chemo-radiation therapy. Additionally, the funds will be used to further 
      develop the Company’s pipeline of selective dismutase mimetics.
    

      “This investment by Sofinnova is a further endorsement of Galera’s team, 
      technology and clinical data generated to date, and of the promise of 
      our dismutase mimetics to transform cancer treatment,” said J. Mel 
      Sorensen, MD, President and CEO of Galera. “We look forward to expanding 
      our development programs and demonstrating the utility of our technology 
      in treating patients with cancer.”
    

      In connection with this financing, Mike Powell, PhD, General Partner at 
      Sofinnova, will join the Galera Board of Directors. “Sofinnova Ventures 
      has been intrigued for some time in Galera’s scientific approach and 
      thoughtful clinical development program,” said Dr. Powell. “I am 
      personally excited to support Galera and work with Mel Sorensen and his 
      team again.”
    

      “We are very pleased to welcome Mike to our Board of Directors,” 
      commented Dr. Sorensen. “His experience and long history of success in 
      biotech is well known and we look forward to his advice and input on our 
      technology and development programs.”
    

About Oral Mucositis (OM)


      Oral mucositis is a common, debilitating side effect of radiation 
      treatment in head and neck cancer (HNC) patients. Severe OM, defined by 
      the World Health Organization as Grade 3 or 4 OM, occurs in 60 to 80 
      percent of HNC patients receiving radiation therapy. Importantly, severe 
      OM may result in interruptions in radiation treatment, which can 
      compromise the otherwise good prognosis for tumor control in many of 
      these patients. In addition, patients with severe OM suffer significant 
      pain, may develop serious infections, and may be unable to eat solid 
      food or even drink liquids. Further, the costs of managing these side 
      effects are substantial, particularly when hospitalization and/or 
      surgical placement of PEG tubes to maintain nutrition and hydration are 
      required. There is currently no drug approved to prevent or treat severe 
      OM in head and neck cancer patients.
    

About Galera Therapeutics, Inc.


      Galera Therapeutics, Inc. is a clinical-stage biotechnology company 
      headquartered in Malvern, Pennsylvania, focused on the development of 
      breakthrough drugs targeting oxygen metabolic pathways. The Company's 
      lead compounds are highly selective small molecule dismutase mimetics 
      that closely mimic the activity of the human superoxide dismutase 
      enzymes. While the biology of the superoxide dismutase family suggests a 
      broad range of potential applications, Galera is initially focused on 
      developing products for the prevention of radiation-induced toxicity,

Galera Therapeutics, Inc. Completes Enrollment in Phase 2B Clinical Trial with Lead Compound GC4419 for Treatment of Oral Mucositis
Jun 15 17
Galera Therapeutics, Inc. announced that it has completed enrollment in its phase 2b clinical trial evaluating the efficacy, safety and tolerability of GC4419 as a treatment for reducing the incidence and duration of oral mucositis (OM) in head and neck cancer patients receiving chemoradiation therapy. GC4419 is a novel dismutase mimetic designed to prevent the damaging effects of radiation in normal tissue by rapidly converting superoxide to hydrogen peroxide. The phase 2b clinical trial is a double blind, randomized, controlled trial of 223 head and neck cancer patients treated with either 30mg or 90mg of GC4419 or placebo infusion on the days they receive their radiation treatment. The primary outcome measure is the duration of severe OM (defined as World Health Organization Grade 3 or 4) experienced by patients receiving 7 weeks of radiation therapy plus cisplatin. Secondary endpoints include incidence of severe OM.

PRESS RELEASE
MALVERN, Pa.–(BUSINESS WIRE)–Galera Therapeutics, Inc., a clinical-stage biotech developing new treatments for cancer patients, announced today it has received an additional $5 million in funding from Enso Ventures to bring its Series B financing total to $42 million. Enso Ventures joins existing investors New Enterprise Associates, Novartis Venture Fund, Novo Ventures, Correlation Ventures and Galera Angels.
The investment capital will be used to advance the Company’s lead candidate GC4419 in a Phase 2b double-blind, randomized clinical trial that is currently enrolling head and neck cancer patients receiving chemoradiation therapy to prevent against oral mucositis (OM). The proceeds will also support continued development of Galera’s pipeline of selective dismutase mimetics to modulate oxygen metabolic pathways.
“We are delighted to have Enso Ventures join us,” said J. Mel Sorensen, MD, President and CEO of Galera. “As we recently announced, our product lead GC4419, which is in randomized Phase 2b clinical development, was granted Fast Track designation for the prevention of radiation-related oral mucositis in patients with head and neck cancer. With Enso’s support, we will further expand the development of our dismutase mimetic portfolio.” 





“Galera’s clinical data with GC4419 in OM and the unmet need for these patients, combined with the strong management and investors really drove our interest,” said Sergei Petukhov, PhD, Partner at Enso Ventures. “We are excited to join our fellow investors in advancing this important product, and Galera’s broader efforts.”
