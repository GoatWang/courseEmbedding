(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  GENERAL  This Management's Discussion and Analysis or Plan of Operation contains forward-looking statements that involve future events, our future performance and our expected future operations and actions. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by the use of words such as "may", "will", "should", "anticipate", "believe", "expect", "plan", "future", "intend", "could", "estimate", "predict", "hope", "potential", "continue", or the negative of these terms or other similar expressions. These forward-looking statements are only our predictions and involve numerous assumptions, risks and uncertainties. Our actual results or actions may differ materially from these forward-looking statements for many reasons, including, but not limited to, the matters discussed in this report under the caption "Risk Factors". We urge you not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this prospectus. We undertake no obligation to publicly update any forward looking-statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.  The following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and the related notes included in this report.  The following table provides selected financial data about us for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2016 and 2015. For detailed financial information, see the audited Financial Statements included in this report.   Year End June 30 Year End June 30 2016 2015 Balance Sheet Data: Cash $ 8,977 33,162 Total assets $ 25,699 53,960 Total liabilities $ 5,000 330  Retained earnings (accumulated deficit) $ (32,751) 180 Operating Data: Revenue $ 30,875 43,080 Cost of revenue $ 12,000 400 Operating expenses $ 51,806 55,692 Income tax expense (benefit) $ - (1,952) Net income (loss) $ (32,931) (11,060)  Green Meadow Products, Inc. ("the Company", "GMP", "we", "us" or "our") was incorporated under the laws of the State of Wyoming on June 22, 2012.  The Company initially acquired a product for trucking fleets which it sold at a loss in order to focus on the pet product business. The Company now operates in the pet natural health supplement and related fields ; with a focus on natural pet Green Meadow PR formulas and pet pain preventative products. We believe we will be able to successfully compete in today's natural supplement and related fields industry by controlling production costs and by limiting our distribution expenses using, primarily, online marketing tools to promote our products.  Significant Accounting Policies and Estimates  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations discusses the Company's consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experiences and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.  Revenue Recognition  The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification No. 605, "Revenue Recognition" ("ASC-605"), ASC-605 requires that four basic criteria must be met before revenue can be recognized: (1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; (2) delivery has occurred; (3) the selling price is fixed and determinable; and (4) collectability is reasonably assured. Determination of criteria (3) and (4) are based on management's judgments regarding the fixed nature of the selling prices of the products delivered and the collectability of those amounts. Provisions for discounts and rebates to customers, estimated returns and allowances, and other adjustments are provided for in the same period the related sales are recorded. The Company will defer any revenue for which the product has not been delivered or is subject to refund until such time that the Company and the customer jointly determine that the product has been delivered or no refund will be required.  The Company's revenues have been generated primarily through sublicense and distribution agreements related to our Paw Pal product and our pain relief products. The terms of these agreements generally consist solely of upfront, nonrefundable payments for licensing and distribution rights. Revenues from non-refundable licensing and distribution fees are recognized upon receipt of the payment if the license has stand-alone value and we do not have ongoing involvement or obligations.  For the year ended June 30, 2015 and June 30, 2016, all license payments met the above criteria or in the case of one contract, the only continuing involvement was to sell our products to the distributor at pricing that is consistent with market transactions, thereby allowing for the recognition of revenue for the licensing and distribution arrangements upon receipt.  When non-refundable license fees do not meet this criteria, the license revenues are recognized over the expected period of performance. We periodically review for any expected period of substantial involvement under the agreements that provide for non-refundable up-front payments and license fees. If ever applicable, we will adjust the amortization periods when appropriate to reflect changes in assumptions relating to the duration of our expected involvement.  On October 20, 2014, we entered into an agreement with EWH whereby it was agreed that, in addition to the $15,000 paid by EWH for the non-exclusive sub licensing rights to manufacture and sell our Green Meadow PR formula, we would also be paid a further $15,000 by EWH to identify a manufacturer for the Green Meadow PR formula and to initiate the manufacturing process. Under this arrangement EWH will have the right to purchase the product from us at the price we receive the product from the as yet to be appointed manufacturer, including packaging, but not labeling or shipping, plus a markup of 15%.  On May 25, 2015, we were notified by Eastwinds Holding Corp. that they had selected a manufacturer with our assistance per our contract with EWH to manufacture their product. Eastwinds Holding Corp. further confirmed that all our obligations under contract with them had been fulfilled, and consequently we reclassified the deferred revenue to recognized revenue.  Depending on the results of the manufacturing process for Eastwinds Holding we may or may not use the same manufacturer, As of June 30, 2015 we have not yet made that determination.  Use of Estimates  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statement and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from the estimates.  Results of Operations  For The Year Ended June 30, 2015 Compared To The Year Ended June 30, 2016.  Revenue  For the year ended June 30, 2015, we recognized revenues of $43,080 compared with $30,875 of revenue for the year ended June 30, 2016. During the year ended June 30, 2015 we recognized $3,080 in sales of Petaprin, the pain relief product for dogs, and $40,000 from the sale of sub license agreements of our Green Meadow PR formula which included $30,000 in sales of sub licensing rights to Eastwinds Holding Corp. and $10,000 of sublicensing rights to Wholesale 4 You, Inc., compared to year ended June 30, 2016 $9,875 in sales of Petaprin, the pain relief product for dogs and $15,000 from the sale of certain of our licensing and distribution rights for our Green Meadow PR formula for dogs. This included $10,000 in sales of sub licensing rights to Mountain High Products, Inc., $5,000 in sales of sub licensing rights to Wholesale 4 You, Inc. and a commercial video consulting service of $6,000 from Collective Media.  Cost of Sales  For the year ended June 30, 2015, we recognized cost of goods of $400 relating to the Petaprin product which we sold for $3,080 in the period (as we were able to source a cheaper vendor for the product who was discontinuing the product line); compared to June 30, 2016 where we recognized cost of goods sold of $7,000 relating to the dog treats which we sold for $9,875 in the period and the assistance in video production for $5,000. The increase in cost of goods was attributable to the cost of manufacturing of the dog treats and the video which was produced during the year.  Gross Profit  For the year ended June 30, 2015, we recognized a gross profit of $42,680 compared with a gross profit of $18,875 for the year ended June 30, 2016, a decrease of $23,805. The decrease in gross profits is due to a decrease in sales of licensing agreements for the year end June 30, 2016 and an increase in costs.  Operating Expenses  For the year ended June 30, 2015, we incurred total operating expenses of $55,692 before tax compared to the year ended June 30, 2016 we incurred total operating expenses of $51,806 before tax, a decrease of $3,886. During the twelve months ended June 30, 2015, we incurred professional fees of $35,750 which were attributable to expenses relating to our SEC filings and accounting costs, amortization of $3,413, remuneration of $6,000, which was paid to our president, Stanley Windhorn, marketing expenses of $10,000; and general and administrative costs of $529. By comparison, during the year end June 30, 2016, our operating expenses comprised marketing expense of $6,000 for promotional costs associated with sales of our Green Meadow PR formula, licensing rights and Petaprin product, amortization of $4,076 and professional fees of $29,825, and consulting fees of $11,000 and General and administrative expense of $905.  Income Tax  During the year ended June 30, 2015, we recognized a tax credit of $1,952 relating to the tax losses incurred in the year compared to no tax credit during the year ended June 30, 2016.  Net Income (Loss)  During the year ended June 30, 2015, we incurred a net loss of $11,060 compared to a net loss of $32,931 during the year ended June 30, 2016 due to the factors discussed above.  Liquidity and Capital Resources  For Year Ended June 30, 2015 Compared To Year Ended June 30, 2016.  As of June 30, 2015, the Company had cash on hand of $33,162, total assets of $53,960, total liabilities of $330 and stockholders' equity of $53,630 compared to June 30, 2016, when the Company had cash on hand of $8,977, total assets of $25,699, total liabilities of $5,000 and stockholders' equity of $20,699.  The change in shareholders' equity at the year ended June 30, 2016 was largely attributable to operating losses incurred in the period.  Operating Activities  During the year ended June 30, 2015, we used $(9,301) cash in operating activities compared to $(24,185) cash used in operating activities during the year ended June 30, 2016. During the year ended June 30, 2015, we incurred a loss of $11,060, of which $3,413 related to noncash amortization, increased our balance of accounts payable by $298 and reduced the balance of income tax payable by $1,952. By comparison during the year ended June 30, 2016 we incurred a loss of $32,931 of which $4,076 related to noncash amortization expense, decreased our income tax payable by $32 and increased our balance of accounts payable by $4,702.  Investing Activities  For the year ended June 30, 2015 we invested $5,000 towards the continued development of our website and the purchase of intellectual property consisting of a formula for stress relief for dogs for $250.  Financing Activities  During the year ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, we neither generated nor used any funds in financing activities.  Our auditor's report states the following with regard to our ability to continue as a going concern, "has yet to establish a reliable, consistent and proven source of revenue to meet its operating costs on an ongoing basis and currently does not have sufficient available funding to fully implement its business plan. These factors raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern".  The Company believes it may have sufficient cash resources available to fund its primary operation for the next twelve (12) months but does not have the funding to fully implement its business plan. The Company has no agreements in place with its shareholders, officer and director or with any third parties to fund operations. The Company has not negotiated nor has available to it any other third party sources of liquidity.  The Company has no, current, off balance sheet arrangements and does not anticipate entering into any off balance sheet arrangements that are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition.  Related parties  We entered into an agreement on January 15, 2015 with our President, Stanley Windhorn, for a salary to be paid in the amount of $2,000 per month. For the three months ended March 31, 2015, $6,000 was paid to Mr. Windhorn per the agreement. Subsequently we determined that the revenues generated by the Company were not sufficient to support operations and a salary. We entered into a new employment agreement on April 1, 2015 which supersedes any past agreements whereby Stan Windhorn under the new agreement will be awarded compensation at the discretion of the Company's board. The Company has not incurred any salary under this new agreement since April 1, 2015 through the date of the issuance of this From 10K.  Plan of Operation  Product Development  Our future plan is to research the incorporation of our Green Meadow PR formula and our stress relief formula for dogs into a bite size bar which would have a flavor appealing to dogs. The bar will be like a "treat" for dogs. We are also researching the incorporation of a flavor into the pain relief tablets and stress relief tablets that dogs would find appealing to eat. We have found that our current pain relief product is typically broken up into a dog's food as dogs do not generally like the taste of the tablet without food. Thus the ongoing research into finding an optimum way in which a flavor could be incorporated into a bar and tablet appealing to dogs.  Cost for research and development of the Green Meadow PR formula and stress relief formula into bars or flavored tablets have not yet been determined. We believe that we will have to raise additional capital either through debt or equity financing in order to accomplish our goals. As of June 30, 2016 we have not yet discussed financing with any source for either debt or equity financing.  We are also considering the acquisition or the possibility of a joint venture with a Company with other "green" (green meaning environmentally friendly) products both within the pet industry and outside of the pet industry. As we have limited capital any acquisitions would possibly be done through the use of our common stock or possibly through a preferred class of stock (which has of this date not been approved or created by the board of Directors). At the year ended June 30, 2016 we have not entered into any negotiations or letter of intents with and targeted acquisitions or joint venture prospects.  Marketing and Sales efforts:  Our marketing efforts will primarily be related to seeking optimum methods for selling our bars and tablets once the flavors are optimized for the bars.  We plan on optimizing Search Engine Optimization ("SEO") work and internet marketing, and subsequently believe sales will be initially supported through our website. We also plan on engaging a call center for developing interest in our products by pet stores and veterinarians. We have not yet begun either stage of marketing. We believe that once our bars are finalized for the Green Meadow PR formula and stress relief formula and\or our flavored tablets are finalized we will be in a position to launch our marketing campaign. We also believe that we will need to initially seek equity or debt financing to accomplish our marketing goals. We anticipate initiating test sales of our bars in the quarter ending December 31, 2016.  Successful implementation of our business strategy depends on factors specific to the further development of our products, regulations regarding equities trading, additional financing through equity or debt sources and numerous other factors that may be beyond our control. Adverse changes in the following factors could undermine our business strategy and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations and cash flow:  -the competitive environment in the pet sector that may force us to reduce prices below the optimal desired pricing level or increase promotional spending;  -the ability to anticipate changes in consumer preferences and to meet customers' needs for trading products in a timely cost effective manner; and  -the ability to establish, maintain and eventually grow market share in a competitive environment.

The selling stockholders are selling shares of common stock covered by this
prospectus for their own account. We will not receive any of the proceeds from
the resale of these shares. We have agreed to bear the expenses relating to the
registration of the shares for the selling security holders.


The pet medications market is competitive and highly fragmented. Our competitors
consist of veterinarians, and online and traditional retailers. We believe that
the following are the principal competitive factors in our market:

. Product selection and availability, including the availability of prescription
  and non-prescription medications;                                             

. Brand recognition;

. Reliability and speed of delivery;

. Personalized service and convenience;

. Price; and

. Quality of website content.

We will compete with veterinarians, pet retailers such as Petsmart and Petco as
well as many online retailers of pet products for the sale of our natural pain
relief products who sell prescription and non-prescription pet medications and
other health products. 

We intend to market our products in the United States. None of the licensing
rights previously sold to other companies prevent us from selling the pain
relief formula under our own Green Meadow Products brand within the United
States, while at the same time preventing those companies that we did market the
product to from competing against us in the United States with the exception of
EastWinds Holding Corporation and Sandstone Enterprises, which acquired the
licensing rights to distribute the product in North Carolina and Virginia
(however we retain the right to sell the product under our label in those
states).

We sold the licensing rights to EastWinds Holding Corporation (EWH) for the
Untied States with the stipulation that EWH would private label the product and
that we would have the right to purchase the product from EWH if we so chose at
EWH's cost plus 10% (of the price EWH receives the product from the
manufacturer, including packaging, but not labeling or shipping). Under the
terms of the agreement, should we purchase the product from EWH, we would
private label the product. Further, if we should establish a manufacturer and
both parties are in agreement, EWH shall have the right to purchase the product
from us at a price of cost plus 15% (of the price GM receives the product from
the manufacturer, including packaging, but not labeling or shipping).

Selling the rights to EWH could affect our ability to successfully market the
product even though both EWH and GM would be selling the product under their own
label. Regardless, EWH would be a direct competitor for the United States Market
which could impact our ability to successfully market the product under our
label.

There are similar products to ours which are available from numerous other
sources, including other distributors and manufacturers. Consolidation in the
animal health products industry could result in existing competitors increasing
their market share, which could give them greater pricing power, decrease our
revenues and profitability, and increase the competition for customers. We
purchase our current pain relief product, PetaPrin,, which is private labeled
for us, from Vitanique who is a also a direct competitor as they sell the same
product under their name. 

Many pet owners may prefer the convenience of purchasing their pet medications
or other health products at the time of a veterinarian visit. In order to
effectively compete with veterinarians, we must continue to educate pet owners
about the potential benefits of a natural pain relief product, convenience, and
savings offered by our Company.

According to the American Pet Products Manufacturers Association, pet spending
in the United States increased 4.7% to $53.3 billion in 2012. Pet supplies and
medications represented $12.6 billion, or 24% of the total spending on pets in
the United States. The pet medication market that we participate in is estimated
to be approximately $4.0 billion, with veterinarians having the majority of the
market share. The dog and cat population is approximately 165 million, with
approximately 62% of all households having a pet.

We believe that the following are the main competitive strengths that will
differentiate our products from the competition:

. All natural product;

. with our formula, a chewable tablet that pets will potentially eat as they    
  would a treat.;                                                               

. unique "niche" products inclusive of our pain relief formula as well as out   
  Paw Pal.                                                                      

There are similar products to ours available from numerous other sources,
including other distributors and manufacturers. We have not done a market study
to determine all of the product lines which are similar to ours. We will compete
with veterinarians, large pet retailers such as Petsmart and Petco as well as
many online retailers of pet products for the sale of our natural pain relief
products who sell prescription and non-prescription pet medications and other
health products. 

While our pain relief formula offers a formula comprised of the ingredients,
in a specific formulation, there are many other companies that offer products 
with some or all of the same ingredients in different formulations. We do not 
know the exact formulation of our competitors. As such there may be competitors
that offer the exact formulation or that offer a product with similar 
ingredients in a different formulation.

The Company does not intend to directly compete against the larger pet retailers
and manufacturers, and it will not attempt to finance any projects beyond the
limited scope of its business plans and on emerging distribution opportunities.
Regardless it will still have competition from a wide range of even smaller
online distributors of pet products as well as the veterinarians and pet stores,
all more established and, in most instances, better capitalized than the
Company.


Company Description
Green Meadow Products, Inc. was incorporated in the state of Wyoming on June 22,
2012. We were formed to develop businesses, assets and opportunities, some
acquired and contributed from third parties and our founding shareholders, in
the natural health supplement and related fields; with a focus on


 natural pet
pain relief formulas and pet pain preventative products. The Company initially
acquired a product for trucking fleets which it subsequently sold at a loss in
order to focus on the pet product business. The Company believes it will be able
to successfully compete in today's natural supplement and related fields
industry by controlling production costs and by limiting its distribution
expenses using, primarily, online marketing tools to promote its products and to
further develop its digital strategies.

NOTES TO
THE CONDENSED UNAUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AS OF SEPTEMBER 30,
2016 AND JUNE 30, 2016 AND

FOR THE
THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2016 AND 2015

 


Note 1
– NATURE OF OPERATIONS

 

Green
Meadow Products, Inc. ("the Company", "GMP", "we", "us" or "our")
was incorporated under the laws of the State of Wyoming on June 22,
2012.

 

The
Company initially acquired a product for trucking fleets on
December 20, 2012. Subsequently on April 18, 2013, we made the
decision to take the business in a different direction and sold the
product for the trucking fleets at a loss. The Company's current
focus is on the sales of licensing rights to our Green Meadow PR
formula and the manufacturing and sales of our Green Meadow PR
formula as well as the manufacturing and sales of our PawPal
product and our recently acquired stress relief formula.

 

Note 2 -
SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

 

A summary
of the significant accounting policies applied in the preparation
of the accompanying financial statements follows.

 

BASIS OF
PRESENTATION

 

The
financial statements of the Company have been prepared in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the
United States of America for interim financial information and the
instructions to Form 10-Q and Rule 10-01 of Regulation S-X. They do
not include all information and footnotes necessary for a fair
presentation of financial position, results of operations and cash
flows in conformity with U.S. GAAP for complete financial
statements. Certain information and note disclosures normally
included in audited financial statements prepared in accordance
with U.S. GAAP have been condensed or omitted pursuant to those
rules and regulations, although the Company believes that the
disclosures made are adequate to make the information not
misleading.

 

In the
opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal
recurring adjustments and accruals) considered necessary for a fair
presentation of the results of operations for the period presented
have been included in the interim period. The operating results for
the three-month period ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily
indicative of the results to be expected for the entire year ending
June 30, 2016 or for any future period.

 

These
unaudited condensed financial statements and notes should be read
in conjunction with the financial statements and related notes
contained in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year
ended June30, 2016.

 

ESTIMATES

 

The
preparation of the financial statement in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of
assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and
liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the
reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the period. Actual
results could differ from those estimates.

CUSTOMER
AND PURCHASE CONCENTRATION

 

During the
quarter ended September 30, 2016 we had $7,100 in sales to
Sandstone Enterprises for a sub license agreement for a dog treat
formula which equates to 100% of sales for the quarter. During the
quarter ended September 30, 2015 we had $5,000 in sales to one
customer for licensing rights which equates to 60% of sales for the
quarter, and swap meet sales for $3,360 which equates to 40% of
sales for the quarter.

 

NET INCOME
(LOSS) PER SHARE OF COMMON STOCK

 

The
Company computes net income (loss) per share in accordance with ASC
105, "Earnings per Share" which requires presentation of both basic
and diluted earnings per share on the face of the statement of
operations. Basic income (loss) per share is computed by dividing
net income (loss) available to common shareholders by the weighted
average number of outstanding common shares during the period.
Diluted loss per share gives effect to all dilutive potential
common shares outstanding during the period.  Dilutive
loss per share excludes all potential common shares if their effect
is anti-dilutive.

 

The
Company has no potentially dilutive debt or equity instruments
issued and outstanding during the quarters ended September 30, 2016
or 2015.   

 

REVENUE
RECOGNITION

 

The
Company recognizes revenue in accordance with Accounting Standards
Codification No. 605, "Revenue Recognition" ("ASC-605"), ASC-605
requires that four basic criteria must be met before revenue can be
recognized: (1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; (2)
delivery has occurred; (3) the selling price is fixed and
determinable; and (4) collectability is reasonably assured.
Determination of criteria (3) and (4) are based on management's
judgments regarding the fixed nature of the selling prices of the
products delivered and the collectability of those amounts.
Provisions for discounts and rebates to customers, estimated
returns and allowances, and other adjustments are provided for in
the same period the related sales are recorded. The Company will
defer any revenue for which the product has not been delivered or
is subject to refund until such time that the Company and the
customer jointly determine that the product has been delivered or
no refund will be required.

 

The
Company's revenues have been generated primarily through sublicense
and distribution agreements related to our Paw Pal product and
our pain relief products. The terms of these agreements generally
consist solely of upfront, nonrefundable payments for
licensing and distribution rights. Revenues from
non-refundable licensing and distribution fees are recognized upon
the completion of delivery of the license agreement and invoice to
the customer and/or receipt of the payment if the license has
stand-alone value and we do not have ongoing involvement or
obligations. 

 

RECENTLY
ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

 

The
Company has reviewed all recently issued, but not yet effective,
accounting pronouncements and does not believe the future adoption
of any such pronouncements may be expected to cause a material
impact on our financial condition or the results of its operations
other than in respect of the early adoption of the new regulations
relating to Development Stage Entities as discussed
above.

 

Note
3– GOING CONCERN

 

The
financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis
which assumes the Company will be able to realize its assets and
discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business for the
foreseeable future. As at September 30, 2016 the Company had yet to
establish a proven, reliable, recurring source of revenue to fund
its ongoing operating costs and with insufficient funds to fully
implement its proposed business plan. This raises substantial doubt
about the Company's ability to continue as a going
concern.

 

 

 

8

  

 

The
ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent
on the Company obtaining adequate capital to fund operating losses
until it becomes profitable. If the Company is unable to obtain
adequate capital, it could be forced to cease
operations.

 

In order
to continue as a going concern, the Company will need, among other
things, additional capital resources. The Company is contemplating
conducting an offering of its debt or equity securities to obtain
additional operating capital. The Company is dependent upon its
ability, and will continue to attempt, to secure equity and/or debt
financing. There are no assurances that the Company will be
successful and without sufficient financing it would be unlikely
for the Company to continue as a going concern.

 

Note 4 -
INCOME TAXES

 

The
provision for income taxes differs from the amount computed by
applying the statutory federal income tax rate to income before
provision for income taxes. The sources and tax effects of the
differences for the periods presented are as follows:

 

For the
three month period ended September 30, 2016, we did not recognize a
tax expense.

 

For the
three month period ended September 30, 2015, we recognized a tax
credit of $871 in respect of tax losses generated in the period
that were available to carry back and generate a tax refund in
r
