                    The funds may not be suitable for all investors. Certain funds may be affected by risks that include those associated
                    with sector concentration, international investing, investing in small and/or medium size companies, and/or the Funds'
                    possible use of investment techniques and strategies such as leverage, derivatives and short sales of securities and
                    alternative or nontraditional asset classes and strategies such as absolute return, long/short, commodities, currencies
                    and managed futures. Investments in fixed-income securities are subject to the possibility that interest rates could rise,
                    causing the value of the Funds' securities and share price to decline. Please see the Funds' prospectus for more information.
                    Shares of the Funds are not deposits of,
                    or guaranteed or endorsed by, any financial institution; are not insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC),
                    the Federal Reserve Board, or any other agency; and involve risk, including the possible loss of the principal amount
                    invested. Diversification neither assures a profit nor eliminates the risk of experiencing investment losses.
                

                    The Alternative Funds may not be suitable for all investors because of the sophisticated and aggressive investment
                    techniques the funds employ, such as leverage, derivatives and short selling. Click a fund name above or see a prospectus
                    for additional details on these and other risks.
                


                        Inverse and leveraged Funds are not suitable for all investors. •These Funds should be utilized only by investors who (a)
                        understand the risks associated with the use of leverage, (b) understand the consequences of seeking daily
                        leveraged investment results, (c) understand the risk of shorting, and (d) intend to actively monitor and manage their investments.
                    
                    •The more a Fund invests in leveraged instruments, the more the leverage will magnify any gains or losses on those investments.
                    •Inverse Funds involve certain risks, which include increased volatility due to the Funds' possible use of short sales of
                    securities and derivatives, such as options and futures. •The Funds' use of derivatives, such as futures, options and swap
                    agreements, may expose the Funds' shareholders to additional risks that they would not be subject to if they invested
                    directly in the securities underlying those derivatives. •Short-selling involves increased risks and costs. You risk
                    paying more for a security than you received from its sale. •Leveraged and inverse Funds seek to provide investment
                    results that match the performance of a specific benchmark, before fees and expenses, on a daily basis. Because the
                    Funds seek to track the performance of their benchmark on a daily basis, mathematical compounding, especially with
                    respect to those Funds that use leverage as part of their investment strategy, may prevent a fund from correlating
                    with the monthly, quarterly, annual or other period performance of its benchmark.Due to the compounding of daily returns,
                    leveraged and inverse Funds' returns over periods other than one day will likely differ in amount and possibly direction from
                    the benchmark return for the same period. For those Funds that consistently apply leverage, the value of the fund's shares
                    will tend to increase or decrease more than the value of any increase or decrease in its benchmark index. The Funds rebalance their
                    portfolios on a daily basis, increasing exposure in response to that day's gains or reducing exposure in response to that day's
                    losses. Daily rebalancing will impair a fund's performance if the benchmark experiences volatility. Investors should
                    monitor their leveraged and inverse Funds' holdings consistent with their strategies, as frequently as daily.
                    •For more on these and other risks, please read the prospectus.
                



                            An investment in the U.S. Government Money Market Fund is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation
                            or any other government agency. Although the fund seeks to preserve the value of your investment at $1.00 per share,
                            it is possible to lose money by investing in the fund.

Guggenheim Investments ETFs may not be suitable for all investors. • Investment returns and principal value will fluctuate so that when shares are redeemed, they may be worth more or less than original cost. Most investors will also incur customary brokerage commissions when buying or selling shares of an ETF. • Investments in securities and derivatives, in general, are subject to market risks that may cause their prices to fluctuate over time. • ETF Shares may trade below their net asset value ("NAV"). The NAV of shares will fluctuate with changes in the market value of an ETF's holdings. In addition, there can be no assurance that an active trading market for shares will develop or be maintained. • Please review a prospectus carefully for more information of the risks associated with each ETF.
