Location

About


              Petit Robert Bistro has been bringing traditional French cuisine to Boston for over a decade. Led by Chef Stefano Quaresima, the restaurant offers a rotating menu—to keep diners on their toes—but the classics remain constant. No matter the day, guests can always expect expertly prepared coq au vin, boeuf bourguignon and buttery escargots. The refined dining experience is carried out not just through the menu but the setting itself. Walk in through the red awning into a classic French bistro atmosphere: cushy brown leather banquettes, wooden chairs and tables draped with white tablecloths. If not for the address on Columbus Ave, you might just think you’re in Paris.

Terms and Conditions For All Promotional Vouchers Purchased Through Gilt City, Inc.
Terms & Conditions


The following terms and conditions apply to all promotional vouchers ("Vouchers") purchased through Gilt City, Inc. or its affiliated companies ("Gilt City"), except as otherwise specified on any particular Voucher and except as otherwise required by law.  In the event of a conflict between these terms and conditions and the actual Voucher, the Voucher itself will control.  All persons purchasing, printing, accepting, using or attempting to use any Voucher (each, a "Customer") agree to these terms and conditions.
All Vouchers are promotional in nature and are issued by the participating merchant or vendor ("Vendor") through Gilt City as a service provider. The Vendor is the holder and issuer of the Voucher and under no circumstances shall Gilt City be deemed the holder, issuer or seller of the Voucher. The law applicable to the Voucher shall be the law of the state where the Vendor interaction with the Customer occurs. As the holder and issuer of the Voucher, Vendor is solely responsible for the value and redemption of the Voucher and for any and all bodily injury, illness, damages, claims, liabilities and costs suffered by or relating to any Customer and the compliance with all laws, including, without limitation, unclaimed property and escheatment laws relating to the Vouchers. Each Customer hereby knowingly waives and releases Gilt City and its affiliates and their respective officers, directors, employees, shareholders, agents and representatives, from any and all injuries, liabilities, damages, claims and rights of any nature whatsoever arising from any act or omission of the Vendor in connection with the Voucher, the provision of the services and products relating to the Voucher, and compliance by the Vendor with applicable law, including, without limitation, unclaimed property and escheatment laws. Gilt City's sole role is as a service provider for the Vendor, and the applicability and compliance with any relevant law relating to any Voucher is solely determined by and complied with by the Vendor.
The Vouchers are coupons that provide a discount price from the actual or retail cost from the Vendor.  That discount is available until the expiration date stated on the face of the Voucher.  After that time, the amount originally paid by the Customer to Gilt City (the "Purchase Value") will be valid for goods and services of the Vendor for a minimum of five years in all states.  If the Customer is located in a state which requires the Vendor to honor the Purchase Value of the Voucher beyond five years, the applicable law of Customer's state governs.  For example, a Voucher purchased for a particular service of the Vendor at the discounted price of $50 (actual retail price of $100) with an expiration date on the discount of six months from a specified date, may be used for the particular service for six months from such specified date; thereafter, the Customer may use the $50 value of the Voucher to purchase other goods and services of the Vendor for a minimum of five years, longer if required by applicable law.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, for Vouchers that are redeemable for specific ticketed events, once the event date passes the Voucher expires.  Customer's acceptance of any redemption of a Voucher constitutes an acceptance of the redemption and a waiver of any claims associated with the Voucher.  The Voucher may not be redeemed for products or services other than those specified on the Voucher or as otherwise specifically permitted by this paragraph and may not be used to pay account balances or for products or services purchased from the Vendor prior to the purchase of the Voucher.
Vouchers are transferable without notice to Gilt City or Vendor. No resale of Vouchers is permitted unless such resale is permitted pursuant to applicable law. Vouchers are not redeemable for cash (in whole or in part) and have no cash value except as required by applicable law. If cash redemption is required by applicable law, the Customer will only be entitled to cash redemption based on the amount paid by the Customer to Gilt City for the Voucher, not the actual or retail cost from the Vendor. Vouchers may not be combined with any other offer, coupon, promotion or discount or certificate and must be used in a single visit to Vendor except as required by applicable law. Limit one Voucher per person per visit or purchase. Neither Gilt City nor Vendor is responsible for lost or stolen Vouchers. If you lose your Voucher, go to the "My Account" section of the Gilt City site and print your certificate. The Vendor will accept the first Voucher presented with the unique number printed on the Voucher. Treat your Voucher as you would cash. Vouchers are subject to any limitations stated on the Voucher or by the Vendor. The issuance of any credits for the Vouchers are at the sole discretion of the Vendor except as required by applicable law. All restaurant Vouchers are valid for dine in only unless otherwise stated on the Voucher. Vouchers may not be used for alcohol, prior balances, shipping or handling, tips or gratuities or other fees except as expressly provided on the Voucher or as allowed by the Vendor and as permitted by applicable law. Unless otherwise stated on the Voucher or disclosed in connection with the purchase of the Voucher by Customer, the Voucher price does not include sales, value added or use taxes, which may be charged to you separately by the Vendor at the time you redeem the Voucher. Any attempted redemption of a Voucher in violation of these terms and conditions will render the Voucher void.
All purchases of Vouchers and other interactions with Gilt City are subject to our Privacy Policy.

Product description

ABOUT PRODUCT
 
 The brand-new edition of the essential French language dictionary, an indispensable tool for improving your French writing and communication skills 
FEATURES

The full content of the latest 2017 edition of the Petit Robert: 

300,000 words and senses
150,000 synonyms and antonyms
75,000 etymologies
35,000 literary quotations from 1,300 authors
all the new words and senses added to this edition


Exclusive language features:

conjugation tables for all verbs
620 boxes on word families
audio pronunciation for 16,000 difficult words and 300 quotations
an integrated biographical dictionary of authors


New functionality for the 2017 edition:  

a brand-new intuitive, user-friendly interface displays the list of words in alphabetical order
an alert-the-editors feature: if you can’t find what you’re looking for in the dictionary (a new word, sense, quotation, author, etc.), you can suggest it for inclusion in the next update
memorize a wordlist: select the words you want and create your own list of favourites that you can then look up or change at any time with just one click
manage user settings: select text size, manage your personal wordlist
look-up history


Finding a word or an expression is simple:

no need to know the spelling: simply type the first few letters and the autocomplete function will suggest the most relevant words, even if you have spelled it wrongly or it sounds like another word
the enhanced search facility (using the Search button) allows you to find a word or expression anywhere in the dictionary (headwords, inflected forms, expressions, compound nouns, etc.)
a powerful multicriteria search engine is ideal for word games, rhymes, quotations and much more
full hypertext navigation (every word has a clickable link) allows you to explore the dictionary’s vast network of words
a new integrated search bar allows you to search for a word or sequence of letters directly within an entry at any time (the keyboard shortcut ""Ctrl+F"" is always active)



Detailed, illustrated online help includes information on all the Petit Robert’s prefaces and supplements. 	
No connection needed: 
An Internet connection is only needed to download and activate the software, after which the dictionary is permanently installed on your computer and can be consulted offline.
