Marriott Ownership Resorts, Inc. Key Developments

Marriott Vacations Worldwide Corporation and Marriott Ownership Resorts, Inc. Enter into Third Amendment Relating to Revolving Credit Facility with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., Bank of America, N.A. and Deutsche Bank Securities Inc
Dec 9 16
On December 8, 2016, Marriott Vacations Worldwide Corporation and certain of its subsidiaries entered into a Third Amendment relating to the revolving credit facility provided by the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, dated as of September 10, 2014, as amended, among the Company, Marriott Ownership Resorts, Inc., the several banks and other financial institutions or entities from time to time parties thereto, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent, Bank of America, N.A. and Deutsche Bank Securities Inc., as co-syndication agents, and Bank of America, N.A. and Deutsche Bank Securities Inc., as co-documentation agents. Among other things, the Third Amendment are: amends the definition of Fiscal Year in a manner that will permit the company to change its financial reporting year end as Amendments to Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws; change in fiscal year; expands the types of 'Investments' that the company is permitted to make to include investments for the purpose of satisfying the obligations of the Company under the Marriott Vacations Worldwide Corporation Deferred Compensation Plan; and increases to 75 million (from 5 million) the amount that the company may invest in unspecified types of investment vehicles at any time. The other terms of the Credit Agreement are substantially similar to those in effect prior to the execution of the Third Amendment. The description of the Third Amendment is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Third Amendment, which is filed as an exhibit to this Current Report on Form 8-K and is hereby incorporated by reference. From time to time, the Administrative Agent, the Documentation Agents, the Syndication Agents and the other financial institutions party to the Credit Agreement or their affiliates may have performed, and may in the future perform, various commercial banking, investment banking and other financial advisory services for the company and its affiliates for which they have or will receive customary fees and expenses. In particular, some of these financial institutions or their affiliates participate, or may in the future participate, in the company’s vacation ownership notes receivable warehouse facility and may also have participated, or may in the future participate, in transactions involving the securitization of vacation ownership notes receivable undertaken by the company’s subsidiaries.


Marriott Vacations Worldwide Corporation and Marriott Ownership Resorts, Inc. Enter into Second Amendment to the Revolving Credit Facility
Apr 7 16
On April 1, 2016, Marriott Vacations Worldwide Corporation and certain of its subsidiaries entered into a second amendment relating to the revolving credit facility provided by the second amended and restated credit agreement, dated as of September 10, 2014, as amended, among the company, its subsidiary Marriott Ownership Resorts, Inc., the several banks and other financial institutions or entities from time to time parties thereto, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent, Bank of America, N.A. and Deutsche Bank Securities Inc., as co-syndication agents, and Bank of America, N.A. and Deutsche Bank Securities Inc., as co-documentation agents. Among other things, the Second Amendment amends certain of the financial covenants contained in the Credit Agreement in a manner more favorable to the Company. The minimum consolidated tangible net worth covenant has been amended to require the Company to maintain a minimum consolidated tangible net worth (as defined in the Credit Agreement) consisting of the sum of 70%, rather than 75%, of the relevant baseline net worth and 70%, rather than 80%, of increases in such net worth resulting from certain equity offerings. In addition, the company will be required to maintain a ratio of its borrowing base amount of at least 1 to 1, rather than 1:25 to 1, to the sum of total extensions of credit under the credit agreement and the excess (if any) of all unrealized losses over all unrealized profits of certain swap agreements. The second amendment also adds certain technical provisions with respect to the impact of European Union bail-in banking legislation on liabilities of certain non-U.S. financial institutions. The other terms of the Credit Agreement are substantially similar to those in effect prior to the execution of the Second Amendment.

Lennen v. Marriott Ownership Resorts, Inc., et al.

 
Complaint
Contact Us Regarding this Case
 







This class action, filed in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Florida (Lennen v. Marriott Ownership Resorts, Inc., et al., 6:16-cv-0855), was filed on behalf of purchasers of Marriott timeshare interests in Marriott's points-based Marriott Vacation Club program (the "MVC Product") and owners of Marriott's tradtional week-to-week timeshares ("Legacy Timeshares").
In sum, the action involves allegations that Defendants, through a series of convoluted and patently illegal transactions, engaged (and continue to engage) in a scheme to convey illusory real property ownership interests to purchasers of the MVC Product. While purchase of the MVC Product is said to convey both title to a Florida timeshare estate and a beneficial interest in a Florida land trust, it, in fact, conveys neither. In reality, the MVC Product conveys to its purchasers nothing more than a simple awards program prodiving access to selected Marriott-owned timeshares throughout the country. The purpose of packaging the MVC Product as a real estate transaction is simple: the product provides significant opportunities for revenue that would not otherwise exist in connection with an awards program of this nature or even, for that matter, with the sale of Legacy Timeshares of the type Marriott has sold for decades.

	The Complaint names as defendants Marriott Ownership Resorts, Inc., Marriott Vacations Worldwide Corporation, d/b/a Marriott Vacation Club, Marriott Resorts Travel Company, Inc., d/b/a MVC Exchange Company (collectively, "Marriott," unless identified specifically), Marriott Title Insurance, MVC Owners Association, First American Financial, First American Trust, FSB, First American Title Company (collectively, "First American"), Orange County Florida, and Orange County Comptroller, Martha O. Haynie (collectively "Defendants"), for claims including violations of the Florida Vacation and Timeshare Act, § 721.01, Fla. Stats., et seq., the Florida Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organization Act ("Florida RICO"), § 895.01, 
	et seq., for common law claims of negligence and breach of fiduciary duty, and for declaratory and injunctive relief.

While Marriott, First American, and others have profited greatly from sales of the MVC Product, purchasers of the MVC Product continue to suffer the consequences of the deception. For one, MVC Owners are deprived of any of the benefits of real-property ownership while shouldering all the burdens, costs, and fees as if they had such title. Moreover, purchasers continue to suffer harm as a result of Marriott's opaque and discretionary point-valuation process, which results in significant dilution and lacks any reliable metric for tracking their so-called beneficial interests, as well as Marriott's unfettered process of adding and restricting access to properties in the underlying land trust.
Finally, as Defendants continue to exploit and profit from the MVC Product owners of Legacy Timeshares aslo suffer due to continued and increasing interference with their and actual ownership interests and Marriott's unlawful exchange and reservation procedures that restrict their ability to use and enjoy their ownership rights.
Plaintiffs in this action are purchasers of both the MVC Product and owners of Legacy Timeshares. They are represented by Newman Ferrara LLP, Soomi Kim, Esq., and the Polaszek Law Firm, PLLC.

About MARRIOTT OWNERSHIP RESORTS, INC.

   Sometimes it pays to share. Marriott Vacations Worldwide, formerly part of hotel giant Marriott International, operates more than 60 timeshare resort properties with one-, two-, and three bedroom villas in prime vacation destinations in the US (such as California, Colorado, Florida, Hawaii, and Nevada) and a handful of other countries (Aruba, France, Spain, St. Thomas, the West Indies, and Thailand). The villas are jointly owned by about 400,000 people who have exclusive use of the properties for limited periods of time. Owners can also trade intervals for time at other Marriott Vacation Club resorts, or for other rewards programs. Marriott spun off Marriott Vacations as a separately-traded company in 2011.

Reselling Timeshare – FAQ for Timeshare Sellers
Read through these frequently asked questions to see how easy reselling timeshare can be when you work with a smart and reliable timeshare resale advertising company like Sell My Timeshare NOW. Don't wait any longer if you need to sell timeshare; we're ready when you are!
If I Originally Purchased from a Resort Can I Resell My Timeshare?
Yes! Regardless of when or where you purchased your timeshare, you are entitled to resell it.
If I Still Have Financing on My Timeshare Can I Sell It?
Yes. You CAN resell even if your timeshare is still under financing. What you owe will simply be taken out of the buyer's purchase price during the closing process.
What Does Right of First Refusal (ROFR) Mean?
When a seller and a buyer come to a purchase agreement, the resort at which the timeshare is located has the legal right to purchase the timeshare for the agreed amount. If the resort enforces their right, they will buy back the timeshare. If they waive their ROFR, the original sale can proceed. In either case, you – the timeshare reseller – will receive the same amount for the sale of your timeshare.
Am I Required to Use a Real Estate Broker to Resell Timeshare?
No! A timeshare is not a traditional piece of real estate, thus brokerage is optional. In most cases, there is no need to pay a commission for a real estate broker's services, when you can easily find a buyer yourself. Sell My Timeshare NOW can help you by advertising your timeshare on our dynamic website, and we can offer professional guidance through the whole resale process.
For those who prefer it, broker assistance is available through our affiliate Timeshare Broker Services. We recommend their assistance to timeshare resellers who want as little as possible to do with the process of finding a buyer and settling on a sale price.
Do I Need an Appraisal to Sell Timeshare?
No, your timeshare property was not "appraised" when you purchased it, and it does not need to be appraised to be resold. If you are interested in the resale value of your timeshare, please take advantage of our free market value survey.
Do I Need a Lawyer to Handle the Timeshare Closing?
Sell My Timeshare NOW recommends a licensed and bonded title company like Timeshare Closing Services. This company executes the entire closing procedure, which includes: deed preparation, escrow of funds, timeshare estoppel certificate, closing statements and recording fees—all for one low flat rate. Any work done to the title is reviewed by a licensed attorney and is guaranteed to be precise.
Can I Resell My Timeshare if I Lost My Deed?
Yes! The closing company you choose can contact the county courthouse in which your timeshare is located to recover the deed. The fee for this service is usually around US $25.
How Long Does a Timeshare Closing Take?
Typically, it can take anywhere from 60 to 180 days to complete a timeshare closing from start to finish. However, each closing is different. A number of factors can impact the speed with which your closing will be processed including how quickly each party executes and returns required documents at various stages throughout the closing.
What Happens to My Banked Time If I Sell?
If you have deposited your week with an affiliated exchange company, that interval is no longer affiliated with the resort. So the sale of the resort timeshare doesn't affect banked weeks. The banked time can be used by you or included with the sale as an added incentive for buyers.
How Long Will it Take to Resell My Timeshare?
No one can accurately determine a specific length of time within which your property will sell. There are many factors that will influence the resale of your timeshare including location, resort quality, flexibility of usage, season, demand and, of course, price.

Why Timeshare Sellers Choose Us
SellMyTimeshareNOW offers more than just timeshare resale advertising.
When you subscribe to our services, we work to get your timeshare seen and sold. And unlike general auction sites like Ebay, we focus on one thing: selling timeshares.
Over the last 10 years, we have invested millions of dollars annually in developing SellMyTimeshareNOW.com and its affiliated websites. Through advanced Internet marketing techniques, we target a global audience of consumers, driving thousands of qualified buyers and renters to our site daily through search engines like Google, Bing, and Yahoo. These visitors turn into offers to rent and buy timeshares from owners like you (see the live feed of offers above for proof of how active our site really is).
Our advertising and marketing efforts have resulted in offers and successful timeshare sales for our customers time and time again. We can also assist you from start to finish in selling your timeshare including affiliated closing and transfer services.


What Former Timeshare Owners Have Said About Us...
"When I decided to sell my timeshare, I had no idea about how to go about doing this and of course who to trust. Trust was the biggest factor! I was afraid of getting ripped off as you hear about all these scams out there. I tried to sell it on my own on Ebay, but that certainly didn't work. Starwood recommended that I go to SellMyTimeshareNOW. After my first call with them, I felt comfortable and at ease that this was the right place to go. The process could not have been easier. SellMyTimeshareNOW did all the work and guided me through the whole process. They kept me informed the entire way. They were amazing and my timeshare sold in a reasonable amount of time. Trust was no longer a factor... I really couldn't be happier with this decision!"
-Bill DiModugno from Ridgewood, New Jersey
"We contracted with SellMyTimeshareNOW in December of 2011. SellMyTimeshareNOW was very honest with us regarding what we could realistically expect to receive in terms of selling price, and we successfully sold our unit in May of 2012. We are grateful to SMTN for their efforts on our behalf. We would certainly use their services again."
-Anthony W. Lista from Reading, Pennsylvania
"My husband and I contacted Sell My Timeshare NOW to list our timeshare week in Maui. We found the representative extremely helpful and professional. A buyer was found within a few months and the transaction was handled promptly and efficiently. When the buyer failed to complete the sale, Sell My Timeshare NOW was ready to relist the property and find another buyer. During the entire process the staff was available to take our calls and address our concerns every step of the way"
I would be happy to recommend Sell My Timeshare NOW to anyone looking for a competent, reliable company to sell their timeshare and handle all documentation with a positive and friendly attitude!
-Gina & Thomas Ebling from Carlsbad, California

Sell My Timeshare Now Reviews from Timeshare Owners







Sean S. 
Atlanta, GA



                "I googled "Timeshare resales" and it had listed SellMyTimeshareNow as the #1 option. Obviously, I did my homework. I looked at three or four other sites. SellMyTimeshareNow definitely had more people on their site, they had more activity on their site, and it was listed more professionally..."
            











Gary J.



                “I had to pay an upfront fee, but I had no issues.
                SellMyTimeshareNow.com, I just thought they were reputable. The fee wasn’t that much. I know to process a deed and to turn-over property - there’s a lot of work to that, so I feel that it was well worth the money. Once they had a buyer for my timeshare, they let you know everything... I could call them, and find out how things were going... Then, they sent me my check, and I’m done.”

                "Bunny from SellMyTimeshareNow contacted me within an hour. She was fantastic. I felt like she was my friend, right away... It was like a one-stop shop. They did the escrow - they had the escrow company work with me as well. They sent everything, all the paperwork, through email, so I didn’t have to go anywhere... I was also able to pay with my credit card, so I was able to get points!"

                “My husband and I were taking a quick vacation and we had an opportunity to visit and go through a
                timeshare presentation. I came home and said, “Well, I really did like that timeshare”... I decided that maybe I would Google online, to see what I could find. That SellMyTimeshareNow website was very easy to use... Not only that, but even sort by price range, so then I could plug in exactly what I was willing to pay for that particular timeshare.”
            










Zachary Strom
(Prospective Buyer)



            "I would like to offer a commendation to your associate Keith *.  I worked with him for the past few days on a listing.  His knowledge of the timeshare industry and dedication to me as a client was exceptional.  Although I ultimately decided not to pursue completion of the transaction, I will say that he did a wonderful job in helping me to negotiate a price to my satisfaction.  He also made me feel comfortable as a client in understanding the benefits of owning timeshare and demonstrating how I could make the best use of one.  I want to thank him for both his time and his dedication.  I recommend him to anyone who is a first time buyer or even a seasoned buyer looking for his/her next purchase."
        





Will & Leslie Snell
(Buyers)



            "We wanted to thank you for all of your help throughout the process of purchasing the 2 weeks timeshare at Marriott Grande Ocean, Hilton Head SC. We just recently closed on the transaction and today booked our first week stay for the end of March in our silver season ocean front villa. We would not be as excited today without your involvement in the process."
        





Alan Mihic
(Buyer)



            "I just completed the purchase of a timeshare in Barbados and was very satisfied with the experience. The price I paid was much better than what the resort was asking for and the people I dealt with were wonderful. They processed everything exactly as they described and were accommodating to my payment schedule requests. Very professional and courteous. I would certainly use this service again."
        





David Blake
(Buyer)



            "We started working with agent Bunny *. She was very positive and a great person to work with. She worked with the seller and us, and we received a fair deal. The staff kept us up to date on where we were in the process. I would recommend and use the services again. We are now proud owners in Key West, Florida."

SellMyTimeshareNow Reviews from Travelers





Lumi & Dan Haiducu
(Travelers)



            "We had a GREAT time at Ka’anapali Beach Club, Maui. The two bedroom condo accommodated the six of us perfectly, and it had everything we needed. My husband and I have been to Maui before, but for the other 4 guests it was their first time on this beautiful island, so they not only had the opportunity to see this magnificent island, but also this beautiful resort and all that it offered. The concierge staff was very nice and helpful, and in just one week we were able to do a lot of activities and site-seeing. Thank you, Judy, for finding this beautiful resort for us. And thank you SMTN for making this all possible and so enjoyable. We will definitely use SMTN for other travel plans in the future and recommend them to our friends and family."

            "I would like to thank the entire staff at SellMyTimeshareNow for customer support that truly is second to none. I was treated with courtesy, respect, professionalism, and the right amount of personality to make the entire experience an absolute joy. I was almost sad that our timeshare sold so quickly because that meant I could no longer deal with the wonderful people at customer service. If you're reading this and thinking of selling or buying a timeshare, you've found the right place and the right people! Thanks again for a wonderful experience."

Marriott has the BEST and biggest properties on Aruba.  We walked the shoreline and none compare to Marriott.  Excellent location.  Walk to restaurants and shops.  It is the perfect island life.

The property is getting tired and is in need of refurbishment inside the units.  The linens barely fit the beds. There is limited drawer space in the bedrooms.Be prepared to listen to all day announcements at the pool after 11am with amplified water aerobics music, then daily Bingo, then "Happy Hour".  It can be difficult to find a quiet spot at the pool.  However, there are plenty of beach huts which are quiet, but there is an additional fee to use them.  The drinks are not cheap and they are weak.  The service at the indoor restaurant "Champions" is poor.

Just came back from a 7 night stay in Aruba and my wife and I had a wonderful stay!  I found renting through redweek.com to be an excellent experience and would defiantly do it again.   I rented from Florence Holmes and she was a pleasure to deal with.  We found the Ocean Club to be far superior to the Surf Club.  Everything is very convenient and getting chairs at 8:30 by the pool every day was never an issue.  The one issue we had at the pool was the spotty internet service.  I know we are supposed to be on "Island Time", but the truth of the matter is that most people feel the need to stay connected to family, friends and work.  I have AT&T and had zero service at the pool or in the Lobby.  It only worked well when I was in my room for some reason.  My wife on the other hand has Verizon and she was able to access the internet at the pool and in the lobby.  I think the beaches in front of the Marriott properties are the biggest and the best in Aruba.  The beaches in front of the other hotels are not nearly as big.  The Ocean Club offers bingo on a daily basis along with other activities.  The pool bar was always busy and we met a lot of friendly people throughout the week.  The bartender, Wilma was out favorite!  We enjoyed wonderful dinners at the nearby restaurants.  I think Madam Jenette was out favorite.  However I think Simply Fish went downhill.  Most of the fish they offer is not local.  The service was the worst we had all week and my wife and I both sent back the tuna we ordered for dinner.  It was at best a 1/2 thick which in our minds was unacceptable for (I think) $38.00.  Tuna steaks should be much thicker cut to allow for a proper sear.  In defense of the Simply Fish management, they truly tried to resolve the issue, but by that time it was too late.  We paid for our app's and drinks and were ready to leave.  The unsung hero of the week was the Pelican Nest.  You can walk there from the Ocean Club and eat on the pier over the water.  I would recommend for any dinner you have in Aruba to make a reservation.  In hindsight I wish I made reservations weeks prior to my arrival to ensure I got into every restaurant I wanted to dine.  Wacky Wahoo was the one restaurant that was completely booked all week that I was unable get a reservation.  The restaurant is supposedly very small.  If I could recommend one thing to all of the folks in the Aruba service industry is to be friendlier.  In my 2 experiences on the island I found a lot of the locals lacking customer service skills on several different occasions.  Of course the worst part is leaving.  If it's on a Saturday give yourself 3 hours to get through multiple security checkpoints and U.S. customs.  Sunday is a whole different story.  Not nearly as busy.  I hope you find this review helpful.

We Fell In Love with Aruba and the Marriott Ocean Club several years ago .. and it continues to be the Best Vacation spot we have been to.  Guaranteed weather most times of the year with the Breezes always present, to keep you cool and relaxed.  Upscale property with the feel of home. Not as congested as the Surf Club Next Door.  Activities if you wish, very relaxing atmosphere, something for everyone.  Never disappoints!!

We love the Ocean Club. We were there for President's week and it did not feel crowded at all. The check in process was very easy. Rooms are not ready before 4pm. We like to relax by the "Quiet Pool" there is plenty of shade and sunshine plus you can take a dip in the pool to cool off. Also, the hot tub is just above it so very convenient. The room was great. Even the utensils were nice, we stayed at another timeshare the week before and you can tell the difference in the quality of the supplies and the friendliness of the staff. also, it has free internet and the TV channels are very similar to our cable in the US. They do need to update the laundry facilities, only 1 dryer was working on our floor and two washers.

It appears that a more current review for the resort is needed!  Checked in was smooth and our room request was once again fulfilled!  The Coconut Trading Company has been replaced by a beach shop otherwise all others remain the same.  Complex looks in great shape and the gardener's work meticulously during the day keeping up with the landscaping!  Pool maintenance and cleaning starts at sunrise! The towel hut line remains the place to congregate very early in the morning! Seems like the spot to catch up with friends made from years past when you can't sleep.  Would be nice to see more straight chairs placed around the pool.  The beach is cleaned daily.  Staff is still as friendly as ever.....  Some down sides if you want to know:(  in desperate need of new washer/dryers and the activities leave a lot to be desired! The price of drinks at Happy Hour are ridiculous!  We find that most of our friends go to a different resort during that time or make in the room and bring down to the pool.  Found security sleeping at pool one morning:(

We have owned 2 weeks in a 1 BD unit at the Ocean Club since 1999 and have been using them almost every year.  We were there recently from 10/26/12 - 11/9/12 and couldn't be more pleased about the condition of the units and the friendliness of the people.  The beds sleep wonderful.We also love the casino in the Marriott hotel next door, and for those who don't know, if you sign up for a player's card, you can get room comps for food and beverage on your Ocean Club unit when you check out.  That is a nice plus for those who like to visit the casino.The pool area is nice, but nothing seems to change about the reserving of chairs.  I was pleasantly surprised that the pool personnel WILL address people who attempt to smoke in non smoking areas (you always have those who think rules don't apply to them).We ate at Ruth's Chris Steak House at the hotel and the food was superb as usual.  We also ate at Champion's at the Ocean Club a couple of times.  There is so much shopping, entertainment, and food venues nearby that it would be hard not to find something to do.

My family prefers the Ocean Club to either the hotel, or the Surf Club, because it is approx 25% the size of the Surf Club, and quieter than either the hotel or the Surf.  The advantage is that you are in an uncrowded resort (especially around the pool), situated in between the other two resorts.  The hotel has the best casino on the island, the spa is at the ocean club and all 3 resorts offer a variety of restaurants in every price range.  All of Marriott's Aruba properties are beautiful and well maintained.  I own at both the Ocean Club and the Surf club.  You can't go wrong with Aruba, and Marriott has the best places on the island.  Walk along the beach and you can easily access all the other hotels, their restaurants and casinos. New shopping malls, multi-plex cinema, many new restaurants, and bowling are all in walking distance.

We have been staying at both Marriott Ocean and Surf Clubs for a few years. Both are great resort. We've found Ocean Club more to our liking. It's more upscale than Surf and not crowded at all. We try to stay at the Ocean Club a few weeks per year. It's more expensive than Surf but its well worth it.

We just spent a week at Marriott's Aruba Ocean Club.  Is a beautiful resort and we could not find a single thing to complain about. Taxi from the airport to the resort was $25.00.  We rented a beach hut every day for $15.00 per day.  Is money well spent.  The pool area is beautiful and spacious.  The resort is beautiful.  The landscaping is out of this world.  The word "paradise" kept going thru my mind.  Food and drinks reasonably priced.  We had maid service one day of the week and that was fine.  The condos have everything you need.  My only wish would be that they had a washer and dryer.  But there are washer and dryers on each floor.  Many restaurants to choose from.  Casinos aren't vegas style and I don't think you would ever really win much if anything on the machines, but it was fun.  Drinks are free if you are playing.  There is a grocery store nearby, for $15 taxi ride.  Our driver waited for us while we grocery shopped.  We made sure it was worth his while, since he was so nice in offering.  The airport doesn't open until 7 am, so if you have an early flight, don't make the mistake we did, in getting there at 6:30.  The airport is very nice with quite a few shops and restaurants.  We had a view of the Iguana sanctuary-which was nice.  Lots of visible security, so we never felt that safety was an issue. I would definitely recommend this resort to anyone.  Its absolutely beautiful, very clean.  The beach is beautiful, one of the best places we have ever been and we have been to alot of places.  Very family oriented.  Loved it!

Without a doubt one of the best locations in the Caribbean!  Aruba is safe and has a dedicated and friendly staff.  The Ocean Club is perfect for families too.  We have been 10 times.  The restaurants are five star too.  Enjoy!

We have been very pleased with the resort in total.  Beach is reserved for Ocean Club owners and guests and not crowded like Surf Club's beach. Gorgeous property.  Great for families or a couples getaway.

We've had the opportunity to stay at the Marriott Ocean Club Resort 5 times with our family &/or friends & have thoroughly enjoyed it each time...some of our best vacations ever.  So many things to do & so close to everything.  Just walk outside to the pool or beach & a short drive or taxi ride into town.

I really depend on these reviews, to help me make a decision on my destination, so here goes. The resort is very good, no problems except the "beach".
We have been to quite a few Caribbean islands at Christmas time and I have never been so disappointed in a beach in all the times we have traveled. It is so crowded that there is nothing beautiful or relaxing about it! We have never seen so many cabanas and every one of them packed with chairs and people all day long. The beach water is also disgusting!
The so called beach appears "man made". If you really want to spend your money and time at a typical beautiful tropical beach, do not stay at this resort.

I visit Aruba Ocean Club two or three times a year.  It is always a pleasure staying at this 5 star resort.  I have been to many other Caribbean islands but none of them come close to Aruba's Ocean Club.  The people there can't do enough for you.  They are far the nicest and most polite people I have ever met.  The island is safe to walk around in any time of the day, or night.  There are a few Supermarkets on the island that are very big and clean and offer everything we have back home.  The drinking water, is one of the most delicious water that I have ever tasted and the food is out of this world.  Marriott Ocean Club, has the largest rooms on the island.  This island, has every convenience that we have in the States.  There is something for everyone in the family, you never get bored.  There are water sports for adults and children, fishing, parasailing, snorkling, horseback ridding and one of the biggest Casinos on the island is right next door.  Across the street, there is a newly built plaza with restaurants, shops and a nice movie theater.  The beaches are clean, long and beautiful and the weather is perfect with always a nice breeze.  The resort's rooms are absolutely gorgeous and the best part is, that Aruba is only 4 hours from Newark airport.  There is nothing negative to be said about this resort, only that you can't find anywhere better than this as a package deal.  This resort is absolutely perfect!!!!Julie A.

I just returned from the Ocean Club and found it to be delightful.  The units are modern, clean and well maintained as usual.  The only drawback  I noticed is that they have cut back on the daily exchange of towels both in your rooms and at the towel hut.  There is a once a week cleaning of your room (free of charge) with clean towels provided.  Any additional requests for clean room towels are for a fee.  At the end of the day the towel hut always ran out of towels so often you would have to wait in line the next morning for a clean beach towel.    All in all the stay was nice and the weather was beautiful.  Unfortunately Aruba is getting busier each year with more & more buildings and stores popping up everywhere.  It's starting to loose a little of its appeal because of that.

I've been an owner at the Aruba Ocean Club for 8 years.  My family and I look forward to our time there year after year.  There is always something fun to do; lots of water activities along the beautiful beach, site seeing, horse back riding, ATV's, snorkeling and scuba diving, boating, fishing, great resturants, night activities, casinos and of course lots of sunshine :)  The timeshares are very roomy, clean and beautifully decorated.  You won't be disappointed.

I have had great vacations here. The lazy river pool allows you to spend the day floating in the water or head down to the beach to float in ocean water. I love the short walk to the hotel for great Sushi in the lobby.

Just returned from an excellent week at the Marriott.  My 1 BR unit was huge, clean and had an awesome view.  Staff could not have been more pleasant or efficient.  The system they use for the palapas (beach huts) works well.  You can either reserve an odd numbered unit for up to 3 days for a small fee, or use one of the even numbered ones on a first-come basis.  There always seemed to be enough huts.Many people have mentioned the cost of food being exceptionally high.  I disagree after traveling extensively throughout the islands.  In fact, I thought there were more reasonably prices choices than many other resorts, plus, you have a kitchen if you do not choose to go out for every meal. Beach area was quieter than the pool area, but neither were particularly loud.  I found the resort very relaxing and I would return there for sure.

Stayed here in March 2009 and had a great time.  The property and unit 
was clean and the staff was friendly.  Was very glad I choose the Ocean 
Club rather than the Surf Club.  For me, being able to get a beach hut 
each morning was important.  You have plenty of space so you are not on 
top of your neighbor at the beach.I struggled chosing between the Surf Club and Ocean Club.  While the 
Surf Club is newer and some consider cosmetically nicer, be prepared to 
be packed in like sausages on the beach or at the pool.  It appears the 
surf club overbuilt for the amount of frontage they have.  The Ocean Club was just a little more laid back and fewer screaming little 
ones than the Surf Club.  If you have a young family they will enjoy the 
Lazy river at the Surf Club.Be prepared food is very, very expensive in Aruba.That being said it was a nice trip.

We just came back from a week-long vacation at
Mariott's Ocean Club. I loved everything there:
the property was amazing, the staff was very
friendly and helpful, it was clean and whatever we
had to be done was done.  they have a person there
who reserves all your trips and makes restaurants
arrangements.  The front desk people were very
friendly and tried to help us as much as possible.
The room that we had was specious and bright, it
had a partial ocean view, but we didn't spend that
much time in the room anyway. We travelled with a
2.5 year-old toddler, you don't need to bring a
crib and a high chair-they give it to you.  The
kitchen was fully stacked and they have a
supermarket nearby and it has anything you wish
for: American and local stuff.
We rented a car for the duration of our trip, and
i recommend you doing the same.  It's not that
much a day, but you have freedom to go anywhere
any time. Cob costs about $6-10 each way, but the
car cost us about $27 a day, which we thought was
a good deal, especially with the child. PArking is
free or it costs very little.
The beach was clean and we didn't have a problem
reserving palapas, they were always available.
Overall it was an great vacation and I would
definately return to Aruba and Marriott.

When I booked this trip I was a bit skeptical of Aruba for my kids as I thought 
there wasnt much to see or do here, and the airfare to get here was too 
expensive for a relaxing vacation.Was I ever wrong!We stayed in the Marriott Ocean Club, a beautiful resort with all the 
amenities of a Hotel.  The only other large resort developer on the Island is 
named Divi Aruba, who had just as nice accomadations, but there site was a 
little more spread out.  Marriotts site has all the restaurants, 
entertainment, beaches, and other amenities just a short walk away.We rented a car (which I suggest) and chose to take Avis insurance because 
if you damage a car in Aruba, you have to pay for the damages before you 
leave and get reimbursed by your insurance company when you return to the 
states.We arrived at the resort and got placed in room 5273 which was on the 2nd 
floor of the main building, it was a garden view in which we had a great 
view of the pool and if we turned our heads to the left we could see the 
beach.  Our room was a 1br, with a 2 person Jacuzzi tub, 2 person shower, 
and a sleeper sofa.  The kitchen had granite counters and a breakfast bar.  
The resort had a great pool, although you couldnt use the pool at the 
Marriott Surf club, I didnt mind as the Ocean Club was MUCH less crowded 
and congested and had a more cozy feel to it than the Surf Club.  The beach 
was riddled with covered huts called Palapas with beach lounge chairs under 
them, and if you wanted one in the morning you could just reserve it for 
free.  However, I was always able to get a front row palapas no matter if I 
reserved one or not.  We packed seasoned meat that I froze, and pre-cooked 
Minute Maid rice for dinner.  I also pre-ordered online eggs, ham, cheese, 
bread and milk for our breakfast, that we picked up from the onsite market 
when we arrived.  It was already packed and ready to go.  My first evening 
here we just relaxed by the beach, watching the sunset and drinking a Pina 
Coladayum.  We went to the beach, packed a picnic lunch & drinks from our room and 
dipped in the beach (my 1 complaint about this resort and this part of Aruba 
was the sand was HARD, with lots of crushed seashells and if you didnt wear 
swim shoes you could cut your feet).  The beach water temp was warm and 
blue, with pirate ships, wind surfers, and other water sports right onsite and 
in view.  They had a band playing in the background, and iguanas roamed 
freely.  The onsite casino, which we didnt feel paid out to well, and they 
had high bet minimums at the tables (we play black jack) starting at $10.  So 
we went up the road to the Alahambra casino that paid out well and we 
could play black jack for $5 a hand.The large gym rivals some gyms you may pay for a membership to join, then 
went out to explore some of Aruba on our own.  Mostly everything in Aruba 
will be closed on Sunday.  A short walk down the beach will take you to the 
bar called Moombas for drinks.  Dinner at Smokey Joes, a fantastic rib joint, 
where the rib dish was about $15 and they had these great Jaimacan beef 
pattiesyum yum.  They usually had another band playing all day, and you can make dinner 
reservations for Madam Jeanettes a cozy, romantic Carribean / dutch 
restaurant.  They have pastries and ice cream at the elaborate snack bar in 
the casino.  Definately reserv the 8 hour jeep tour (which is the best tour 
for you $ at 79 pp and includes a great lunch and all the sites the Island has 
to offer in 1 swoop).  We went on the tour with ABC for the 8 hr tour of 
Aruba that covered the natural pool, baby beach, the oldest catholic church 
in Aruba, the caves, ostrige farm, old gold mines, the natural bridge and the 
lighthousedefinitely well worth every penny!  We came back  the room and 
had dinner at Simply Fish (a restaurant on Marriott property), located on the 
beach at the Marriott where we were staying.  We enjoyed the dinner, 
location, and the service.Don't leave without stopping at Lindas Pancakes for a late brunchYUM
YUM then we turned in the car, went flew home.Definitely a do over vacation!  The Marriott Aruba Ocean Club far exceeded 
our expectations and is a definite do over.

Have stayed at The Aruba Ocean Club several times and love it more each 
time we stay. We purchased here 7 years ago and are very happy with the 
resort. The beach is beautiful, the pool area is not crowded and we feel safe 
whenever we stay at The Ocean Club.

We love the Marriott Ocean Club, smaller and 
more cosy than the Surf Club but with the 
same amenities. Great for families or couples.

We just returned from the Aruba Ocean Club 
and liked the facility very much with one 
exception - out of control kids running up and 
down the hallway and slamming doors at all 
hours of the day and night.  Running kids 
everywhere including the pool area, etc.  
Other than that, we loved it.  We will definitely 
go again, maybe at a  quieter time than 
during the week after New Year's Eve!!

Stayed at the Ocean Club December 1-8, 
2006. This is a very nice resort and we 
enjoyed it very much. Because of its more 
intimate atmosphere, I actually liked it more 
than the Marriot Surf Club next door.I would most definitely return to the Marriot 
Ocean Club in the future.

We sent our daughter and new son-in-law 
here for their honeymoon in August of this 
year. They had nothing but great things to 
say about the facilities, and the usual 
excellant service from the Marriott staff.As a matter of fact - my daughter is pretty 
picky and she had absolutely nothing bad to 
say about the entire experience!She has convinced us to exchange our week 
another year (our home resort is Cypress 
Harbor) for ourselves... 8-))

One of the best places to stay in Aruba.  Great 
beach, lovely shops, beautiful rooms, wonderful 
views.  Only negative was that the rooms are not 
ready on time. Had to wait 1 1/2 hours past 
check in.  Don't come early.

Outstanding resort!  Units recently done over.  
Staff very friendly to guests.  Outstanding 
pool, and super nice beach with lots of water 
activities at your doorstep.  Guests can use the 
facilities of the Marriott hotel on one side and 
the Marriott Surf Club on the other side.  
Parking is free if you rent a car. I will go 
back in a minute.

We have stayed here on two occasion's.  It is 
without a doubt one of the finest timeshares 
in Aruba.  This is a typical 5 Star Marriott 
facility. Plus you get an added bonus - it is 
right next door to the Marriott Hotel and 
Casino. As a guest at the timeshare you get to 
use all of the facilities of the hotel and have 
charge-card privlages.  If you haven't been to 
Aruba - then you must go! It's a wonderful 
island, great restaurants and the locals are 
dedicated to your having a wonderful stay.

We were there in the middle of construction 
and it was still a great place to be.  I am sure 
it is even nicer now.  Aruba is worth the 
airfare.  If you get this property any time of 
year it is a good exchange.
