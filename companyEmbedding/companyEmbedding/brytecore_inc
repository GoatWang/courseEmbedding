                your leads' searches have evolved over time. Automatically classify leads into personas, such
                as first-time home buyer, elementary school parent, or investor.
              

                To use Lead Booster, place our snippet of code on your website (or in your app) and track
                when real estate actions occur.

            "you" or "a user"). This Privacy Statement gives you specific information about how we protect
            your privacy, how we treat information we collect on the Sites that identifies an individual
            user ("Personal Information"), and how we use aggregated information.
            
          

            By using the Sites, you signify your acceptance of this Privacy Statement. If you do not agree
            to the Privacy Statement, you cannot use the Sites. We reserve the right to modify this
            Statement at any time. Your use of the Sites after the date of the last modification listed at the
            beginning of this Privacy Statement indicates to us that you agree to the changes.
            
          
Location of Servers and Transfer of Information to the United States

            The Sites are hosted by servers in the United States. If you are located outside of the United States,
            your Personal Information will be transferred to the United States. By submitting your Personal
            Information, you consent to its transfer to the United States and to its storage, processing, and
            use there in accordance with this Privacy Statement.
            
          
Collection and Use of Your Personal Information

            We collect your Personal Information on the Sites in order to enhance the services we offer you. We
            collect Personal Information from you only when you voluntarily submit it in order to obtain certain
            services or information, including:
          

submitting a form containing your information
creating an account to use Brytecore services
requests for contact
requests for information on employment

Contacting Us

            If you contact us, we collect Personal Information, which is retained or referred to the appropriate
            department for research and a response.
            
          
Collection of Non-Personal Information

            Even if you do not send us any Personal Information, we collect information about how you use our site
            ("Non-Personal Information"). This information cannot be used to identify you personally and is
            explained in more detail below under "Non-Personal Information".
            
          
Cookies

            A cookie is a small data file, often including an anonymous unique identifier, that is sent from a web
            site's computer and stored on your computer's hard drive. Use of cookies is common on the Internet. A
            web site can send its own cookie to your browser if your browser's preferences allow it, but (to protect
            your privacy) your browser permits a web site to access only the cookies it has already sent to you, not
            the cookies sent to you by other sites. You can configure your browser to accept all cookies, reject all
            cookies, or notify you when a cookie is sent. (Each browser is different, so check the "Help" menu of
            your browser to learn how to change your cookie preferences.) You can reset your browser to refuse all
            cookies or indicate when a cookie is being sent. But if you refuse cookies, some parts of the Sites will
            not function properly and may not provide services or information you have requested.
            
          
Non-Personal Information

            Like many sites, we obtain Non-Personal Information such as IP (internet protocol) addresses, browser
            types, the name of your ISP (internet service provider), information about where a user comes from
            before arriving at our Site, what pages a user visits, the order of those pages, and the amount of time
            spent on each. A vendor may perform these services for us by sending a cookie to gather this information,
            compile it, and report to us. We use Non-Personal Information to customize the advertising and content
            you see, improve our services, conduct research, and provide anonymous aggregated reporting for internal
            audits and third-parties.
            
          
Use of Information

            We use the Personal Information and the Non-Personal Information we collect on the Sites (A) to provide
            you with the services that you ask to receive through the Sites, (B) to answer your questions or
            complaints, (C) to refer you to a sales associate about our products and services, and (D) for
            analytical purposes to help us improve the Sites and for our business generally.
            
          
Sharing Your Information

            We do not rent, sell, or share with third parties the Personal Information we collect from you on this
            Site except (A) to provide information or services that you have requested, (B) with your permission,
            or (C) under the following circumstances:
          


              Third party vendors we engage to provide services on our behalf, such as hosting, web-site
              development, and support, have access to Personal Information, but they have agreed not to
              disclose the Personal Information or to use it for any purpose other than providing the
              requested services.
            

              There may arise special circumstances where it is necessary for us to disclose and use Personal
              Information and Non-Personal Information, such as: to enforce this Privacy Statement; to protect
              our property or rights; to protect the safety of anyone; to investigate, prevent, or take action
              regarding illegal or improper activities; to carry out a merger or consolidation with another entity, a
              sale or transfer of some or all of our assets, or any similar transaction; or for other reasons we
              determine in good faith are necessary, appropriate, or required by law, such as when we respond to subpoenas,
              court orders, or other legal or administrative process.
            

              The Sites may contain links to third-party web sites. When you click on those links, you will go
              to a third-party site where you will be subject to that site's privacy statement and we encourage you
              to read that policy statement. Please be aware that we are not responsible for the privacy practices of
              those other web sites and we expressly disclaim any liability for their actions, including actions
              relating to the use and disclosure of Personal Information by those third parties. We remind you to be aware
              of when you leave our Sites and enter a third-party web site, and again encourage you to read the privacy
              statement on any web site that collects your Personal Information.

What does it mean to update a profile?





Owler is a community of business professionals working together to build a database of company information. One contribution reaches thousands of members across the Owler community.
When you contribute on Owler you're shaping the database for all people consuming Owler data. Your updates will flow through to company profiles, competitive intelligence reports, daily snapshots and more. All verified members of the Owler community can update Owler profiles.  Members help the community by sharing data, such as a company's headquarters, and also by weighing-in on sentiment-based questions, such as CEO rating.
Community members make this all happen. That being said, each data update is reviewed by at least one other person to ensure accuracy. All updates are kept anonymous. Happy updating!
