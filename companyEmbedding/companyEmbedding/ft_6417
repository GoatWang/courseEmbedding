Manufacturer Description


Â  Additional features: Two 30 x 14-inch shelves Two 16-inch peg strips with tool hooks Exterior dimensions: 10.3W x 10.3D x 9.3H feet Interior dimensions: 10W x 10D x 6.6H feet Door dimensions: 9W x 6.5H feet Â  Â  Offering 786.6 cubic feet of space to store your riding lawnmower, snow mobile, large garden equipment, and more, the Lifetime 11 x 11 Foot Outdoor Storage Building with Tri Fold Doors makes a convenient addition to your backyard. Constructed from high-density polyethylene (HDPE) plastic with powder-coated steel reinforcements, this sturdy shed from Lifetime Sheds is weather- and- rust-resistant and designed to withstand the harshest elements for years to come. And since it is UV-protected and stain-resistant, it requires no painting or maintenance. That means extra time to yourself. Â  The extra-large, carriage-style tri-fold doors allow you to open up the entire front of the shed for easy access, while an internal spring latch, interior deadbolts, and an exterior padlock loop ensure the security of your property. Two lockable, sliding windows, three stationary windows in the doors, two large skylights, and two screened vents let in enough natural light, so you can easily make your way around during the day. Two 30 x 14-inch shelves and two 16-inch peg strips with tool hooks allow you to create the perfect storage area to suit your needs. This storage building comes with a 10-year limited manufacturer's warranty. Assembly is a weekend project for one or two people. Â  About Lifetime Products One of the largest manufacturers of blow-molded polyethylene folding tables and chairs and portable residential basketball equipment, Lifetime Products also manufactures outdoor storage sheds, utility trailers, and lawn and garden items.

                    Improvements to Farmington Lake make it a destination
Playing in the water at Lake Farmington.
Beaches are a relatively rare phenomenon in New Mexico, but one is growing in the Four Corners area.
Farmington Lake, which a few short years ago was a reservoir that was untapped as a source of recreation, has been transformed into not just a source of valuable drinking water, but also a summer playground.
It¿s a real thriving aquatic adventure!
