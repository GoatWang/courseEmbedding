Goldilocks or the Bears: The Debate About the Direction of the Economy



David Tillson


July 12, 2017





 It seems as though everyone from the “man-on-the-street” to the world’s central bankers cannot agree on where we stand in terms of the outlook for the economy. One week’s good news is often offset by the next week’s bad news. The continual release of seemingly contradictory economic data keeps everyone a little off balance. While statistics are necessary when analyzing the economy, it is well known that data revisions, false signals and surprises are the norm.

Status Quo in the Macro Economy v. Rapid Change Everywhere Else



David Laidlaw


April 12, 2017





The recovery from the Financial Crisis of 2007-2009 has been marked by two extraordinary characteristics. The first is that economic growth in the US and throughout the world has been extremely slow. Gross Domestic Product has not grown at a rate above 3% during any year and has averaged 2.1% since the recession ended in the second quarter of 2009. The second characteristic is that the recovery has lasted a very long time.

Do Expectations Live Up To Reality?



David Tillson


January 12, 2017





The one constant in life is change. Sometimes we can anticipate an impending change and be fairly certain of the result, as in: “it’s going to rain tomorrow.” Other times, change happens when we least expect it and with an uncertain outcome—remember December 7th, 1941! Over the ages when the Brits spoke “The King is dead. Long live the King!” it was a recognition that change is normal but that life must go on, and people must adapt despite everything that has occurred. 2016 was a year of some major changes and some very surprising, unexpected results.

 Low Interest Rates, Market Manipulation, Fraud and Politics



David Tillson


October 13, 2016





We chose these topics for discussion because low interest rates have led to accusations of market manipulation by central bankers and to fraudulent behavior by issuers of some bonds. A few comments about politics are warranted because it is ‘the season.’ The world has been living with low interest rates for nearly a decade and confidence that we will return to a 1990’s type of interest rate environment any time soon is certainly lacking. Some economists and market strategists are questioning if central bankers have been experimenting with financial markets too much with too little to show for it.

Money Market Changes



David Laidlaw


September  9, 2016





The brokerage firms and banks are implementing new SEC rules affecting money market accounts.  We have reviewed the options and will change client money market accounts to the cash/bank balance choice since we believe it is the safest option for liquid funds.

Brexit - A Deeper Dive



David Laidlaw


July  8, 2016





Our plans to discuss other topics in this quarterly note were upstaged by the UK’s recent vote to leave the European Union (EU). The ‘Brexit’ vote caught many, including us, off guard. The subsequent economic impacts still remain unclear. Thus, the immediate ‘risk off’ move in stocks was logical. More surprising was the ensuing rally in which 90% of post-Brexit equity market losses were recouped in a matter of 72 hours.

Should I Stay or Should I Go



David Laidlaw


April 14, 2016





It is a challenging environment for investing, and current macroeconomic and financial market conditions have pushed many investors toward supposedly safer investments. Past efforts by monetary authorities around the world to increase economic growth have been relatively unsuccessful as worldwide growth is now well below desired levels. This lack of growth combined with the battle against recessions has led central banks to adopt unconventional and untested tools. Investors are nervous that politicians and bankers have exhausted their remedies to restore normalcy.

2015 Fourth Quarter Commentary



David Tillson


January 27, 2016





This quarter’s letter was initially designed to take a slightly somber tone of “2015 was a little rocky, but not too much damage was done.”  However, given the inauspicious start to 2016, a different focus is clearly in order.  Just to put 2015 to bed, the market, depending on your definition, was essentially flat.  The Russell 1000 and S&P 500 Indexes were up approximately 1% while their growth and value constituents showed plus 5% and negative 4% returns, respectively.  Major bond indices were in these same ranges which had the practical effect of most major investment strategies having similar performance.

Eagle Ridge Investment Management and Laidlaw Group Merger

Jul 07, 2015, 13:50 ET
		  		  					
						 from   Eagle Ridge Investment Management, LLC 











 
















































 

 




















 


WESTPORT, Conn. and BEDFORD HILLS, N.Y., July 7, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Eagle Ridge Investment Management, LLC, an independent advisory firm headquartered in Westport, CT and Laidlaw Group, LLC, a Registered Investment Advisor headquartered in Bedford Hills, NY, announced that they have merged their like-sized RIA firms effective July 1, 2015. The combined firm, which will be known as Eagle Ridge Investment Management, LLC will have approximately $550 million in assets under management. The two firms will operate in their current locations until later this year, when they will relocate operations to a new office in Stamford, CT.
Following the merger, clients will enjoy access to an expanded team of investment professionals and support staff working together to meet their needs. Eagle Ridge and Laidlaw Group decided to pursue the merger after significant internal discussion and due diligence spanning a period of 3 years. During this time, principals at both firms had ample time to get to know one another and to determine that each firm's respective investment philosophy and passion for working directly with clients to compound wealth over the longer term were, in fact, very complementary. 
As independent, partner-owned entities, both firms have also prided themselves on their ability to give clients truly objective, individualized investment advice that is 'hands-on' and unencumbered by any need to sell product or meet conflicting goals imposed by a larger corporation. This focus on truly independent investment advice will remain unchanged as a merged company. The merged firms' increased scale should also provide benefits that will accrue directly to clients in the form of increased commitments to technology, back office and compliance as well as in form of an expanded research effort supported by a team of 6 investment professionals. 
"Investment management firms depend on the quality of the people providing portfolio management, research and client relationship services," said David Tillson, president of Eagle Ridge Investment Management, LLC.  David Laidlaw's and his colleagues' professionalism enabled Laidlaw Group to thrive over the course of two wrenching bear markets. "Laidlaw Group and Eagle Ridge share the same fundamental approach to long-term investing," said David Laidlaw, founder of Laidlaw Group, LLC. "This merger will allow each firm to enhance the investment research and service it provides without sacrificing the unique qualities that attracted clients in the first place. It's an exciting step for both companies, and everyone involved is enthusiastic about what this partnership could mean for both clients' interests and the future growth of the merged firm." About Eagle Ridge Investment Management, LLC
Eagle Ridge Investment Management is an independent RIA with offices in Westport, CT and Bedford Hills, NY. The firm specializes in investment management strategies for clients and currently serves roughly 200 different households, families, individuals and institutions.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.

Eagle Ridge Investment Management and Laidlaw Group Merger






Jul 7, 2015, 1:50pm EDT














WESTPORT, Conn. and BEDFORD HILLS, N.Y., July 7, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Eagle Ridge Investment Management, LLC, an independent advisory firm headquartered in Westport, CT and Laidlaw Group, LLC, a Registered Investment Advisor headquartered in Bedford Hills, NY, announced that they have merged their like-sized RIA firms effective July 1, 2015. The combined firm, which will be known as Eagle Ridge Investment Management, LLC will have approximately $550 million in assets under management. The two firms will operate in their current locations until later this year, when they will relocate operations to a new office in Stamford, CT.
Following the merger, clients will enjoy access to an expanded team of investment professionals and support staff working together to meet their needs. Eagle Ridge and Laidlaw Group decided to pursue the merger after significant internal discussion and due diligence spanning a period of 3 years. During this time, principals at both firms had ample time to get to know one another and to determine that each firm's respective investment philosophy and passion for working directly with clients to compound wealth over the longer term were, in fact, very complementary. 
As independent, partner-owned entities, both firms have also prided themselves on their ability to give clients truly objective, individualized investment advice that is 'hands-on' and unencumbered by any need to sell product or meet conflicting goals imposed by a larger corporation. This focus on truly independent investment advice will remain unchanged as a merged company. The merged firms' increased scale should also provide benefits that will accrue directly to clients in the form of increased commitments to technology, back office and compliance as well as in form of an expanded research effort supported by a team of 6 investment professionals. 
"Investment management firms depend on the quality of the people providing portfolio management, research and client relationship services," said David Tillson, president of Eagle Ridge Investment Management, LLC.  David Laidlaw's and his colleagues' professionalism enabled Laidlaw Group to thrive over the course of two wrenching bear markets. "Laidlaw Group and Eagle Ridge share the same fundamental approach to long-term investing," said David Laidlaw, founder of Laidlaw Group, LLC. "This merger will allow each firm to enhance the investment research and service it provides without sacrificing the unique qualities that attracted clients in the first place. It's an exciting step for both companies, and everyone involved is enthusiastic about what this partnership could mean for both clients' interests and the future growth of the merged firm." About Eagle Ridge Investment Management, LLC
Eagle Ridge Investment Management is an independent RIA with offices in Westport, CT and Bedford Hills, NY. The firm specializes in investment management strategies for clients and currently serves roughly 200 different households, families, individuals and institutions.
