Victor Mendelson, J.D. ’92: Building a Successful Global Business




BY:  


            Richard Westlund    



CREATED:  


            Wednesday, February 08, 2017    








 


Drawing on his family ties, entrepreneurial spirit, and legal education, Victor H. Mendelson, J.D. ’92, has played a key leadership role in one of South Florida’s most remarkable business turnaround stories.

In the past 20 years, Mendelson and his brother Eric, guided by their father Laurans, have transformed HEICO Corporation from a money-losing venture to a highly profitable global aerospace and electronics conglomerate with more than $1 billion in annual sales. Along the way, Mendelson has helped fight off a $100 million lawsuit by United Technologies Corp. that would have closed the company’s doors and has negotiated more than 60 acquisitions.
Today, HEICO (NYSE: HEI and HEI.A) has a $4 billion market cap, and analysts project sales of $1.3 to $1.4 billion this year. “Our compound annual return over the past 25 years has been about 23 percent—better than Warren Buffet’s investment in Berkshire Hathaway,” Mendelson said.
Based in Hollywood, Florida, HEICO has multiple locations around the world for design, manufacturing, repair, overhaul, distribution, sales, and support capabilities. Over the past decade, Forbes magazine has ranked HEICO as one of the 100 “World’s Most Innovative Growth Companies,” 100 “Best Small Companies,” 200 “Hot Shot Stocks,” and 100 “Most Trustworthy Companies in America.”
Mendelson has served as HEICO’s co-president since 2009 and is also president of the company’s Electronic Technologies Group, whose net sales increased 46 percent to a record $132.6 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2016. “Our products are found on large commercial aircraft, regional, business and military aircraft, as well as on a large variety of industrial turbines, targeting systems, missiles, and electro-optical devices,” he said.
SHARING A DREAM
Born in New York, Mendelson was 15 months old when his parents, Laurans, and Arlene, moved to Miami. He graduated from Gulliver School and then returned to New York City as a freshman at Columbia College, earning his bachelor’s degree in political science in 1989. His older brother Eric was already a student at Columbia, on his way to a bachelor’s degree in economics and an M.B.A.
The brothers had already formed an investment company, and Mendelson was considering a law degree in preparation for a career in finance.
“With our father, we shared a dream of taking over a troubled public company and making it a success,” Mendelson said. “Since Eric and I were in New York, we were able to talk with several Wall Street securities analysts. One of them suggested we look at HEICO, which was a small Florida company that was losing money.”
The three Mendelsons acquired enough shares to become the largest shareholders but had to initiate a proxy fight for control of the company. “During my senior year at Columbia, we sued the directors for proxy solicitation violations, and the case came to trial during my first semester at UM law school,” Mendelson said. “By the end of the trial, it was apparent that we would win, so the company turned over management to us on January 1, 1990.”



Victor H. Mendelson
A NEW CHAPTER
At that time, HEICO had about $26 million in annual sales with a market cap of about $25 million. One of the first things the Mendelsons did was to allocate about 12 percent of the company stock—priced at less than $1 share—to the employees’ 401(k) defined contribution plan. Since then the value of those shares has grown exponentially. As Mendelson said, “We are proud to have rewarded our company’s loyal employees turning many of them into millionaires.”
In the early 1990s, Mendelson was living at home, juggling his law school assignments with the responsibilities of building a business. “We have a close family, and the company is intertwined in our lives,” he said.
But Mendelson also paid close attention to his classes, particularly the corporate and security law courses taught by Professor Stephen Halpert. After he graduated, he returned to the law school several times as a guest lecturer on his experience at HEICO.
For Mendelson, one of the primary benefits of a law school education was being able to serve as the general counsel, as well as an operational executive, on HEICO’s lean management team. “Every contract over a minimal size and every important negotiation came across my desk,” he said. “I was responsible for closing most of the 62 acquisitions we’ve made since 1996, working with the entrepreneurs who were selling their companies. My legal background helped me navigate those deals, and I was able to overlay my business judgment on top of that.”
SECRETS OF A TURNAROUND
Turning around HEICO was a long-term process—not like waving a magic wand. “We were able to do so by running a good business, taking care of our people, and developing products our customers needed,” Mendelson said.
One of the first and most serious challenges the Mendelsons faced was a lawsuit from UTC dating back to the 1980s. “They filed an injunction to prevent us from making a jet engine replacement part—our only product at the time—and sued for $100 million in damages,” he said. “Fortunately, our insurance company covered the legal fees, and our attorneys were successful in defending our company. After ten years in the courts, the UTC lawsuit was dismissed.”
Meanwhile, the Mendelsons began broadening HEICO’s product line, beginning with aircraft replacement parts and moving into electronic components. “I founded our Electronic Technologies Group in 1996 as we began acquiring aerospace and defense electronics firms,” he said. “We now develop mission-critical, high-reliability components for a variety of applications. Our latest products include chips for laser range finders that help determine the distance from a target, as well as infrared testing and calibration equipment for aircraft cameras and detection systems,” Mendelson said. “These are all critical components in advanced technology products.”
 BUILDING ON SUCCESS
Through the years, HEICO has allowed most of its acquisitions to run as stand-alone businesses within the corporate framework. “We are buying successful niche businesses where the founders and owners have knowledge and expertise,” Mendelson said. “We are not looking to squeeze more juice from the same orange. Instead, we want to encourage their creativity and ability to respond to the market so they can continue their success. As a result, about 90 percent of those entrepreneurs are still with us.”
On the personal side, Mendelson and his wife Lisa have three children, including two daughters at Columbia University, where he now serves as chairman of the Columbia College Board of Visitors. Active in a number of community organizations, including serving as treasurer of the Boys & Girls Clubs of Miami-Dade, trustee of St. Thomas University, and board member of Florida Grand Opera, Mendelson said, “Lisa and I love the South Florida lifestyle. We couldn’t imagine living anywhere else.”

Victor Mendelson


Victor H. Mendelson is President and Chief Executive Officer of HEICO Electronic Technologies Corp. (HET), one of two principal operating subsidiaries of NYSE-traded HEICO Corporation. HET is engaged primarily in the design, manufacture and sale of complex niche electro-optical, electronic and microwave components employed mostly in mission-critical defense, space and medical systems. HET is the substantial market leader in all of its product categories.
Victor was born in New York, NY and moved to Miami, FL with his family when he was 15 months old. He grew up in South Miami-Dade County, graduating from the local Gulliver Schools. He received his AB degree from Columbia College of Columbia University, New York and he is currently a member of the Columbia College Board of Visitors. He received his JD degree from the University of Miami School of Law.
Victor’s involvement in Florida Grand Opera (FGO) dates back to his early childhood. His mother, Arlene Mendelson, brought him to the children’s operas produced by the Young Patronesses of the Opera (YPO), the oldest FGO affiliate group. Arlene has served as YPO President, among many other roles in that organization. She is currently the Vice Chairman of the FGO Board of Directors, on which she has served for nearly 30 years (including its predecessor the Miami Opera Guild). Victor joined FGO’s Finance Committee in 1996 and the Board of Directors in 2000, a second generation Board member. He currently serves as Chairman of the Finance Committee and Treasurer of FGO.
Victor is a Trustee of St. Thomas University in Miami Gardens, FL, where he chairs the Board’s Academic Affairs Committee, and is a member of the Board of Directors of the Boys & Girls Clubs of South Florida Foundation.
Victor also serves as a member of the Board of Directors and Executive Vice-President of HEICO Corporation. He was the Company’s General Counsel from 1992 until late 2008. HEICO is the world’s largest designer and manufacturer of factory-new, FAA-approved, non-OEM commercial aircraft replacement parts and a significant provider of aircraft accessory component repair and overhaul services. HEICO counts all twenty of the world’s largest twenty airlines as customers. With his father, Laurans, and his brother, Eric, they assumed management control of HEICO Corporation in 1990. Under their management, the firm experienced compound annual growth in sales and net income approximating 20%. The company evolved from an operating loss in their year of takeover to a business producing operating income margins in the top five percent of publicly-held aerospace and defense companies.
Victor is married to the former Lisa Hellinger, who also was raised in South Miami-Dade. Lisa is a member of the Beth Am Day School Board in Pinecrest, FL and a member of the Board of the Greater Miami Jewish Federation Southwest Division. Lisa and Victor reside in Coconut Grove, FL with their three elementary and middle school-aged children, Alexander, Lindsey and Nicole.

HEICO Corporation Increases Semi-Annual Cash Dividend by 11 Percent | Business Wire


























































HEICO Corporation Increases Semi-Annual Cash Dividend by 11 Percent




25% Cumulative Cash Dividend Increase In Past 6 Months; Follows 
      5-for-4 stock split






June 13, 2017 08:30 AM Eastern Daylight Time



MIAMI & HOLLYWOOD, Fla.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--HEICO Corporation (NYSE: HEI.A) (NYSE: HEI) announced today that its 
      Board of Directors declared a regular semi-annual cash dividend of $0.08 
      per share payable on both classes of common stock. The cash dividend is 
      payable on July 19, 2017 to shareholders of record as of July 5, 2017.
    

      Since December 2016, the Company has cumulatively increased its cash 
      dividend by 25%.
    

      The upcoming cash dividend is HEICO’s 78th consecutive 
      semi-annual cash dividend since 1979 and represents an 11% increase over 
      the prior semi-annual per share amount of $0.072 (as adjusted for the 
      Company’s 5-for-4 stock split distributed in April 2017). Additionally, 
      HEICO increased its cash dividend by 13% in December 2016.
    

      Laurans A. Mendelson, HEICO’s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, 
      along with HEICO’s Co-Presidents, Eric A. Mendelson and Victor H. 
      Mendelson, stated, “The cash dividend increase represents our Board of 
      Directors’ commitment to rewarding shareholders, while also retaining 
      sufficient capital to invest in our internal growth objectives and 
      acquisition strategies.”
    

      HEICO Corporation is engaged primarily in the design, production, 
      servicing and distribution of products and services to certain niche 
      segments of the aviation, defense, space, medical, telecommunications 
      and electronics industries through its Hollywood, Florida-based Flight 
      Support Group and its Miami, Florida-based Electronic Technologies 
      Group. HEICO’s customers include a majority of the world’s airlines and 
      overhaul shops, as well as numerous defense and space contractors and 
      military agencies worldwide, in addition to medical, telecommunications 
      and electronics equipment manufacturers. For more information about 
      HEICO, please visit our website at http://www.heico.com.
    

      The Company has two classes of common stock traded on the NYSE. Both 
      classes, the Class A Common Stock (HEI.A) and the Common Stock (HEI), 
      are virtually identical in all economic respects. The only difference 
      between the share classes is the voting rights. The Class A Common Stock 
      (HEI.A) receives 1/10 vote per share and the Common Stock (HEI) receives 
      one vote per share. There are currently approximately 50.6 million 
      shares of HEICO's Class A Common Stock (HEI.A) outstanding and 33.8 
      million shares of HEICO's Common Stock (HEI) outstanding. The stock 
      symbols for HEICO's two classes of common stock on most web sites are 
      HEI.A and HEI. However, some web sites change HEICO's Class A Common 
      Stock symbol (HEI.A) to HEI/A or HEIa.
    

      Certain statements in this press release constitute forward-looking 
      statements, which are subject to risks, uncertainties and contingencies. 
      HEICO's actual results may differ materially from those expressed in or 
      implied by those forward-looking statements as a result of factors 
      including: lower demand for commercial air travel or airline fleet 
      changes or airline purchasing decisions, which could cause lower demand 
      for our goods and services; product specification costs and 
      requirements, which could cause an increase to our costs to complete 
      contracts; governmental and regulatory demands, export policies and 
      restrictions, reductions in defense, space or homeland security spending 
      by U.S. and/or foreign customers or competition from existing and new 
      competitors, which could reduce our sales; our ability to introduce new 
      products and services at profitable pricing levels, which could reduce 
      our sales or sales growth; product development or manufacturing 
      difficulties, which could increase our product development costs and 
      delay sales; our ability to make acquisitions and achieve operating 
      synergies from acquired businesses; customer credit risk; interest, 
      foreign currency exchange and income tax rates; economic conditions 
      within and outside of the aviation, defense, space, medical, 
      telecommunications and electronics industries, which could negatively 
      impact our costs and revenues; and defense budget cuts, which could 
      reduce our defense-related revenue. Parties receiving this material are 
      encouraged to review all of HEICO's filings with the Securities and 
      Exchange Commission, including, but not limited to filings on Form 10-K, 
      Form 10-Q and Form 8-K. We undertake no obligation to publicly update or 
      revise any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new 
      information, future events or otherwise, except to the extent required 
      by applicable law.
