Wednesday, May 6, 2015Lumos Networks Corp. Introduces Dark Fiber Offering Targeting Fiber to the Cell (“FTTC”), Large Enterprise and Data        Center Opportunities
 WAYNESBORO, Va.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--        Lumos Networks Corp. (“Lu        Targeting Fiber to the Cell (“FTTC”), Large Enterprise and Data        Center Opportunities
 WAYNESBORO, Va.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--        Lumos Networks Corp. (“Lumos Networks” or the “Company”) (Nasdaq: LMOS),        a leading fiber-based provider of data, voice and IP-based        telecommunication services in the Mid-Atlantic region, today introduced        a dark fiber product offering to meet the growing demand for        high-capacity, customizable network connectivity for FTTC (both small        cell and macro sites), large enterprises and data centers. 
 The Lumos Dark Fiber offering will provide connectivity for both        wireless backhaul to macro sites and fronthaul for small cell sites.        Dark Fiber provides the scalability and speed capabilities that wireless        carriers require for small cell roll-outs, a rapidly growing trend as        wireless carriers seek to expand the coverage and density of their        mobile networks. Wireless backhaul provides connectivity between a macro        cell site and a mobile switching center while fronthaul links a small        cell and the macro site. The Lumos Dark Fiber solution will provide        connectivity for both examples. 
 “National and regional wireless carriers already trust us with their        FTTC backhaul needs so extending our services to support new        applications in this area is a natural fit. Our Dark Fiber solution        offers the right combination of high-bandwidth, low-latency backhaul and        fronthaul necessary to manage their rapidly growing bandwidth needs,”        said Craig Drinkhall, Lumos Networks’ Chief Technology Officer. 
 Joseph E. McCourt, Chief Revenue Officer at Lumos said, “The release of        our dark fiber product comes at a very opportune time. Recently, we have        seen an increase in the number of dark fiber RFPs for macro FTTC deals,        small cells, and large Enterprise opportunities, particularly within the        Education and Healthcare verticals. We expect to sign Enterprise dark        fiber contracts in 2015 within our fiber expansion markets in Richmond,        Norfolk and the rest of the Tidewater area.” 
 “Our Dark Fiber solution is also well suited for our large enterprise        and data center customers who need to maximize control over their        connectivity needs and demand a high-bandwidth, private network they can        fully customize,” added Mr. Drinkhall. “Dark Fiber increases a        customer’s control over all key aspects of network connectivity: design,        capacity, latency, security, management and cost.” 
 Mr. Drinkhall continued, “The Dark Fiber product leverages Lumos’        extensive fiber assets and deep experience constructing new fiber        networks. Our fiber network currently has nearly 8,000 fiber route miles        with an average density of approximately 46 strands, and we expect both        metrics to increase as we continue to aggressively expand our fiber        footprint. With these assets and our ongoing focus on increasing our        fiber footprint, we are well poised to meet the dark fiber needs of our        FTTC, enterprise and data center customers,” Mr. Drinkhall said.

Such forward-looking statements reflect, among other things,        our current expectations, plans and strategies, and anticipated        financial results, all of which are subject to known and unknown risks,        uncertainties and factors that may cause our actual results to differ        materially from those expressed or implied by these forward-looking        statements. Many of these risks are beyond our ability to control or        predict.

Important factors with respect to any such        forward-looking statements, including certain risks and uncertainties        that could cause actual results to differ from those contained in the        forward-looking statements, include, but are not limited to: rapid        development and intense competition in the telecommunications and high        speed data transport industry; our ability to offset expected revenue        declines in legacy voice and access products related to the recent        regulatory actions, wireless substitution, technology changes and other        factors; our ability to effectively allocate capital and implement our        “edge-out” expansion plans in a timely manner; our ability to complete        customer installations in a timely manner; adverse economic conditions;        operating and financial restrictions imposed by our senior credit        facility; our cash and capital requirements; declining prices for our        services; our ability to maintain and enhance our network; the potential        to experience a high rate of customer turnover; federal and state        regulatory fees, requirements and developments; our reliance on certain        suppliers and vendors; and other unforeseen difficulties that may occur.        These risks and uncertainties are not intended to represent a complete        list of all risks and uncertainties inherent in our business, and should        be read in conjunction with the more detailed cautionary statements and        risk factors included in our SEC filings, including our Annual Report        filed on Form 10-K.

SPECIAL NOTE FROM THE COMPANY REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS


      Any statements contained in this presentation that are not statements of 
      historical fact, including statements about our beliefs and 
      expectations, are forward-looking statements and should be evaluated as 
      such. The words “anticipates,” “believes,” “expects,” “intends,” 
      “plans,” “estimates,” “targets,” “projects,” “should,” “may,” “will” and 
      similar words and expressions are intended to identify forward-looking 
      statements. Such forward-looking statements reflect, among other things, 
      our current expectations, plans and strategies, and anticipated 
      financial results, all of which are subject to known and unknown risks, 
      uncertainties and factors that may cause our actual results to differ 
      materially from those expressed or implied by these forward-looking 
      statements. Many of these risks are beyond our ability to control or 
      predict. Because of these risks, uncertainties and assumptions, you 
      should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements. 
      Furthermore, forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they 
      are made. We do not undertake any obligation to update or review any 
      forward-looking information, whether as a result of new information, 
      future events or otherwise. Important factors with respect to any such 
      forward-looking statements, including certain risks and uncertainties 
      that could cause actual results to differ from those contained in the 
      forward-looking statements, include, but are not limited to: the 
      successful closing of the announced EQT Merger, including obtaining the 
      requisite regulatory, governmental and stockholder approvals and 
      satisfying other closing conditions; the risk that required governmental 
      and regulatory approvals may delay the Merger or result in the 
      imposition of conditions that could cause the parties to abandon the 
      Merger or materially impact the financial benefits of the Merger; the 
      timing to consummate the proposed Merger; any disruption from the 
      proposed Merger making it more difficult to maintain relationships with 
      customers, employees or suppliers; the diversion of management time on 
      Merger-related issues; the Merger may involve unexpected costs, 
      liabilities or delays; the outcome of any legal proceedings related to 
      the Merger, the failure by EQT Infrastructure to obtain the necessary 
      financing arrangement set forth in commitment letters received in 
      connection with the Merger; the impact of our previous acquisitions of 
      Clarity and DC74 on our operations; rapid development and intense 
      competition with resulting pricing pressure in the telecommunications 
      and high speed data transport industry; our ability to grow our data 
      business on an organic or inorganic basis in order to offset expected 
      revenue declines in legacy voice and access products; our ability to 
      obtain new carrier contracts or expand services under existing carrier 
      contracts at competitive pricing levels to offset churn and achieve 
      revenue growth from our carrier businesses; our ability to separate our 
      legacy business on a timely basis; our ability to effectively allocate 
      capital and timely implement network expansion plans necessary to 
      accommodate organic growth initiatives; our ability to complete customer 
      installations in a timely manner; adverse economic conditions; operating 
      and financial restrictions imposed by our senior credit facility and our 
      unsecured debt obligations; our cash and capital requirements; our 
      ability to maintain and enhance our network; the potential to experience 
      a high rate of customer turnover; federal and state regulatory fees, 
      requirements and developments; our reliance on certain suppliers and 
      vendors; and other unforeseen difficulties that may occur. These risks 
      and uncertainties are not intended to represent a complete list of all 
      risks and uncertainties inherent in our business, and should be read in 
      conjunction with the more detailed cautionary statements and risk 
      factors included in our SEC filings, including our Quarterly Report on 
      Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2017 and our Annual Report on 
      Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016.

Lumos Networks Corp. Introduces Dark Fiber Offering | Business Wire


























































Lumos Networks Corp. Introduces Dark Fiber Offering




Targeting Fiber to the Cell (“FTTC”), Large Enterprise and Data 
      Center Opportunities






May 05, 2015 04:44 PM Eastern Daylight Time



WAYNESBORO, Va.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Lumos Networks Corp. (“Lumos Networks” or the “Company”) (Nasdaq: LMOS), 
      a leading fiber-based provider of data, voice and IP-based 
      telecommunication services in the Mid-Atlantic region, today introduced 
      a dark fiber product offering to meet the growing demand for 
      high-capacity, customizable network connectivity for FTTC (both small 
      cell and macro sites), large enterprises and data centers.
    


      The Lumos Dark Fiber offering will provide connectivity for both 
      wireless backhaul to macro sites and fronthaul for small cell sites. 
      Dark Fiber provides the scalability and speed capabilities that wireless 
      carriers require for small cell roll-outs, a rapidly growing trend as 
      wireless carriers seek to expand the coverage and density of their 
      mobile networks. Wireless backhaul provides connectivity between a macro 
      cell site and a mobile switching center while fronthaul links a small 
      cell and the macro site. The Lumos Dark Fiber solution will provide 
      connectivity for both examples.
    

      “National and regional wireless carriers already trust us with their 
      FTTC backhaul needs so extending our services to support new 
      applications in this area is a natural fit. Our Dark Fiber solution 
      offers the right combination of high-bandwidth, low-latency backhaul and 
      fronthaul necessary to manage their rapidly growing bandwidth needs,” 
      said Craig Drinkhall, Lumos Networks’ Chief Technology Officer.
    

      Joseph E. McCourt, Chief Revenue Officer at Lumos said, “The release of 
      our dark fiber product comes at a very opportune time. Recently, we have 
      seen an increase in the number of dark fiber RFPs for macro FTTC deals, 
      small cells, and large Enterprise opportunities, particularly within the 
      Education and Healthcare verticals. We expect to sign Enterprise dark 
      fiber contracts in 2015 within our fiber expansion markets in Richmond, 
      Norfolk and the rest of the Tidewater area.”
    

      “Our Dark Fiber solution is also well suited for our large enterprise 
      and data center customers who need to maximize control over their 
      connectivity needs and demand a high-bandwidth, private network they can 
      fully customize,” added Mr. Drinkhall. “Dark Fiber increases a 
      customer’s control over all key aspects of network connectivity: design, 
      capacity, latency, security, management and cost.”
    

      Mr. Drinkhall continued, “The Dark Fiber product leverages Lumos’ 
      extensive fiber assets and deep experience constructing new fiber 
      networks. Our fiber network currently has nearly 8,000 fiber route miles 
      with an average density of approximately 46 strands, and we expect both 
      metrics to increase as we continue to aggressively expand our fiber 
      footprint. With these assets and our ongoing focus on increasing our 
      fiber footprint, we are well poised to meet the dark fiber needs of our 
      FTTC, enterprise and data center customers,” Mr. Drinkhall said.

SPECIAL NOTE FROM THE COMPANY REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS


      Any statements contained in this presentation that are not statements of 
      historical fact, including statements about our beliefs and 
      expectations, are forward-looking statements and should be evaluated as 
      such. The words “anticipates,” “believes,” “expects,” “intends,” 
      “plans,” “estimates,” “targets,” “projects,” “should,” “may,” “will” and 
      similar words and expressions are intended to identify forward-looking 
      statements. Such forward-looking statements reflect, among other things, 
      our current expectations, plans and strategies, and anticipated 
      financial results, all of which are subject to known and unknown risks, 
      uncertainties and factors that may cause our actual results to differ 
      materially from those expressed or implied by these forward-looking 
      statements. Many of these risks are beyond our ability to control or 
      predict. Because of these risks, uncertainties and assumptions, you 
      should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements. 
      Furthermore, forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they 
      are made. We do not undertake any obligation to update or review any 
      forward-looking information, whether as a result of new information, 
      future events or otherwise. Important factors with respect to any such 
      forward-looking statements, including certain risks and uncertainties 
      that could cause actual results to differ from those contained in the 
      forward-looking statements, include, but are not limited to: rapid 
      development and intense competition in the telecommunications and high 
      speed data transport industry; our ability to offset expected revenue 
      declines in legacy voice and access products related to the recent 
      regulatory actions, wireless substitution, technology changes and other 
      factors; our ability to effectively allocate capital and implement our 
      “edge-out” expansion plans in a timely manner; our ability to complete 
      customer installations in a timely manner; adverse economic conditions; 
      operating and financial restrictions imposed by our senior credit 
      facility; our cash and capital requirements; declining prices for our

Common questions

What's the difference between a C corporation and an S corporation?
The IRS allows corporations to choose to be taxed as either a "C corporation" or an "S corporation." Income from C corporations are subject to double taxation; that is, the corporation pays taxes on its net income and then the shareholders also pay taxes on the income that they receive from the corporation.S corporations have only one level of taxation. The shareholders still have to pay taxes on money that they receive from the corporation, but an S corporation does not pay taxes on its net income. While the S corporation is popular among small business owners, C corporations have greater tax planning flexibility.


How does a corporation protect my personal assets?
If a business operates as a corporation, the business owners, called shareholders, are not personally liable for debts or other claims against the corporation. That's because the corporation is a separate legal entity from its owners. If a corporation complies with the formalities required for it to be treated as a separate legal entity, then anyone seeking to collect a debt from, or enforce a claim against, a corporation, would not be able to collect from the shareholders themselves. They would only be able to pursue the assets held in the name of the corporation.


Why do many people choose to form their corporation in Delaware?
Delaware is a very popular place in which to form corporations. However, the primary benefits apply to larger public corporations or those planning to go public. Delaware's laws provide heightened protection for board members against lawsuits brought by shareholders, and Delaware has a court exclusively dedicated to resolving corporate disputes. These benefits don't mean much to smaller corporations. Keep in mind that if a corporation forms in Delaware and does business in another state, the corporation would be required to file additional paperwork, and pay any taxes and/or fees required to do business in that state. Given those factors, many smaller corporations keep it simple and form in the state in which they plan to do business.


What is an EIN?
An employer identification number (EIN), also known as a federal tax identification number, is used to identify a business entity for tax purposes. It's like a Social Security number, but for a business. In general, most businesses need an EIN. The only reason a business would not get an EIN is if it has only one owner, elects to be treated as a sole proprietor for tax purposes, and does not want to open a separate business bank account. In this case, the owner would use their Social Security number as the business identifier. However, there are disadvantages to this approach, namely the risk of liability.


How are LLCs taxed?
Unlike a corporation, LLCs have some flexibility in how they're taxed. Depending on how many members and the type of tax treatment the owner selects, the LLC can be taxed as either a corporation, partnership or as part of the owner's personal tax return (called a "disregarded entity"). By default, an LLC with two or more members are taxed as a partnership, unless they file an IRS Form 8832 to elect to be treated as a corporation. If the LLC has only one owner, it will be taxed as a sole proprietor, unless the owner files Form 8832. It's not necessary to decide which tax treatment until after your business is formed. You have up to 12 months to decide and can speak to an accountant if you need help making this decision.


What is a registered agent?
A registered agent (sometimes called a resident agent or statutory agent) is a person or business authorized to accept important legal documents on behalf of a business. States require businesses to provide the name of their registered agent at the time they form their business entity. While you can be your own registered agent, there are disadvantages. You have to be available during regular business hours and your information goes on the public record. If you miss a filing deadline, you risk being fined or shut down. Our registered agent service can ensure you receive important business documents, sort through junk mail and keep your information private.


Is a corporation right for me?
It depends on many factors. Get help deciding by answering a few questions here.

Common questions

What's the difference between a C corporation and an S corporation?
The IRS allows corporations to choose to be taxed as either a "C corporation" or an "S corporation." Income from C corporations are subject to double taxation; that is, the corporation pays taxes on its net income and then the shareholders also pay taxes on the income that they receive from the corporation.S corporations have only one level of taxation. The shareholders still have to pay taxes on money that they receive from the corporation, but an S corporation does not pay taxes on its net income. While the S corporation is popular among small business owners, C corporations have greater tax planning flexibility.


How does a corporation protect my personal assets?
If a business operates as a corporation, the business owners, called shareholders, are not personally liable for debts or other claims against the corporation. That's because the corporation is a separate legal entity from its owners. If a corporation complies with the formalities required for it to be treated as a separate legal entity, then anyone seeking to collect a debt from, or enforce a claim against, a corporation, would not be able to collect from the shareholders themselves. They would only be able to pursue the assets held in the name of the corporation.


Why do many people choose to form their corporation in Delaware?
Delaware is a very popular place in which to form corporations. However, the primary benefits apply to larger public corporations or those planning to go public. Delaware's laws provide heightened protection for board members against lawsuits brought by shareholders, and Delaware has a court exclusively dedicated to resolving corporate disputes. These benefits don't mean much to smaller corporations. Keep in mind that if a corporation forms in Delaware and does business in another state, the corporation would be required to file additional paperwork, and pay any taxes and/or fees required to do business in that state. Given those factors, many smaller corporations keep it simple and form in the state in which they plan to do business.


What is an EIN?
An employer identification number (EIN), also known as a federal tax identification number, is used to identify a business entity for tax purposes. It's like a Social Security number, but for a business. In general, most businesses need an EIN. The only reason a business would not get an EIN is if it has only one owner, elects to be treated as a sole proprietor for tax purposes, and does not want to open a separate business bank account. In this case, the owner would use their Social Security number as the business identifier. However, there are disadvantages to this approach, namely the risk of liability.


How are LLCs taxed?
Unlike a corporation, LLCs have some flexibility in how they're taxed. Depending on how many members and the type of tax treatment the owner selects, the LLC can be taxed as either a corporation, partnership or as part of the owner's personal tax return (called a "disregarded entity"). By default, an LLC with two or more members are taxed as a partnership, unless they file an IRS Form 8832 to elect to be treated as a corporation. If the LLC has only one owner, it will be taxed as a sole proprietor, unless the owner files Form 8832. It's not necessary to decide which tax treatment until after your business is formed. You have up to 12 months to decide and can speak to an accountant if you need help making this decision.


What is a registered agent?
A registered agent (sometimes called a resident agent or statutory agent) is a person or business authorized to accept important legal documents on behalf of a business. States require businesses to provide the name of their registered agent at the time they form their business entity. While you can be your own registered agent, there are disadvantages. You have to be available during regular business hours and your information goes on the public record. If you miss a filing deadline, you risk being fined or shut down. Our registered agent service can ensure you receive important business documents, sort through junk mail and keep your information private.


Is a corporation right for me?
It depends on many factors. Get help deciding by answering a few questions here.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

Biltz serves as the company's president and chief executive officer.[3]
