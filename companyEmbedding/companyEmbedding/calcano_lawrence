Two Harbors Investment Corp.

                    Two Harbors Investment Corp. is a Maryland corporation focused on investing, financing and managing residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS) and related investments.

Our objective is to provide attractive risk-adjusted returns to our stockholders over the long-term, primarily through dividends and secondarily through capital appreciation. We intend to achieve this by constructing a well-balanced portfolio consisting primarily of RMBS, with a focus on managing various associated risks, including interest rate, prepayment, mortgage spread, financing, and credit risk. We focus on security selection and implement a relative value investment approach across various sectors within the residential mortgage market. Our target assets include:

    Agency RMBS, meaning RMBS whose principal and interest payments are guaranteed by the Government National Mortgage Association (or Ginnie Mae), the Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae) or the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac);
    Non-Agency RMBS, meaning RMBS that are not issued or guaranteed by Ginnie Mae, Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac; and
    Financial assets other than RMBS, comprising 5% to 10% of our portfolio.

We have elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust (REIT) for U.S. federal income tax purposes, which requires that we distribute at least 90% of our REIT income to our stockholders on an annual basis

A NOTE ON METHODOLOGY: The Midas List seeks to identify individuals who deploy venture capital to create wealth for their investors. Our ranking formula ignores the original amount invested in a deal (as it is often undisclosed), instead weighing most heavily the market capitalization of a venture-backed company on the close of its first day of trading or the purchase price in an acquisition. A lesser weight is given to the change in value of each investment since going public or being sold. Ranking also depends on a venture capitalist's (or lawyer's, banker's or recruiter's) length of involvement and influence with a startup. Companies must have gone public or been acquired after June 1995 to be considered, and they must be engaged in information technology or life sciences. Our results are based on extensive reporting and surveys sent to 1,000 professionals, including VCs, angels, lawyers, bankers, recruiters and limited partners. Special thanks go to Thomson Financial Venture Economics/National Venture Capital Association, Alternative Investor/Private Equity Analyst/VentureOne.

PRESS RELEASE
Foundation Medical Partners, a national healthcare venture capital investment firm, today announced that Lawrence Calcano has joined the team as a Venture Partner.  Mr. Calcano joins Foundation’s healthcare investment team in assessing and managing investments in the connected health and healthcare IT sectors.
Calcano has spent a significant portion of his career working with growth technology oriented companies from multiple vantage points, including as CEO, director, investor, and outside financial advisor.
Calcano was at Goldman Sachs for almost seventeen years, where he became a Partner in the Investment Banking Division and served as Co-Head or COO of the firm’s Technology Banking Group (“the Tech Group”) from 1997 to 2006, and Head of the firm’s East Coast Technology Group beginning in 1993. Calcano has deep domain knowledge and deal experience working with startup and growth companies in technology, the internet, and e-commerce.  
He has served as an adviser to the CEOs of many of the most exciting growth companies over the years and has worked on over $40 billion transactions of all types, including public and private financings as well as mergers and acquisitions. In addition, Calcano was named to the Forbes Midas List of the most influential people in venture capital in 2001 (the inaugural year), 2002, 2004, 2005 and 2006. Calcano has served on the Boards of Directors for several companies over the years including 800Flowers, Freemarkets, Capital Acquisition Corp, ECI, Pivot Point Software, and Bite Tech. 





Mr. Calcano is currently CEO of i1 Biometrics, a connected health company that is developing sensors, wireless connectivity, and data analytics for sports and military applications (a Foundation portfolio company). i1 Biometrics is a spinout of Bite Tech, Inc., a maker of athletic protective and performance oriented devices, where Calcano served as Chairman and CEO for two and a half years.  
“Lawrence brings experience in IT and deal structuring to Foundation,” said Andrew Firlik, Managing Partner of Foundation Medical Partners. “He has worked with some of the fastest growing companies in the past two decades and he knows how to help them succeed.”
Mr. Calcano joins the investment team at Foundation Medical Partners that includes partners Andrew Firlik, Lee Wrubel, Kevin Sharer, and Ted Laufik.  The firm actively manages over $200 million in venture capital targeted toward start-up and early-stage companies.  Foundation has remained exclusively focused on the healthcare technology market since the firm was founded in 2001, with a current market capitalization of its healthcare investments totaling approximately $2.0 billion.
