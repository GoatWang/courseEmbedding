Gabelli Funds Launches Gabelli Media Mogul NextShares






November 29, 2016 10:00 AM Eastern Standard Time



RYE, N.Y.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Gabelli Funds, LLC, a subsidiary of GAMCO Investors, Inc. (NYSE:GBL), 
      announced today that Gabelli Media Mogul NextShares (the “Fund”) would 
      list and commence trading on Nasdaq Stock Market LLC on December 1, 2016 
      under the symbol “MOGLC.” The Fund is the first member of the Gabelli 
      NextShares Trust offered under an agreement with NextShares Solutions 
      LLC, a subsidiary of Eaton Vance Corp. (NYSE:EV).
    

      The primary objective of the Fund is capital appreciation. Under normal 
      market conditions, the Fund will invest primarily in companies that were 
      spun-off from Liberty Media Corporation (“Liberty Media”) as constituted 
      in 2001, including companies formed through subsequent mergers of those 
      spin-offs and companies in which Liberty Media and its successors have 
      invested.
    

      Liberty Media separated from AT&T Corp. in August 2001, to form a 
      company that is an amalgamation of media and telecommunications related 
      assets. The company’s Chairman and largest shareholder since inception 
      has been Dr. John C. Malone. Since 2001, Liberty Media has engaged in a 
      series of spin-offs, split-offs, mergers and tracking stock issuances. 
      Tracking stocks are generally common stocks issued by a parent company 
      that track performance of a particular division of a company without 
      having claim on the assets of the division or the parent company. Media 
      Mogul NextShares current investable universe includes U.S. and non-U.S. 
      listed companies in the telecommunications, media, publishing, and 
      entertainment industries.
    

      Investors interested in purchasing the Fund should contact 1-800-GABELLI 
      (1-800-422-3554).
    

      NextShares, an innovative way to invest in actively managed strategies, 
      offer the potential for benchmark-beating returns by applying their 
      manager’s proprietary investment research. As exchange-traded products, 
      NextShares may offer cost and tax efficiencies that can enhance 
      shareholder returns. NextShares are expected to be offered by a range of 
      well-known asset managers and across fund asset classes. The first 
      NextShares funds began trading on the Nasdaq Stock Market LLC earlier 
      this year.
    

      GAMCO Investors, Inc., through its subsidiaries, manages private 
      advisory accounts (GAMCO Asset Management Inc.), mutual funds and 
      closed-end funds (Gabelli Funds, LLC). As of September 30, 2016, GAMCO 
      had $39.6 billion in equity assets under management.
    

THIS PRESS RELEASE IS NOT AN OFFER TO SELL THESE SECURITIES AND IS 
      NOT SOLICITING AN OFFER TO BUY THESE SECURITIES IN ANY STATE WHERE THE 
      OFFER OF SALE IS NOT PERMITTED.


      Commercial success also requires completion of enabling implementation 
      technology and acceptance by market participants, which cannot be 
      assured.
    

The information contained herein is provided for informational 
      purposes only, are not intended as investment or tax advice.


Shares of NextShares funds are normally bought and sold in the 
      secondary market through a broker, and may not be individually purchased 
      or redeemed from the fund. In the secondary market, buyers and sellers 
      transact with each other, rather than with the fund. These 
      transactions do not affect the fund or its investments. When a 
      NextShares fund does issue or redeem shares, the transactions are made 
      through designated authorized participants and are normally in kind when 
      practicable, meaning that the fund receives or delivers securities 
      rather than cash. By transacting in kind, a NextShares fund can 
      lower its trading costs and enhance fund tax efficiency by avoiding 
      forced sales of securities to meet redemptions. As 
      exchange-traded securities, NextShares can operate with low transfer 
      agency expenses by utilizing the same highly efficient share processing 
      system as used for exchange-listed stocks.


Market trading prices of NextShares are linked to the fund’s 
      next-computed net asset value (NAV) and will vary from NAV by a 
      market-determined premium or discount, which may be zero. Buyers 
      and seller of NextShares will not know the value of their purchases and 
      sales until after the fund’s NAV is determined at the end of the trading 
      day. Market trading prices may vary significantly from 
      anticipated levels. NextShares do not offer investors the 
      opportunity to buy and sell intraday based on current (versus 
      end-of-day) determinations of fund value. NextShares trade execution 
      prices will fluctuate based on changes in NAV. Although limit orders may 
      be used to control trading costs, they cannot be used to control or 
      limit trade execution prices. As a new type of fund, NextShares have a 
      limited operating history and may initially be available through a 
      limited number of brokers. There can be no guarantee that an 
      active trading market for NextShares will develop or be maintained, or 
      that their listing will continue unchanged. Buying and selling 
      NextShares may require payment of brokerage commissions and expose 
      transacting shareholders to other trading costs. Frequent trading may 
      detract from realized investment returns. The return on a shareholder’s 
      NextShares investment will be reduced if the shareholder sells shares at 
      a greater discount or narrower premium to NAV than he or she acquired 
      the shares. NextShares funds issue and redeem shares only in 
      specified creation unit quantities in transactions by or through 
      authorized participants. In such transactions, a fund issues and 
      redeems shares in exchange for the basket of securities, other 
      instruments and/or cash that the fund specifies each business day. The 
      basket is not intended to be representative of the fund’s current 
      portfolio positions and may vary significantly from current positions.


NextShares™ is a trademark of NextShares Solutions LLC. All 
      rights reserved.


      Creation units of Gabelli NextShares will be distributed by 
      G.distributors, LLC, an affiliate of Gabelli Funds, LLC, the investment 
      advisor to Gabelli NextShares.
    

All investments are subject to risks, including possible loss of 
      principal. Please consider the investment objectives, risk, 
      charges and expenses of Gabelli NextShares before investing. Please 
      carefully read a copy of the Gabelli NextShares prospectus or summary 
      prospectus before investing, which contains this and other information 
      about Gabelli NextShares; you can obtain a copy of the prospectus or 
      summary prospectus by calling 800 422-3554.
