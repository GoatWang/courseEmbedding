Historical KLIC Share Price vs. Net Cash per Share
 


 

 




 





 


NEW YORK, Dec. 1, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Breithorn Capital Management ("Breithorn"), a private investment manager and long term shareholder of Kulicke & Soffa Industries ("K&S" or the "Company") (Nasdaq:   KLIC) with beneficial ownership of approximately 1.2% of the Company's outstanding common stock announced that it has delivered a letter to the Company's Board of Directors. 
In the letter, Breithorn expressed that it believes K&S is deeply undervalued, and that there are clear opportunities for the Company to unlock significant value for shareholders.
Breithorn also stated that it believes the Company should not make additional acquisitions and instead should immediately focus on further share repurchases. 
The full text of the letter follows:
1 December 2015
Garrett E. Pierce, Chairman
Kulicke and Soffa Industries, Inc.
23A Serangoon North Avenue 5, #01-01
K&S Corporate Headquarters
Singapore 554369
Dear Members of the Board:
Breithorn Capital Management ("Breithorn") beneficially owns approximately 1.2% of the outstanding shares of Kulicke & Soffa Industries, Inc. ("K&S" or the "Company"). Breithorn is a value-oriented investment manager with a long-term investment horizon, and has been a shareholder of K&S since April 2013.
We have conducted extensive research on K&S and the markets in which it competes, and we appreciate the time and cooperation of the K&S management team during the process. We have concluded that the Company's stock trades at a deep discount to its intrinsic value. We believe this is due in part to misconceptions by investors regarding the Company's core wire bonding business and to lack of appreciation for the Company's growth potential in advanced packaging. However, we suspect that investors are also applying a valuation discount due to a lack of confidence in the ability of management and the Board of Directors ("Board") to allocate capital in an optimal manner. In this regard, we believe a clear opportunity exists within the Company's control to unlock significant shareholder value. 
In our opinion, K&S is a very attractive business, given its dominant market share in wire bonding equipment and high historical returns on invested capital over the cycle. As we shared in our presentation, dated October 27, 2015 (www.breithorn.com), we estimate the Company currently has normalized earnings power of approximately $1.00 per share. In addition, we think it has significant growth potential in the advanced packaging market. Specifically, we believe the Company's new thermo-compression products could ultimately generate an incremental $0.50 of earnings per share. 
Separately, K&S has a massively overcapitalized balance sheet. As of the fiscal year ended October 3, 2015, the Company held $482 million of net cash. Management estimates that the Company requires an operating cash balance of only $75 million to run the business and manage down-cycles. This implies that the Company holds excess cash of $407 million, or $5.75 per share, which amounts to 49% of its current market capitalization.
We believe K&S stock is currently trading far below its intrinsic value. After subtracting $5.75 per share of excess cash from the stock price of $11.81, K&S trades at a mere 6.1x our normalized earnings power estimate for the existing business, and 4.0x our estimated earnings power including growth from thermo-compression. Given the high quality of this business, we believe the fair value for K&S stock is nearly double its current price.
K&S stock has a depressed valuation for several reasons. First, we believe there is an unfounded fear that the Company's core business is in secular decline. The concern is that wire bonding, the dominant interconnection technology used in semiconductor packaging for over 50 years, will be supplanted by newer alternatives such as "flip chip" bonding. We see little evidence that wire bonding is in decline. Wire bonding continues to grow on an absolute basis and maintains a dominant unit market share of roughly 80%, due to significant cost advantages which we expect will persist in the future. Accordingly, we are convinced that the Company's recently reported year-over-year decline in wire bonding equipment sales is cyclical rather than secular.
Second, we believe the Company's stock price does not reflect its growth opportunity in advanced packaging.  The Company has established a broad foothold in the advanced packaging and advanced surface mount technology markets, which could enable growth in excess of the semiconductor capital equipment market. Furthermore, K&S has developed a next generation thermo-compression bonder that compares favorably to the competition, based on our research. Together, we believe these initiatives have the potential to significantly expand the Company's earnings power and mitigate the risk of market share loss in the wire bonding business.  
Third, we believe the stock price does not adequately reflect the value of the Company's excess cash. In our opinion, this is due to a pervasive fear that management will either squander this cash on poor acquisitions or indefinitely hoard cash without good reason. As the chart below illustrates, over the last 10 years the Company's share price has exhibited only modest appreciation, despite significant earnings power improvement and dramatic cash accumulation. Management deserves credit for excellent operational execution during this period, as K&S market share in wire bonding has increased and profit margins have expanded. In contrast, the Company's approach to capital allocation has left much to be desired.

Regarding capital allocation, management has repeatedly expressed that its primary focus is on making acquisitions for reasons including diversification. We strongly disagree with this approach, given the risk of capital misallocation and lack of attractive targets. Moreover, we do not believe that management's acquisition track record inspires confidence. While it is too early to definitively assess the recent $98 million acquisition of Assembléon Netherlands BV ("Assembléon"), early results are not encouraging. The post-transaction decline in Assembléon's revenue run-rate suggests that this acquisition was poorly timed, and that stated earnings accretion and revenue growth goals will not be achieved. If management is intent on diversifying the business, we see ample opportunity to do so through organic growth of the Company's broad product line.
Given the current valuation of K&S, we think it is extremely unlikely that any acquisition could generate a return comparable to repurchasing the Company's depressed shares, and we struggle to understand why management and the Board have not acted more aggressively to unlock value for shareholders by doing so. Perhaps if management and the Board owned more than a trivial amount of the Company's stock, they would be better aligned with the interests of shareholders who have endured subpar returns for years.
We believe further large share repurchases would be in the best interest of shareholders. In our view, K&S has the capacity to repurchase $250 million in stock without impairing its financial position or strategic flexibility. To avoid repatriation taxes on foreign cash, repurchases could be funded with debt raised in the U.S. As we illustrated in our presentation, we believe that at the current share price this would result in immediate earnings accretion and stock price appreciation without assuming any multiple expansion. Separately, we believe multiple expansion is likely once management demonstrates improved capital allocation discipline. 
Another option for the Board to consider is a sale of the Company to a strategic buyer with foreign operations not subject to repatriation taxes, who can pay full value for the Company's cash. This could achieve management's goal of diversification in a more shareholder-friendly manner, provided that an acquirer pays a very large premium to the current share price to offer fair value to existing shareholders. We anticipate K&S will become an increasingly attractive acquisition candidate as its new advanced packaging products gain traction. 
We look forward to hearing back from management and the Board regarding their plan to unlock shareholder value in K&S.
Sincerely,
Breithorn Capital Management LLC

Breithorn Urges Kulicke & Soffa To Explore Strategic Alternatives
Sep 28 16
Breithorn Capital Management LLC believes Kulicke and Soffa Industries, Inc. (NasdaqGS:KLIC) should immediately hire advisors to evaluate strategic alternatives for the business to address persistent undervaluation of stock.


Breithorn Urges Kulicke To Mull Options
Dec 1 15
Breithorn Capital Management LLC has urged the Noard of Kulicke and Soffa Industries, Inc. (NasdaqGS:KLIC) to consider options. Breithorn wrote a letter to the Board. According to Breithorn, the options for the company are share repurchases. Another option for the Board to consider is a sale of the Company to a strategic buyer with foreign operations not subject to repatriation taxes, who can pay full value for the Company's cash. This could achieve management's goal of diversification in a more shareholder-friendly manner, provided that an acquirer pays a very large premium to the current share price to offer fair value to existing shareholders. We anticipate K&S will become an increasingly attractive acquisition candidate as its new advanced packaging products gain traction.

Hedging Strategies

Simple Short Exposure. This strategy effectively shorts the S&P 500 by
        buying shares in the S&P 500 Short ETF.
        Simple Hedging will assume that 100%
        of the backtest's invested principal is always in the backtest's long positions.

        For example, if you choose a 25% hedging rate, then for a $10,000 portfolio,
        you will be long $10,000 and have a $2,500 short on the S&P 500.
        The short position will adjust each rebalancing period to match 25% of the total portfolio.
        Any gains/losses from the short are added to the overall available capital for the long positions in the
        portfolio.
      

Moving Average Hedge.  With this strategy, your portfolio will be hedged
        by shorting the S&P 500 whenever your long portfolio's performance drops below the monthly moving average.
        So if you set a 25% hedge, 25% of your long portfolio will be sold and the funds reallocated to the short
        whenever the hedge is in effect.
        Once your long portfolio performance goes back over the moving average, the short hedge will be removed
        and the funds from the short will be reallocated to your long positions.
      

        When hedging strategies are being used, backtests can only go back as far as 2006.  This is the date
        the S&P 500 Short ETF first appeared.

Stock Sell Buffer

      You can optionally include a stock sell buffer in your backtesting model.
      It works by keeping a stock in your portfolio even when it would otherwise drop out
      during rebalancing as long as it remains within your sell buffer threshold.
      For example, you are backtesting with the top 20 stocks each quarter and set a sell buffer of 50.
      In the first quarter, AAPL is one of the top 20 stocks and is included in the portfolio.
      In quarter 2, AAPL drops down to number 25. Without the sell buffer, AAPL would drop out
      for that quarter, but since it is still within the sell buffer threshold of 50,
      it will remain in the portfolio.
      Your portfolio size remains the same. The stocks that would have fallen out stay in and the
      stocks that would otherwise have been added stay out. Using the sell buffer may
      help produce a lower turnover rate.
    

      Sell Buffer Size (must be greater than # of holdings in portfolio to work):
      
No sell buffer

Rebalancing Frequency

      By default backtester rebalances quarterly using new 13F filing data. You can
      adjust the rebalancing frequency using the dropdown below. Reasons for
      changing the frequency include lower turnover and possible tax advantages
      by keeping stocks at least one year before selling.
    


        Do not rebalance after each quarter

or rebalance:
        
Every quarter (default)
 Every other quarter
 Once a year
