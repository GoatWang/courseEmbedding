							Propane Council Partners With Jenna Bush Hager And Donates $30,000 to Schools Driving Propane Buses					



		
		School buses already make up the largest share of mass transportation in the U.S. and are the safest mode of transportation to and from school. This year, however, the yellow bus is getting an upgrade. More than 500,000 students will ride a school bus powered by the alternative fuel propane this back-to-school season.
“Diesel has long been the standard in school transportation, but for districts that want to reduce harmful emissions, save money and create a safer, healthier ride, propane is an excellent alternative,” said Roy Willis, Propane Education & Research Council president and CEO.
Recognizing these benefits, schools across 45 states – a total of more than 7,000 buses – have transitioned to propane. The trend prompted PERC to start a campaign to teach communities about the benefits of propane-powered transportation. The Council is partnering with journalist and former teacher Jenna Bush Hager and the nonprofit Adopt a Classroom to donate more than $30,000 to teachers at schools adopting propane buses.“It’s clear when you talk to school administrators and transportation departments that they are saving more than just dollars and cents by going with propane buses,” said Hager. “The switch is improving their school as a whole and giving them the opportunity to invest in more teachers or school programs.”The Propane Education & Research Council’s donation will benefit teachers at seven schools this fall, including Lilla G. Frederick Pilot Middle School in Massachusetts; Kyrene Monte Vista in Arizona; Broward Education Foundation in Florida; Wilkes Elementary in Oregon; Five Star Education Foundation in Colorado; St. Francis Elementary in Minnesota; and Friendswood Jr. High in Texas.Donations began today with an event at Lilla G. Frederick Pilot Middle School in Boston. Hager surprised teachers at the school and announced that they would receive a total of $10,000 from PERC to purchase supplies for their classrooms. Boston Public Schools is the first district in the city to switch from diesel to propane buses.The transition from diesel to propane buses has been reported in 20 of the top 25 designated market areas, and four of the 10 largest school districts in the country are using them. Among the health and safety advantages of propane buses is that they are quieter than diesel and they reduce exposure to diesel exhaust, which the World Health Organization classifies as a carcinogen.“As a former teacher and parent, I know that the school day begins and ends on the bus,” Hager said. “When we give our kids a safer, healthier start to the day, it can improve their entire experience in the classroom and at home, too.”For more information on propane school buses, including bus safety tips for parents and kids courtesy of the National Association of Pupil Transportation, visit BetterOurBuses.com. To donate to teachers in your local community, visit AdoptAClassroom.org.

							St. Francis Elementary School Makes Commitment to Cleaner Air with CleanFUEL USA and Thomas Built Propane School Buses					



		
		CleanFUEL USA took part in a check presentation Monday evening for St. Francis Elementary School in St. Francis, Minnesota. The Propane Education & Research Council donated $2,500 to the school in recognition of its effort to improve students’ health and safety by adopting a propane-powered bus fleet. The donation is part of PERC’s new campaign to educate consumers about the benefits of transitioning away from diesel.

Of the 50 total buses in their fleet, St. Francis Elementary boasts 41 propane powered Thomas Built Saf-T-Liner C2 units in their fleet. The buses are equipped with Liquid Propane Injection (LPI) systems by CleanFUEL USA.“St. Francis made the choice to focus on cleaner air for their students and staff, and we are proud to play a part in that commitment,” said Curtis Donaldson, founder and managing director for CleanFUEL USA. Donaldson attended the school board meeting, where the check was presented, along with local representatives from Thomas Built, American Lung Association and the Minnesota Propane Gas Association.“Our drivers say they’re quieter to the point that you can’t even hear them running,” said Dean Krause, St. Francis’ transportation director. “They’re that quiet. When the kids don’t have to yell over the loud diesel buses, they tend to talk quieter and the whole noise level is reduced.”In addition to noise reduction and fuel savings, St. Francis is able to save a substantial amount of money – about $10,000 annually – on heating costs for their diesel engines. The propane buses do not have any issues “starting right up in 30 below — every day.”For more information on propane school buses, including bus safety tips for parents and kids courtesy of the National Association of Pupil Transportation, visit BetterOurBuses.com.

This acquisition expands MFA Oil’s presence in the east-central Kansas market.

The purchase includes 10 propane plants, eight refined fuel plants, five unattended fueling locations and bulk and packaged lubricants business.“We are constantly exploring opportunities to grow our business and this purchase greatly enhances our presence in Kansas,” says Don Smith, MFA Oil director of mergers and acquisitions. “We look forward to integrating the Lybarger Oil business into our operations. It is a great cultural and strategic fit for us.”The company previously announced the acquisitions of Cunningham Propane of West Helena, AR; Faughn Oil Company of Campbell, MO; Alexander Propane of Sullivan, MO; Brown Propane Gas, Inc. of Neosho, MO; All Propane of Murfreesboro, TN; Home Service Oil of Poplar Bluff, MO; New Hampton Propane of New Hampton, MO; Georgia LP Gas Co. of Manchester, GA; PB’s Propane of West Plains, MO; and Basin Propane Systems of Vernal, UT.MFA Oil plans to continue evaluating acquisition opportunities in its existing market area and other states where it can expand its footprint. MFA Oil Company supplies fuels, lubricants and propane to customers in Missouri, Arkansas, Colorado, Georgia, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Nebraska, Oklahoma, North Carolina, Tennessee, Utah and Wyoming.

							ROUSH CleanTech Extends Range of F-450 Autogas Fuel Tank					



		
		An extended range fuel tank for the Ford E-450 chassis has been developed by ROUSH CleanTech. Transit agencies can now make fewer trips to the pump with this new autogas tank that holds 56 percent more fuel than the typical 41-usable gallon tank option. “We listened to our paratransit customers who wanted the Ford E-450 chassis, yet also needed more autogas fuel capacity,” said Todd Mouw, vice president of sales and marketing. “With this extended range fuel tank, we offer the longest driving range for this model — plus an extended warranty for those customers.”

Built on Ford’s 6.8-liter V10 engine, the Ford E-450 with extended range fuel system comes with an extended 5-year, 100,000-mile warranty exclusively for the transit industry. Flint Mass Transportation Authority (FMTA) has incorporated 101 standard range tank E-450s since 2011. Historically, propane autogas costs up to 40 percent less than gasoline and 50 percent less than diesel. The FMTA saves about $70,000 per vehicle in fuel and maintenance during the normal lifecycle of 10 years and 350,000 miles, compared to conventionally fueled counterparts. It is estimated that the extended range shuttle emits 91,000 fewer pounds of carbon dioxide over its lifetime compared to conventionally fueled counterparts. ROUSH CleanTech Ford E-450s are California Air Resources Board and Environmental Protection Agency compliant and have completed Federal Transit Administration’s New Model Bus Testing Program (“Altoona Testing”). Altoona-tested vehicles can be purchased using a transit agency’s FTA funds.
