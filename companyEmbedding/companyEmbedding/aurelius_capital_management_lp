The USPTO makes this data available for search by the public so that individuals can locate ownership information for intellectual property, much the same way a county might make real estate property ownership information available.

You may also contact Trademarkia to make a request for the removal of your personally identifiable information or trademark data.  Such requests must be made in writing and will be subject to verification of ownership.  This policy allows verified trademark owners to specify: (A) that their identifiable information be masked, or (B) that their trademark pages permanently deleted from Trademarkia.com.  
                                                Requests may be made directly to customer.service@trademarkia.com and every effort will be made to honor them within 48 hours.

Co-Operative Bank Is Reportedly Close To Abandoning Its Search For A Buyer
Apr 30 17
Co-operative Bank plc is reportedly close to abandoning its search for a buyer and moving towards a second painful financial restructuring instead. The Co-operative Bank is expected to hire advisers from Houlihan Lokey to oversee a new rescue effort. It would allow existing backers, such as Aurelius Capital Management, LP and Silver Point Capital L.P., to plough more cash into the bank. City sources said KKR & Co. L.P. (NYSE:KKR), Oaktree Capital Management, L.P. and Apollo Global Management, LLC (NYSE:APO) were also considering buying equity.

Background Information:


Aurelius Capital Management LP »
Aurelius Capital Management's (ACM) funds seek to maximize returns while preserving capital and minimizing correlation with the overall financial markets. The funds are generally referred to as distressed credit and event driven funds. The funds' investments may be concentrated in one or more of the following categories: entities that are, or face the prospect of becoming, financially stressed or distressed; entities undergoing, or facing the prospect of undergoing, significant corporate events; investments that may be affected by material legal disputes; companies facing material regulatory developments; and capital structure arbitrage. The funds may invest in all manner of instruments and obligations, including equity and debt securities, bank debt, trade debt, options, contractual and litigation claims, market and sector indices and derivatives. The funds may invest anywhere in the world, but ACM has a strong preference for countries having reliable legal systems and markets.
