Item Description: iUniverse, United States, 2004. Paperback. Book Condition: New. Language: English . Brand New Book ***** Print on Demand *****.Candid, astonishing, and commanding your attention, Journey of Discovery reveals things hidden in the life of a writer. Divulging secrets from the diary of a poet, Paula Denise Johnson once again helps us to understand that a writer does not just write for the sake of writing, but to convey the hidden world to us, the best way they know how. Some do this through novels, short stories, and songs, but she through the art of poetry conveys her most honest and intimate thoughts to us. The poems Hidden Realm and Loving Me are both reflections of a young woman s struggle to find true love within herself. Through the bold and realistic poems, Easily Led and No Love, she explains how others explore themselves through other people without, first, taking time to love themselves. The romantic, sensual and erotic poems, Paradisacial Xperience and Loving This Man express notions of love by Paula Denise Johnson that are alluring, but surprising. This is an insightful look at the diary of a poet.  Bookseller Inventory # AAV9780595314027

Item Description: iUniverse, United States, 2012. Paperback. Book Condition: New. Language: English . Brand New Book ***** Print on Demand *****.A Writer and A Fighter by Paula Denise Johnson is a collection of poems that pierce the heart and cause reflection and self evaluation. The writer pours out her soul throughout the pages of this book, deftly handling issues from abortion and baby momma drama to love for God and fufilling one s purpose. Her work speaks of experience from the school of hard knocks, yet is inspiring rather than bitter. This work of art is a portrait of resilience. With some of the same compassion, strength and sadness as poet, Maya Angelou, Johnson s writing leaps from the pages and caresses readers hearts and moves one to tears. Her readers are sure to appreciate her sincerity and determination. Anyone who has ever struggled in life will find something that resonates within their spirit. Johnson gives readers a glimpse of her inner psyche as she demonstrates unequivocally her true calling. Furthermore, through her own journey of self-discovery, she encourages readers to find their true selves and fulfill their own calling. What Mary J. Blige is to music, Paula Denise Johnson is to poetry.  Bookseller Inventory # AAV9781475933345

About This Designer





Born and raised in Manhattan, the daughter of archaeologists, Ulla Johnson honed her signature style between the streets of New York and the far-flung destinations of their family travels. Her eponymous line, founded in 2000 just after her graduation from university, immediately caught the attention of the fashion press. The Ulla Johnson label has become synonymous with custom prints, intricate embroideries, and fine tailoring, all of which have earned her a loyal and global customer base.
