About Wealthminder



Wealthminder was created for one simple reason:
To help people get the financial assistance they need to achieve their long-term financial goals.


Wealthminder is a database of every Investment Advisor Representative in the country.
We work hard to collect and provide you the information you need to find a financial advisor who’s right for you.


If you are looking for a specific financial advisor and you can’t find them on Wealthminder,
it’s likely that they are either exclusively a broker or are unlicensed - please
contact us
and we’ll try to help!



Finding a Financial Advisor through Wealthminder



Historically finding and hiring a financial advisor was hard.
Wealthminder was built to make the process much easier.


The best way to use Wealthminder is to take advantage of our free proposal system.
All you have to do is take a few minutes of your time to describe your situation and the assistance you are looking for.


Wealthminder then sends your request to our network of
prescreened financial advisors.
If a financial advisor is interested in your business, they will submit a proposal to you.


You review the proposals you receive and decide if you’d like to have a follow-up call with one or more of the financial advisors.


Throughout the process, you maintain control. We only share your contact information with a financial advisor once you ask for an introduction.

Teacher Retirement System of Texas


                  The Teacher Retirement System of Texas (TRS) employs an investment strategy which focuses on diversification and risk control. Investments are balanced to achieve attractive long-term returns that are required to fund TRS benefits and obligations. Investment decisions are based on asset allocation, which is determined after consideration of expected returns for asset classes with the context of risk tolerance for the fund. TRS uses both passive and active investing styles. Their approach tracks the performance of key benchmarks and provides the opportunity to add value through active portfolios.TRS' Active Core Equity investment strategy seeks to replicate closely the characteristics of the benchmarks of the various asset classes while seeking returns that exceed those of the benchmarks. The strategy employs risk control similar to passive or index management but allows for generation of excess return associated with active management. TRS' style is a disciplined, balanced approach with a strong quantitative foundation that focuses on long-term returns and objectives rather than on short-term market movements. The process includes frequent updating of statistical risk and return models constructed by TRS' investment staff. These models incorporate economic conditions, interest rate changes and industry factors. Equity portfolios, which typically comprise the majority of the total fund, seek to add value through security selection that focuses on attractive industries.
