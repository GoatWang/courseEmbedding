Lucy Lee Helm, General Counsel, Starbucks Coffee Company
Lucy Helm, Starbucks general counsel, discusses her views on diversity, community service and mentorship of women in law







By Susan MarkelFebruary 26, 2015


























Lucy Lee Helm, General Counsel, Starbucks Coffee Company



Lucy Helm didn’t know whether she would even like Seattle when she arrived there from Louisville, Kentucky, 24 years ago. But she knew was that she was ready for change in her life and a new challenge in her career. Although she began her legal career as a litigator in a law firm, she had always maintained a strong commitment to her community and incorporated volunteerism into all aspects of her life, notably through her advocacy for people with disabilities.
Since taking on the role of executive vice president, general counsel, and secretary of Starbucks global Law & Corporate Affairs department — which includes supervising a staff of over 200 legal and compliance professionals — Lucy still gives her time and energy to nonprofit and community causes, including serving as a board member of the global humanitarian and development agency, Mercy Corps.
