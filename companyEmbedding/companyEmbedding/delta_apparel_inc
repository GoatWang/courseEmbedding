Company Overview


Delta Apparel, Inc. specializes in the design, merchandising, sales, and marketing of a variety of lifestyle branded activewear, apparel, and headwear for men, women, juniors, youth and children at a wide range of price points. Delta became an independent public company in July of 2000.  At that time, our business was solely based on the sale of unembellished basic tees. Since then, we have become a diversified branded apparel company through the completion of several acquisitions, which added well-recognized brands and licensed properties to our portfolio, expanded our product offerings and broadened our distribution channels and customer base.
Our products are sold in all distribution tiers and store types, including specialty stores, boutiques, department stores, mid-tier, and mass chains. From a niche distribution standpoint, we also have strong distribution at college bookstores, to the U.S. military and with independent screen printers.  Through Art Gun, we also provide shoppers a “virtual art studio” to create customized graphics on apparel products.  Our direct-to-consumer business is a key growth area for us and our products are available for sale at www.soffe.com, www.saltlife.com, www.coastapparel.com and www.deltaapparel.com. We have a Salt Life® flagship retail store in Jacksonville Beach, the home of the Salt Life brand, and other retail outlet stores featuring our Soffe® products.  We believe this diversified distribution allows us to capitalize on our strengths to provide casual activewear and headwear to consumers purchasing from all types of retailers.
We design and internally manufacture the majority of our products, which allows us to offer a high degree of consistency and quality controls as well as leverage scale efficiencies. One of our strengths is the speed in which we can reach the market from design to delivery. We have manufacturing operations located in the United States, El Salvador, Honduras, and Mexico, and use domestic and foreign contractors as additional sources of production. Our distribution facilities are strategically located throughout the United States to better serve our customers with same-day shipping on our catalog products and weekly replenishments for retailers. 
We were incorporated in Georgia in 1999 and our principal executive offices are located at 322 South Main Street, Greenville, South Carolina 29601 (telephone number: 864-232-5200).  Our common stock trades on the NYSE MKT under the symbol “DLA”.

The forward-looking statements in this document are based on Delta Apparels
expectations and are necessarily dependent upon assumptions, estimates and data

results to differ materially from those set forth in or implied by the
forward-looking statements. Many of these risks and uncertainties are described
under the subheading Risk Factors below and are beyond Delta Apparels
control. Accordingly, any forward-looking statements do not purport to be

Apparel, Inc., together with its subsidiaries.

OVERVIEW

Delta Apparel, Inc. (Delta Apparel or the Company) is a vertically
integrated manufacturer and marketer of high quality knit apparel. The Company
specializes in selling undecorated T-shirts, golf shirts and activewear tops
directly to screen printers and other retail accounts. In addition, the
Company sells its products to distributors and private label accounts.

Delta Apparel is a Georgia corporation with its principal executive offices
located at 2750 Premiere Parkway, Suite 100, Duluth, Georgia 30097 (telephone
number: 678-775-6900). The Companys common stock trades on the American Stock
Exchange under the symbol DLA.

Delta Apparel was incorporated on December 10, 1999 as an indirect wholly-owned
subsidiary of Delta Woodside Industries, Inc. (Delta Woodside). On June 30,
2000, Delta Woodside distributed all of the outstanding shares of Delta Apparel
to the shareholders of Delta Woodside. Prior to May 2000, the business of the
Company was conducted by the Delta Apparel Company division of various
subsidiaries of Delta Woodside. In May 2000, Delta Woodside reorganized its
subsidiaries and divisions, and all of the assets and operations of the Delta
Apparel Company division were transferred to the Company or its subsidiaries,
and the Company became a direct wholly-owned subsidiary of Delta Woodside.

PRODUCTS

Delta Apparel markets high quality knit apparel garments for the entire family.
The Companys products are marketed under the Delta Pro-Weight, Delta Magnum
Weight, and Quail Hollow® Sportswear brand names. Delta Apparels product lines
include T-shirts, golf shirts and activewear tops.

DELTA PRO-WEIGHT: The Pro-Weight line represents a variety of 5.5 oz 100%
cotton silhouettes. Short sleeve, long sleeve and Baseball Practice tees are
available in both youth and adult sizes in a variety of colors. Specialty
items that are also available for adults include pocket tees, tank tops,
sleeveless tees, Pigment-Dyed tees, and a wide color selection of Ringer tees.

DELTA MAGNUM WEIGHT: The Magnum Weight line is designed to give the customer a
variety of silhouettes in a heavier 6.1oz, 100% cotton fabric. Programs in
this category provide a consistent quality of short sleeve and long sleeve
products in a wide range of colors, available from juvenile to adult sizes, up
to 5X.

Table of Contents
QUAIL HOLLOW®: The Quail Hollow® line includes adult golf shirts, ladies tees
and junior tees. The ladies and juniors programs feature an assortment of
styles developed specifically for misses, plus sizes and young juniors. Adult
golf shirts are offered in heavy weight 100% cotton jersey styles with fashion
trims, or in solid color ringspun pique.

MARKETING

Delta Apparels marketing is performed primarily by employed sales personnel
located throughout the country. Delta Apparel also utilizes independent sales
representatives. Sales personnel call directly on the retail marketplace,
contacting screen printing companies, distributors and mass marketers.

Approximately 72% of Delta Apparels fiscal 2003 sales were to screen printers
and other direct customers, approximately 13% were to distributors, with the
balance to private label accounts. In fiscal year 2003, the Company increased
its sales personnel by over 30% in its continued focus on selling directly to
screen printers and other direct customers. As a growing percentage of the
Companys sale of goods are direct, backlog order levels no longer give a
general indication of future sales. Generally, sales to screen printers and
distributors are driven by the availability of competitive products and price,
while sales in the private label business are characterized by slightly higher
customer loyalty.

The Company currently services over 1,800 customers. No single customer
accounted for more than 10% of Delta Apparels sales in fiscal year 2003, 2002
or 2001. Part of Delta Apparels strategy is not to become dependent on any
single customer.

The majority of the Companys knit apparel products are produced based on
forecasts to permit quick shipment and to level production schedules. Special
knit apparel products and private label knit apparel styles are generally made
only to order. Some customers place multi-month orders and request shipment at
their discretion. The Company offers same-day shipping and uses third party
carriers to ship products to its customers.

Delta Apparels sales reflect some seasonality, with sales during the first and
fourth fiscal quarters generally being the highest, and sales during the second
fiscal quarter generally being the lowest. The apparel industry is
characterized by rapid shifts in fashion, consumer demand and competitive
pressures, resulting in both price and demand volatility. The demand for any
particular product varies from time to time based largely upon changes in
consumer preferences and general economic conditions affecting the apparel
industry, such as consumer expenditures for non-durable goods.

MANUFACTURING

As a vertically integrated operation, the Company converts raw fibers into
finished apparel utilizing company-owned and leased facilities. When demand
exceeds production capacity or when it is cost effective to do so, the Company
uses outside contractors and general suppliers for textile and sewing
production.

Delta Apparel spins the majority of its yarn at its modern facility in
Edgefield, South Carolina. The Company knits, dyes, finishes and cuts its
fabric in company-owned plants located in Maiden, North Carolina and Fayette,
Alabama. Delta Apparel currently sews most of its garments in two leased
facilities in San Pedro Sula, Honduras and one leased facility in Campeche,
Mexico. At the 2003, 2002 and 2001 fiscal year ends, Delta Apparels
long-lived assets in Honduras and Mexico collectively comprised 8.5%, 7.7% and
7.6%, respectively, of Delta Apparels total net property, plant and equipment.
In addition to its leased sewing facilities, during fiscal year 2003 the
Company used outside contractors located in the Caribbean basin to sew
approximately 33% of the Companys products. Outside sewing contractors will
provide approximately 30% to 40% of the Companys total sewing needs for fiscal
year 2004. Delta Apparel has distribution centers located in Knoxville,
Tennessee and Buena Park, California. In February 2003, the Company opened a
distribution center in Miami, Florida. The Florida distribution center is
expected to ship in excess of one million dozen garments during fiscal year
2004. The Company is not planning on adding any additional distribution
centers during fiscal year 2004.

RAW MATERIALS

Delta Apparels principal raw material is cotton, which is acquired from
several suppliers. In fiscal 2004 Delta Apparel expects to use over 45 million
pounds of cotton in its manufacture of yarn. Delta Apparel fixes the price on
its expected cotton requirements based upon its forecast of future cotton
prices. The Company uses derivatives, including cotton option contracts, to
manage its exposure to movements in cotton market prices. The Company has not
designated its options as hedge instruments upon inception, and therefore
changes in the fair market value are marked to market. Delta Apparel believes
that it will be competitive with other companies in the United States apparel
industry when the cotton purchased for

3



Table of Contents
future use is put into production. To the extent that cotton prices decrease
before Delta Apparel uses these future purchases or to the extent that cotton
prices increase and Delta Apparel has not provided for its requirements with
fixed price contracts, the Company could be materially and adversely affected,
as there can be no assurance that it would be able to pass along its own
relatively higher costs to its customers.

BUSINESS STRATEGY

Delta Apparels mission is to grow sales and increase earnings by providing its
customers with the best value with respect to the products it manufactures.
Set forth below are key components of the Companys current business strategy
to pursue this objective:

MAINTAIN LOW-COST VERTICALLY-INTEGRATED MANUFACTURING OPERATIONS. The Company
is a vertically integrated manufacturer that spins, knits, bleaches, dyes,
finishes, cuts and sews its products at its manufacturing facilities. The
Company believes this reduces costs, allows for efficient production and
provides for consistent, high quality products. Delta Apparel continues to
use its automated textile manufacturing facilities in the United States, but
has moved all its sewing operations offshore to take advantage of the favorable
wage differentials. In April 2002, the Company purchased an additional textile
facility in Fayette, Alabama. The Fayette plant produced over 20% of Delta
Apparels textile production in fiscal year 2003. During fiscal year 2004 the
Company will be increasing its focus on cost reductions to continue to improve
its profitability.

PROVIDE EXCELLENT CUSTOMER SERVICE. The Company believes that providing
excellent customer service with respect to rapid and accurate delivery,
customer inventory needs and order monitoring is essential. In June 2001, the
Company opened its West Coast Sales and Distribution Center in order to provide
better service to its West Coast customers. In February 2003, the Company
opened a distribution center in Miami, Florida. The Florida distribution
center allowed Delta Apparel to expand its 24 to 48 hour delivery capability to
a new group of customers. Delta Apparel can cost-effectively offer delivery of
its products to approximately 90% of the continental United States population
in one to two days under normal conditions.

Delta Apparel also offers a customer-friendly Internet site. The site provides
real-time information in an easy to use format so customers will have the
information they need to run their business more efficiently. Customers can
now track the status of their order, receive emails confirming the shipment of
their order and check the availability of inventory prior to placing an order.
During fiscal year 2003 the Companys Internet site was updated to allow new
customers to open an account on the Internet and purchase products with credit
card payments. The Company believes that its knowledgeable phone-based
customer service representatives, along with the Internet site, make its total
customer service offering among the most advanced and convenient in the
industry.

BALANCE THE CUSTOMER AND PRODUCT MIX. The Company believes that a balanced mix
of customers and products is essential to its success. The Company has
continued to focus its sales efforts on direct customers, increasing the sales
to direct customers to 72% of total sales in fiscal 2003. In addition, Delta
Apparel is focusing on shifting the product mix to higher margin items. This
includes manufacturing more colored products and expanding the product line
into more specialized shirts. During fiscal year 2003, the Company continued
to increase its sales of colored products to 59% of catalog sales. In
addition, the Company introduced new specialty products, including the
sleeveless tee and pigment-dyed tee. Delta Apparels specialty tees continued
to generate good margins and helped offset declining margins on basic tees.

FOCUS ON INVENTORY AND ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE. Delta Apparel continues to focus
on the management of inventory and accounts receivable in order to minimize its
overall risk and capital investment. During fiscal year 2003, the Company
increased its inventory levels to support its new distribution center and in
anticipation of continued sales growth. During fiscal year 2004, the Company
will continue to monitor its inventory levels to maintain the correct mix and
levels of inventory for its anticipated sales. The Company expects inventory
levels in fiscal year 2004 will be similar to the inventory levels maintained
in fiscal year 2003. Delta Apparel will also closely monitor its average
payment terms to customers in order to limit its days sales outstanding.

COMPETITION

Delta Apparel competes with many United States and Canadian branded and private
label manufacturers of knit apparel, some of which are larger in size and have
greater financial resources than Delta Apparel. Competition in the activewear
apparel industry is generally based upon price, service, delivery time, quality
and flexibility, with the relative importance of each factor depending upon the
needs of particular customers and the specific product offering. Delta
Apparels strategy is to provide the best value to its customers. Favorable
competitive aspects of Delta Apparels business are the relatively high

4



Table of Contents
quality of its products, its state of the art information systems and its
flexibility and process control, which leads to product consistency. Delta
Apparels primary relative competitive disadvantage is that its brand names are
not as well known as the brand names of its largest competitors, such as
Gildan®, Hanes® and Russell®.

EMPLOYEES

At June 28, 2003, the Company, including its offshore subsidiaries, had
approximately 3,200 full time employees. Delta Apparels employees are not
represented by unions and the Company believes that its relations with its
employees are good.

ENVIRONMENTAL AND REGULATORY MATTERS

Delta Apparel is subject to various federal, state and local environmental laws
and regulations concerning, among other things, wastewater discharges, storm
water flows, air emissions and solid waste disposal. Delta Apparels plants
generate very small quantities of hazardous waste, which are either recycled or
disposed of off-site. Most of its plants are required to possess one or more
discharge permits.

On May 27, 2002, the Company received a renewal of its National Pollution
Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit from the North Carolina
Department of Environment and Natural Resources, Division of Water Quality
(DWQ) for its Maiden, North Carolina textile plant. Among other things, the
new permit required the Company to reduce its effluent (waste discharge) color
to specified color concentration limits. The color concentration limits were
lowered over time. The Company believed that the DWQ exceeded its authority
and acted arbitrarily in imposing the specific color concentration limitations
within the new permit and, on July 23, 2002 contested the permit by filing a
petition with the North Carolina Office of Administrative Hearings. The
Company and DWQ have reached a tentative settlement and have stayed the
contested case until September 30, 2003. The tentative settlement provides
that Delta Apparel will have one year to research and test alternative color
removal technologies and thereafter must select and implement a technology. In
addition, Delta Apparel must continue to monitor its color removal.

The Company does not currently have an estimate of the amount of additional
annual expenses, if any, that the Company may incur in the future in order to
comply with the tentative settlement. The Company believes that the cost of
compliance will not be material to the results of operations or financial
condition of the Company.

Delta Apparel incurs capital and other expenditures each year that are aimed at
achieving compliance with current and future environmental standards.
Generally, the environmental rules applicable to Delta Apparel are becoming
increasingly stringent. Delta Apparel does not expect that the amount of these
expenditures in the future will have a material adverse effect on its
operations, financial condition or liquidity. There can be no assurance,
however, that future changes in federal, state, or local regulations,
interpretations of existing regulations or the discovery of currently unknown
problems or conditions will not require substantial additional expenditures.
Similarly, the extent of Delta Apparels liability, if any, for past failures
to comply with laws, regulations and permits applicable to its operations
cannot be determined.

RISK FACTORS

AVAILABILITY OF CASH. The Company believes that adverse changes in
competitive conditions, coupled with the long-term trend of declining prices
for Delta Apparels products, could cause Delta Apparel to incur operating
losses or to use significant amounts of cash in its operations. Significant
operating losses or significant uses of cash in its operations could cause the
Company to be unable to pay its debts as they become due and to default on its
credit facility, which would have an adverse effect on the value of the Delta
Apparel shares.

In mid-May 2000, Delta Apparel entered into a credit agreement with a lending
institution, under which the lender provided Delta Apparel with a $10 million
term loan and a 3-year $25 million revolving credit facility. On August 23,
2002, the Company amended its credit agreement to extend the due date of the
revolver loan from May 1, 2003 to May 1, 2005. The Companys ability to borrow
under its revolving credit facility is based upon, and thereby limited by, the
amounts of its accounts receivable and inventory. Any material deterioration
in Delta Apparels financial results could reduce the Companys borrowing base,
which could cause the Company to lose its ability to borrow additional amounts
under its revolving credit facility or to issue additional letters of credit to
suppliers. In such a circumstance, the borrowing availability under Delta
Apparels credit facility may not be sufficient for the Companys capital
needs.

Delta Apparels credit agreement contains covenants that restrict, among other
things, the ability of Delta Apparel and its subsidiaries to incur
indebtedness, create liens, consolidate, merge, sell assets or make
investments. The credit agreement

5



Table of Contents
also contains customary representations and warranties, funding conditions and
events of default. A breach of one or more covenants or any other event of
default under the credit agreement could result in an acceleration of the
Companys obligations under that agreement, in the foreclosure on any assets
subject to liens in favor of the credit agreements lender and in the inability
of Delta Apparel to borrow additional amounts under the credit agreement.

PRICING. Prices for the Companys products have generally been dropping over
the last several years, even though demand for Delta Apparels products has
increased since fiscal 1998. The price declines have resulted from factors
largely outside Delta Apparels control, such as the industrys transfer of
manufacturing out of the United States, excess supply capacity, and declining
raw material prices. In addition, intense competition to gain market share may
lead some competitors to sell substantial amounts of goods at prices against
which Delta Apparel cannot profitably compete. Demand for Delta Apparels
products is dependent on the general demand for T-shirts and the availability
of alternative sources of supply. The Companys strategy in this market
environment is to be a low cost producer and to differentiate itself by
providing quality service to its customers. Even if this strategy is
successful, its results may be offset by reductions in demand or price
declines.

CYCLICAL RESULTS. Delta Apparel and the U.S. apparel industry are sensitive to
the business cycle of the national economy. Moreover, the popularity, supply
and demand for particular apparel products can change significantly from year
to year based on prevailing fashion trends and other factors. Reflecting the
cyclical nature of the apparel industry, many apparel producers tend to
increase capacity during years in which sales are strong. These increases in
capacity tend to accelerate a general economic downturn in the apparel markets
when demand weakens. These factors have historically contributed to
fluctuations in Delta Apparels results of operations. When these fluctuations
occur in the future, Delta Apparel may be unable to compete successfully in the
industry downturn.

MARKET PRICE OF DELTA APPAREL SHARES. Various investment banking firms have
informed the Company that public companies with relatively small market
capitalizations have difficulty generating institutional interest, research
coverage or trading volume. This illiquidity can translate into price
discounts as compared to industry peers or to the shares inherent value.
Delta Apparel believes that the market perceives it to have a relatively small
market capitalization. This could lead to Delta Apparels shares trading at
prices that are significantly lower than the Companys estimate of their
inherent value.

As of August 15, 2003, Delta Apparel had outstanding 4,041,080 shares of common
stock . The Company believes that approximately 72.1% of this stock is
beneficially owned by persons who beneficially own more than 5% of the
outstanding shares of Delta Apparel common stock and related individuals, and
that of this, approximately 36.3% of the outstanding stock is beneficially
owned by institutional investors who own more than 5% of the outstanding
shares. Sales of substantial amounts of Delta Apparel common stock in the
public market by any of these large holders could adversely affect the market
price of the common stock.

PRINCIPAL STOCKHOLDERS EXERT SUBSTANTIAL INFLUENCE. As of August 15, 2003,
two members of Delta Apparels board of directors and related individuals had
or share the voting power with respect to approximately 29.3% of the
outstanding shares of Delta Apparel common stock. These individuals will exert
substantial influence with respect to all matters submitted to a vote of
stockholders, including the election of the Delta Apparel directors.

POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTY IN HONDURAS AND MEXICO. Delta Apparel has
two company-operated sewing facilities in Honduras and one company-operated
sewing facility in Mexico. If the Honduran or Mexican labor markets tighten,
it could have some adverse effects on the industries located in the applicable
country. In addition, the Company might be adversely affected if economic or
legal changes occur that affect the way in which Delta Apparel conducts its
business in these countries. For example, a growing economy could lower
unemployment which could increase wage rates or make it difficult to retain
employees or employ enough people to meet demand. The government could also
decide to add additional holidays or change employment law increasing the
Companys costs to operate in that country. Domestic unrest or political
instability in either of these countries could also disrupt Delta Apparels
operations.

U.S. TRADE REGULATIONS. Delta Apparels products are subject to foreign
competition, which in the past has been faced with significant U.S. government
import restrictions. Foreign producers of apparel often have significant labor
cost advantages. Given the number of these foreign producers, the substantial
elimination of import protections that protect domestic apparel producers could
materially adversely affect Delta Apparels business. The extent of import
protection afforded to domestic apparel producers has been, and is likely to
remain, subject to considerable political considerations.

The North American Free Trade Agreement or NAFTA became effective on January
1, 1994 and has created a free-trade zone among Canada, Mexico and the United
States. NAFTA contains a rule of origin requirement that products be produced
in one of the three countries in order to benefit from the agreement. NAFTA
has phased out all trade restrictions and tariffs among the three countries on
apparel products competitive with those of Delta Apparel. During fiscal 2001,
the Company

6



Table of Contents
completed its sewing expansion into Mexico in order to take advantage of the
NAFTA benefits. Subsequent repeal or alteration of NAFTA could seriously
adversely affect the Companys results of operations.

The Caribbean Basin Trade Partnership Act (often referred to as the CBI Parity
Bill) became effective on October 1, 2000. The provisions of the CBI Parity
Bill have the following effects most relevant to the apparel business:



 


 
Apparel assembled in most Caribbean nations (such as
Honduras) from fabric formed and cut in the United States of
U.S. manufactured yarn can enter the United States duty-free;





 


 
Apparel cut and sewn in most Caribbean nations from
fabric formed in the United States of U.S. manufactured yarn
can enter the United States duty-free as long as it is sewn
with U.S. manufactured thread; and





 


 
Certain limits of apparel made from fabric formed in
certain Caribbean nations of U.S. manufactured yarn and cut and
sewn in those nations can enter the United States duty-free.



Apparel entering the United States under any of these three provisions is not
subject to any quotas that may exist for that specific category of goods.
Delta Apparel believes that the CBI Parity Bill gives it a competitive
advantage relative to apparel manufacturers outside of the Caribbean and
improves its competitive position relative to apparel manufacturers inside the
non-NAFTA countries. Subsequent repeal or adverse alteration of the CBI Parity
Bill could put Delta Apparel at a serious competitive disadvantage relative to
such manufacturers.

The World Trade Organization or WTO, a multilateral trade organization, was
formed in January 1995 and is the successor to the General Agreement on Tariffs
and Trade or GATT. This multilateral trade organization has set forth
mechanisms by which world trade in clothing is being progressively liberalized
by phasing-out quotas and reducing duties over a period of time that began in
January of 1995. As it implements the WTO mechanisms, the U.S. government is
negotiating bilateral trade agreements with developing countries (which are
generally exporters of textile and apparel products) that are members of the
WTO to get them to reduce their tariffs on imports of textiles and apparel in
exchange for reductions by the United States in tariffs on imports of textiles
and apparel. The elimination of quotas and the reduction of tariffs under the
WTO may result in increased imports of certain apparel products into North
America. These factors could make Delta Apparels products less competitive
against low cost imports from developing countries.

ENVIRONMENTAL RULES. Delta Apparels operations must meet extensive federal,
state and local regulatory standards in the areas of safety, health and
environmental pollution controls. In addition, there can be no assurance that
future changes in federal, state or local regulations, interpretations of
existing regulations or the discovery of currently unknown problems or
conditions will not require substantial additional expenditures. Similarly,
the extent of Delta Apparels liability, if any, for past failures to comply
with laws, regulations and permits applicable to its operations cannot be
determined.

On May 27, 2002, the Company received a renewal of its National Pollution
Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit from the North Carolina
Department of Environment and Natural Resources, Division of Water Quality
(DWQ) for its Maiden, North Carolina textile plant. Among other things, the
new permit required the Company to reduce its effluent (waste discharge) color
to specified color concentration limits. The color concentration limits were
lowered over time. The Company believed that the DWQ exceeded its authority
and acted arbitrarily in imposing the specific color concentration limitations
within the new permit and, on July 23, 2002 contested the permit by filing a
petition with the North Carolina Office of Administrative Hearings. The
Company and DWQ have reached a tentative settlement and have stayed the
contested case until September 30, 2003. The tentative settlement provides
that Delta Apparel will have one year to research and test alternative color
removal technologies and thereafter must select and implement a technology. In
addition, Delta Apparel must continue to monitor its color removal.

The Company does not currently have an estimate of the amount of additional
annual expenses, if any, that the Company may incur in the future in order to
comply with the tentative settlement. The Company believes that the cost of
compliance will not be material to the results of operation or financial
condition of the Company.

OUTSIDE PRODUCTION. Delta Apparel has historically relied upon third party
suppliers for up to 40% of its sewing production. Approximately 33% of Delta
Apparels fiscal 2003 sewing requirements were satisfied by outside contractors
located in the Caribbean basin, and the Company expects that approximately 30%
to 40% of its fiscal 2004 sewing production will be satisfied by outside
contractors. Any shortage of supply or significant price increases from the
Companys suppliers could adversely affect Delta Apparels results of
operations.

HISTORICAL TAX LIABILITIES. Delta Apparel was spun-off from Delta Woodside by
means of a pro rata distribution on June 30, 2000 of Delta Apparels stock to
Delta Woodsides shareholders. Prior to the Spin-off, Delta Apparel was a
member of Delta Woodsides consolidated group for federal income tax purposes.
Each member of a consolidated group is

7



Table of Contents
jointly and severally liable for the federal income tax liability of the other
members of the group. After the Spin-off, Delta Apparel, along with Delta
Woodside, will continue to be liable for the Delta Woodside liabilities that
were incurred for periods before the Spin-off.

Delta Apparel and Delta Woodside are parties to a tax sharing agreement. This
agreement generally seeks to allocate consolidated federal income tax
liabilities to Delta Woodside for all periods prior to and including the
Spin-off. Under this agreement, all disputes arising under the agreement
(other than claims in equity) shall be resolved by arbitration in accordance
with the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association.
If Delta Woodside does not satisfy any of its liabilities respecting any period
prior to the Spin-off, Delta Apparel could be responsible for satisfying them,
notwithstanding the tax sharing agreement.

TRADEMARKS. Delta Apparel relies on the strength of its trademarks. Based on
unit volume, approximately 87% of Delta Apparels products are currently sold
under the DELTA® and QUAIL HOLLOW® brands. The Company has incurred legal
costs in the past to establish and protect its trademarks, but this cost has
not been significant. Delta Apparel may in the future be required to expend
resources to protect these trademarks. The loss or limitation of the exclusive
right to use its trademarks could adversely affect the Companys sales and
results of operations.

KEY MANAGEMENT. Delta Apparels success depends upon the talents and continued
contributions of its key management, many of whom would be difficult to
replace. The loss or interruption of the services of these executives could
have a material adverse effect on the Companys business, financial condition
and results of operations. Although the Company maintains employment
agreements with certain members of key management, the Company cannot be
assured that the services of such personnel will continue. Delta Apparel does
not, however, maintain an employment agreement with Robert W. Humphreys,
President and Chief Executive Officer. The Company believes its future success
depends on its ability to retain and motivate its key management, its ability
to integrate new members of management into its operations and the ability of
all personnel to work together effectively as a team.

ITEM 2. PROPERTIES

Delta Apparels principal administrative, sales, and marketing operations are
located in a leased facility in Duluth, Georgia. The lease is for approximately
18,600 square feet and expires in March 2006 and Delta Apparel has one option
to extend the lease for a five year term. The Company also maintains an
executive office in Greenville, South Carolina. The lease is for approximately
220 square feet and expires in June 2004.

The Company has a leased sales office in New York City. The lease is for
approximately 648 square feet and expires in October 2005.

properties listed above.

Various factors affect the relative use by Delta Apparel of its own facilities
and outside contractors in the various production phases. Delta Apparel
believes that its equipment and facilities are generally adequate to allow it
to remain competitive with its principal competitors.

ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

On May 27, 2002, the Company received a renewal of its National Pollution
Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit from the North Carolina
Department of Environment and Natural Resources, Division of Water Quality
(DWQ) for its Maiden, North Carolina textile plant. Among other things, the
new permit required the Company to reduce its effluent (waste discharge) color
to specified color concentration limits. The color concentration limits were
lowered over time. The Company believed that the DWQ exceeded its authority
and acted arbitrarily in imposing the specific color concentration limitations
within the new permit and, on July 23, 2002 contested the permit by filing a
petition with the North Carolina Office of Administrative Hearings. The
Company and DWQ have reached a tentative settlement and have stayed the
contested case until September 30, 2003. The tentative settlement provides
that Delta Apparel will have one year to research and test alternative color
removal technologies and thereafter must select and implement a technology. In
addition, Delta Apparel must continue to monitor its color removal.

The Company does not currently have an estimate of the amount of additional
annual expenses, if any, that the Company may incur in the future in order to
comply with the tentative settlement. The Company believes that the cost of
compliance will not be material to the results of operations or financial
condition of the Company.

All other pending litigation to which Delta Apparel is a party is ordinary
routine product liability litigation or contract breach litigation incident to
its business that does not depart from the normal kind of such actions. The
Company believes that none of these actions, if adversely decided, would have a
material adverse effect on its results of operations, financial condition or
liquidity taken as a whole.

The Board may terminate or amend the dividend program at any time. The Company
currently expects to continue the quarterly dividend program.

Subject to the provisions of any outstanding blank check preferred stock, the
holders of Delta Apparel common stock are entitled to receive whatever
dividends, if any, may be declared from time to time by the Delta Apparel board
of directors in its discretion from funds legally available for that purpose.
Delta Apparels credit agreement permits the payment of cash dividends in an
amount up to 25% of cumulative net income (excluding extraordinary or unusual
non-cash items), provided that no event of default exists or would result from
that payment and after the payment at least $6.0 million remains available to
borrow under the revolving credit facility. At June 28, 2003, the total amount
permitted for payment of cash dividends under the Companys credit agreement
was $5.5 million.

Any future cash dividend payments will depend upon Delta Apparels earnings,
financial condition, capital requirements, compliance with loan covenants and
other relevant factors.

Stock Split

On August 15, 2002, the Board of Directors approved a 2-for-1 stock split of
the Companys common stock. The stock split took the form of a 100% stock
dividend that was paid on September 20, 2002 to each shareholder of record as
of September 6, 2002. All references in the financial statements with regard to
the number of shares or average number of shares of common stock and related
prices, dividends and per share amounts have been restated to reflect the
2-for-1 stock split.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

The projections included in the following discussions include only the
operations of Delta Apparel, Inc. and subsidiaries and do not reflect any
adjustments that may occur if the M.J. Soffe Co. acquisition is successfully
completed in fiscal year 2004.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Quarterly Financial Data

For information regarding quarterly financial data, reference is made to Note
12 Quarterly Financial Information (Unaudited) to the consolidated financial
statements.

Fiscal Year 2003 versus Fiscal Year 2002

Net sales for fiscal year 2003 were $129.5 million, a decrease of $2.1 million,
or 1.6%, from net sales of $131.6 million in fiscal year 2002. Lower fiscal
year 2003 net sales were the result of lower average unit prices (down 5.8%,
accounting for $8.0 million) offset partially by increased unit sales (up 4.5%,
accounting for $5.9 million). Throughout fiscal year 2003,

11



Table of Contents
pricing in the marketplace continued to decrease, primarily in the basic white
and colored tees. Delta Apparel did not fully participate in many of the
pricing promotions in the industry, resulting in decreased sales volumes in
these products. The increase in unit sales for fiscal year 2003 is the result
of increased sales in the Companys heavyweight and specialty products,
slightly offset by decreases in its basic tees. The Company expects increased
net sales for fiscal year 2004, primarily resulting from continued unit sales
growth. There can, however, be no assurance that the Company will achieve this
expected sales growth.

Gross profit as a percentage of net sales increased to 18.5% in fiscal year
2003 from 16.2% in fiscal year 2002 primarily as a result of lower raw material
costs, partially offset by lower average selling prices, throughout fiscal year
2003. The Company also achieved significant cost reductions and increased
production efficiencies in its textile and sewing operations during the year.
The gross profit for the year ended June 29, 2002 includes an expense of $0.4
million related to the training and start-up of the Fayette textile facility.
Assuming no material change in pricing, the Company expects fiscal year 2004
gross profit percentage to be consistent with fiscal year 2003. The Company
believes that its expected increase in raw material costs will be offset by the
results of other cost reduction strategies.

Selling, general and administrative expenses for fiscal year 2003 were $13.2
million, or 10.2% of net sales, an increase of $1.4 million from $11.8 million,
or 9.0% of net sales, in fiscal year 2002. The increase was primarily driven
by an increase of $0.7 million in distribution costs, an increase of $0.3
million in selling expenses and an increase of $0.4 million in bad debt
expense. The increase in distribution expenses mainly relates to the Florida
Distribution Center that opened in February 2003. Selling expenses for fiscal
year 2003 were higher due to higher salaries and commission expense, resulting
from the increased sales of specialty tees, and higher advertising costs,
resulting from direct marketing campaigns. During fiscal year 2003, the
Company incurred higher bad debt expenses resulting from the slower payments
from customers due to the depressed retail climate. Delta Apparel expects its
selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales in fiscal
year 2004 to be consistent with historical selling, general and administrative
expenses.

Other expense for fiscal year 2003 was $0.2 million compared to other income of
$0.8 million for fiscal 2002. In fiscal year 2003, the Company recorded $0.1
million in net losses related to cotton options. The Company also recorded a
net loss of $0.1 million related to the sale or disposal of certain machinery
and equipment. During fiscal year 2002, the Company recorded a $0.3 million
gain related to its cotton options. In fiscal year 2002, the Company also sold
its facility located in Washington, Georgia, resulting in a gain of $0.2
million and received the final payment on an installment sale of a previously
idled manufacturing facility, resulting in a gain of $0.3 million.

Operating income for fiscal year 2003 was $10.6 million, an increase of $0.2
million, or 2.1%, from $10.3 million in fiscal year 2002. The increase is the
result of the higher gross profit, partially offset by higher selling, general
and administrative expenses and higher other expense.

Net interest expense for fiscal year 2003 was $0.7 million, which is consistent
with fiscal year 2002. During fiscal year 2003, the Company had an increase in
average borrowings that was offset by a decrease in interest rates during the
fiscal year.

The effective tax rate for the year ended June 28, 2003 was 38.3% compared to
33.0% for the year ended June 29, 2002. In fiscal year 2002, the Company
reversed a valuation allowance related to its state net operating loss
carryforwards, resulting in the effective tax rate of 33.0%. Based upon its
assessment of current results and future projections, the Company believes
these state net operating losses will be used in the upcoming years.

Net income for fiscal year 2003 was $6.1 million, a decrease of $0.4 million,
or 6.3%, from net income of $6.5 million for fiscal year 2002, due to the
factors described above.

Inventories at June 28, 2003 totaled $47.2 million compared to $35.5 million at
June 29, 2002. The increase in inventory is related to an increase of $7.4
million in finished goods, and increase of $6.1 million in work in process and
a decrease of $1.8 million in raw materials. The Company built higher levels
of inventory in the first half of the year in expectation of increased sales
over the prior year. Sales volume expectations were not met during the fourth
quarter, resulting in the increased finished goods inventory at June 28, 2003.
Textile and apparel production levels were also increased to support the
expected sales growth resulting in increased work in process inventory. The
Companys raw material inventory decreased to $2.9 million at June 28, 2003.
Beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2002, the Company began
increasing its raw material inventory to take advantage of lower cotton prices
and to support its increased textile capacity. During the quarter ended June
28, 2003, the Company decreased its raw material inventory to levels that it
expects to maintain during fiscal year 2004. The Company expects finished
goods and work in process inventory levels in fiscal year 2004 to remain
relatively consistent with levels maintained during fiscal year 2003.

Fiscal Year 2002 versus Fiscal Year 2001

Net sales for fiscal year 2002 were $131.6 million, an increase of $11.2
million, or 9.3%, from net sales of $120.4 million in fiscal year 2001. Higher
fiscal year 2002 net sales were the result of increased unit sales (up 16.9%,
accounting for $20.3 million) offset by lower average unit prices (down 6.5%,
accounting for $9.1 million). The lower average unit prices were mainly due to
decreased sales to private label customers, resulting from a drop in retail
demand.

Gross profit as a percentage of net sales decreased to 16.2% in fiscal year
2002 from 19.4% in fiscal year 2001 primarily as a result of the decrease in
average selling prices and higher average cotton costs throughout the year.
The gross profit for the year ended June 29, 2002 includes an expense of $0.4
million related to the training and start-up of the Fayette textile facility.
The gross profit for the year ended June 30, 2001 includes an expense of $0.2
million related to the closing of the Companys Washington, Georgia sewing
facility and $1.1 million related to the start-up of the Mexican sewing
facility.

Selling, general and administrative expenses for fiscal year 2002 were $11.8
million, or 9.0% of net sales, an increase of $0.8 million from $11.0 million,
or 9.2% of net sales, in fiscal year 2001. The increase was primarily driven
by an increase of $0.6 million in distribution costs, an increase of $0.6
million in selling expenses, an increase of $0.1 million in administrative
costs, and a decrease of $0.6 million in bad debt expense. The increase in
distribution expenses mainly relates to the West Coast Sales and Distribution
Center, which was opened in the fourth fiscal quarter of 2001. The increase in
selling costs is primarily due to higher commission expense resulting from the
increase in sales during the fiscal year. The increase in administrative costs
is due to the expenses related to the Incentive Stock Program, offset by the
absence of the proxy fight expenses incurred during fiscal year 2001. During
fiscal year 2001, the Company incurred higher bad debt expenses than in either
fiscal year 2002 or 2000 due to the Chapter 11 filing of a single customer.
The decrease in bad debt expense from fiscal year 2001 is the result of not
incurring this expense during fiscal year 2002.

Other income for fiscal year 2002 was $0.8 million, an increase of $0.8 million
from fiscal year 2001. During the year, the Company sold its facility located
in Washington, Georgia, resulting in a gain of $0.2 million. The Company also
received the final payment on an installment sale of a previously idle
manufacturing facility, resulting in a gain of $0.3 million. In April 2002 the
Company purchased cotton options. Increases in the fair market value of the
cotton options were marked to market in the fourth fiscal quarter, resulting in
a gain of $0.3 million.

Operating income for fiscal year 2002 was $10.3 million, a decrease of $2.0
million, or 16.0%, from $12.3 million in fiscal year 2001. The decrease is the
result of the decreased gross profit and increased selling, general and
administrative expenses, partially offset by the increase in other income.

Net interest expense for fiscal year 2002 was $0.7 million, a decrease of $0.7
million, or 49.4%, from $1.3 million in fiscal year 2001. The reduction in
interest resulted from a decrease in average borrowings and a decrease in
interest rates during the fiscal year.

The effective tax rate for the year ended June 29, 2002 was 33.0% compared to
9.0% for the year ended June 30, 2001. In fiscal year 2002, the Company
reversed the valuation allowance against its state net operating loss
carryforwards, resulting in the effective tax rate of 33.0%. Based upon its
assessment of current results and future outlooks, the Company believes these
state net operating losses will be used in the upcoming years. The low tax
rate in fiscal 2001 was the result of the utilization of federal and state net
operating loss carryforwards and valuation allowance adjustments.

Net income for fiscal year 2002 was $6.5 million, a decrease of $3.5 million,
or 35.1%, from net income of $10.0 million for fiscal year 2001, due to the
factors described above.

Inventories at June 29, 2002 totaled $35.5 million compared to $41.6 million at
June 30, 2001. The decrease in inventory is related to a decrease of $6.1
million in finished goods, an increase of $2.0 million in raw materials and a
decrease of $2.0 million in work in process. The decrease in finished goods
inventory is the result of the increased sales in the fourth quarter over the
prior year. During the fiscal year, the Company purchased additional cotton in
order to take advantage of the lower cotton prices. This resulted in an
increase in raw materials at June 29, 2002.

Capital expenditures were $5.3 million in the year ended June 29, 2002 and $3.2
million in the year ended June 30, 2001. In April 2002, the Company purchased a
textile facility located in Fayette, Alabama, resulting in $2.7 million of
capital expenses. Additional capital expenditures were made to increase
capacity and lower costs in its existing textile facilities. Fiscal year 2001
capital expenditures were primarily related to increasing capacity and lowering
costs in the textile facilities. In addition, capital expenditures were made
in fiscal year 2001 related to the Companys expansion into Mexico and the
opening of its West Coast Sales and Distribution facility.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

The Companys primary cash needs are for working capital and capital
expenditures. In addition, the Company uses cash to fund its share repurchases
under its Stock Repurchase Program and, in fiscal 2002, its Dutch Tender Offer.
During fiscal year 2003, the Company financed its working capital and capital
expenditure requirements through its operating profits and its credit
agreement. The credit agreement provides Delta Apparel with a 5-year $10
million term loan and a 3-year $25 million revolving credit facility. On
August 23, 2002, the Company amended its credit agreement to extend the due
date of the revolver loan from May 1, 2003 to May 1, 2005. All loans under the
credit agreement bear interest at rates based on an adjusted LIBOR rate plus an
applicable margin or the banks prime rate plus an applicable margin. Delta
Apparel granted the lender a first mortgage lien on or security interest in
substantially all of its assets. Delta Apparel has the option to increase the
revolving credit facility from $25 million to $30 million, provided that no
event of default exists under the facility.

Delta Apparels operating activities resulted in the use of $1.0 million of
cash in fiscal year 2003, provided $26.5 million of cash in fiscal year 2002,
and resulted in the use of $0.9 million of cash in fiscal year 2001. The cash
used in fiscal year 2003 was primarily due to an increase of $11.7 million in
inventory and a decrease of $2.2 million in income taxes payable, offset by net
income plus depreciation. The cash provided in fiscal year 2002 was primarily
due to net income plus depreciation, a decrease of $6.1 million in inventory
and an increase of $4.4 million in accounts payable and an increase of $1.0
million in accrued expenses. The cash used in fiscal year 2001 was primarily
due to an increase of $13.4 million in inventory and a decrease of $1.8 million
in payables, offset by net income plus depreciation.

Capital expenditures were $4.7 million in the year ended June 28, 2003 and $5.3
million in the year ended June 29, 2002. In February 2003, the Company opened
a distribution facility in Florida. The Company spent $0.4 million in capital
expenditures related to this facility. During the year, the Company spent $1.2
million to increase production and decrease costs in its Fayette, Alabama
textile facility. Additional capital expenditures were made to increase
capacity and lower costs in its existing textile and apparel facilities.
During fiscal year 2002, the Company purchased the textile facility located in
Fayette, Alabama, resulting in $2.7 million of capital expenditures.
Additional capital expenditures were made to increase capacity and lower costs
in its existing textile facilities.

Delta Apparel also used cash to repurchase common stock pursuant to its Stock
Repurchase Program and Dutch Tender Offer. The Company used $1.9 million, $9.1
million and $0.6 million in fiscal years 2003, 2002 and 2001 respectively, for
share repurchases.

Based upon projections for normal operating purposes, the Company expects to
borrow funds during fiscal 2004. At June 28, 2003, the Company had $6.2
million outstanding under its revolving credit facility at an average interest
rate of 3.32%. The interest rate at June 28, 2003 on the term loan was 3.32%.

Based on its expectations, Delta Apparel believes that its $25 million
revolving credit facility should be sufficient to satisfy its foreseeable
working capital needs, and that the cash flow generated by its operations and
funds available under its revolving credit line should be sufficient to service
its debt payment requirements, to satisfy its day-to-day working capital needs,
to fund its planned capital expenditures and to pay dividends under its
dividend program. Any material deterioration in Delta Apparels results of
operations, however, may result in the Company losing its ability to borrow
under its revolving credit facility and to issue letters of credit to suppliers
or may cause the borrowing availability under that facility to be insufficient
for the Companys needs.

Dividends and Purchases by Delta Apparel of its Own Shares

Delta Apparels ability to pay cash dividends or purchase its own shares will
largely be dependent on its earnings, financial condition, capital
requirements, compliance with loan covenants and other relevant factors. Delta
Apparels credit agreement permits the payment of cash dividends in an amount
up to 25% of cumulative net income (excluding extraordinary or unusual non-cash
items), provided that no event of default exists or would result from that
payment and after the payment at least $6.0 million remains available under the
revolving credit facility. At June 28, 2003, the total amount permitted for
payment of cash dividends under the Companys credit agreement was $5.5
million. Purchases by Delta Apparel of its own stock are permitted provided
that no event of default exists or would result from that action and after the
purchase at least $3.0 million remains available to borrow under the revolving
credit facility. The credit agreement, as amended, allows for an aggregate of
$23.0 million in share repurchases.

During the fiscal year ended June 28, 2003, the Company purchased 130,204
shares of Delta Apparel common stock pursuant to its Stock Repurchase Program
for an aggregate of $1.9 million. Since the inception of the program, the
Company has

14



Table of Contents
purchased 360,204 shares of its stock under the program for a total
cost of $4.1 million. The Company has authorization
from the Board of Directors to spend up to $6.0 million for share repurchases
under the Stock Repurchase Program. All purchases were made at the discretion
of management.

In fiscal year 2002, the Company purchased 676,286 shares of its stock
(adjusted to reflect the 2-for-1 stock split effective as of September 20,
2002) at an aggregate cost, including offering expenses, of $7.6 million,
pursuant to its Dutch Tender Offer.

Dividend Program

On April 18, 2002, the Board of Directors adopted a quarterly dividend program.
The Company paid $0.9 million and $0.2 million in dividends during fiscal year
2003 and fiscal year 2002, respectively. The Board may terminate or amend the
dividend program at any time. The Company currently expects to continue the
quarterly dividend program.

Stock Split

On August 15, 2002, the Board of Directors approved a 2-for-1 stock split of
the Companys common stock. The stock split took the form of a 100% stock
dividend that was paid on September 20, 2002 to each shareholder of record as
of September 6, 2002. All references in the financial statements with regard to
the number of shares or average number of shares of common stock and related
prices, dividends and per share amounts have been restated to reflect the
2-for-1 stock split.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Note 1 to the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements includes a summary of
the significant accounting policies or methods used in the preparation of the
Companys Consolidated Financial Statements.

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities and disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the
financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during
the reporting periods. The Company bases its estimates and judgments on
historical experience and various other factors it believes to be reasonable
under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making
judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not
readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these
estimates under different assumptions or conditions. The most significant
estimates and assumptions relate to the adequacy of receivable and inventory
reserves, self-insurance accruals and the accounting for income taxes.

Allowance for Doubtful Accounts

Management judgments and estimates are made in connection with establishing the
allowance for doubtful accounts receivable. Specifically, the Company analyzes
the aging of accounts receivable balances, historical bad debts, customer
concentrations, customer credit-worthiness, current economic trends and changes
in customer payment terms. Significant changes in customer concentration or
payment terms, deterioration of customer credit-worthiness or weakening in
economic trends could have a significant impact on the collectibility of
receivables and the Companys operating results.

Inventory Write-Downs

Delta Apparel regularly reviews inventory quantities on hand and records a
provision for damaged, excess and out of style or otherwise obsolete inventory
based primarily on the Companys historical selling prices for these products
and its estimated forecast of product demand for the next twelve months.

Self Insurance

Delta Apparels medical, prescription and dental care benefits are
self-insured. The Companys self-insurance accruals are based on claims filed
and estimates of claims incurred but not reported. Estimates of claims
incurred but not reported are developed by the Company based upon the
historical time it takes for a claim to be reported and historical claim
amounts. If actual claims experience is significantly different from the
estimates, it could have a significant impact on the Companys operating
results.

Income Taxes

Delta Apparel uses the liability method of accounting for income taxes, which
requires recognition of temporary differences between financial statement and
income tax basis of assets and liabilities measured by enacted tax rates. The
Company has

recorded deferred tax assets for certain state operating loss
carryforwards and nondeductible accruals. The Company
established a valuation allowance related to certain of the state operating
loss carryforward amounts in accordance with the provisions of FASB Statement
No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. The Company continually reviews the
adequacy of the valuation allowance and recognizes the benefits of deferred tax
assets if reassessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the
deferred tax assets will be realized based on earnings forecasts for the
Company in the respective tax locations.

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS

On July 7, 2003, the Company announced that it signed a definitive agreement to
purchase all of the outstanding capital stock of M.J. Soffe Co. The
transaction is valued at up to $72 million, consisting of $52 million of cash
including retirement of debt, $8 million in promissory notes, and up to $12
million in contingent payments subject to the achievement of certain
performance targets. All currently outstanding bank debt of Soffe will be
satisfied upon consummation of the sale. The acquisition is expected to close
in September of 2003, and is subject to regulatory approval, satisfactory
completion of due diligence, and financing approval.

Delta Apparel expects to finance the cash portion of the selling price
primarily from new asset based secured term loans and secured revolving credit
agreements, both of which will be subject to the satisfaction of customary
conditions.

M. J. Soffe Co. was founded in 1946 and has a long history of profitability and
growth in the branded activewear market. For the twelve months ended December
31, 2002 Soffe had sales of approximately $100 million and served four distinct
channels of distribution. The Soffe brand is well recognized at specialty
sporting goods stores and department stores. In addition to these retail
channels, Soffe also supplies college bookstores and has a long history of
producing activewear products for the U.S. Military. Assuming that the closing
of the acquisition occurs on or about September 30, 2003, Delta Apparel expects
the Soffe acquisition to add approximately $75 million in sales to Delta
Apparel and increase per share earnings forty five to sixty cents per share in
fiscal year 2004.

RECENT ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

In August 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued
Statement of Financial Accounting Standard (SFAS) 143, Accounting for Asset
Retirement Obligations, which addresses financial accounting and reporting for
obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets and
the associated asset retirement costs. The Company adopted the provisions of
SFAS 143 in its first quarter of fiscal year 2003. The adoption of SFAS 143
had no impact on the Companys financial statements.

In August 2001, the FASB issued SFAS 144, Accounting for the Impairment or
Disposal of Long-Lived Assets, which addresses financial accounting and
reporting for the impairment or disposal of long-lived assets. The Company
adopted the provisions of SFAS 144 in its first quarter of fiscal year 2003.
The adoption of SFAS 144 had no impact on the Companys financial statements.

In June 2002, the FASB issued SFAS 146, Accounting for Costs Associated with
Exit or Disposal Activities, which addresses financial accounting and reporting
for costs associated with exit or disposal activities. The Company adopted
SFAS 146 in its third quarter of fiscal year 2003. The adoption of SFAS 146
had no impact on the Companys financial statements.

In December 2002, the FASB issued SFAS 148, Accounting for Stock-Based
CompensationTransition and Disclosure, which amends FASB Statement No. 123,
Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, to provide alternative methods of
transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting
for stock-based employee compensation. In addition, this Statement amends the
disclosure requirements of Statement 123 to require prominent disclosures in
both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for
stock-based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported
results. The Company adopted SFAS 148 in its third quarter of fiscal year
2003.

In April 2003, the FASB issued SFAS 149, Amendment of Statement 133 on
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, which amends and clarifies
financial accounting and reporting for derivative instruments, including
certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts (collectively
referred to as derivatives) and for hedging activities under FASB Statement No.
133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. The changes
in this Statement improve financial reporting by requiring that contracts with
comparable characteristics be accounted for similarly. The Company is required
and plans to adopt the provisions of SFAS 149 for the quarter ending September
27, 2003. The Company does not believe that the adoption of SFAS 149 will have
a material impact on the Companys financial statements.

16



Table of Contents
In January 2003, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 46 (FIN 46),
Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, which
addresses consolidation of variable interest entities. FIN 46 expands the
criteria for consideration in determining whether a variable interest entity
should be consolidated by a business entity, and requires existing
unconsolidated variable interest entities (which include, but are not limited
to, Special Purpose Entities, or SPEs) to be consolidated by their primary
beneficiaries if the entities do not effectively disperse risks among parties
involved. This interpretation applies immediately to variable interest
entities created after January 31, 2003, and to variable interest entities in
which an enterprise obtains an interest after that date. It applies in the
first fiscal year or interim period beginning after June 15, 2003, to variable
interest entities in which an enterprise holds a variable interest that it
acquired before February 1, 2003. The Company does not believe that the
adoption of FIN 46 will have a material impact on the Companys financial
statements.

ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

Commodity Risk Sensitivity

The Company purchases cotton from approximately eleven established merchants
with whom it has long standing relationships. The majority of the Companys
purchases are executed using on-call contracts. These on-call arrangements
are used to insure that an adequate supply of cotton is available for the
Companys requirements. Under on-call contracts, the Company agrees to purchase
specific quantities for delivery on specific dates, with pricing to be
determined at a later time. Prices are set according to prevailing prices, as
reported by the New York Cotton Exchange, at the time of the Companys election
to fix specific contracts.

Cotton on-call with a fixed price at June 28, 2003 was valued at $7.2 million,
and is scheduled for delivery between July 2003 and December 2003. At June 28,
2003, the Company had unpriced contracts for deliveries between July 2003 and
June 2004. Based on the prevailing price at June 28, 2003, the value of these
commitments was approximately $15.9 million. At June 28, 2003, a 10% decline
in the market price of the cotton covered by Delta Apparels fixed price
contracts would have had a negative impact of approximately $0.7 million on the
value of the contracts. At June 29, 2002, cotton on-call with a fixed price
was valued at $15.0 million. At June 29, 2002, a 10% decline in the market
price of the cotton covered by Delta Apparels fixed price contracts would have
had a negative impact of approximately $1.5 million on the value of the
contracts. The effect of a 10% decline in the market price of cotton on Delta
Apparels fixed price contracts would have been less at June 28, 2003 than at
June 29, 2002 because the value of Delta Apparels fixed price cotton on-call
contracts was less on June 28, 2003. Daily price fluctuations are minimal, yet
long-term trends in price movement could result in unfavorable pricing of
cotton for Delta Apparel.

The Company uses derivatives, including cotton option contracts, to manage its
exposure to movements in commodity prices. The Company did not designate its
options as hedge instruments upon inception. Accordingly, changes in the fair
market value are marked to market. The Company owned options valued at $0.1
million on June 28, 2003.

Interest Rate Sensitivity

Delta Apparels credit agreement provides that the interest rate on outstanding
amounts owed shall bear interest at variable rates. If the amount of
outstanding indebtedness at June 28, 2003 under the revolver and term loan had
been outstanding during the entire year and the interest rate on this
outstanding indebtedness were increased by 100 basis points, Delta Apparels
expense would have increased by approximately $99,000, or 13.5%, for the fiscal
year. The actual increase in interest expense resulting from a change in
interest rates would depend on the magnitude of the increase in rates and the
average principal balance outstanding.

Report of Independent Auditors

The Board of Directors,
Delta Apparel, Inc.

We have audited the accompanying consolidated
balance sheets of Delta Apparel,
Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) as of June 28, 2003 and
June 29, 2002,
and the related consolidated statements of income, stockholders
equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended June 28, 2003.
Our audits also included
the financial statement schedule listed in the index of Item 15 (a). These
financial statements and schedule are the responsibility of the Companys
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements and schedule based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform
the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in
all material respects, the consolidated financial position of the Company as of
June 28, 2003 and June 29, 2002, and the consolidated results of its operations
and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended June
28, 2003, in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States. Also in our opinion, the
related financial statement schedule for the three years ended June 28, 2003,
when considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole,
present fairly in all material respects the information set forth therein.

Exchange under the symbol DLA.

NOTE 2SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

(a) Basis of Presentation: The consolidated financial statements of Delta
Apparel, Inc. and subsidiaries represent the operations of Delta Apparel and
its wholly owned subsidiaries, Delta Apparel Honduras, S.A., Delta Cortes, S.A.
and Delta Campeche, S.A. de C.V. All significant intercompany accounts and
transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. The Companys business
constitutes a single reportable segment.

(b) Fiscal Year: The Companys operations are based upon a fifty-two or
fifty-three week fiscal year ending on the Saturday closest to June 30. Fiscal
years 2003, 2002 and 2001 each consist of fifty-two weeks.

(c) Cash: Cash consists of cash and temporary investments with maturities of
three months or less when purchased.

(d) Inventories: Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (first-in,
first-out method) or market. Estimated losses on inventories represent
reserves for obsolescence, excess quantities, irregulars and slow moving
inventory. The Company estimates the losses on the basis of its assessment of
the inventorys net realizable value based upon current market conditions and
historical experience. The majority of the Companys raw materials are readily
available, and thus it is not dependent on a single supplier.

(e) Property, Plant, and Equipment: Property, plant and equipment are stated
at cost. Depreciation and amortization is recorded following the straight-line
method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which range from 3 to 20
years. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the lease term
or the estimated useful life of the improvements. When assets are retired or
disposed of, the costs and accumulated depreciation or amortization are removed
from the respective accounts and any related gain or loss is recognized.
Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense when incurred.

(f) Impairment of Long-Lived Assets: The Company accounts for long-lived
assets in accordance with SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or
Disposal of Long-Lived Assets. Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment
whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount
of the asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and
used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to
undiscounted future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If
such assets are considered to be impaired, impairment is measured by comparing
the carrying amount to the fair value or discounted cash flow.

(g) Accounts Receivable and Revenue Recognition: Sales of goods are
recognized upon shipment of the goods to the customer. The Company generally
does not require collateral. The Company provides allowances for merchandise
returns, claims and markdowns based on historical credits issued as a
percentage of sales and periodic evaluations of the aging of accounts
receivable. The Company actively monitors its exposure to credit risk through
the use of credit approvals and credit limits.

F-7



Table of Contents
(h) Income Taxes: Income taxes are accounted for under the liability method.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax
consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement
carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax
bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and
liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable
income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be
recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a
change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the
enactment date.

During the year ended July 1, 2000, the Companys operations were reported in
the consolidated federal tax return of Delta Woodside Industries, Inc. The
Federal income tax obligation or refund under the corporate tax sharing
arrangement that was allocated to the Company was determined as if the Company
was filing a separate Federal income tax return. Until mid-May 2000, the
Companys federal tax liability or receivable was paid to or was received from
Delta Woodside.

Under the tax sharing agreement entered into by and between Delta Woodside,
Duck Head and the Company, for the taxable period ending July 1, 2000, Delta
Woodside would be responsible for paying any federal income taxes, and shall be
entitled to any refund of or savings in federal income taxes, with respect to
the Delta Woodside consolidated federal income tax group. With respect to
state income, franchise or similar taxes, for each taxable year ending July 1,
2000 and prior, each corporation that is a member of the Delta Woodside tax
group, the Duck Head tax group or the Delta Apparel tax group shall be
responsible for paying any of those state taxes, and any increase in those
state taxes, and shall be entitled to receive the benefit of any refund of or
saving in those state taxes, with respect to that corporation (or any
predecessor by merger of that corporation) or that results from any tax
proceeding with respect to any returns relating to those state taxes of that
corporation (or any predecessor by merger of that corporation).

On August 6, 2001, the tax sharing agreement between Delta Woodside Industries,
Inc., Duck Head Apparel Company, Inc. and Delta Apparel, Inc. was amended. The
amendment includes a provision that all disputes arising under the Agreement
(other than claims in equity) shall be resolved by arbitration in accordance
with the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association.

(i) Advertising Costs: Advertising costs are expensed as incurred.
Advertising costs amount to $977, $904 and $818 in fiscal 2003, 2002 and 2001,
respectively.

(j) Earnings Per Share: Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing net
income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the
year. The computation of diluted earnings per share includes the dilutive
effect of stock options and non-vested stock awards. The weighted-average
shares do not include securities that would be anti-dilutive for each of the
periods presented.

(k) Cotton Procurements: The Company contracts to buy cotton with future
delivery dates at fixed prices in order to reduce the effects of fluctuations
in the prices of cotton used in the manufacture of its products. These
contracts permit settlement by delivery and are not used for trading purposes.
The Company commits to fixed prices on a percentage of its cotton requirements
up to eighteen months in the future. If market prices for cotton fall below
the Companys committed fixed costs and it is estimated that the costs of
cotton are not recoverable in future sales of finished goods, the differential
is charged to income at that time.

(l) Use of Estimates: The preparation of financial statements in conformity
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires the
Companys management to use estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts and disclosures of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

(m) Stock Option and Incentive Award Plans: The Company applies the intrinsic
value-based method of accounting prescribed by Accounting Principles Board
(APB) Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and related
interpretations, in accounting for its fixed plan stock options. As such,
compensation expense would be recorded on the date of grant only if the current
market price of the underlying stock exceeded the exercise price.

The pro forma information regarding
net income and earnings per share is required by SFAS 123 to be
determined as if the Company had accounted for its employee stock
options under the fair value method of that Statement. For purposes of pro forma disclosures, the estimated fair value of the options
under the Option Plan and the Award Plan are amortized to expense over the
options vesting period. The Companys pro forma information follows (in

(n) Comprehensive Income: There were no items of Other Comprehensive Income
in fiscal years 2003, 2002 or 2001.

(o) Fair Value of Financial Instruments: The Company uses financial
instruments in the normal course of its business. The carrying values
approximate fair value for financial instruments that are short-term in nature,
such as cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued expenses. The
Company estimates that the carrying value of the Companys long-term debt
approximates fair value based on the current rates offered to the Company for
debt of the same remaining maturities.

(p) Derivatives: From time to time, the Company enters into forward
contracts, option agreements or other instruments to limit its exposure to
fluctuations in raw material prices with respect to cotton purchases. The
Company determines at inception whether the derivative instruments will be
accounted for as hedges. The option agreements purchased during fiscal year
2002 and 2003 are derivative instruments but are not accounted for as hedges.
The option agreements are marked to market on a quarterly basis with
adjustments to the fair market value recorded in operations. The fair value of
these derivative instruments was $138 and $445 at June 28, 2003 and June 29,
2002, respectively, and was included in other current assets in the
accompanying balance sheet.

(q) Reclassifications: Certain reclassifications have been made to prior year
financial statements to conform to the current period presentation.

(r) Shipping and Handling Costs: The Company classifies shipping and handling
costs as a component of cost of goods sold. Amounts billed to a customer in a
sale transaction related to shipping and handling costs are classified as
revenues.

(s) Recent Accounting Pronouncements: In August 2001, the Financial
Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement of Financial Accounting
Standard (SFAS) 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations, which
addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with
the retirement of tangible long-lived assets and the associated asset
retirement costs. The Company adopted the provisions of SFAS 143 in its first
quarter of fiscal year 2003. The adoption of SFAS 143 had no impact on the
Companys financial statements.

In August 2001, the FASB issued SFAS 144, Accounting for the Impairment or
Disposal of Long-Lived Assets, which addresses financial accounting and
reporting for the impairment or disposal of long-lived assets. The Company
adopted the provisions of SFAS 144 in its first quarter of fiscal year 2003.
The adoption of SFAS 144 had no impact on the Companys financial statements.

F-9



Table of Contents
In June 2002, the FASB issued SFAS 146, Accounting for Costs Associated with
Exit or Disposal Activities, which addresses financial accounting and reporting
for costs associated with exit or disposal activities. The Company adopted
SFAS 146 in its third quarter of fiscal year 2003. The adoption of SFAS 146
had no impact on the Companys financial statements.

In December 2002, the FASB issued SFAS 148, Accounting for Stock-Based
CompensationTransition and Disclosure, which amends FASB Statement No. 123,
Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, to provide alternative methods of
transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting
for stock-based employee compensation. In addition, this Statement amends the
disclosure requirements of Statement 123 to require prominent disclosures in
both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for
stock-based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported
results. The Company adopted SFAS 148 in its third quarter of fiscal year
2003.

In April 2003, the FASB issued SFAS 149, Amendment of Statement 133 on
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, which amends and clarifies
financial accounting and reporting for derivative instruments, including
certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts (collectively
referred to as derivatives) and for hedging activities under FASB Statement No.
133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. The changes
in this Statement improve financial reporting by requiring that contracts with
comparable characteristics be accounted for similarly. The Company is required
and plans to adopt the provisions of SFAS 149 for the quarter ending September
27, 2003. The Company does not believe that the adoption of SFAS 149 will have
a material impact on the Companys financial statements.

In January 2003, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 46 (FIN 46),
Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, which addresses consolidation of
variable interest entities. FIN 46 expands the criteria for consideration in
determining whether a variable interest entity should be consolidated by a
business entity, and requires existing unconsolidated variable interest
entities (which include, but are not limited to, Special Purpose Entities, or
SPEs) to be consolidated by their primary beneficiaries if the entities do not
effectively disperse risks among parties involved. This interpretation applies
immediately to variable interest entities created after January 31, 2003, and
to variable interest entities in which an enterprise obtains an interest after
that date. It applies in the first fiscal year or interim period beginning
after June 15, 2003, to variable interest entities in which an enterprise holds
a variable interest that it acquired before February 1, 2003. The Company does
not believe that the adoption of FIN 46 will have a material impact on the
Companys financial statements.

In May 2000, the Company entered into a credit agreement with a lending
institution, under which the lender has provided the Company with a 5 year
$10.0 million term loan and a 3 year $25.0 million revolving credit facility.
On August 23, 2002, the Company amended its credit agreement to extend the due
date of the revolver loan from May 1, 2003 to May 1, 2005. All loans under the
credit agreement bear interest based on an adjusted LIBOR rate plus an
applicable margin or the banks prime rate plus an applicable margin. The
Company has granted the lender a first mortgage lien on or security interests
in substantially all of its assets. The Company has the option to increase the
revolving credit facility from $25.0 million to $30.0 million, provided that no
event of default exists under the facility.

The credit agreement contains limitations on, or prohibitions of, cash
dividends, stock purchases, related party transactions, mergers, acquisitions,
sales of assets, indebtedness and investments. The credit agreement, as
amended, permits up to an aggregate of $23.0 million of purchases by the
Company of its own stock provided that no event of default existed or would
result from that action and after the purchase at least $3.0 million remained
available to borrow under the revolving credit facility.

Principal of the term loan will be repaid in monthly installments based on a 60
month amortization, with a payment of all outstanding principal and interest
required upon earlier termination of the credit facility. The Company will
make the following payments related to its long-term debt: $2.0 million in
fiscal year 2004 and $1.7 million in fiscal year 2005.

Under the revolving credit facility, the Company is able to borrow up to $25.0
million (including a $10.0 million letter of credit subfacility) subject to
borrowing base limitations based on the accounts receivable and inventory
levels. Annual facility fees are .25% of the amount by which the revolving
loan limit exceeds the average daily principal balance of the outstanding
revolving loans and letter of credit accommodations during the immediately
preceding month. At June 28, 2003 the Company had the ability to borrow an
additional $18.8 million under the revolving credit facility.

The Companys deferred tax asset related to state net operating loss
carryforwards are reduced by a valuation allowance to result in deferred tax
assets considered by management to be more likely than not realizable. The
valuation allowance for deferred tax assets was $58 as of June 28, 2003 and
June 29, 2002. There was no net change in the total valuation allowance for
the year ended June 28, 2003. The net change in the total valuation allowance
for the year ended June 29, 2002 was a decrease of $631. The ultimate
realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future
taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become
deductible.

F-12



Table of Contents
As of June 28, 2003, the Company had operating loss carryforwards of
approximately $8.6 million for State purposes. These
carryforwards expire at various intervals through 2019.

NOTE 8LEASES

The Company has several noncancellable operating leases relating to buildings,
office equipment, machinery and equipment, and computer systems. Certain land

NOTE 9EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS

The Companys defined contribution plan, the Savings and Investment Plan (the
Plan), allows employees to make pre-tax contributions under Section 401(k) of
the Internal Revenue Code. The Plan is open to any U.S. employee who has
attained the age of eighteen, at the beginning of the next quarter after
completing three months of service. The Plan provides for the Company to make
a guaranteed match of the employees contributions. The Company contributed
approximately $257, $217 and $121 to the Plan during fiscal 2003, 2002 and
2001, respectively.

The Company has a Deferred Compensation Plan that permits certain management
employees to defer a portion of their compensation. Deferred compensation
accounts are credited with interest and are distributable after retirement,
disability or employment termination. The Deferred Compensation Plan is
unfunded and benefits are paid from the general assets of the Company. The
Company expensed approximately $122, $96 and $66 to the Deferred Compensation
Plan during fiscal 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.

The Company provides postretirement life insurance benefits for certain retired
employees. The plan is noncontributory and is unfunded. Benefits and
expenses are paid from the general assets of the Company and recorded as they
are incurred. All of the employees in the plan are fully vested and the plan
was closed to new employees in 1990. The discount rate used in determining the
liability was 7.25%, 7.25% and 7.50% as of June 28, 2003, June 29, 2002 and
June 30, 2001, respectively. No options were granted in fiscal
year 2002. The following table presents the benefit
obligation for these benefits, which is included in Accrued Expenses in the
accompanying balance sheet.

NOTE 10STOCK OPTIONS AND INCENTIVE STOCK AWARDS

Effective in June 2000, the Company established the Delta Apparel Stock Option
Plan (the Option Plan) and the Delta Apparel Incentive Stock Award Plan (the
Award Plan). Information included in this footnote has been adjusted to
reflect the 2-for-1 stock split effective as of September 20, 2002.

F-13



Table of Contents
The Company has elected to follow Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25,
Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees (APB 25) and related
Interpretations in accounting for its employee stock options because, as
discussed below, the alternative fair value accounting provided for under FASB
Statement No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation (SFAS 123),
requires use of option valuation models that were not developed for use in
valuing employee stock options.

Under the Option Plan, the Company authorized the grant of options of up to
1,000,000 shares of common stock. Options are granted by the compensation
committee of the Companys board of directors to key and middle level
executives for the purchase of the Companys stock at prices not less than the
fair market value of the shares on the dates of grant. Under APB 25, no
compensation expense is recognized by the Company as the exercise price of the
Companys employee stock options equals the market price of the underlying
stock on the date of grant.

Under the Award Plan, the compensation committee of the Companys board of
directors has the discretion to grant awards for up to an aggregate maximum of
400,000 common shares. The Award Plan authorizes the compensation committee to
grant to officers and key and middle level executives of the Company or any of
its subsidiaries rights to acquire common shares at a cash purchase price of
$0.01 per share. As of June 28, 2003, awards covering 192,200 shares have been
granted and awards covering 142,400 shares have been exercised under the Award
Plan. The Award Plan contains certain provisions that require it to be
accounted for as a variable plan under APB 25. Accordingly, compensation
expense is recognized by the Company as the market value of the stock increases
and decreases from the grant date. Compensation expense recorded under the
Award Plan was $1,251, $1,195 and $750 in fiscal 2003, 2002 and 2001,
respectively.

A summary of the Companys stock option activity under the Option Plan and the
Award Plan and related information are as follows:

Exercise prices for options outstanding as of June 28, 2003 ranged from
approximately $4.66 to $6.13, except for 49,200 shares covered by awards
outstanding under the Award Plan for which the exercise price was $0.01. The
weighted average remaining contractual life of those options is approximately 2
years.

The pro forma information regarding net income and earnings per share disclosed
in Note 1 is required by SFAS 123 to be determined as if the Company had
accounted for its employee stock options under the fair value method of that
Statement. The fair value for these options was estimated at the date of grant
using a Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following weighted-average
assumptions: risk-free interest rates of 5.5% in 2003 and 2001, dividend yield
of 1.7% and 0% in 2003 and 2001, respectively, volatility factor of the
expected market price of the Companys common stock of .394 and .557 in 2003
and 2001, respectively, and expected lives of one to four years. No shares
were granted in fiscal year 2002.

The Black-Scholes option valuation model was developed for use in estimating
the fair value of traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are
fully transferable. In addition, option valuation models require the input of
highly subjective assumptions including the expected stock price volatility.
Because the Companys employee stock options have characteristics significantly
different from those of traded options, and because changes in the subjective
input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate, in
managements opinion, the existing models do not necessarily provide a reliable
single measure of the fair value of its employee stock options.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
