Economite RE4400DS HTD
Linkageless Technology

Midco International has developed a 400,000 BTU high turndown burner. The Midco RE4400DS HTD burner is a fully modulating gas burner using a linkage less air fuel ratio control. The burner fires at 20,000 BTU’s low fire and 400,000 BTU’s high fire.  The burner is ETL listed and comes complete with ignition system and gas train.
Midco Advantage Over the Competition
Why buy a Midco burner over a competing product? There are two excellent reasons - One: We Fire Test Every Burner before shipping it out to you or your customer. Two: We stand on our reputation for excellent post order support on all of the Midco burners. Which is a highly prized benefit that is not always apparent or present when  looking for the ‘best price’ in a product.  We stand by  our motto: “Quality Designed for Proven Performance”.
