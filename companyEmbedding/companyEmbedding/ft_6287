The rug  we received looked nothing like this.  It was totally red. I took it to Home Depot to return and they talked with the HD warehouse and it was reported that this rug is no longer being manufactured.  Yet the rug we received is not on the website.   Therefore we returned the rug.  Why would HD have a rug like the one above of their website and discontinue it.  This makes for poor merchandising and customer service.
