    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).

On Aug. 7, proceeds from the new facility will primarily be used to redeem $750 million of its 7.25% senior notes, maturing Oct. 2022 (notice was provided on July 6).

History[edit]




Zebra Technologies office in Heerenveen, The Netherlands.


Zebra was incorporated in 1969 as "Data Specialties Incorporated", a manufacturer of high-speed electromechanical products. The company changed its focus to specialty on-demand labeling and ticketing systems in 1982 and// became "Zebra Technologies Corporation" in 1986. Zebra became a publicly traded company in 1991. Since 2008, Zebra has outsourced the majority of its printer manufacturing to Jabil Circuit in Guangzhou, China.[5]
In 1998 Zebra Technologies merged with Eltron International, Inc.[6] In 2000 Comtec Information Systems was acquired,[7] followed in 2003 by the acquisition of Atlantek, Inc.[8]
In 2004 the company expanded into RFID smart label manufacturing,[9] acquiring Retail Systems International, Inc. (RSI) the next year.[10] In the following years Swecoin,[11] WhereNet Corp,[12] Proveo AG,[13] and Navis Holdings, LLC (later divested in 2011)[14] were acquired.
The company established the Enterprise Solutions Group (ESG) in 2008; renamed as Zebra Enterprise Solutions (ZES) in 2009. In the same year Multispectral Solutions, Inc. was acquired.[15] In 2012 the company acquired LaserBand, LLC[16] and StepOne Systems in a cash purchase price of $1.5 million.[17]
2013 saw the acquisition of Hart Systems for $94 million in cash from the private equity firm Topspin Partners LBO.[18] In 2014, Motorola Solutions' Enterprise business was bought in a $3.45 billion transaction, providing mobile computing and advanced data capture communications technologies and services.[18]
Locations[edit]
Zebra Technologies has more than 80 offices worldwide,[19] with regional headquarters in Lincolnshire, Illinois, and Miramar, Florida, in the United States; Bourne End, Buckinghamshire in the United Kingdom; and Singapore.[citation needed]
In April 2014 the company employed more than 2,500 people worldwide. Upon the closing of the Motorola Solutions' Enterprise business acquisition, Zebra’s workforce was expected to grow by 4,500 employees and its patent portfolio predicted to exceed 4,100 U.S. and international patents.[20]
In its annual report for the year ended December 2015, the company said it provided products and services in over 170 countries, with approximately 120 facilities and 7,000 employees worldwide.[21]
