For family and friends of James Foley, 'Jim' is a mark of the man

John Foley felt a complicated set of emotions when he viewed the now infamous video of his son, the journalist James Wright Foley, being executed by Islamic State 18 months ago."Despite the world watching, I felt so bad he was alone and none of us were there," John said in an interview with his wife Diane at a restaurant here last week. "I only pray that, even though he was physically alone, he died with the memories of all those who loved him."A tear then came to John's eye. "It was horrific," he said, his voice wavering. "But seeing Jimmy's lips like that in the video, I could see his courage. I could feel his courage.See more of Entertainment’s top stories on Facebook >>

To many Americans, James Foley is a piece of shorthand, a symbol, the orange-jumpsuited man in the grotesque footage that drove home the danger of ISIS at the dawn of its threat.To the Foleys, he represented something else: Jimmy, a brave and pure-hearted idealist, the son who made them proud, if more than a little anxious, with every new adventure he embarked upon. Their son--held prisoner for nearly two years before his death, in Syria, at age 40--was pursuing a task that was dangerous but important. They came to embrace his choice even as it led, with a kind of horrible slow-motion velocity, to the unthinkable.The rest of America might start to feel a little more like the Foleys upon watching "Jim." Directed by Brian Oakes, a film-graphics veteran and the subject's childhood friend, the documentary is an intimate homage to a deeply likable man — and a reminder that, for all its high-level policy wrangling, the war on terror is just as often about the confused and heartbroken family next door.After premiering last week at the Sundance Film Festival, where it won a major audience prize, "Jim" will debut on HBO Saturday night. The film paints the native of small-town New Hampshire as a rich human being, one innately driven to take risks in the name of truth."I remember as I became more aware of the dangers, asking him, 'Why are you doing this?' You have two master's degrees — why?' Diane Foley, with her trademark mix of resolute and self-questioning tones, said as she sat near her husband. "And he said, 'Mom, you have to understand my passion.' He became more excited just talking about it. And that's when I began to understand."

The Marquette- and Medill-educated Foley was a free spirit — so caught up did he become in the moment that he often arrived hours late to appointments and rarely packed a toothbrush, the film recalls. Foley took some time in early adulthood figuring out his life purpose. He volunteered with Teach for America; he taught writing to prison inmates in the Chicago area.As the Iraq war progressed, however, Foley felt the need to be closer to, and communicate from, intense global conflicts. He embedded with the Indiana National Guard as a broadcast journalist, then shortly afterward, he traveled as a freelancer with a small group of international reporter friends to chronicle the 2011 revolution in Libya. Foley was captured there and survived more than 40 days as a hostage before being freed in a negotiated release.The journalist returned home to his tightknit family — he is the eldest of five siblings and was especially close to his more pragmatic brother Michael, a key voice in the film — but found himself bored with a desk-editing job. He soon returned to a combat zone. In late 2012, he was captured while working in war-torn northern Syria.The second half of "Jim" is devoted to showing what Foley's life was like in a harsh prison setting. More than a dozen European journalists were held captive with him at various points; apart from the British nationals, all were released. Their voices here offer an uncommonly detailed look at life as a Westerner behind ISIS lines.




There were the board games the prisoners invented out of basic raw material. The oranges they coveted like candy. And, of course, there were the torture sessions. As one former captive says in the movie, it wasn't the physical pain as much as the psychological uncertainty. (If offered the choice between the relief of a “stress-killer” pill or a “pain-killer” pill, he says, he would unquestioningly take the former.)A perennial optimist, Foley was a steady presence throughout. At a time when a brute need for survival brought out the worst in prisoners, he was frequently helpful and supportive, even if it meant pushing down his own pain."The most poignant moment, and the one that drove home Jimmy's spirit to me watching the film, was when some people weren't certain about whether they would be released, and Jimmy put his arm around them and supported them even though he knew he would never be released," said John Foley, a soft-spoken doctor with a New Hampshire accent. "That was the essence of Jim," he added, beginning to choke up once more.Oakes, who knew Jim Foley well from their  New Hampshire town, said, "He was just that guy you always wanted around. Whenever Jim entered that room, he didn't have to say anything. He just changed the environment."If the movie elides the question of whether there was a more traditional way for Foley to be practicing overseas journalism, it also makes clear the benefits that came from his fearlessness. Foley and his colleagues were among the first to transmit horrific images and stories, now conveyed via the likes of the Homs drone, from the dangerous region where few dared to travel. (One of the goals of the foundation that Diane and John formed after their son's death is to provide a better safety net for the growing number of freelance journalists in conflict areas.)Hovering above the movie are several what-ifs, particularly with regard to the strict hostage-negotiation policy of the U.S. Though John and Diane Foley decline to speak of it these days, there is a palpable sense of frustration in the film about the government's efforts. As Foley's editor notes with a bittersweet trace in his voice, the Europeans were all released.

Some viewers might also ask why a civilian was in a hot zone like Syria, especially after cheating death in Libya just a short time before. But this was never a question for Foley, and the film argues it shouldn't be for us either. As a Foley friend, in an analogy befitting cinema's current "Spotlight" moment, says in the movie, you would never question a fireman who rushes into a burning building to do his job. Why would you do the same for a journalist?

For Foley's parents, this is, understandably, a more delicate issue."It was so hard to have Jimmy home from Libya," John said. "We didn't want to push him. But I still feel like sometimes maybe we should have laid more guilt, like that might have stopped him from going back overseas.""We could have laid more guilt," Diane said quietly.At an HBO-backed screening of the film hosted by the Council of Foreign Relations and attended by top Time Warner executives earlier this week, the Foleys turned out, along with some of their children, to help keep Jim Foley's legacy alive. John and Diane bravely watched the movie once more and then, when it was over, stood in front of the cocktail-party set to explain how they were trying to carry on their son's mission. Some fatigue was evident on their faces. However impossible it is to conceive of what parents like the Foleys went through, imagining how it feels to re-live it in the name of a cause seems that much more difficult.The moment that will emotionally wreck even the most steely soul comes during the movie's conclusion, when Jim's brother Michael reads a letter--written just before Foley was executed and memorized by a captor about to be released--that serves as a kind of epilogue and farewell. In it, the journalist offers a heartfelt reminder to each of his close family members about what he loves and remembers about them — the hug he gave one brother outside a comedy club, the foibles of his grandmother."You realize you don't know your children when they become adults," said Diane, taking a deep breath as she recounted some of the textured details in "Jim." "They go off and have their jobs and their friends, and a lot of that is a mystery to parents.""We came to know Jimmy from the film," said John.steve.zeitchik@latimes.com

      Obama administration failed James Foley, says victim's brother, while father recounts watching his son's beheading Obama administration failed James Foley: brother   BY  Bev Ford Meg Wagner  Larry Mcshane   NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Updated: Saturday, August 23, 2014, 3:51 AM     facebook   Tweet   email          James Foley's parents John and Diane speak to reporters in front of their house in Rochester, N.H.  (Chitose Suzuki for New York Daily News)       BY  Bev Ford Meg Wagner  Larry Mcshane   NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Updated: Saturday, August 23, 2014, 3:51 AM    
	The Obama administration failed James Foley in the 21 months before the journalist was savagely executed, the dead man’s brother charged.

	Michael Foley, speaking Friday with Yahoo News, said the beheading of his sibling by Islamic State (ISIS) jihadists should change America’s handling of similar cases in the future.

	“There’s more that could have been done directly on Jim’s behalf,” Michael Foley said in a shot at the White House. “I really, really hope that Jim’s death pushes us to take another look at our approach to terrorist and hostage negotiation.”

	Asked about President Obama’s decision to send U.S. commandos into Syria this summer in a secret rescue mission, Foley sounded skeptical.

	“I’d like to think it did happen, but I certainly wasn’t aware of it,” said the U.S. Air Force serviceman.

	Deputy National Security Adviser Ben Rhodes defended the White House response to the Foley situation, insisting “we have done everything we can possibly do . . . to bring home our hostages.”

	He specifically reiterated the administration’s opposition to meeting demands for ransom from terrorist groups: “It incentivizes the kidnapping of foreigners.”       James Foley was executed earlier this week. (GlobalPost/AP)   

	ISIS wanted a $132 million payoff in return for the release of Foley, 40, who was snatched off the streets of Syria in November 2012. But Michael Foley suggested cash wasn’t the government’s only asset.

	“We are sitting on prisoners, for example, in Guantanamo,” he said. “It doesn’t have to be financial.”

	Rhodes flatly declared the beheading of the innocent U.S. citizen as a terror attack.

	“We see that as an attack on our country when one of our own is killed like that,” he said.

	Rhodes, speaking to reporters in Edgartown, Mass., echoed the administration’s threat to strike inside Syria in its fight against the growing ISIS threat.

	Foley’s parents, after avoiding the gruesome video of a hooded terrorist beheading their son, finally sat down together to watch the barbaric murder.      American war reporter James Wright Foley was beheaded by ISIS. (YouTube)   

	“We just needed to know,” dad John Foley said outside the family’s New Hampshire home after revealing the couple had seen the stomach-turning tape.

	Foley was then asked if he could forgive his son’s remorseless killer.

	“Not today,” he told the Daily News Friday morning as his voice trailed off. “As Christians, we have to ...”

	John Foley said the family was planning to establish a scholarship at James’ alma mater, Marquette University, and tried to put a positive spin on a horrific few days.

	“We believe he’s free,” the distraught dad said of his slain son. “He’s with his God. The joy has been being Jimmy’s parents. The pain is in his death.”

	The ISIS militants said Foley’s killing was in response to U.S. air strikes in Iraq, where hopes of a new government took a nosedive after a terror attack at a Sunni mosque.      Foley's siblings, Katie Foley, 26, and Michael Foley, 38, said the family thought they were on a path toward freeing the 40-year-old. (yahoo news)   

	A suicide bomber burst into Musab bin Omair Mosque about 75 miles northeast of Baghdad, followed by gunmen who began spraying the trapped worshippers with bullets. At least 64 people were killed and more than 60 wounded in the village of Imam Wais, while another four militiamen rushing to the bloody scene were killed by explosions.

	Officials could not immediately determine if the mass murder was the work of Shiite militias or ISIS.

	John and Diane Foley started the day with a joint appearance on the “Today” show, their first comments since their son’s employer released the text of an email sent last week by ISIS.

	The cold-blooded missive warned that Foley would “be executed as a direct result of (U.S.) transgressions,” adding the violence would not stop “until we quench our thirst for your blood.”

	Despite the message’s terrifying tenor, the Foleys told the NBC morning show that the email also gave them some kind of hope.

	“I actually was excited to see an email despite the conclusion that they would execute Jim,” said John Foley. “I actually hoped we could engage in negotiations with them if they were willing to send any sort of communication because we had none prior.”     

	The two said they remained optimistic about bringing their captive son home until the moment they learned about his death.

	Once the details emerged, the couple became aware of the group’s depraved indifference to life.

	“I did not realize how brutal they were,” said John Foley.

	In the video, ISIS warned that a second captive American journalist, Steven Sotloff, would be killed next if the U.S. does not meet the terrorists’ demands.

	Sotloff, a freelance reporter for Time magazine, was kidnapped in August 2013 while on assignment in Syria.

	The Foleys have been in touch with Sotloff’s mother, who has kept a low profile during her ordeal.     

	President Obama took a day off from golfing Friday as his Martha’s Vineyard vacation reached its final days.

	White House spokesman Eric Schultz responded to the criticism prompted by the juxtaposition of the President teeing off minutes after addressing the nation about Foley’s murder.

	“I am not going to get into the President’s mindset,” Schultz said. “Generally, sports and leisure activities are a good way for release and clearing of the mind for a lot of us.”

The brutal killing of my friend Jim Foley
 James Foley was a generous man, committed journalist and stoic hostage. His beheading by a masked fighter is part of Islamic State’s strategy of using foreign hostages for political and military leverage

They had spent many dark months together, at times shackled to one another by their youthful captors, several of whom taunted them with European accents. The three journalists, who had all been captured in Syria and held by jihadists, joked with each other despite the harshest of conditions. They swapped stories of reporting in other tough places – Libya, Iraq, Afghanistan, Yemen. They shared blankets and whatever scraps of food they were given. 
This week the lives of the three men diverged in the cruellest way. In a sun-dappled garden in northern France one of the three, Nicolas Hénin, a French reporter who had been released with three compatriots in April, celebrated his wedding. Days later another of the three, the American freelance photojournalist James Foley, who had gone missing in northern Syria in November 2012, was beheaded by a masked fighter from the group now known as Islamic State. Another militant filmed the killing. At the end of the gruesome video they dragged Steven Sotloff, another American freelancer and the third of the trio, onscreen and warned he could face a similar fate.
I know all three men. Nicolas Hénin and I have been friends for almost 10 years. We met when we were living in the Jordanian capital, Amman, in 2005. Both of us spent months in Libya during the 2011 revolution, where I met James Foley and Steven Sotloff – known to their friends as Jim and Steve. 
We often shared cars to get to the front line as it see-sawed across the desert of eastern Libya. Jim Foley stood out for his laid-back nature, his generosity and his ready smile. We had a friend in common who had studied journalism with Jim in Chicago but opted to report on the American educational system instead of war. 



Foley was later captured – for the first time – by Muammar Gadafy’s forces and held for several weeks. “It was a kind of siren song that called me out to the front lines,” he told students at his alma mater, Marquette University, in Milwaukee, in December 2011, before returning to the Middle East. “It’s not enough to see it from the distance.”
Steve Sotloff, who describes himself as a “stand-up philosopher from Miami” in his Twitter bio, could be irreverent in both English and Arabic. He became firm friends with several Libyan revolutionaries, including one musician known for bringing his guitar to battle, and who appreciated his droll sense of humour. 
All four of us went on to report from rebel-held territories in northern Syria, witnessing from summer 2012 onwards the first signs of how a popular uprising against President Bashar al-Assad became hijacked by extremists who later coalesced into what became Islamic State.
 The video The group’s rise in recent months, including its extraordinary sweep across northern Iraq, has alarmed regional players and prompted US air strikes in an effort to stem its advance. Foley’s executioners claimed they killed him in response to the attacks. 
                                    	                                    The video of Foley’s beheading, which the increasingly media-savvy Islamic State posted on YouTube for maximum impact on what would have been his 636th day in captivity, opens with footage of President Barack Obama explaining his decision to order the bombing of Islamic State positions. It then cuts to Foley, shaven-headed and dressed in orange clothing, kneeling in an arid landscape. A black-clad militant holds a knife to his throat. Foley’s name appears onscreen in both English and Arabic. 
Speaking in a monotone, Jim Foley says his impending death comes in retaliation for the air raids, describing them as “the last nail in my coffin”. He goes on to utter his final words: “I wish I had more time. I wish I could have the hope of freedom and seeing my family once again. But that ship has sailed. I guess, all in all, I wish I wasn’t American.” 
After his killing the camera settles on a man clearly identifiable as Steve Sotloff, minus his usual beard and squinting without his wire-rimmed glasses but dressed in the same orange Guantánamo-like clothes as Jim Foley. The masked man grabs his collar and declares: “The life of this American citizen, Obama, depends on your next decision.”
 Captured journalists The last time I met Steve Sotloff was in July last year. We had lunch in Istanbul, where he was then based. I had just returned from a trip to the borderlands between Turkey and Syria, where I had tried to glean any information I could on Nicolas Hénin’s whereabouts. 
                                    	                                    Hénin had messaged me the day he was captured that June. I was part of a small team of friends and colleagues who had been working on his case since then, reaching out to our network of contacts inside Syria to find out where he was being held and by whom. 
That day Sotloff and I discussed all the journalists we knew who had been kidnapped – Nicolas Hénin, Jim Foley and others who have not been publicly identified. I told Steve not to go back to Syria, that it was too dangerous. My advice fell on deaf ears. Days later I was told he had been abducted. 
At Nicolas Hénin’s wedding last weekend he and two other former hostages – a French photographer and a Danish photographer – told me that during their long days in captivity he had often recalled my warning to him. They spoke of Jim Foley’s stoicism throughout an ordeal that got worse when their kidnappers discovered while searching his laptop that his brother was in the US air force. “He became a scapegoat,” said Hénin, who shared a room with him for seven months. The others remember Jim trying to make light of the beatings, trying to survive through humour. 



All have been knocked sideways by his killing. “He died as I knew him: with great dignity,” Hénin says. “This is not a guy who will complain or whine. He stayed dignified to the end.”
 Killings on film Jim Foley’s shocking murder was a scenario many had feared, suspecting that Islamic State had been deliberately capturing westerners, including journalists and aid workers, to use as possible leverage in the future. 
                                    	                                    The Committee to Protect Journalists, which Foley told his fellow hostages he hoped to work for when he was released, has called Syria the most dangerous country in the world for journalists. According to its most recent figures, more than 80 reporters have been kidnapped. About 20 are currently missing; many of them are believed to be held by Islamic State.
The tactic of killing foreigners on film is reminiscent of al-Qaeda in Iraq, the group’s forebear, which decapitated a number of westerners between 2004 and 2007. Its Jordanian leader, Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, earned the sobriquet “Sheikh of the Slaughterers” because of his preference for personally beheading captives, who were usually dressed in orange clothing similar to what Foley and Sotloff wore in this week’s video. 
Zarqawi’s methods proved too extreme for al-Qaeda’s then deputy leader Ayman al-Zawahiri, who told him to use a gun instead. Zarqawi was later killed in a US strike, but his cadre re-emerged in Syria under the name Islamic State of Iraq and ash-Sham (an Arabic term broadly meaning the Levant), or Isis. 
Their ruthless ways of dealing not just with Assad loyalists but with entire communities in rebel-held northern Syria led to al-Qaeda formally breaking all ties to the group this year. In light of its new territorial gains, Isis recently truncated its name to Islamic State.
In Iraq, Islamic State fighters have occupied Tikrit and the northern city of Mosul since early June, plus swathes of the country’s north and west. More than 1.5 million people have been displaced by fighting there since the group’s lightning advance began, more than two months ago, and thousands more have died. 
Its leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, who has declared a caliphate across territory that Islamic State controls in Iraq and neighbouring Syria, draws on powerful religious symbolism in an effort to legitimise a group that many view as merely unschooled – but dangerous – rabble. 
 Foreign, not Syrian A recent documentary aired by Vice News provided an unprecedented glimpse of life as it is now lived inside Raqqa, the northern Syrian city that Islamic State seized last year and currently considers its capital. 
                                    	                                    Raqqa is where Nicolas Hénin was captured last year. For months after his kidnapping I was in contact with activists in the city who described to me how Islamic State imposed its will through fear and intimidation. 
Demonstrations against the jihadists petered out after they started publicly executing alleged transgressors. “Our Raqqa is just a shadow of what it once was,” one resident said. “These people rule through brute force.”
The Vice documentary shows swaggering Islamic State fighters indoctrinating young children to kill “infidels” and patrolling the city for any signs of behaviour considered “un-Islamic” according to their austere interpretation of the faith. 
It also shows scenes of crucified corpses and the severed heads of regime soldiers killed in battle. What is striking about the film is that few of the Islamic State fighters who feature in it have Syrian accents – a great number within the wider movement are foreigners. 
Tunisians, Libyans, Iraqis and Saudis constitute the largest nationalities, but there are also Europeans. The militant filmed killing Jim Foley speaks with what sounds like a London accent; he is thought to be one of a number of British jihadists collectively known as “the Beatles”. 



A French journalist freed earlier this year said one of his captors sang Charles Aznavour ballads despite the extremists’ denunciation of music. Mehdi Nemmouche , the young French man arrested over the shooting dead of three people at a Jewish museum in Brussels in May, had spent time in Syria. When he was apprehended in southern France, he was carrying weapons wrapped in a sheet scrawled with the name of Isis.
Islamic State may have been birthed in Iraq but it found a whole new purpose in the midst of Syria’s devastating war, which has left more than 170,000 dead and displaced over nine million others in what many consider the worst humanitarian crisis in decades. 
Such is Islamic State’s brutality in Raqqa and other parts of northern Syria it is not uncommon to hear locals there repeat conspiracy theories claiming it is in cahoots with Assad, given his regime’s role in facilitating the stream of jihadists to Iraq after the US invasion in 2003. 
 Threat to the region Islamic State’s ranks have been swollen by predominantly young men, some even in their teens, from a multitude of countries who are drawn by its uncompromising approach and the camaraderie of battle. 
                                    	                                    But several former jihadists, particularly those who fought the Soviets in Afghanistan in the 1980s, say they are greatly unsettled by the ascendancy of Islamic State. “These kids have been influenced by the extreme violence and confusion of ideologies they have been exposed to on the internet,” says one man whose father was a prominent figure in the war against the Soviets. “Because of this it is more difficult to control than anything that has gone before.” 
An Arab diplomat offers a chilling assessment: “This is a virus that poses not just a security threat but an ideological threat to the whole region.”
The US must now weigh the risks of adopting a more aggressive strategy to rout what Obama this week called the “cancer” of Islamic State against any action that could result in the death of another American. 
In an emotional speech Obama paid tribute to Foley and accused Islamic State of “cowardly acts of violence” and abuses including enslavement and sexual assault. 
From their home in New Hampshire, Jim Foley’s parents, who had campaigned tirelessly for his release, implored their son’s killers to spare the lives of Steve Sotloff and other hostages. “Like Jim, they are innocents,” his mother, Diane, said. “They have no control over American government policy in Iraq, Syria or anywhere in the world.”
