What Our Customers Say

 We surveyed members who have used the club in the last 90 days to get input on facility and equipment upgrades ... 46% of people voted for the Cleaning station, making it #2 choice over “all” equipment, over iPod charges on cardio, over a membership rewards program, over Coffee service, over an updated website. Wow! ... Considering the low price of these units, it’s the best bang for the buck we will spend this year, hands down!!!

				*Performance data quoted represents past performance. Past performance is not a guarantee of future
				results and current performance may be higher or lower than performance quoted. Investment returns
				and principal value will fluctuate and shares when sold or redeemed, may be worth more or less than
				their original cost. 
				

 
				After Tax Held returns represent return after taxes on distributions. Assumes shares have not been sold.
				After Tax Sold returns represent the return after taxes on distributions and the sale of fund shares. Returns
				do not represent the returns you would receive if you traded shares at other times. Market Price returns are 
                based on the midpoint of the bid/ask spread on the stock exchange on which shares of the fund are listed for 
                trading as of the time that the fund’s NAV is calculated. Returns are average annualized total returns, except
				those for periods of less than one year, which are cumulative. The fund's performance reflects fee waivers
				and expense reimbursements, absent which performance would have been lower. 
			

				After-tax returns are calculated using the historical highest individual federal marginal income tax rates and
				do not reflect the impact of state and local taxes. Actual after-tax returns depend on the investor’s tax
				situation and may differ from those shown. The after-tax returns shown are not relevant to investors who hold
				their fund shares through tax-deferred arrangements such as 401(k) plans or individual retirement accounts.

Footnotes


1
The NAV represents the fund's net assets (assets less liabilities) divided by the fund's outstanding shares .


2
Fund shares are purchased and sold on an exchange at their share price rather than net asset value (NAV), which may cause the shares to trade at a price greater than NAV (premium) or less than NAV (discount).


3
Most recent distribution paid or declared to today's date. Subject to change in the future. There is no guarantee that the fund will declare dividends.


4
The 30-day SEC yield is calculated by dividing the net investment income per share earned during the most recent 30-day period by the maximum offering price per share on the last day of the period and includes the effects of fee waivers and expense reimbursements, if applicable.


5
The unsubsidized 30-day SEC yield is calculated the same as the 30-day SEC yield, however it excludes contractual fee waivers and expense reimbursements.

        ETF Characteristics
    

		The fund lists and principally trades its shares on The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC.	
	
The fund's return may not match the return of the NASDAQ Clean Edge® Smart Grid Infrastructure IndexSM.  Securities held by the fund will generally not be bought or sold in response to market fluctuations.

		Investors buying or selling fund shares on the secondary market may incur customary brokerage commissions. 
		Market prices may differ to some degree from the net asset value of the shares. Investors who sell fund shares may receive less than the share's net 
		asset value. Shares may be sold throughout the day on the exchange through any brokerage account. However, unlike mutual funds, shares may only be 
		redeemed directly from the fund by authorized participants, in very large creation/redemption units. If the fund's authorized participants are unable 
        to proceed with creation/redemption orders and no other authorized participant is able to step forward to create or redeem, fund shares may trade at 
        a discount to the fund's net asset value and possibly face delisting.	
	





Risk Considerations


    The fund's shares will change in value, and you could lose money by investing in the fund. One of the principal risks of investing in the fund is market risk. Market risk is the risk that a particular stock owned by the fund, fund shares or stocks in general may fall in value. There can be no assurance that the fund's investment objective will be achieved.
    

    The fund may invest in small capitalization and mid capitalization companies. Such companies may experience greater price volatility than larger, more established companies.


    An investment in a fund containing securities of non-U.S. issuers is subject to additional risks, including currency fluctuations, political risks, withholding, the lack of adequate financial information, and exchange control restrictions impacting non-U.S. issuers. The fund may invest in depositary receipts which may be less liquid than the underlying shares in their primary trading market.


    The fund invests in industrials companies, which are subject to certain risks, including include the general state of the economy, intense competition, consolidation, domestic and international politics, excess capacity and consumer demand and spending trends. They may also be significantly affected by overall capital spending levels, economic cycles, technical obsolescence, delays in modernization, labor relations, and government regulations.


    Smart grid companies can be negatively affected by high costs of research and development, high capital requirements for implementation, government regulations, limited ability of industrial and utility companies to implement new technologies and uncertainty of the ability of new products to penetrate established industries.


    The fund is classified as "non-diversified" and may invest a relatively high percentage of its assets in a limited number of issuers. As a result, the fund may be more susceptible to a single adverse economic or regulatory occurrence affecting one or more of these issuers, experience increased volatility and be highly concentrated in certain issuers.


    First Trust Advisors L.P. is the adviser to the fund. First Trust Advisors L.P. is an affiliate of First Trust Portfolios L.P., the fund's distributor.

GRID Fund Description
The First Trust NASDAQ Clean Edge Smart Grid Infrastructure ETF tracks a market-cap-weighted index of companies in the grid and electrical energy infrastructure sector.
  
GRID FactSet Analytics Insight
GRID is a niche fund if ever there was one, targeting a select group of companies determined to be in the smart grid industry by Clean Edge. Just three of GRID's 40 holdings are in our benchmark, as the fund has a completely different mandate than our global infrastructure benchmark. To enhance exposure to the heart of the smart grid market, the index provider uses a tiered weighting scheme that gives more weight to pure-play firms. GRID charges the highest fee in the segment for this very specific exposure (70 bps), and after you factor in the fund's poor tracking and weak liquidity, you could end up paying two or three times that for a round-trip trade. If you can get past the high cost, it is an interesting strategy that's been hot at times.

the need for basic resources like food, water and electricity in communities overseas. This
led him to encourage the development of technologies capable of producing these resources

into hubs for a community, marketplace, school or hospital anywhere in the world.
