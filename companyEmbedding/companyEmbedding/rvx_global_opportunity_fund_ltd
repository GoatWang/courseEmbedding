What a constant stream of oil company spending cuts means for crude prices
              
              Oil companies are sounding a recurring theme: lower exploration and production spending estimates. Will that lead to a rally in oil prices?

How Venezuela chaos could spark oil rally OPEC has failed to achieve 
              
              Political and economic turmoil in Venezuela could fuel a rise in oil prices—something the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, despite it’s efforts to cut back production, hasn’t been able to do.

A quarter of S&P 500’s 2017 climb due to five stocks (yes, those five)
              
              Throughout 2017, there’s one acronym that investors have in particular been sinking their teeth into: FAANG.

Watch out: ‘Kids’ are making the most money in this stock market 
              
              Those who are old enough to remember past bear markets, in contrast, look outdated and old-fashioned, says Mark Hulbert.

Extremely low volatility could lead to a sharp, but short-lived, decline in stocks 
              
              Still, a chart of the S&P 500 reveals an undercurrent of bullishness, says Lawrence G. McMillan.

Who trades options the most? Millennial investors
              
              Millennials are frequently criticized by market experts for the way they invest—or, more accurately, the way they’re not investing—but recent research indicates that at least some young market participants are going about things in a more sophisticated way than they’re typically given credit for.

Dollar spins wheels ahead of GDP report expected to show faster clip of growth
              
              The U.S. dollar churned lower against most rivals save for the depreciating Swiss franc on Friday ahead of an update on the broadest measure of the U.S. economy—a GDP report that could help shape the Federal Reserve’s so far slow-moving approach to interest rates.

Dollar rises from 13-month low

RVX Asset Management – Targeted investing across Global Emerging Markets






































 











 












 





















 





Targeted investing across Global Emerging Markets.We believe capital appreciation should not be constrained by a country or an asset class.The long-term performance of the fund is primarily determined by our ability to allocate capital to the optimal investment product for each opportunity. This helps diversify our returns to provide further stability.We strive to comprehend the fundamental, economic and financial characteristics of our investments so they make sense on multiple levels.Our primary focus is to be constantly perfecting the portfolio’s asset mix so we can generate superior risk-adjusted returns throughout market cycles and protect the capital growth of our investments. 






Welcome to RVX Asset Management

 


Investment Approach

 


Emerging and Frontier markets provide economic growth and opportunity.
Seek to generate alpha while managing volatility.
Utilize top-down thematic and bottom-up fundamental research.
Use proprietary models to enhance universe definition and research.





Capabilities

 


Equities: Long-only GEMS and Frontier Markets.
Fixed Income: Long and Short Corporates and Sovereigns (cash bonds and derivatives).
Foreign Exchange: Global developed as well as local currencies.





Firm Overview

 


Composed of 12 professionals, with over 265 years of combined years of experience in equities, corporate and sovereign bonds, FX, operations, compliance and client service.
Continuing a 16-year core team history.
Management has ownership and private external backing.







We believe Emerging Markets are a primary force for global economic growth and have a multitude of investment opportunities for many years to come.

 


Our Philosophy

 


We See Extraordinary Opportunity Across Emerging and Frontier Markets.

 


We believe Emerging and Frontier (E&F) markets are a primary force for global economic growth and can structurally improve a portfolio through diversification and risk adjusted returns.
We believe there are E&F market opportunities that are under-followed and under-appreciated, creating opportunities to add Alpha in properly understood situations.

*Sources: Per Morningstar, from 2001 through 2015 the highest performing cumulative fixed income and equity categories were Emerging Market Debt (e.g. the JP Morgan EMBI) and EM Equities (e.g. the Morningstar EM Index.)



We Believe in Risk Managed Investing.

 


We strive to identify multiple risk exposures in our portfolios.
Maximum portfolio positions are determined for various categories such as individual securities, country and sector.
Management subjectively weighs each investment to balance return objectives versus potential for risk. When in doubt, we endeavour to consistently favour risk mitigation over return maximization.
We not only focus on the risk of each position but also overall portfolio risk.




We Establish Client-focused Targets and Communication.

 


We work with clients to determine performance goals.
We strive to achieve clients’ return as well as volatility expectations.
We endeavor to provide timely and clear understanding and insights into our strategies, markets and performance.




**Sources: IMF Report (12/2015), MSCI (1/2016)

 


Investment Process

 


We Invest Using Top-Down Thematic & Bottom-Up Fundamental Approaches.

 








Monitor global macroeconomic, geopolitical and industry trends.
Use extensive global network (i.e. global and local banks or brokers, sell side and buy side relationships) to source new ideas.
Isolate long-term value opportunities and price dislocations using proprietary screening methods.










Execute fundamental analysis of security-specific factors including business financial models, and competitive landscapes.
Assess valuation considerations.










Subject to Client Investment Guidelines, select the specific investment and establish a target price, position size and return targets.
Strategic investment execution: build/sell positions without impacting the market.










Determine potential risks for each asset class and run stress tests for each scenario.
Monitor potential macro risks and maintain stringent reporting controls.





THE RVX ADVANTAGE

 


What makes us different.

 

Flexibility and Breadth

Emerging and Frontier markets are increasingly more complex. Single asset class expertise is no longer sufficient to bring clients sustainable value over time.

Emerging Markets are in our DNA

Several members of our management team have both invested in and traveled to Emerging and Frontier countries for over two decades. Many of us have lived in EM countries for a significant part of our lives.

Teamwork

Our team is primarily composed of people who have worked together before and have known one another over several years. Senior team members have ownership.

Experience and Perspective

RVX’s greatest strength is our combined 140+ year experience in our markets. Having a classically trained economist to provide macro strategy alongside rigorous bottom-up analytical talent truly sets the investment team apart.

Proprietary Technology

Equity screening methodologies and valuation models drive the research process and for scale and consistency.
Sovereign Credit and Foreign Exchange models.
