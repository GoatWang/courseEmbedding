        	7.28.2017
        


Recap: Gains in oil prices were extended for the third straight session, with oil futures trading close to a two-month high. Traders are beginning to broaden their focus, not only to encompass the U.S. stockpile situation and OPEC output cuts, but geopolitical risk as well. Coming into view are strikes in Venezuela  that are now into their second day, sanctions against Iran, and heightened tensions with North Korea. On the other side, is the U.S. rig count, which, if oil prices rise, so will the rig count.
September WTI settled up 29 cents, or 0.6% at $49.04 a barrel, while September Brent settled at $51.49, up 52 cents, or 1.02%.
RBOB was clearly the largest percentage gainer on the day, gaining 1.7%, finishing at their highest level since May 24. August RBOB rose 2.7 cents, or 1.7%, to $1.645 a gallon, while August heating oil added under a penny to $1.603 a gallon.
Fundamental News:  Kuwait joined the UAE in promising to produce less oil after Saudi Arabia called on fellow OPEC producers to cut more supply to help cut the global oversupply.  Kuwait Petroleum Corp has agreed with customers in the US to reduce contractual sales volumes of oil for 2017.  This came a day after UAE Minister of Energy, Suhail Al Mazrouei said Abu Dhabi National Oil Co would cut shipments of Murban, Das and Upper Zakum crudes by 10% starting in September.
Royal Dutch Shell Chief Executive, Ben van Beurden, said the company is preparing for “lower forever” oil prices.  He said that with oil prices around $50/barrel and forecasts of only a modest recovery by the end of the decade, Shell was not planning to stop its cost cutting drive.   He stated that the company was getting fit for oil prices of $40/barrel.  Shell oil and gas production in the second quarter fell to 3.495 million bpd of oil equivalent from 3.752 million bpd of oil equivalent in the first quarter.  Separately, he said the world’s oil consumption could peak as early as the end of the net decade as electric vehicles become more popular.  On Wednesday, Britain announced plans to ban diesel and gasoline vehicles by 2040, following a similar move by France.  He said under the company’s most aggressive scenario of battery-powered vehicles replacing traditional internal combustion engines, consumption of oil will peak in the early 2030s.  He added that with a high use of biofuels, demand could peak by the late 2020s.  However, he stated that oil will still be needed for decades to come as it is likely to remain the main fuel for planes, ships and heavy trucks.   
Goldman Sachs Equity Research said recent inventory draws have been favorable and suggest the market is beginning to rebalance.  It said $45-$50/barrel WTI price signal needed to effectively constrain shale and restrain OPEC production. 
US shale producers have started to cut their 2017 capital spending budgets.  Anadarko Petroleum Corp, ConocoPhillips, Whiting Petroleum Corp and Hess Corp cut a combined $750 million from their capex plans. 
Gasoline stocks held in the Amsterdam-Rotterdam-Antwerp terminal in the week ending July 27th increased by 6.93% on the week but fell by 32.71% on the year to 864,000 tons, while gasoil stocks fell by 0.49% on the week and by 12.95% on the year to 2.817 million tons.


Early Market Call - as of 9:00 AM EDT
WTI - Sep $ 49.24, up 20 cents
RBOB - Aug $1.6582, up 1.34 cents
HO - Aug $1.6149, up 1.09 cents

On Thursday, July 27th – settlement day for the August Contract – the front-month NYMEX Natural Gas Futures Contracts opened at $2.919, slightly below Wednesday’s closing price of $2.924.  Trading evenly as markets opened, a modest rise near 10:00AM soon surged higher as prices reacted to news of a bullish storage injection.  Recording the intraday high of $2.998 at 10:30AM, choppy trading ensued into the early afternoon as the contract toed the $2.960 mark.  August settled at $2.969 to finish higher on Thursday, while the more actively traded September contract closed five cents higher at $2.967.
The EIA Natural Gas Storage Report published on Thursday showed a 17 BCF injection to storage for the week ended July 21st – below the market estimate of 22 BCF.  Total working gas in storage was reported as 2,990 BCF; 9.2% below this time last year and 3.9% above the five-year average.
This morning in Globex, WTI Crude was up five cents; Natural Gas was up slightly; Heating Oil was up one cent; and, Gasoline was up one cent.   Additionally, cash prices were higher in New York and New England.
