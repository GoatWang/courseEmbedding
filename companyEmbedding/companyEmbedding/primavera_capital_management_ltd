Primavera Capital Planning





Whether public or private sector, every organization looks to maximize the return on its project investments. Resource and budget limitations place a premium on making the right decisions on which projects to include in the capital plan. Oracle’s Primavera Capital Planning gives planners and project execution personnel a common platform for the collaborative management of project portfolios to ensure the most-efficient use of capital funds.
Primavera Capital Planning provides the tools to manage all of the prospective and on-going projects in your project portfolios.  Develop multiple scenarios, include both top-down and bottom-up cash flow models, and approve portfolios for execution.  Manage different project initiatives in their own portfolios.  Included are complementary modules for document management, phase gate control, reporting and more. Primavera Capital Planning is part of the integrated Primavera Unifier offering.

	Powerful Multi-Portfolio Project Planning


Create multiple portfolios for different initiatives or project types (e.g. capital and expense,)

		Manage long term multi-year portfolios with varying timescale granularities and any project attributes across the portfolio lifecycle

		Build multiple scenarios and varying cash flow spreads; compare planner’s top-down data with real-time cash flow from on-going projects

		Include cash flow targets per period to visualize variances from plan

		Robust permission controls by role to manage access to view, edit, and approve

		Includes powerful document management, dashboards, and reports

From Ideas to Approved Portfolio
Primavera Unifier’s Web-based platform fosters and controls the collection of project requests from across the organization. You can use preconfigured project attributes or configure your own forms. All prospective projects are available for inclusion in portfolio scenarios for comparison and ultimate selection for approval. Project information is displayed in an intuitive grid format for easy manipulation of large volumes of data.
With Primavera Capital Planning, you can create multiyear plans with information from ongoing projects rolling into subsequent period portfolios.In addition, you can manage multiple types of portfolios with different project types, with roll-up reporting across the entire organization.

Detailed Cash Flow Forecasting
Primavera Unifier’s best-in-class cash flow forecasting engine provides an unparalleled ability to manage both top-down and bottom-up planned, actual, and forecasted costs. You can choose the overall duration and granularity of the capital portfolio and then set target budgets per period. Adding and removing prospective projects to the portfolio allows direct comparison to the target amounts per cash flow period.
Planners can define planned cash flow as a top-down budget that can optionally be viewed by the project execution team once projects are underway. Similarly, actuals and forecast updates by the project teams are also visible by the planner in a comprehensive portfolio grid.

Linked Project Information
By linking portfolio projects to the actual projects in execution, planners have full visibility to all of the desired project attributes, including the project cash flow information. Projects can be individually linked or unlinked, allowing planners to capture alternate project information to be compared as baselines to the project already in execution.

Document Management
Primavera Capital Planning includes the robust Document Manager module, with the ability to store documentation at the overall organizational level or at any level of the hierarchy. Whether high-level basis-of-design documents or detailed specifications, all documentation utilizes tight permission controls to manage access across the enterprise and supply chain. Features include check-in and check-out, version control, and full text search for all Microsoft Office documents. Users can utilize Oracle’s AutoVue technology to view and mark up hundreds of different file types without the need to install the native application.

Dashboards and Reporting
Manage capital planning at any level of the organization’s hierarchy, with each level utilizing Primavera Unifier’s standard dashboard module. All dashboards are individually configurable to be able to roll up desired information in graphical or tabular formats. Additionally, the Primavera Unifier User-Defined Reports module allows fully configurable reports during project execution.

Hedging Strategies

Simple Short Exposure. This strategy effectively shorts the S&P 500 by
        buying shares in the S&P 500 Short ETF.
        Simple Hedging will assume that 100%
        of the backtest's invested principal is always in the backtest's long positions.

        For example, if you choose a 25% hedging rate, then for a $10,000 portfolio,
        you will be long $10,000 and have a $2,500 short on the S&P 500.
        The short position will adjust each rebalancing period to match 25% of the total portfolio.
        Any gains/losses from the short are added to the overall available capital for the long positions in the
        portfolio.
      

Moving Average Hedge.  With this strategy, your portfolio will be hedged
        by shorting the S&P 500 whenever your long portfolio's performance drops below the monthly moving average.
        So if you set a 25% hedge, 25% of your long portfolio will be sold and the funds reallocated to the short
        whenever the hedge is in effect.
        Once your long portfolio performance goes back over the moving average, the short hedge will be removed
        and the funds from the short will be reallocated to your long positions.
      

        When hedging strategies are being used, backtests can only go back as far as 2006.  This is the date
        the S&P 500 Short ETF first appeared.

Stock Sell Buffer

      You can optionally include a stock sell buffer in your backtesting model.
      It works by keeping a stock in your portfolio even when it would otherwise drop out
      during rebalancing as long as it remains within your sell buffer threshold.
      For example, you are backtesting with the top 20 stocks each quarter and set a sell buffer of 50.
      In the first quarter, AAPL is one of the top 20 stocks and is included in the portfolio.
      In quarter 2, AAPL drops down to number 25. Without the sell buffer, AAPL would drop out
      for that quarter, but since it is still within the sell buffer threshold of 50,
      it will remain in the portfolio.
      Your portfolio size remains the same. The stocks that would have fallen out stay in and the
      stocks that would otherwise have been added stay out. Using the sell buffer may
      help produce a lower turnover rate.
    

      Sell Buffer Size (must be greater than # of holdings in portfolio to work):
      
No sell buffer
10
25
35
50
100




Rebalancing Frequency

      By default backtester rebalances quarterly using new 13F filing data. You can
      adjust the rebalancing frequency using the dropdown below. Reasons for
      changing the frequency include lower turnover and possible tax advantages
      by keeping stocks at least one year before selling.
    


        Do not rebalance after each quarter

or rebalance:
        
Every quarter (default)
 Every other quarter
 Once a year




How many days after the end-of-quarter date before doing the backtest? (0 - 60)

      Or use day whenever the filing was submitted to the SEC
      (or the last filing when using a group of funds):

      By default backtester will test your strategy using all available dates going back to 2001 (for subscribers only).
      You can optionally adjust when the backtest actually starts.
