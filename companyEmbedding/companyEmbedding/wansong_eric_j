Tangoe Announces Executive Changes


Mike Sheridan joins as Chief Revenue Officer and Eric J. Wansong

      joins as Senior Vice President of Global Operations

 ORANGE, Conn.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--

      Tangoe,

      Inc. (NASDAQ:TNGO), a leading global provider of IT and Telecom

      Expense Management (TEM) software and related services, today announced

      that Mike Sheridan has joined the company as Chief Revenue Officer,

      succeeding Michael Pray who is leaving to pursue other opportunities,

      and Eric J. Wansong has joined the company as Senior Vice President of

      Global Operations, succeeding Scott Snyder who is also leaving to pursue

      other opportunities. Sheridan and Wansong will report directly to CEO,

      James Foy.

    


      Sheridan brings three decades of experience leading and building

      customer-centric enterprise sales teams and will be responsible for all

      aspects of the Sales organization, which includes direct sales, account

      management, business development, and channel sales. Prior to joining

      Tangoe, Sheridan held executive sales leadership positions at

      Vizolution, Talend, and Aspect Software, where he led a global sales and

      professional services team of 600 people in sales, pre-sales, inside

      sales, channel, professional services, field marketing, and sales

      operations. Sheridan earned a Bachelor's degree in Electrical

      Engineering and Technology from Bradley University and a Master's degree

      in Computer Science from DePaul University.

    


      Wansong also brings three decades of experience and will be responsible

      for all aspects of the Operations organization, which includes global

      service delivery, implementation and on-boarding, customer help desk,

      lifecycle audit, inventory management and provisioning. Prior to joining

      Tangoe, Wansong held leadership positions at VMware, where he most

      recently established an award-winning customer advocacy organization and

      led a number of global customer support and operations teams. Prior to

      this he was Vice President Support Services at SAP and held support

      services, professional services, and business development leadership

      roles at Business Objects, which was acquired by SAP. Prior to Business

      Objects, Wansong co-founded and was the President and COO of Acurion and

      also served as VP of Sales at Synetics. Wansong earned a Bachelor's

      degree in Business Administration from Ithaca College.

    


      "Tangoe serves critical telecom and mobile expense management needs for

      some of the world's largest corporations, and we are focused on making

      the customer experience as seamless, positive, and efficient as

      possible," Foy said. "With this in mind, we believe Mike's and Eric's

      success in customer-centric sales and operations throughout their

      careers will make them extremely valuable members of the Tangoe

      executive management team. We are very grateful for Michael's and

      Scott's service and tenure at Tangoe and wish them the best in their

      future endeavors."
