A joint venture involves two or more businesses pooling their resources and expertise to achieve a particular goal. The risks and rewards of the enterprise are also shared.
The reasons behind forming a joint venture include business expansion, development of new products or moving into new markets, particularly overseas.
Your business may have strong potential for growth and you may have innovative ideas and products. However, a joint venture could give you:


more resources
greater capacity
increased technical expertise
access to established markets and distribution channels


Entering into a joint venture is a major decision. This guide provides an overview of the main ways in which you can set up a joint venture, the advantages and disadvantages of doing so, how to assess if you are ready to commit, what to look for in a joint venture partner and how to make it work.


Types of joint venture
Joint venture - benefits and risks
Assess your readiness for a joint venture
Plan your joint venture relationship
Choosing the right joint venture partner

Ending a joint venture


Types of joint venture
How you set up a joint venture depends on what you are trying to achieve.
One option is to agree to co-operate with another business in a limited and specific way. For example, a small business with an exciting new product might want to sell it through a larger company's distribution network. The two partners could agree to a contract setting out the terms and conditions of how this would work.
Alternatively, you might want to set up a separate joint venture business, possibly a new company, to handle a particular contract. A joint venture company like this can be a very flexible option. The partners each own shares in the company and agree on how it should be managed.
In some circumstances, other options may work better than a business corporation. For example, you could form a business partnership. You might even decide to completely merge your two businesses.
To help you decide what form of joint venture is best for you, you should consider whether you want to be involved in managing it. You should also think about what might happen if the venture goes wrong and how much risk you are prepared to accept.
It's worth taking legal advice to help identify your best option. The way you set up your joint venture affects how you run it and how any profits are shared and taxed. It also affects your liability if the venture goes wrong. You need a clear legal agreement setting out how the joint venture will work and how any income will be shared. See the page in this guide on how to create a joint venture agreement.
Joint venture - benefits and risks
Businesses of any size can use joint ventures to strengthen long-term relationships or to collaborate on short-term projects.
A successful joint venture can offer:


access to new markets and distribution networks
increased capacity
sharing of risks and costs with a partner
access to greater resources, including specialised staff, technology and finance


A joint venture can also be very flexible. For example, a joint venture can have a limited life span and only cover part of what you do, thus limiting the commitment for both parties and the business' exposure.
Joint ventures are especially popular with businesses in the transport and travel industries that operate in different countries.
The risks of joint ventures
Partnering with another business can be complex. It takes time and effort to build the right relationship. Problems are likely to arise if:


the objectives of the venture are not 100 per cent clear and communicated to everyone involved
the partners have different objectives for the joint venture
there is an imbalance in levels of expertise, investment or assets brought into the venture by the different partners
different cultures and management styles result in poor integration and cooperation
the partners don't provide sufficient leadership and support in the early stages


Success in a joint venture depends on thorough research and analysis of aims and objectives. This should be followed up with effective communication of the business plan to everyone involved.
Assess your readiness for a joint venture
Setting up a joint venture can represent a major change to your business. However beneficial it may be to your potential for growth, it needs to fit with your overall business strategy.
It's important to review your business strategy before committing to a joint venture. This should help you define what you can realistically expect. In fact, you might decide that there are better ways to achieve your business aims. See our guide on how to assess your options for growth.
You may also want to look at what other businesses are doing, particularly those that operate in similar markets to yours. Seeing how they use joint ventures could help you choose the best approach for your business. At the same time, you could try to identify the skills they apply to partner successfully.
You can benefit from examining your own business. Be realistic about your strengths and weaknesses - consider performing a SWOT (strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats) analysis to discover whether the two businesses are a good fit. You will almost certainly want to find a joint venture partner that complements your own business' strengths and weaknesses.
You should take into account your employees' attitudes and bear in mind that people can feel threatened by a joint venture. It can also be difficult to build effective working relationships if your partner has a different way of doing things.
If you do decide to form a joint venture, it may well help your business to grow faster, increase productivity and generate greater profits. Joint ventures often enable growth without having to borrow funds or look for outside investors. You may also be able to use your joint venture partner's customer database to market your product, or offer your partner's services and products to your existing customers. Joint venture partners also benefit from being able to join forces in purchasing, research and development.
Plan your joint venture relationship
Before starting a joint venture, the parties involved need to understand what they each want from the relationship.
Smaller businesses often want to access a larger partner's resources, such as a strong distribution network, specialist employees and financial resources. The larger business might benefit from working with a more flexible, innovative partner, or simply from access to new products or intellectual property.
Similarly, you might decide to build a stronger relationship with a supplier. You might benefit from their knowledge of new technologies and get a better quality of service. The supplier's aim might be to strengthen their business from a guaranteed volume of sales to you.
Whatever your aims, the arrangement needs to be fair to both parties. Any deal should:


recognise what you each contribute
ensure that you both understand what the agreement is expected to achieve
set realistic expectations and allow success to be measured


The objectives on which you agree should be turned into a working relationship that encourages teamwork and trust. See the page in this guide on how to make your joint venture relationship work.
Choosing the right joint venture partner
The ideal partner in a joint venture is one that has resources, skills and assets that complement your own. The joint venture has to work contractually, but there should also be a good fit between the cultures of the two organisations.
A good starting place is to assess the suitability of existing customers and suppliers with whom you already have a long-term relationship. You could also think about your competitors or other professional associates. Broadly, you need to consider the following:


How well do they perform?
What is their attitude to collaboration and do they share your level of commitment?
Do you share the same business objectives?
Can you trust them?
Do their brand values complement yours?
What kind of reputation do they have?


If you opt to assess a new potential partner, you need to carry out some basic checks:


Are they financially secure?
Do they have any credit problems?
Do they already have joint venture partnerships with other businesses?
What kind of management team do they have in place?
How are they performing in terms of production, marketing and personnel?
What do their customers and suppliers say about their trustworthiness and reputation?


Before you consider signing up to a joint venture, it's important to protect your own interests. This should include drawing up legal documents to protect your own trade secrets and finding out whether your potential partner holds intellectual property rights agreements. Also, it's worth checking to see whether they have other agreements in place, either with their employees or consultants.
Create a joint venture agreement
When you decide to create a joint venture, you should set out the terms and conditions in a written agreement. This will help prevent any misunderstandings once the joint venture is up and running.
A written agreement should cover:


the structure of the joint venture, e.g. whether it will be a separate business in its own right
the objectives of the joint venture
the financial contributions you will each make
whether you will transfer any assets or employees to the joint venture
ownership of intellectual property created by the joint venture
management and control, e.g. respective responsibilities and processes to be followed
how liabilities, profits and losses are shared
how any disputes between the partners will be resolved
an exit strategy - see the page in this guide on ending a joint venture


You may also need other agreements, such as a confidentiality agreement to protect any commercial secrets you disclose.
It is essential to get independent expert advice before any final decisions are taken.
Make your joint venture relationship work
A clear agreement is an essential part of building a good relationship. Consider these ideas:


Get your relationship off to a good start. For example, you might include a project that you know will be a success so that the team working on the joint venture can start well, even if you could have completed it on your own.
Communication is a key part of building the relationship. It's usually a good idea to arrange regular, face-to-face meetings for all the key people involved in the joint venture.
Sharing information openly, particularly on financial matters, also helps avoid partners becoming suspicious of each other. The more trust there is, the better the chances that your relationship will work.
It's essential that everyone knows what you are trying to achieve and works towards the same goals. Establishing clear performance indicators lets you measure performance and can give you early warning of potential problems.
At the same time, you should aim for a flexible relationship. Regularly review how you could improve the way things work and whether you should change your objectives.
Even in the best relationship, you'll almost certainly have problems from time to time. Approach any disagreement positively, looking for "win-win" solutions rather than trying to score points off each other. Your original joint venture agreement should set out agreed dispute resolution procedures in case you are unable to resolve your differences yourselves.


For more information, see the page in this guide on how to create a joint venture agreement.
Ending a joint venture
Your business, your partner's business and your markets all change over time. A joint venture may be able to adapt to the new circumstances, but sooner or later most partnering arrangements come to an end. If your joint venture was set up to handle a particular project, it will naturally come to an end when the project is finished.
Ending a joint venture is always easiest if you have addressed the key issues in advance. A contractual joint venture, such as a distribution agreement, can include termination conditions. For example, you might each be allowed to give three months' notice to end the agreement. Alternatively, if you have set up a joint venture company, one option can be for one partner to buy the other out. The original agreement may typically require one partner to buy out the other.
The original agreement should also set out what will happen when the joint venture comes to an end. For example:


how shared intellectual property will be unbundled
how confidential information will continue to be protected
who will be entitled to any future income arising from the joint venture's activities
who will be responsible for any continuing liabilities, e.g. debts and guarantees given to customers


Even with a well-planned agreement, there are still likely to be issues to resolve. For example, you might need to agree who will continue to deal with a particular customer. Good planning and a positive approach to negotiation will help you arrange a friendly separation. This improves the chances that you can continue to trust each other and work together afterwards. It can also raise your profile in the business community as a reliable and productive partner.

The terms and conditions of this Agreement sets out the terms and conditions governing this association. 


IN CONSIDERATION OF and as a condition of the Members entering into this Agreement and other valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which consideration is acknowledged, the parties to this Agreement agree as follows:

monitoring, controlling and directing the financial, business and operational affairs of the Venture;

proper maintenance of books of account and financial records according to accepted accounting practices;

monitoring, analyzing and acting on all issues over which it would have express or implied authority according to this Agreement; and

All Members will contribute their respective Capital Contributions fully and on time.

Withdrawal of Capital

No Member will have the right to demand or withdraw any portion of their capital contribution without the express written consent of the remaining Members.

The Members will not be personally liable for the return of all or part of the Capital Contributions of a Member, except as otherwise provided in this Agreement.

Additional Capital

Capital Contributions may be amended from time to time, according to the requirements of the Joint Venture, by decision of the Members as recommended by the Manager. Where Members' interests are affected, additional capital contributions (the "Additional Capital Contributions") must have the unanimous consent of the Members.

Any advance of money to the Venture by any Member in excess of the amounts provided for in this Agreement or subsequently agreed to as an Additional Capital Contribution will be deemed a debt due from the Venture rather than an increase in Capital Contribution of the Member. This liability will be repaid with interest at such rates and times to be determined by a majority of the Members. This liability will not entitle the lending Member to a greater voting power. Such debts may have preference or priority over any other payments to Members as may be determined by a majority of the Members.

Capital Accounts

An individual capital account will be maintained for each Member and their initial Capital Contribution will be credited to this account. Any additional, approved contributions to the Venture's capital made by a Member will be credited to that Member's individual Capital Account.

Interest on Capital

No borrowing charge or loan interest will be due or payable to any Member on any Capital Contribution or on their Capital Account despite any disproportion that may from time to time arise among the Capital Accounts of the Members.

Books of Account

Accurate and complete books of account of the transactions of the Venture will be kept in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and at all reasonable times will be available and open to inspection and examination by any Member. The books and records of the Venture will reflect all the Venture’s transactions and will be appropriate and adequate for the business conducted by the Venture.

Banking and Venture Funds

The funds of the Venture will be placed in such investments and banking accounts as will be designated by the Members. Venture funds will be held in the name of the Venture and will not be commingled with those of any other person or entity.

Member Meetings

Regular Member meetings will be held as required. Minutes of the meetings will be maintained on file.

Any Member can call a special meeting to resolve urgent issues that require a vote and that cannot wait for the next regularly scheduled meeting. When calling a special meeting, all Members must be provided with reasonable notice. Where a special meeting has been called, the meeting will be restricted to the specific purpose for which the meeting was called.

All meetings will be held at a time and in a location that is reasonable, convenient and practical considering the situation of all Members.

Any vote required by the Members will be determined such that each Member receives one vote carrying equal weight.

Amendments

This Agreement may be amended only with the unanimous consent of all Members.

Admitting a new Member

New Members may be admitted into the Venture only with the unanimous consent of the existing Members. The new Member agrees to be bound by all the covenants, terms, and conditions of this Agreement, inclusive of all current and future amendments. Further, a new Member will execute such documents as are needed or required for this admission. Any new Member will receive a business interest in the Venture as determined by all other Members.

Dissociation of a Member

Where a Member is in breach of this Agreement and that Member has not remedied the breach on notice from the Venture and after a reasonable period then the remaining Members will have the right to terminate this Agreement with regard to that individual defaulting Member (an "Involuntary Withdrawal") and take whatever action necessary to protect the interests of the Venture.

If the Venture is harmed as the result of an individual Member's action or failure to act, then that individual Member will be liable for that harm. If more than one Member is at fault then they will be jointly and severally liable for that harm.

Each Member will indemnify the remaining Members against all losses, costs and claims that may arise in the event of the Venture being terminated as a result of breach of the Agreement by that Member.

If a Member is placed in bankruptcy, or withdraws voluntarily from the Venture, or if there is an Operation of Law against a Member, the other Members will be entitled to proceed as if the Member had breached this Agreement.

Distribution of any amount owing to a dissociated Member will be made according to the percentage of ownership as described in the Valuation of Interest or as otherwise may be agreed in writing.

Dissolution of the Joint Venture

The Venture will be dissolved and its assets liquidated in the event of any of the following:

the Term of the Venture expires and is not extended;

a unanimous vote by the Members to dissolve the Venture;

on satisfaction of the exclusive purpose of the Venture;

loss or incapacity through any means of substantially all of the Venture's assets; or

where only one Member remains.



Liquidation

On dissolution, the Venture will be liquidated promptly and within a reasonable time.

On the liquidation of the Venture assets, distribution of any amounts to Members will be made in proportion to their respective capital accounts or as otherwise may be agreed in writing.

Valuation of Interest

In the absence of a written agreement setting a value, the value of the Venture will be determined based on the fair market value appraisal of all Venture assets (less liabilities) in accordance with generally accepted accounting procedures (GAAP) by an independent accounting firm agreed to by all Members. An appraiser will be appointed within a reasonable period of the date of withdrawal or dissolution. The results of the appraisal will be binding on all Members. A withdrawing Member's interest will be based on the proportion of their respective capital account less any outstanding liabilities a Member may have to the Venture. The intent of this section is to ensure the survival of the Venture despite the withdrawal of any individual Member.

No allowance will be made for goodwill, trade name, patents or other intangible assets, except where those assets have been reflected on the Venture books immediately prior to valuation.

Transfer of Member Interest

Joint Venture Agreement
What is a Joint Venture Agreement?
A Joint Venture Agreement, also known as a Co-Venture Agreement, is used when two or more business entities or individuals enter into a temporary business relationship (joint venture) for the purposes of achieving a mutual goal. The Joint Venture Agreement sets out the terms and obligations of the members and the joint venture.
Types of Joint Ventures


Contractual: a contractual joint venture is where two or more parties agree to collaborate on a project, but do not set up a separate legal entity or pool the profits and losses. Each party keeps their accounting records separate and there are no registration requirements. 
General Partnership: a joint venture in the form of a general partnership is where the partners agree to share in the profits and losses from the mutual project and each party incurs unlimited liability for the obligations of the partnership. This type of joint venture is mainly used for real estate ventures and not for business endeavors related to research and product development.

Why do Businesses Form Joint Ventures?
Two parties form a joint venture when they wish to join forces for a common purpose where they will each share in the risk and reward. It allows each party to grow without having to look for outside funding. 
Other reasons businesses may enter into joint venture relationships are to gain access to wider markets, share resources, fund growth of another business, develop products, diversify, etc.
What is Included in a Joint Venture Agreement?
The following is included in a Joint Venture Agreement:

Place of business
The type of joint venture
Venture details, such as its name, address, purpose, etc.
Start and end date
Venture members and their capital contributions
Member duties and obligations
Meeting and voting details
Management, dissolution, and assignment of interest details
Non-compete, confidentiality, and dispute resolution clauses

Joint Venture vs. Partnership
A joint venture is typically made up of two or more individuals or businesses joining together to complete a project that is limited in scope and time. Its terms are defined under a Joint Venture Agreement. A partnership consists of two or more people who go into business together for the purposes of forming an ongoing business. A partnership is governed by a Partnership Agreement.
Joint Venture Advantages and Disadvantages
Collaborating with another business can offer the following benefits:

More financial or technical resources
Greater expertise and skills
Access to new markets and distribution channels
Larger capacity
Partner on new and existing products/services
Diversification
Flexibility and control over the terms of the relationship

Partnering with another business does offer its perks, but there are also some possible risks as well, including:

Imbalance in resources, expertise, or investment
Different management or leadership styles, or different workplace cultures
Poor planning, unclear objectives, or decision making that could lead to misunderstandings

monitoring, controlling and directing the financial, business and operational affairs of the Venture;

proper maintenance of books of account and financial records according to accepted accounting practices;

monitoring, analyzing and acting on all issues over which it would have express or implied authority according to this Agreement; and

$ USD
						




All Members will contribute their respective Capital Contributions fully and on time.

Withdrawal of Capital

No Member will have the right to demand or withdraw any portion of their capital contribution without the express written consent of the remaining Members.

The Members will not be personally liable for the return of all or part of the Capital Contributions of a Member, except as otherwise provided in this Agreement.

Additional Capital

Capital Contributions may be amended from time to time, according to the requirements of the Joint Venture, by decision of the Members as recommended by the Manager. Where Members' interests are affected, additional capital contributions (the "Additional Capital Contributions") must have the unanimous consent of the Members.

Any advance of money to the Venture by any Member in excess of the amounts provided for in this Agreement or subsequently agreed to as an Additional Capital Contribution will be deemed a debt due from the Venture rather than an increase in Capital Contribution of the Member. This liability will be repaid with interest at such rates and times to be determined by a majority of the Members. This liability will not entitle the lending Member to a greater voting power. Such debts may have preference or priority over any other payments to Members as may be determined by a majority of the Members.

Capital Accounts

An individual capital account will be maintained for each Member and their initial Capital Contribution will be credited to this account. Any additional, approved contributions to the Venture's capital made by a Member will be credited to that Member's individual Capital Account.

Interest on Capital

No borrowing charge or loan interest will be due or payable to any Member on any Capital Contribution or on their Capital Account despite any disproportion that may from time to time arise among the Capital Accounts of the Members.

Books of Account

Accurate and complete books of account of the transactions of the Venture will be kept in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and at all reasonable times will be available and open to inspection and examination by any Member. The books and records of the Venture will reflect all the Venture’s transactions and will be appropriate and adequate for the business conducted by the Venture.

Banking and Venture Funds

The funds of the Venture will be placed in such investments and banking accounts as will be designated by the Members. Venture funds will be held in the name of the Venture and will not be commingled with those of any other person or entity.

Member Meetings

Regular Member meetings will be held as required. Minutes of the meetings will be maintained on file.

Any Member can call a special meeting to resolve urgent issues that require a vote and that cannot wait for the next regularly scheduled meeting. When calling a special meeting, all Members must be provided with reasonable notice. Where a special meeting has been called, the meeting will be restricted to the specific purpose for which the meeting was called.

All meetings will be held at a time and in a location that is reasonable, convenient and practical considering the situation of all Members.

Any vote required by the Members will be determined such that each Member receives one vote carrying equal weight.

Amendments

This Agreement may be amended only with the unanimous consent of all Members.

Admitting a new Member

New Members may be admitted into the Venture only with the unanimous consent of the existing Members. The new Member agrees to be bound by all the covenants, terms, and conditions of this Agreement, inclusive of all current and future amendments. Further, a new Member will execute such documents as are needed or required for this admission. Any new Member will receive a business interest in the Venture as determined by all other Members.

Dissociation of a Member

Where a Member is in breach of this Agreement and that Member has not remedied the breach on notice from the Venture and after a reasonable period then the remaining Members will have the right to terminate this Agreement with regard to that individual defaulting Member (an "Involuntary Withdrawal") and take whatever action necessary to protect the interests of the Venture.

If the Venture is harmed as the result of an individual Member's action or failure to act, then that individual Member will be liable for that harm. If more than one Member is at fault then they will be jointly and severally liable for that harm.

Each Member will indemnify the remaining Members against all losses, costs and claims that may arise in the event of the Venture being terminated as a result of breach of the Agreement by that Member.

If a Member is placed in bankruptcy, or withdraws voluntarily from the Venture, or if there is an Operation of Law against a Member, the other Members will be entitled to proceed as if the Member had breached this Agreement.

Distribution of any amount owing to a dissociated Member will be made according to the percentage of ownership as described in the Valuation of Interest or as otherwise may be agreed in writing.

Dissolution of the Joint Venture

The Venture will be dissolved and its assets liquidated in the event of any of the following:

the Term of the Venture expires and is not extended;

a unanimous vote by the Members to dissolve the Venture;

on satisfaction of the exclusive purpose of the Venture;

loss or incapacity through any means of substantially all of the Venture's assets; or

where only one Member remains.



Liquidation

On dissolution, the Venture will be liquidated promptly and within a reasonable time.

On the liquidation of the Venture assets, distribution of any amounts to Members will be made in proportion to their respective capital accounts or as otherwise may be agreed in writing.

Valuation of Interest

In the absence of a written agreement setting a value, the value of the Venture will be determined based on the fair market value appraisal of all Venture assets (less liabilities) in accordance with generally accepted accounting procedures (GAAP) by an independent accounting firm agreed to by all Members. An appraiser will be appointed within a reasonable period of the date of withdrawal or dissolution. The results of the appraisal will be binding on all Members. A withdrawing Member's interest will be based on the proportion of their respective capital account less any outstanding liabilities a Member may have to the Venture. The intent of this section is to ensure the survival of the Venture despite the withdrawal of any individual Member.

No allowance will be made for goodwill, trade name, patents or other intangible assets, except where those assets have been reflected on the Venture books immediately prior to valuation.

Transfer of Member Interest

A Member will not in any way alienate their interest in the Venture or its assets. Any such prohibited transfer, if attempted, will be void and without force or effect.

Force Majeure

A Member will be free of liability to the Venture where the Member is prevented from executing their obligations under this Agreement in whole or in part due to force majeure where the Member has communicated the circumstance of that event to any and all other Members and taken any and all appropriate action to mitigate that event. Force majeure will include, but not be limited to, earthquake, typhoon, flood, fire, and war or any other unforeseen and uncontrollable event.

Duty of Loyalty

Provided a Member has the consent of the majority of the other Members, the Members to this Agreement and their respective affiliates may have interests in businesses other than the Joint Venture business. Neither the Venture nor any other Member will have any rights to the assets, income or profits of any such business, venture or transaction. Any and all businesses, ventures or transactions with any appearance of conflict of interest must be fully disclosed to all other Members. Failure to disclose any potential conflicts of interest will be deemed an Involuntary Withdrawal by the offending Member and may be treated accordingly by the remaining Members.

BACKGROUND:


The Members wish to enter into an association of mutual benefit and agree to jointly invest and set up a joint venture enterprise. 

The terms and conditions of this Agreement sets out the terms and conditions governing this association. 


IN CONSIDERATION OF and as a condition of the Members entering into this Agreement and other valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which consideration is acknowledged, the parties to this Agreement agree as follows:
	

Formation

By this Agreement the Members enter into a joint venture (the "Venture") in accordance with the laws of the State of California. The rights and obligations of the Members will be as stated in the applicable legislation of the State of California (the 'Act') except as otherwise provided here.

Name

The business name of the Venture will be ____________________.

Purpose

The exclusive purpose of the Venture will be ___________________________________.

________________________________________.



This Agreement may be extended with the unanimous consent of all Members.

Place of Business

The principal office of the business of the Venture will be located at ____________________, __________, __________ __________ or such other place as the Members may from time to time designate.

Business Management

Management Duties

Except as otherwise specified in this agreement, the duties and obligations of the Manager in relation to the Venture will include the following:

managing the day to day business of the Venture;

monitoring, controlling and directing the financial, business and operational affairs of the Venture;

proper maintenance of books of account and financial records according to accepted accounting practices;

monitoring, analyzing and acting on all issues over which it would have express or implied authority according to this Agreement; and

all responsibilities attached to hiring of production and administration staff including any required labor negotiations, and all responsibilities attached to hiring of third party contractors.

Member

Duties of Members may be amended, from time to time, by decision of the Members, provided that the Members' Interests are not affected except with the unanimous consent of the Members.

Capital Contributions

Each of the Members has contributed to the capital of the Venture, in cash or property in agreed upon value, as follows (the "Capital Contribution"):



Member



Contribution Description



Agreed Value




 
					
 
					

$ USD
						



 
					
 
					

$ USD
						




All Members will contribute their respective Capital Contributions fully and on time.

Withdrawal of Capital

No Member will have the right to demand or withdraw any portion of their capital contribution without the express written consent of the remaining Members.

The Members will not be personally liable for the return of all or part of the Capital Contributions of a Member, except as otherwise provided in this Agreement.

Additional Capital

Capital Contributions may be amended from time to time, according to the requirements of the Joint Venture, by decision of the Members as recommended by the Manager. Where Members' interests are affected, additional capital contributions (the "Additional Capital Contributions") must have the unanimous consent of the Members.

Any advance of money to the Venture by any Member in excess of the amounts provided for in this Agreement or subsequently agreed to as an Additional Capital Contribution will be deemed a debt due from the Venture rather than an increase in Capital Contribution of the Member. This liability will be repaid with interest at such rates and times to be determined by a majority of the Members. This liability will not entitle the lending Member to a greater voting power. Such debts may have preference or priority over any other payments to Members as may be determined by a majority of the Members.

Capital Accounts

An individual capital account will be maintained for each Member and their initial Capital Contribution will be credited to this account. Any additional, approved contributions to the Venture's capital made by a Member will be credited to that Member's individual Capital Account.

Interest on Capital

No borrowing charge or loan interest will be due or payable to any Member on any Capital Contribution or on their Capital Account despite any disproportion that may from time to time arise among the Capital Accounts of the Members.

Books of Account

Accurate and complete books of account of the transactions of the Venture will be kept in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and at all reasonable times will be available and open to inspection and examination by any Member. The books and records of the Venture will reflect all the Venture’s transactions and will be appropriate and adequate for the business conducted by the Venture.

Banking and Venture Funds

The funds of the Venture will be placed in such investments and banking accounts as will be designated by the Members. Venture funds will be held in the name of the Venture and will not be commingled with those of any other person or entity.

Member Meetings

Regular Member meetings will be held as required. Minutes of the meetings will be maintained on file.

Any Member can call a special meeting to resolve urgent issues that require a vote and that cannot wait for the next regularly scheduled meeting. When calling a special meeting, all Members must be provided with reasonable notice. Where a special meeting has been called, the meeting will be restricted to the specific purpose for which the meeting was called.

All meetings will be held at a time and in a location that is reasonable, convenient and practical considering the situation of all Members.

Any vote required by the Members will be determined such that each Member receives one vote carrying equal weight.

Amendments

This Agreement may be amended only with the unanimous consent of all Members.

Admitting a new Member

New Members may be admitted into the Venture only with the unanimous consent of the existing Members. The new Member agrees to be bound by all the covenants, terms, and conditions of this Agreement, inclusive of all current and future amendments. Further, a new Member will execute such documents as are needed or required for this admission. Any new Member will receive a business interest in the Venture as determined by all other Members.

Dissociation of a Member

Where a Member is in breach of this Agreement and that Member has not remedied the breach on notice from the Venture and after a reasonable period then the remaining Members will have the right to terminate this Agreement with regard to that individual defaulting Member (an "Involuntary Withdrawal") and take whatever action necessary to protect the interests of the Venture.

If the Venture is harmed as the result of an individual Member's action or failure to act, then that individual Member will be liable for that harm. If more than one Member is at fault then they will be jointly and severally liable for that harm.

Each Member will indemnify the remaining Members against all losses, costs and claims that may arise in the event of the Venture being terminated as a result of breach of the Agreement by that Member.

If a Member is placed in bankruptcy, or withdraws voluntarily from the Venture, or if there is an Operation of Law against a Member, the other Members will be entitled to proceed as if the Member had breached this Agreement.

Distribution of any amount owing to a dissociated Member will be made according to the percentage of ownership as described in the Valuation of Interest or as otherwise may be agreed in writing.

Dissolution of the Joint Venture

The Venture will be dissolved and its assets liquidated in the event of any of the following:

the Term of the Venture expires and is not extended;

a unanimous vote by the Members to dissolve the Venture;

on satisfaction of the exclusive purpose of the Venture;

loss or incapacity through any means of substantially all of the Venture's assets; or

where only one Member remains.



Liquidation

On dissolution, the Venture will be liquidated promptly and within a reasonable time.

On the liquidation of the Venture assets, distribution of any amounts to Members will be made in proportion to their respective capital accounts or as otherwise may be agreed in writing.

Valuation of Interest

In the absence of a written agreement setting a value, the value of the Venture will be determined based on the fair market value appraisal of all Venture assets (less liabilities) in accordance with generally accepted accounting procedures (GAAP) by an independent accounting firm agreed to by all Members. An appraiser will be appointed within a reasonable period of the date of withdrawal or dissolution. The results of the appraisal will be binding on all Members. A withdrawing Member's interest will be based on the proportion of their respective capital account less any outstanding liabilities a Member may have to the Venture. The intent of this section is to ensure the survival of the Venture despite the withdrawal of any individual Member.

No allowance will be made for goodwill, trade name, patents or other intangible assets, except where those assets have been reflected on the Venture books immediately prior to valuation.

Transfer of Member Interest

A Member will not in any way alienate their interest in the Venture or its assets. Any such prohibited transfer, if attempted, will be void and without force or effect.

Force Majeure

A Member will be free of liability to the Venture where the Member is prevented from executing their obligations under this Agreement in whole or in part due to force majeure where the Member has communicated the circumstance of that event to any and all other Members and taken any and all appropriate action to mitigate that event. Force majeure will include, but not be limited to, earthquake, typhoon, flood, fire, and war or any other unforeseen and uncontrollable event.

Duty of Loyalty

Provided a Member has the consent of the majority of the other Members, the Members to this Agreement and their respective affiliates may have interests in businesses other than the Joint Venture business. Neither the Venture nor any other Member will have any rights to the assets, income or profits of any such business, venture or transaction. Any and all businesses, ventures or transactions with any appearance of conflict of interest must be fully disclosed to all other Members. Failure to disclose any potential conflicts of interest will be deemed an Involuntary Withdrawal by the offending Member and may be treated accordingly by the remaining Members.

Confidentiality

All matters relating to this Agreement and the Venture will be treated by the Members as confidential and no Member will disclose or allow to be disclosed any Venture matter or matters, directly or indirectly, to any third party without the prior written approval of all Members except where the information properly comes into the public domain.

This section will survive for one year after the expiration or termination of this Agreement or dissolution of the Venture.

Language

The parties expressly state that the English language is to be the language of choice for this Agreement and all other notices and agreements required by the Venture.

Insurance

The Venture will insure all its assets against loss where reasonable and standard practice in the industry.

Indemnification

Each Member will be indemnified and held harmless by the Venture from any and all harm or damages of any nature relating to the Member's participation in Venture affairs except where the that harm or damages results from gross negligence or willful misconduct on the part of the Member.

Liability

No Member will be liable to the Venture or to any other Member for any error in judgment or any act or failure to act where made in good faith. The Member will be liable for any and all acts or failures to act resulting from gross negligence or willful misconduct.

Liability Insurance

The Venture may acquire insurance on behalf of any Member, employee, agent or other person engaged in the business interest of the Venture against any liability asserted against them or incurred by them while acting in good faith on behalf of the Venture.

Covenant of Good Faith

Members will use their best efforts, fairly and in good faith to facilitate the success of the Venture.

Joint Venture Property

Where allowed by statute, title to all Joint Venture property, including intellectual property, will remain in the name of the Joint Venture. Where joint ventures are not recognized by statute as separate legal entities, Joint Venture property, including intellectual property, will be held in the name of one or more Members. In all cases Joint Venture property will be applied by the Members exclusively for the benefit and purposes of the Joint Venture and in accordance with this Agreement.

Jurisdiction

The Members submit to the jurisdiction of the courts of the State of California for the enforcement of this Agreement and for any arbitration award or decision arising from this Agreement.

Warranties

All Members represent and warrant that they have all authority, licenses and permits to execute and perform this Agreement and their obligations under this Agreement and that the representative of each Member has been fully authorized to execute this Agreement.

Each Member represents and warrants that this Agreement is not in violation of any and all agreements and constitutional documents of the individual Member.

Members will provide services to one another on an arms' length basis while remaining independent business entities. There will be no pooling of profits and losses.

Joint Venture Agreement
What is a Joint Venture Agreement?
A Joint Venture Agreement, also known as a Co-Venture Agreement, is used when two or more business entities or individuals enter into a temporary business relationship (joint venture) for the purposes of achieving a mutual goal. The Joint Venture Agreement sets out the terms and obligations of the members and the joint venture.
Types of Joint Ventures


Contractual: a contractual joint venture is where two or more parties agree to collaborate on a project, but do not set up a separate legal entity or pool the profits and losses. Each party keeps their accounting records separate and there are no registration requirements. 
General Partnership: a joint venture in the form of a general partnership is where the partners agree to share in the profits and losses from the mutual project and each party incurs unlimited liability for the obligations of the partnership. This type of joint venture is mainly used for real estate ventures and not for business endeavors related to research and product development.

Why do Businesses Form Joint Ventures?
Two parties form a joint venture when they wish to join forces for a common purpose where they will each share in the risk and reward. It allows each party to grow without having to look for outside funding. 
Other reasons businesses may enter into joint venture relationships are to gain access to wider markets, share resources, fund growth of another business, develop products, diversify, etc.
What is Included in a Joint Venture Agreement?
The following is included in a Joint Venture Agreement:

Place of business
The type of joint venture
Venture details, such as its name, address, purpose, etc.
Start and end date
Venture members and their capital contributions
Member duties and obligations
Meeting and voting details
Management, dissolution, and assignment of interest details
Non-compete, confidentiality, and dispute resolution clauses

Joint Venture vs. Partnership
A joint venture is typically made up of two or more individuals or businesses joining together to complete a project that is limited in scope and time. Its terms are defined under a Joint Venture Agreement. A partnership consists of two or more people who go into business together for the purposes of forming an ongoing business. A partnership is governed by a Partnership Agreement.
Joint Venture Advantages and Disadvantages
Collaborating with another business can offer the following benefits:

More financial or technical resources
Greater expertise and skills
Access to new markets and distribution channels
Larger capacity
Partner on new and existing products/services
Diversification
Flexibility and control over the terms of the relationship

Partnering with another business does offer its perks, but there are also some possible risks as well, including:

Imbalance in resources, expertise, or investment
Different management or leadership styles, or different workplace cultures
Poor planning, unclear objectives, or decision making that could lead to misunderstandings

All Members will contribute their respective Capital Contributions fully and on time.

Withdrawal of Capital

No Member will have the right to demand or withdraw any portion of their capital contribution without the express written consent of the remaining Members.

The Members will not be personally liable for the return of all or part of the Capital Contributions of a Member, except as otherwise provided in this Agreement.

Additional Capital

Capital Contributions may be amended from time to time, according to the requirements of the Joint Venture, by decision of the Members as recommended by the Manager. Where Members' interests are affected, additional capital contributions (the "Additional Capital Contributions") must have the unanimous consent of the Members.

Any advance of money to the Venture by any Member in excess of the amounts provided for in this Agreement or subsequently agreed to as an Additional Capital Contribution will be deemed a debt due from the Venture rather than an increase in Capital Contribution of the Member. This liability will be repaid with interest at such rates and times to be determined by a majority of the Members. This liability will not entitle the lending Member to a greater voting power. Such debts may have preference or priority over any other payments to Members as may be determined by a majority of the Members.

Capital Accounts

An individual capital account will be maintained for each Member and their initial Capital Contribution will be credited to this account. Any additional, approved contributions to the Venture's capital made by a Member will be credited to that Member's individual Capital Account.

Interest on Capital

No borrowing charge or loan interest will be due or payable to any Member on any Capital Contribution or on their Capital Account despite any disproportion that may from time to time arise among the Capital Accounts of the Members.

Books of Account

Accurate and complete books of account of the transactions of the Venture will be kept in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and at all reasonable times will be available and open to inspection and examination by any Member. The books and records of the Venture will reflect all the Venture’s transactions and will be appropriate and adequate for the business conducted by the Venture.

Banking and Venture Funds

The funds of the Venture will be placed in such investments and banking accounts as will be designated by the Members. Venture funds will be held in the name of the Venture and will not be commingled with those of any other person or entity.

Member Meetings

Regular Member meetings will be held as required. Minutes of the meetings will be maintained on file.

Any Member can call a special meeting to resolve urgent issues that require a vote and that cannot wait for the next regularly scheduled meeting. When calling a special meeting, all Members must be provided with reasonable notice. Where a special meeting has been called, the meeting will be restricted to the specific purpose for which the meeting was called.

All meetings will be held at a time and in a location that is reasonable, convenient and practical considering the situation of all Members.

Any vote required by the Members will be determined such that each Member receives one vote carrying equal weight.

Amendments

This Agreement may be amended only with the unanimous consent of all Members.

Admitting a new Member

New Members may be admitted into the Venture only with the unanimous consent of the existing Members. The new Member agrees to be bound by all the covenants, terms, and conditions of this Agreement, inclusive of all current and future amendments. Further, a new Member will execute such documents as are needed or required for this admission. Any new Member will receive a business interest in the Venture as determined by all other Members.

Dissociation of a Member

Where a Member is in breach of this Agreement and that Member has not remedied the breach on notice from the Venture and after a reasonable period then the remaining Members will have the right to terminate this Agreement with regard to that individual defaulting Member (an "Involuntary Withdrawal") and take whatever action necessary to protect the interests of the Venture.

If the Venture is harmed as the result of an individual Member's action or failure to act, then that individual Member will be liable for that harm. If more than one Member is at fault then they will be jointly and severally liable for that harm.

Each Member will indemnify the remaining Members against all losses, costs and claims that may arise in the event of the Venture being terminated as a result of breach of the Agreement by that Member.

If a Member is placed in bankruptcy, or withdraws voluntarily from the Venture, or if there is an Operation of Law against a Member, the other Members will be entitled to proceed as if the Member had breached this Agreement.

Distribution of any amount owing to a dissociated Member will be made according to the percentage of ownership as described in the Valuation of Interest or as otherwise may be agreed in writing.

Dissolution of the Joint Venture

The Venture will be dissolved and its assets liquidated in the event of any of the following:

the Term of the Venture expires and is not extended;

a unanimous vote by the Members to dissolve the Venture;

on satisfaction of the exclusive purpose of the Venture;

loss or incapacity through any means of substantially all of the Venture's assets; or

where only one Member remains.



Liquidation

On dissolution, the Venture will be liquidated promptly and within a reasonable time.

On the liquidation of the Venture assets, distribution of any amounts to Members will be made in proportion to their respective capital accounts or as otherwise may be agreed in writing.

Valuation of Interest

In the absence of a written agreement setting a value, the value of the Venture will be determined based on the fair market value appraisal of all Venture assets (less liabilities) in accordance with generally accepted accounting procedures (GAAP) by an independent accounting firm agreed to by all Members. An appraiser will be appointed within a reasonable period of the date of withdrawal or dissolution. The results of the appraisal will be binding on all Members. A withdrawing Member's interest will be based on the proportion of their respective capital account less any outstanding liabilities a Member may have to the Venture. The intent of this section is to ensure the survival of the Venture despite the withdrawal of any individual Member.

No allowance will be made for goodwill, trade name, patents or other intangible assets, except where those assets have been reflected on the Venture books immediately prior to valuation.

Transfer of Member Interest

A Member will not in any way alienate their interest in the Venture or its assets. Any such prohibited transfer, if attempted, will be void and without force or effect.

Force Majeure

A Member will be free of liability to the Venture where the Member is prevented from executing their obligations under this Agreement in whole or in part due to force majeure where the Member has communicated the circumstance of that event to any and all other Members and taken any and all appropriate action to mitigate that event. Force majeure will include, but not be limited to, earthquake, typhoon, flood, fire, and war or any other unforeseen and uncontrollable event.

Duty of Loyalty

Provided a Member has the consent of the majority of the other Members, the Members to this Agreement and their respective affiliates may have interests in businesses other than the Joint Venture business. Neither the Venture nor any other Member will have any rights to the assets, income or profits of any such business, venture or transaction. Any and all businesses, ventures or transactions with any appearance of conflict of interest must be fully disclosed to all other Members. Failure to disclose any potential conflicts of interest will be deemed an Involuntary Withdrawal by the offending Member and may be treated accordingly by the remaining Members.

Confidentiality

All matters relating to this Agreement and the Venture will be treated by the Members as confidential and no Member will disclose or allow to be disclosed any Venture matter or matters, directly or indirectly, to any third party without the prior written approval of all Members except where the information properly comes into the public domain.

This section will survive for one year after the expiration or termination of this Agreement or dissolution of the Venture.

Language

The parties expressly state that the English language is to be the language of choice for this Agreement and all other notices and agreements required by the Venture.

Insurance

The Venture will insure all its assets against loss where reasonable and standard practice in the industry.

Indemnification

Each Member will be indemnified and held harmless by the Venture from any and all harm or damages of any nature relating to the Member's participation in Venture affairs except where the that harm or damages results from gross negligence or willful misconduct on the part of the Member.

Liability

No Member will be liable to the Venture or to any other Member for any error in judgment or any act or failure to act where made in good faith. The Member will be liable for any and all acts or failures to act resulting from gross negligence or willful misconduct.

Liability Insurance

The Venture may acquire insurance on behalf of any Member, employee, agent or other person engaged in the business interest of the Venture against any liability asserted against them or incurred by them while acting in good faith on behalf of the Venture.

Covenant of Good Faith

Members will use their best efforts, fairly and in good faith to facilitate the success of the Venture.

Joint Venture Property

Where allowed by statute, title to all Joint Venture property, including intellectual property, will remain in the name of the Joint Venture. Where joint ventures are not recognized by statute as separate legal entities, Joint Venture property, including intellectual property, will be held in the name of one or more Members. In all cases Joint Venture property will be applied by the Members exclusively for the benefit and purposes of the Joint Venture and in accordance with this Agreement.

All Members represent and warrant that they have all authority, licenses and permits to execute and perform this Agreement and their obligations under this Agreement and that the representative of each Member has been fully authorized to execute this Agreement.

Joint Venture Agreement
What is a Joint Venture Agreement?
A Joint Venture Agreement, also known as a Co-Venture Agreement, is used when two or more business entities or individuals enter into a temporary business relationship (joint venture) for the purposes of achieving a mutual goal. The Joint Venture Agreement sets out the terms and obligations of the members and the joint venture.
Types of Joint Ventures


Contractual: a contractual joint venture is where two or more parties agree to collaborate on a project, but do not set up a separate legal entity or pool the profits and losses. Each party keeps their accounting records separate and there are no registration requirements. 
General Partnership: a joint venture in the form of a general partnership is where the partners agree to share in the profits and losses from the mutual project and each party incurs unlimited liability for the obligations of the partnership. This type of joint venture is mainly used for real estate ventures and not for business endeavors related to research and product development.

Why do Businesses Form Joint Ventures?
Two parties form a joint venture when they wish to join forces for a common purpose where they will each share in the risk and reward. It allows each party to grow without having to look for outside funding. 
Other reasons businesses may enter into joint venture relationships are to gain access to wider markets, share resources, fund growth of another business, develop products, diversify, etc.
What is Included in a Joint Venture Agreement?
The following is included in a Joint Venture Agreement:

Place of business
The type of joint venture
Venture details, such as its name, address, purpose, etc.
Start and end date
Venture members and their capital contributions
Member duties and obligations
Meeting and voting details
Management, dissolution, and assignment of interest details
Non-compete, confidentiality, and dispute resolution clauses

Joint Venture vs. Partnership
A joint venture is typically made up of two or more individuals or businesses joining together to complete a project that is limited in scope and time. Its terms are defined under a Joint Venture Agreement. A partnership consists of two or more people who go into business together for the purposes of forming an ongoing business. A partnership is governed by a Partnership Agreement.
Joint Venture Advantages and Disadvantages
Collaborating with another business can offer the following benefits:

More financial or technical resources
Greater expertise and skills
Access to new markets and distribution channels
Larger capacity
Partner on new and existing products/services
Diversification
Flexibility and control over the terms of the relationship

Partnering with another business does offer its perks, but there are also some possible risks as well, including:

Imbalance in resources, expertise, or investment
Different management or leadership styles, or different workplace cultures
Poor planning, unclear objectives, or decision making that could lead to misunderstandings
