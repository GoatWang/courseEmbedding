ZELTIQ Aesthetics is a public company based in Pleasanton, California that markets and licenses the CoolSculpting cryolipolysis procedure. The company holds the largest market share for non-invasive fat reduction procedures. Its sole product, CoolSCulpting, is "the main Cryolipolysis device available in the market".[1][3] The company was founded in 2005 and raised $75 million in funding before going public in 2011. Its CoolSculpting procedure was approved by the Food and Drug Administration for "body-sculpting" on the flanks (sides) in 2010, stomach fat in 2012 and thighs in 2014.

History[edit]
ZELTIQ was founded in 2005[4][5] by Mitch Levinson[6] as Juniper Medical Systems.[7] It was originally a healthcare-focused division of a wireless technology holding company, Juniper Group.[8] The company changed its name to ZELTIQ in July 2007.[9]
ZELTIQ's CoolSculpting procedure was invented by Dieter Manstein from the Massachusetts General Hospital and Rox Anderson, from Harvard Medical School.[10][11] An early prototype was created to advance cryolipolysis studies being done on pigs in 2008.[12][13] The device underwent clinical trials later that year,[14] and an exclusive license was awarded to ZELTIQ to commercialize the technology.[11][15]
In 2009 Gordie Nye was appointed CEO, replacing founder Levinson, who remained on the board.[6][16] By this time, CoolSculpting had already been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for cooling skin before dermatological procedures and other uses, but had not yet been approved for killing fat cells.[17] ZELTIQ waited for FDA approval before marketing the device,[2] however a growing number of doctors were using it off-label for "body-sculpting" procedures.[18] By 2010, the company had raised $50 million in financing over three rounds of funding.[5][19] An additional $25 million in funding was raised in June 2010.[20]
The company's CoolSculpting procedure was approved by the Food and Drug Administration for flanks (sides) in September 2010[21] and for stomach fat in 2012.[21] It has also been approved by Health Canada and the European Union.[22] By late 2010 CoolSculpting had been introduced as a body-sculpting procedure in Europe, Asia and Canada.[15] By 2011 ZELTIQ was approved to market the procedure in 46 countries.[23]
CoolSculpting became popular in the United States around 2011.[21] In the first half of that year, ZELTIQ's revenues grew four-fold to $31.6 million, though it was still operating at a small loss.[4][23] ZELTIQ filed for an initial public offering later that year.[4][23] The IPO raised $91 million.[24]
By January 2012, there had been 150,000 CoolSculpting treatments.[25] In 2014, ZELTIQ introduced a new model of the CoolSculpting device that didn't use a suction cup and was cleared by the FDA for use on thighs.[26][27]
CoolSculpting[edit]
Main article: Cryolipolysis
CoolSculpting is a noninvasive body sculpting procedure.[28] It is based on cryolipolysis,[29] a method of controlled cold exposure that causes an inflammatory response in fat cells, resulting in gradual cell death and consumption by macrophages, without causing damage to other tissues.[30] It is intended for body contouring and not general weight loss. As of 2013, clinical trials have found that Cryolipolysis is moderately effective and has mostly mild and temporary side-effects.[31]
ZELTIQ's revenues come from selling CoolSculpting equipment and from a fee doctors pay for each treatment they perform.[20][23] It is the company's sole product[32] and the main brand used for Cryolipolysis.[1][3] The CoolSculpting treatment process involves a fatty area of the body being sucked into a suction cup-type device and cooled.[33][34] Different shapes of suction cup and different programming in the machine are used for different areas of the body.[35] Typically an individual treatment lasts one hour for each part of the body being treated and involves two treatments, eight weeks apart. The number and duration of treatments vary.[21]

Allergan is buying a fat-freezing company for $2.5 billion

  The hyper-acquisitive multinational pharmaceutical company
  Allergan is buying the fat-reduction biopharmaceutical company
  Zeltiq Aesthetics.

  Allergan, which is the Dublin-headquartered maker of Botox, will
  pay $56.50 a share, or about $2.48 billion, for Zeltiq.

  Zeltiq's sole product is a cryolipolysis, or fat-freezing, device
  called CoolSculpting.

  "By adding the best-in-class body contouring CoolSculpting System
  to our best-in-class facial aesthetics, plastic surgery, and
  regenerative medicine offerings we are creating a world-class
  aesthetics business," Allergan CEO Brent Saunders said in a
  statement.

  Allergan is a 
  regular acquirer of other companies.





  In December, it announced it was 
  buying the regenerative-medicine company LifeCell for $2.9
  billion. In October it said it was 
  buying the rights to a Crohn's-disease drug for about $1.3
  billion.

  In September, the company announced four other deals:

On September 20, 
    it acquired Tobira Therapeutics, which is
    developing two treatments for a liver condition called NASH in
    a deal worth $1.65 billion.
  
Later that afternoon, the company announced it had also
  acquired Akarna Therapeutics, a private company
  also working on drugs to treat NASH. That deal was worth $50
  million up-front.
  
On September 14, it acquired the dermatology company 
    Vitae Pharmaceuticals for $639 million.
  
A $60 million up-front deal to buy RetroSense
  Therapeutics, a gene-therapy company that is working on
  a treatment for a cause of blindness, happened 
    September 6.
  

  Those followed the $34 billion sale of Allergan's generic-drug
  business to the Israeli pharmaceutical Teva. Allergan attempted
  to merge with Pfizer in 2015 in 
  what could have been a tax inversion, but US 
  regulators blocked the deal last April.

  The Zeltiq acquisition is subject to shareholder and regulatory
  approval and is expected to close in the second half of the year.

  Two boutique investment banks advised on the deal. Moelis &
  Company advised Allergan, while Guggenheim advised Zeltiq.

  Here's the full press release:

  DUBLIN and PLEASANTON, Calif., Feb. 13, 2017 /PRNewswire/ --
  Allergan plc (NYSE:AGN), a leading global biopharmaceutical
  company, and ZELTIQ^® Aesthetics, Inc. (NASDAQ:ZLTQ), a medical
  technology company focused on developing and commercializing
  products utilizing its proprietary controlled-cooling technology
  platform, today announced that they have entered into a
  definitive agreement under which Allergan has agreed to acquire
  ZELTIQ for $56.50 per share, or $2.475 billion, subject to
  customary adjustments.

  The acquisition of ZELTIQ is immediately accretive and enhances
  Allergan's global medical aesthetics portfolio with the addition
  of ZELTIQ's flagship CoolSculpting^® System, the sales leader in
  the fast-growing cash pay body contouring segment of medical
  aesthetics. The CoolSculpting System is FDA-cleared to affect
  appearance through lipolysis or reduction of unwanted fat using a
  patented cooling technology. CoolSculpting works by gently
  cooling targeted fat cells in the body to induce a natural,
  controlled elimination of fat cells without affecting surrounding
  tissue. Body contouring is a $4 billion market opportunity
  worldwide and growing.

  "The acquisition of ZELTIQ is highly complementary and strategic
  to Allergan. By adding the best-in-class body contouring
  CoolSculpting System to our best-in-class facial aesthetics,
  plastic surgery and regenerative medicine offerings we are
  creating a world-class aesthetics business," said Brent Saunders,
  Chairman and CEO of Allergan. "With CoolSculpting, our offerings
  to plastic surgeons, dermatologists and aesthetic practitioners
  will now extend to three of the largest and fastest-growing
  segments of their practices, putting Allergan in a unique
  position to provide expanded customer service, and help meet the
  needs of patients."

  "Allergan's world-class medical aesthetics products, global
  footprint, history and commitment to developing best-in-class
  aesthetic treatments makes the Company ideally suited to realize
  the maximum commercial potential of the ZELTIQ controlled-cooling
  technology platform," said Mark Foley, Chief Executive Officer of
  ZELTIQ. "I appreciate the unwavering commitment and dedication of
  the ZELTIQ team in building a world-class Company and technology
  platform with CoolSculpting. We look forward to working with
  Allergan to ensure successful completion of this transaction, and
  supporting the ongoing success of the CoolSculpting technology in
  the U.S. and around the world."

  Allergan's acquisition of ZELTIQ is subject to approval by the
  shareholders of ZELTIQ, expiration or termination of the waiting
  period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of
  1976 and fulfillment of certain other customary conditions to
  closing. Assuming typical regulatory and shareholder approval
  timeframes, Allergan currently anticipates closing the
  transaction in the second half of 2017.

  Moelis & Company is acting as financial advisor to Allergan,
  and Debevoise & Plimpton LLP is acting as lead legal counsel.
  Guggenheim Securities is acting as financial advisor to ZELTIQ,
  and Cooley LLP is serving as legal counsel.

The company holds the largest market share for non-invasive fat reduction procedures.

History[edit]
ZELTIQ was founded in 2005[4][5] by Mitch Levinson[6] as Juniper Medical Systems.[7] It was originally a healthcare-focused division of a wireless technology holding company, Juniper Group.[8] The company changed its name to ZELTIQ in July 2007.[9]
ZELTIQ's CoolSculpting procedure was invented by Dieter Manstein from the Massachusetts General Hospital and Rox Anderson, from Harvard Medical School.[10][11] An early prototype was created to advance cryolipolysis studies being done on pigs in 2008.[12][13] The device underwent clinical trials later that year,[14] and an exclusive license was awarded to ZELTIQ to commercialize the technology.[11][15]
In 2009 Gordie Nye was appointed CEO, replacing founder Levinson, who remained on the board.[6][16] By this time, CoolSculpting had already been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for cooling skin before dermatological procedures and other uses, but had not yet been approved for killing fat cells.[17] ZELTIQ waited for FDA approval before marketing the device,[2] however a growing number of doctors were using it off-label for "body-sculpting" procedures.[18] By 2010, the company had raised $50 million in financing over three rounds of funding.[5][19] An additional $25 million in funding was raised in June 2010.[20]
The company's CoolSculpting procedure was approved by the Food and Drug Administration for flanks (sides) in September 2010[21] and for stomach fat in 2012.[21] It has also been approved by Health Canada and the European Union.[22] By late 2010 CoolSculpting had been introduced as a body-sculpting procedure in Europe, Asia and Canada.[15] By 2011 ZELTIQ was approved to market the procedure in 46 countries.[23]
CoolSculpting became popular in the United States around 2011.[21] In the first half of that year, ZELTIQ's revenues grew four-fold to $31.6 million, though it was still operating at a small loss.[4][23] ZELTIQ filed for an initial public offering later that year.[4][23] The IPO raised $91 million.[24]
By January 2012, there had been 150,000 CoolSculpting treatments.[25] In 2014, ZELTIQ introduced a new model of the CoolSculpting device that didn't use a suction cup and was cleared by the FDA for use on thighs.[26][27]
CoolSculpting[edit]
Main article: Cryolipolysis
CoolSculpting is a noninvasive body sculpting procedure.[28] It is based on cryolipolysis,[29] a method of controlled cold exposure that causes an inflammatory response in fat cells, resulting in gradual cell death and consumption by macrophages, without causing damage to other tissues.[30] It is intended for body contouring and not general weight loss. As of 2013, clinical trials have found that Cryolipolysis is moderately effective and has mostly mild and temporary side-effects.[31]
ZELTIQ's revenues come from selling CoolSculpting equipment and from a fee doctors pay for each treatment they perform.[20][23] It is the company's sole product[32] and the main brand used for Cryolipolysis.[1][3] The CoolSculpting treatment process involves a fatty area of the body being sucked into a suction cup-type device and cooled.[33][34] Different shapes of suction cup and different programming in the machine are used for different areas of the body.[35] Typically an individual treatment lasts one hour for each part of the body being treated and involves two treatments, eight weeks apart. The number and duration of treatments vary.[21]

ZELTIQ's CoolSculpting procedure was invented by Dieter Manstein from the Massachusetts General Hospital and Rox Anderson, from Harvard Medical School.[10][11] An early prototype was created to advance cryolipolysis studies being done on pigs in 2008.[12][13] The device underwent clinical trials later that year,[14] and an exclusive license was awarded to ZELTIQ to commercialize the technology.[11][15]
In 2009 Gordie Nye was appointed CEO, replacing founder Levinson, who remained on the board.[6][16] By this time, CoolSculpting had already been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for cooling skin before dermatological procedures and other uses, but had not yet been approved for killing fat cells.[17] ZELTIQ waited for FDA approval before marketing the device,[2] however a growing number of doctors were using it off-label for "body-sculpting" procedures.[18] By 2010, the company had raised $50 million in financing over three rounds of funding.[5][19] An additional $25 million in funding was raised in June 2010.[20]
The company's CoolSculpting procedure was approved by the Food and Drug Administration for flanks (sides) in September 2010[21] and for stomach fat in 2012.[21] It has also been approved by Health Canada and the European Union.[22] By late 2010 CoolSculpting had been introduced as a body-sculpting procedure in Europe, Asia and Canada.[15] By 2011 ZELTIQ was approved to market the procedure in 46 countries.[23]
CoolSculpting became popular in the United States around 2011.[21] In the first half of that year, ZELTIQ's revenues grew four-fold to $31.6 million, though it was still operating at a small loss.[4][23] ZELTIQ filed for an initial public offering later that year.[4][23] The IPO raised $91 million.[24]
By January 2012, there had been 150,000 CoolSculpting treatments.[25] In 2014, ZELTIQ introduced a new model of the CoolSculpting device that didn't use a suction cup and was cleared by the FDA for use on thighs.[26][27]
CoolSculpting[edit]
Main article: Cryolipolysis
CoolSculpting is a noninvasive body sculpting procedure.[28] It is based on cryolipolysis,[29] a method of controlled cold exposure that causes an inflammatory response in fat cells, resulting in gradual cell death and consumption by macrophages, without causing damage to other tissues.[30] It is intended for body contouring and not general weight loss. As of 2013, clinical trials have found that Cryolipolysis is moderately effective and has mostly mild and temporary side-effects.[31]
ZELTIQ's revenues come from selling CoolSculpting equipment and from a fee doctors pay for each treatment they perform.[20][23] It is the company's sole product[32] and the main brand used for Cryolipolysis.[1][3] The CoolSculpting treatment process involves a fatty area of the body being sucked into a suction cup-type device and cooled.[33][34] Different shapes of suction cup and different programming in the machine are used for different areas of the body.[35] Typically an individual treatment lasts one hour for each part of the body being treated and involves two treatments, eight weeks apart. The number and duration of treatments vary.[21]

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

History[edit]
ZELTIQ was founded in 2005[4][5] by Mitch Levinson[6] as Juniper Medical Systems.[7] It was originally a healthcare-focused division of a wireless technology holding company, Juniper Group.[8] The company changed its name to ZELTIQ in July 2007.[9]
ZELTIQ's CoolSculpting procedure was invented by Dieter Manstein from the Massachusetts General Hospital and Rox Anderson, from Harvard Medical School.[10][11] An early prototype was created to advance cryolipolysis studies being done on pigs in 2008.[12][13] The device underwent clinical trials later that year,[14] and an exclusive license was awarded to ZELTIQ to commercialize the technology.[11][15]
In 2009 Gordie Nye was appointed CEO, replacing founder Levinson, who remained on the board.[6][16] By this time, CoolSculpting had already been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for cooling skin before dermatological procedures and other uses, but had not yet been approved for killing fat cells.[17] ZELTIQ waited for FDA approval before marketing the device,[2] however a growing number of doctors were using it off-label for "body-sculpting" procedures.[18] By 2010, the company had raised $50 million in financing over three rounds of funding.[5][19] An additional $25 million in funding was raised in June 2010.[20]
The company's CoolSculpting procedure was approved by the Food and Drug Administration for flanks (sides) in September 2010[21] and for stomach fat in 2012.[21] It has also been approved by Health Canada and the European Union.[22] By late 2010 CoolSculpting had been introduced as a body-sculpting procedure in Europe, Asia and Canada.[15] By 2011 ZELTIQ was approved to market the procedure in 46 countries.[23]
CoolSculpting became popular in the United States around 2011.[21] In the first half of that year, ZELTIQ's revenues grew four-fold to $31.6 million, though it was still operating at a small loss.[4][23] ZELTIQ filed for an initial public offering later that year.[4][23] The IPO raised $91 million.[24]
By January 2012, there had been 150,000 CoolSculpting treatments.[25] In 2014, ZELTIQ introduced a new model of the CoolSculpting device that didn't use a suction cup and was cleared by the FDA for use on thighs.[26][27]
CoolSculpting[edit]
Main article: Cryolipolysis
CoolSculpting is a noninvasive body sculpting procedure.[28] It is based on cryolipolysis,[29] a method of controlled cold exposure that causes an inflammatory response in fat cells, resulting in gradual cell death and consumption by macrophages, without causing damage to other tissues.[30] It is intended for body contouring and not general weight loss. As of 2013, clinical trials have found that Cryolipolysis is moderately effective and has mostly mild and temporary side-effects.[31]
ZELTIQ's revenues come from selling CoolSculpting equipment and from a fee doctors pay for each treatment they perform.[20][23] It is the company's sole product[32] and the main brand used for Cryolipolysis.[1][3] The CoolSculpting treatment process involves a fatty area of the body being sucked into a suction cup-type device and cooled.[33][34] Different shapes of suction cup and different programming in the machine are used for different areas of the body.[35] Typically an individual treatment lasts one hour for each part of the body being treated and involves two treatments, eight weeks apart. The number and duration of treatments vary.[21]

ZELTIQ Aesthetics is a public company based in Pleasanton, California that markets and licenses the CoolSculpting cryolipolysis procedure. The company holds the largest market share for non-invasive fat reduction procedures. Its sole product, CoolSCulpting, is "the main Cryolipolysis device available in the market".[1][3] The company was founded in 2005 and raised $75 million in funding before going public in 2011. Its CoolSculpting procedure was approved by the Food and Drug Administration for "body-sculpting" on the flanks (sides) in 2010, stomach fat in 2012 and thighs in 2014.

History[edit]
ZELTIQ was founded in 2005[4][5] by Mitch Levinson[6] as Juniper Medical Systems.[7] It was originally a healthcare-focused division of a wireless technology holding company, Juniper Group.[8] The company changed its name to ZELTIQ in July 2007.[9]
ZELTIQ's CoolSculpting procedure was invented by Dieter Manstein from the Massachusetts General Hospital and Rox Anderson, from Harvard Medical School.[10][11] An early prototype was created to advance cryolipolysis studies being done on pigs in 2008.[12][13] The device underwent clinical trials later that year,[14] and an exclusive license was awarded to ZELTIQ to commercialize the technology.[11][15]
In 2009 Gordie Nye was appointed CEO, replacing founder Levinson, who remained on the board.[6][16] By this time, CoolSculpting had already been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for cooling skin before dermatological procedures and other uses, but had not yet been approved for killing fat cells.[17] ZELTIQ waited for FDA approval before marketing the device,[2] however a growing number of doctors were using it off-label for "body-sculpting" procedures.[18] By 2010, the company had raised $50 million in financing over three rounds of funding.[5][19] An additional $25 million in funding was raised in June 2010.[20]
The company's CoolSculpting procedure was approved by the Food and Drug Administration for flanks (sides) in September 2010[21] and for stomach fat in 2012.[21] It has also been approved by Health Canada and the European Union.[22] By late 2010 CoolSculpting had been introduced as a body-sculpting procedure in Europe, Asia and Canada.[15] By 2011 ZELTIQ was approved to market the procedure in 46 countries.[23]
CoolSculpting became popular in the United States around 2011.[21] In the first half of that year, ZELTIQ's revenues grew four-fold to $31.6 million, though it was still operating at a small loss.[4][23] ZELTIQ filed for an initial public offering later that year.[4][23] The IPO raised $91 million.[24]
By January 2012, there had been 150,000 CoolSculpting treatments.[25] In 2014, ZELTIQ introduced a new model of the CoolSculpting device that didn't use a suction cup and was cleared by the FDA for use on thighs.[26][27]
CoolSculpting[edit]
Main article: Cryolipolysis
CoolSculpting is a noninvasive body sculpting procedure.[28] It is based on cryolipolysis,[29] a method of controlled cold exposure that causes an inflammatory response in fat cells, resulting in gradual cell death and consumption by macrophages, without causing damage to other tissues.[30] It is intended for body contouring and not general weight loss. As of 2013, clinical trials have found that Cryolipolysis is moderately effective and has mostly mild and temporary side-effects.[31]
ZELTIQ's revenues come from selling CoolSculpting equipment and from a fee doctors pay for each treatment they perform.[20][23] It is the company's sole product[32] and the main brand used for Cryolipolysis.[1][3] The CoolSculpting treatment process involves a fatty area of the body being sucked into a suction cup-type device and cooled.[33][34] Different shapes of suction cup and different programming in the machine are used for different areas of the body.[35] Typically an individual treatment lasts one hour for each part of the body being treated and involves two treatments, eight weeks apart. The number and duration of treatments vary.[21]

	ZELTIQ is a medical technology company focused on developing and commercializing products utilizing its proprietary controlled-cooling technology platform. The Company’s first commercial product, the CoolSculpting® System, is designed to selectively reduce stubborn fat bulges that may not respond to diet or exercise. CoolSculpting is based on the scientific principle that fat cells are more sensitive to cold than the overlying skin and surrounding tissues. CoolSculpting utilizes precisely controlled cooling to reduce the temperature of fat cells in the treated area, which is intended to cause fat cell elimination through a natural biological process known as apoptosis.  We developed CoolSculpting to safely, noticeably, and measurably reduce the fat layer within a treated fat bulge without requiring the patient to diet or exercise. ZELTIQ has received regulatory clearance from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to market CoolSculpting in the United States for the selective reduction of fat around the flanks and the abdomen area. ZELTIQ has also received regulatory approval or is otherwise free to market CoolSculpting in 55 international markets.

Zeltiq Aesthetics is a relative upstart in the aesthetic medical procedure industry. However, its bona fides certainly are not in question. The company and its chief product, the Zeltiq CoolSculpting System, were birthed by research conducted at the Wellman Center for Photomedicine, a research center affiliated with Harvard Medical School and located within Massachusetts General Hospital.
Zeltiq has been quickly moving up into the higher echelons of cosmetic medicine, which is why Allure Aesthetic is pleased to offer the Zeltiq CoolSculpting System for sale on our site. You can see the CoolSculpting units we have for sale by visiting our current Zeltiq inventory page. If you have any questions about our Zeltiq systems or need further assistance, we encourage you to contact us so that we can best serve you.
Zeltiq CoolSculpting System
The effectiveness of the CoolSculpting system is based upon the process of Cryolipolysis, which was discovered and developed at Massachusetts General Hospital a decade ago. In short, Cryolipolysis hinges upon the observation that the cells comprising fatty tissues in the body are more vulnerable to low temperatures than other tissues in the body. By cooling a specific region of the body–selective cryolysis–fat cells are induced to undergo cell death (apoptosis), prompting the immune system to attack and reabsorb the dead cells.
The CoolSculpting procedure begins with an applicator being placed against the targeted area of the body. The applicator creates a vacuum, drawing the underlying skin and tissue up against two recessed cooling panels in the handpiece. Then the system begins extracting energy from the tissue underneath, lowering local tissue temperature. The lipids in fat cells in the area crystallize, killing the cells. The chemical composition of other tissues, such as skin, nerves, and muscles, is such that they are more tolerant of these temperatures, and the CoolSculpting system carefully monitors and manages the process, so that temperatures are maintained below those that fat cells can endure, but above temperatures that would damage other tissues. Ultimately, everything but fatty tissues emerge from the Cryolipolysis process unscathed.
As the body absorbs these damaged fat deposits, noticeable thinning occurs, and fat layers in treated areas of the body are noticeably thinned. Improved body shape is apparent for at least six months after initial treatment. The only side effects of the procedure are minimal reddening of the skin, and very occasionally some bruising or swelling.
