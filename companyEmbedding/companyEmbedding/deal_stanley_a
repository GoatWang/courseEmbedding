Sears sells Craftsman brand to Stanley in deal that could top $1 billion

Sears Holdings will sell its well-known Craftsman tools brand to Stanley Black & Decker, the latest in a recent flurry of moves the retailer is making to generate cash after at least five money-losing years.The agreement announced Thursday calls for Stanley to pay $525 million when the deal closes — expected later this year — and another $250 million after three years, the companies said. New Britain, Conn.-based Stanley will pay Sears a percentage of its new sales of Craftsman products for 15 years, and during that time, Sears will be able to continue selling Craftsman products royalty-free.Hoffman Estates-based Sears estimated the deal's value could top $1 billion. 











Sears’ stock jumped as much as 8.7% following a recent statement issued Dec. 29. (Dec. 29, 2016)

Separately Thursday, Sears said it's trying to raise another $1 billion by selling off real estate. On Wednesday, affiliates of the hedge fund managed by Sears' chairman, CEO and biggest investor, Edward Lampert, lent Sears up to $500 million to fund operations while it negotiates those sales.

Sears announced in May that it was looking for ways to wring more cash from some of its best-known brands — Craftsman, Kenmore and DieHard.Craftsman still accounted for the largest share of the hand tools and accessories market by dollar share as of September, with about 26.6 percent, and accounts for about 8.3 percent of portable power tool sales, according to Stevenson TraQline, a market research firm. But its share in both categories declined nearly 6 percent over the last four years, shrinking alongside Sears' sales.Currently, about 90 percent of Craftsman products are sold through Sears, Kmart and Sears Hometown stores, Stanley President and CEO James Loree said on a conference call Thursday. Much of the 10 percent sold outside Sears-related channels is sold through Ace Hardware stores.

Craftsman's appeal might be slightly stronger with older customers who remember it from decades ago, when the Sears catalog's role was similar to that of e-commerce today, Loree said. But he  estimated the brand could add about $100 million of revenue growth per year for the next 10 years, in part by making Craftsman products more widely available.

"The world has changed, but Craftsman is still an incredibly strong brand," he said.Stanley is working on plans to begin expanding Craftsman's distribution but currently sells Stanley and Black & Decker brands to some of the biggest home and hardware retailers, including Home Depot, Lowe's and Amazon. The availability of Craftsman products outside of Sears could give shoppers even less reason to venture into its department stores. But those sales will generate cash for Sears, said Craig Johnson, president of consulting and research firm Customer Growth Partners."If the concept is to monetize some of Sears' assets, it's hard to think of a better partner to make that happen than a company like (Stanley)," he said.Sears has sold off multiple assets to try to turn itself from a traditional department store chain with a big brick-and-mortar footprint to a nimbler retailer focused on membership and online sales. The company previously spun off its Sears Hometown & Outlet and Lands' End businesses. In 2015, it sold 235 stores to a real estate investment trust spinoff, Seritage Growth Properties, and raised $2.72 billion. On Wednesday, Sears said it would close 150 unprofitable stores, including two Kmarts in Alton and Granite City. Last week, affiliates of Lampert's hedge fund, ESL Investments, also recently gave the retailer a $200 million letter of credit that could be expanded to $500 million. Lampert and his hedge fund's loans to the retailer add up to more than $1 billion since September 2014."We are taking strong, decisive actions today to stabilize the company and improve our financial flexibility in what remains a challenging retail environment," Lampert said in a news release. "We are confident that concentrating on these key initiatives will lay the foundation for growth over the long term."Sears did not make Lampert available for an interviewSears' sales have been shrinking for years but could be facing extra pressure after a holiday season that is shaping up to be a dismal one for some traditional department stores.During November and December,  sales at Sears and Kmart stores open at least a year declined at least 12 percent from a year ago, Sears said. Macy's and Kohl's each reported Wednesday a 2.1 percent drop in sales during November and December. Macy's said it had expected stronger sales and announced plans to close 68 stores by spring."My sense is (Sears has) been having a tough go in general for the last couple years, but this year has been particularly bad for malls and mall-based anchors," Johnson said.The deal with Stanley — on top of other recent cash infusions — is "like a life preserver that couldn't have come at a better time," he said.lzumbach@chicagotribune.com Twitter @laurenzumbach

Stanley Black & Decker to Buy Craftsman Brand From Sears For $900M

Sears Holdings said it reached a deal to sell its iconic Craftsman brand to Stanley Black & Decker for about $900 million, as the cash-strapped retailer continues to seek ways to whittle down its debt.

 Sears will continue to offer Craftsman-branded products though a perpetual license from Stanley Black & Decker, which will be royalty-free for the first 15 years after closing. The deal gives Stanley the rights to develop, manufacture and sell Craftsman-branded products outside of Sears. 
 Today just 10% of Craftsman-branded products are sold outside of Sears. Stanley Black & Decker said the deal will help boost Craftsman sales in untapped channels. 
 "We intend to invest in the brand and rapidly increase sales through these new channels, including retail, industrial, mobile and online," said Stanley Black & Decker Chief Executive James Loree. Stanley also recently signed a $1.95 billion deal to buy Newell Brands Inc.'s tools business. 
 Shares of Sears jumped 8.6% in premarket trading, while shares of Stanley rose 1.7%. 
 Mr. Loree said the company will expand its manufacturing footprint in the U.S.

 "This will add jobs in the U.S., where we have increased our manufacturing head count by 40% in the past three years," he said. 
 Stanley Black & Decker will pay Sears $525 million at closing, $250 million after three years, and annual payments on new Stanley Black & Decker Craftsman sales for 15 years. The license granted to Sears will remain royalty-free for 15 years, then 3% thereafter. 
 Stanley Black & Decker expects the sale of Craftsman branded products to contribute $100 million in sales annually for the next 10 years. The deal is expected to increase earnings by 10 cents to 15 cents a share in the first year, increasing to 35 cents to 45 cents by year five and 70 cents to 80 cents by year 10, excluding $20 million of deal-related costs. 
 Sears CEO Edward Lampert said the deal represents a significant step in the company's transformation to a membership-focused business model. He called Stanley "a great owner that is committed to expanding Craftsman and helping it to reach its potential outside of its current channels," he said.

Have had 2 of these beds, One extra large and one large.
The Large is tearing all along the bolster where it meets the bed surface.  
Not a small rip but a LARGE tear about 12 inches.
Not at all what I expected......looking for refund or new cover!

Have had 4 dogs beds over the past 8 years, for 2 dogs.  Never had one that fit the need as well as this one.
Easy to keep clean and Stella (80 pounds) is in heaven.  Stanley (120 pounds) is getting older now and needs something nice also.  Liked Stella's bed so much, his was just ordered today.
******UPDATE******
Just received the 2nd bed yesterday.......tried out the first one with my 80 pound Female.  Now the King of the House has his throne.
Stanley my 125 pound Shepperd/Lab Mix 8 year old, took to his new bed immediately.  He took a nap in it and when I got up this morning, he was completely stretched out in it and didn't make a move to get up as he usually does.
This is his 4th bed in 8 years...NONE has held up to his weight and size......Same with our female.  Think we have finally found their new beds for a long time.
They love them and the quality seems to be above average.Totally Awesome   !!!!!!!!!!!This book deserves more than 5 stars..I just got it, and read it in a few days. It is a fascinating book. I love the way that Dr. Stanley tells his story of his youth, and coming to Christ, and the trials that he endured when going to the First Baptist Church of Atlanta...If you like Dr. Stanley, you will NOT be disappointed in this book...Again, I say it is fascinating  !!!!Stanley I love my Stanley and love this iRobot even more because I can schedule cleaning everyday Beautiful color I've had this rug for about 5 yrs under my dining room table and the room gets lots of sun. The color has not faded and it looks as good as it did the day I purchased.  it's been cleaned 3x by Stanley Sreamer and held up beautifully. Sturdy and reliableI ordered this for my kitchen tool drawer.  It is perfect for my needs.  Since this is not my first dance with Stanley tools, I knew I could expect very good quaity.  I am not disappointed.Lovely chairs for the moneyDifficult to put together but I figured it out by the third chair. I put the back on first by hanging the chair over the dinning room table. I had a Stanley tool multi Allen wrench or hex key. The tool that was included with the chairs was impossible to use. Exactly What We WantedWe ordered this in red,replaced the factory back with one we had with numerous autographs of our Beloved Blackhawks and it is now our centerpiece for Stanley Cup runSLove this ottoman!It is a very attractive piece and works well with my decor. It serves many purposes in my home. Currently, my new puppy enjoys sleeping under it:-) Assembly was a breeze. Do be careful w/ upholstery cleaning agents. I used some leftover Stanley Steamer spot cleaner and it did discolor an area of the ottoman. Luckily the area was small enough that I can just stack some magazines over it.Very sturdy and exactly what I needed!Leave it to Stanley to put out a quality tool chest made of plastic! I wasn't sure what to expect but it is awesome. Everything fit inside and the compartments implemented in the design are perfect for all of your smaller tools, screws, tape rolls, etc. I definitely recommend this for someone who needs a tool chest at a good price.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
