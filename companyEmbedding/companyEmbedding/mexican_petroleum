The petroleum industry in Mexico makes Mexico the eleventh largest producer of oil in the world and the thirteenth largest in terms of net exports. Mexico has the seventeenth largest oil reserves in the world, and it is the fourth largest oil producer in the Western Hemisphere behind the United States, Canada and Venezuela.[1] Mexico is not a member of the OPEC (the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries) or any petroleum production related organizations, but since 1994 it is a member of the North American Free Trade Agreement.
The state-owned company Petróleos Mexicanos (Pemex) has exclusive rights over all oil production in Mexico. The petroleum sector is crucial to the Mexican economy; while its oil production has fallen in recent years, oil revenues still generate over 10% of Mexico's export earnings.[2] High taxes on the revenues of Pemex provide about a third of all the tax revenues collected by the Mexican government.[3]

History[edit]
Development of the oil industry in Mexico before 1938[edit]




Edward L. Doheny, California oil entrepreneur in Mexico


Petroleum was known in Mexico before the arrival of the Spaniards and used by the natives for incense and to repair canoes.[4] In Mexico's colonial era (1521-1821), ranchers lost cattle to tar pits in the Gulf Coast Region,[5] so it was considered more of a hazard than a valuable resource. Exploratory wells were first drilled in Mexico in 1869 by Mexican and some U.S. entrepreneurs.[5]
Development of petroleum took place as Mexico's railway system was developed in the 1880s and 1890s, allowing petroleum to reach export markets; before that there was no internal market for Mexican petroleum and no way for petroleum to be easily exported.[5] By 1901, commercial production of crude oil in Mexico had begun. California oil entrepreneur Edward L. Doheny opened the Ebano oil field along the Mexican Central Railway.[5]
In 1889, the Veracruz legislature passed a law titled “Ley sobre subdivision de la propiedad territorial", under which the state gave land titles to private owners. The privatization of land allowed state to declare any land that was not privatized to be public land. In 1883, the Mexican Congress passed the “Ley de Colonization," which allowed private land companies to survey public lands for the purpose of subdivision and settlement. For their work surveying this public land, the company would receive one-third the surveyed land, and gave them the opportunity to buy the remaining two-thirds at a very low cost.[6] This allowed more than 132 million acres of Mexican land to be owned by the surveyors. By the early twentieth century the reapportionment was complete.[6] The law divided former communal land and large estates into small, privately owned lots. Dealing with private landowners made it easier for foreign oil companies to buy or lease oil property. Many property owners considered the up-front bonus they received for leasing their property to be “easy money.” A typical oil lease allowed the property owners remain on the land; if the company did not start producing oil from the land within the term of the lease, commonly five years, the company would leave, and the owner still had the lease bonus money.[7]
July 1908, British entrepreneur Weetman Pearson struck oil in San Diego de la Mar, a co-proprietorship, that had been divided up into 87 individual lots, due to the privatization of lands.[8] In 1889, President Porfirio Díaz had contracted British Weetman Pearson, to engineer several major projects in Mexico, such as the drainage of Mexico City, the dredging of Veracruz harbor, and the building of the southern Vera Cruz Tehuantepec Isthmus railroad line.[9] Mexican President Porfirio Díaz also encouraged Pearson to develop petroleum reserves, resulting in the highly successful Compañia Mexicana de Petróleo "El Águila", exploiting the Potrero del Llano reserves located near the central Gulf of Mexico coast town of Tuxpán.[10]
This furthered fueled a massive land rush by the foreign oil companies. The two main companies Edward Doheny’s Huasteca Petroleum, and Weetman Pearson’s El Aguila were able to secure a large sum of land rights through ownership, and leasing. By 1922 Huasteca petroleum owned or leased 1,223,780 acres, and El Aguila 1,890,286 acres of land respectively.[11] Pearson subsequently sold his shares "El Aguila" to Royal Dutch Shell, although "El Aguila" continued to have a majority of British investors.[12] Mexico became an oil exporting nation in 1911, with the first shipment leaving the Gulf Coast port of Tampico.[5]
Article 27 of the constitution of 1917 granted the Mexican government the permanent and complete rights to all subsoil resources. This would cause conflicts between the Mexican government and foreign companies, and “lay basis for a twenty-one-year struggle” between Mexico and foreign oil companies. Foreign oil companies questioned if Article 27 would be applied retroactively, leading to expropriation of oil rights by the Mexican government. At the end of World War I, the United States was concerned with rapid exhaustion of domestic oil resources.[13] United States imports of crude oil, nearly all of it from Mexico, rose rapidly from 30 million barrels in 1917, to more than 100 million barrels per year from 1920 to 1922, before declining.[14] The demand for Mexican oil imports was increased by the United States conservation of oil movement. The United States saw Mexican oil as an opportunity and the US business interests were heavily backed by the United States government
In 1925, President Plutarco Elías Calles decreed that foreign oil companies must register their titles and limited their concessions to fifty years.[15]
Starting in 1918 and extending into the 1920s, Mexico was second behind the United States in petroleum output and led the world in oil exports. Oil production and exports from 1921-25 were at historic high levels. In 1921, production was in thousands of barrels of 42 gallons each 193,398, with exports at 172,268; 1922 production was 182,278 with exports of 180,866; 1923 production was 149,585, with exports of 135,607; 1924 production was 139,678, with exports of 129,700; and 1925 production was 115,515, with exports of 96,517.[16] In 1926 production dropped below (in thousands of barrels) 100,000 and in 1942, net exports dropped below 10,000.[16]
In the 1930s, as a consequence of worldwide economic depression, the lack of new oil discoveries, increased taxation, political instability, and Venezuela's emergence as a more attractive source of petroleum, output fell to just 20% of its 1921 level.[17] Production began to recover with the 1932 discovery of the Poza Rica field near Veracruz, which would become Mexico's main source of petroleum for the next several decades.
1938 expropriation[edit]
Main article: Mexican oil expropriation




Lázaro Cárdenas del Río, president of Mexico from 1934 to 1940. In 1938, Cárdenas ordered the expropriation of all oil companies in Mexico.


The expropriation of lands by the Mexican government started with the ratification of the Mexican constitution of 1917. By nationalizing the land, Mexico and the people would be better able to control working conditions, pay, and environmental impact. However, this privatization of land further marginalized the indigenous population.
In 1935, all companies in the business of oil production in Mexico were foreign companies. Labor practices in these companies poorly benefited the workers since the companies were able to block the creation of labor unions through legal and illegal tactics. Despite legal opposition, the Confederation of Mexican Workers was created and proposed a project of general contracts for each oil company. A strike was planned to push towards an agreement but the matter went to the court instead. On December 18, the Arbitration Board declared in favor of the union and ordered the oil companies had to pay 26 million pesos in lost wages because of the strike.
"Faced with political difficulties in Mexico, as well as the intrusion of saltwater into some of the major producing field, the United States and other foreign oil companies began to seek other sources of supply particularly in Venezuela, and interest in the middle east intensified as well." [18] Foreign oil companies continued to pump as much oil as quickly as possible for exportation, until the Mexican expropriation in 1938, “Ignoring reasonable conservation measures to export as much oil as quickly as possible”.[19] “Mexico only found itself compelled by the rebellious and defiant conduct of the oil companies that is decreed the expropriation of their properties.”[20] The United States refusal to recognize and work with Mexico’s post-revolution government, along with a very hazardous work environment that lead to workers strikes and revolts, forced the Mexican government to expropriate the land.
On March 18, 1938, Mexican President Lázaro Cárdenas announced the nationalization of all oil resources and facilities in Mexico. The government assumed control of all property of nearly every oil company operating in Mexico, including machinery, equipment, buildings, refineries, gas stations, ships and pipelines. At the time, the country's oil industry was dominated by Mexican Eagle Petroleum Company (a subsidiary of Royal Dutch Shell) and American oil firms such as Jersey Standard and Standard Oil of California.
On June 7, 1938, the state-owned company Petróleos Mexicanos (or "Pemex") was founded, with exclusive rights over exploration, extraction, refining, and commercialization of oil in Mexico.
International reaction to expropriation[edit]
The British government demanded immediate compensation for the Mexican Eagle Petroleum Company. However, the company had been founded as a Mexican company under Mexican law. Therefore, the British government couldn’t intervene directly in the company’s favor.[21] Diplomatic relations between the countries were soon broken, but not before Mexico paid a debt claimed by the British government for damages caused during the Mexican Revolution.[22]
The government of the Netherlands sent business manager Arthur Methöfer to defend the interests of their citizens. Methöfer refused to recognize the legality of the expropriation and demanded the immediate return of expropriated property or immediate payment as compensation. Mexican Secretary of Foreign Affairs Eduardo Hay reaffirmed that the Mexican government was willing and committed to pay compensation within the stipulated time period. As the Dutch government began to realize the Cárdenas government would not reverse the expropriation decree, the Anglo-Dutch company Royal Dutch Shell decided to pressure Mexico without the help of the government.[23]
Negotiations with the United States went differently. During Cárdenas’s speech, he claimed that the resources in the subsoil belonged to the Mexican nation, and therefore would not be considered as part of the compensation to foreign businesses. The companies, however, assumed compensation should include the fuel that was estimated to be found in the soil. President Franklin D. Roosevelt in a public speech recognized the right of Mexico to expropriate the oil properties and agreed to accept compensation for the properties of the companies excluding underground oil.[24]
Boycott[edit]
In retaliation for the expropriation, Standard Oil of New Jersey and Royal Dutch Shell began a boycott against Mexico.[25] The companies tried to prevent Mexico from acquiring chemicals necessary to the process of refining (such as tetraethyl lead), and specialized machinery.[26] This plan was supported by several American companies which refused to sell certain products to Mexico such as drilling equipment, pumps, ethyl fluid, air compressors and electrical equipment.[27]
Soon after, students at the Instituto Politécnico Nacional and the National Autonomous University of Mexico were able to synthesize tetraethyl lead, a popular gasoline additive at the time used for boosting octane ratings. Gradually, companies that sold parts and equipment gave in as Mexico opted to buy from Germany, Italy and other European countries.[28]
The U.S. State Department assisted with the boycott in various ways. Purchases of Mexican silver were suspended, which represented an average amount of $30 million annually, although after 1938 sales were resumed in smaller quantities and lower prices.[25] In the United States, government departments prohibited the use of Mexican fuel. Preference was given to the importation of Venezuelan oil. The import tax for Mexican oil increased from 15 to 50 cents on the dollar while Venezuelan oil was only taxed at 25 cents. Shipping agencies were pressured not to transport Mexican oil.[29]
World War II[edit]
Manuel Ávila Camacho was elected president of Mexico in 1940. With the development of World War II, Franklin Delano Roosevelt was more interested in forming a strategic alliance with Mexico to create an anti-fascist front than in protecting private companies. The U.S. government required cooperation to guard its borders and coastlines and to secure the supply of raw materials, including oil. As a result, the Good Neighbor policy was signed on November 17, 1941. The Mexican government agreed to pay $40 million for claims originating from the Mexican Revolution, and the U.S. government opened a line of credit in order to stabilize the Mexican currency. The State Department also resumed purchases of silver from Mexico and investments were made in Mexico’s transportation infrastructure.[30]
In 1938, Mexico had voted during the Pan-American Conference in favor of establishing continental solidarity against non-American and non-democratic influences, an allusion to the governments of Adolf Hitler and Benito Mussolini. Nonetheless, owing primarily to the boycott, Mexico maintained economic and commercial relations with these countries.[31] Gradually, commercial and diplomatic relations between Mexico and Germany and Italy deteriorated. After the attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941, all of Mexico’s diplomatic ties with Germany and Italy were cut.
Post-nationalization[edit]
Between 1938 and 1971, Mexico's oil output expanded at an average annual rate of 6%.[32] In 1957, Mexico became a petroleum net importer after domestic demands exceeded domestic production. However, production rose to 177 million barrels (28.1×10^6 m3) by 1971 with the exploitation of new oil fields in the isthmus of Tehuantepec and natural gas reserves near the northeastern border city of Reynosa, but the gap between domestic demand and production continued to widen.
1973 witnessed Mexican oil production surpassing the peak of 190 million barrels (30×10^6 m3) achieved in the early 1920s. In 1974 Pemex announced petroleum discoveries in Veracruz, Baja California, Chiapas, and Tabasco. In 1976, President López Portillo announced that Mexico's proven hydrocarbon reserves had risen up to 11 billion barrels (1.7×10^9 m3). By 1983, that figure further rose to 72.5 billion barrels (11.53×10^9 m3). López Portillo increased Mexican petroleum production and used the value of the reserves as collateral for negotiating large international loans, most of which went to Pemex.
From 1977 to 1980, Pemex received $12.6 billion in international credit, representing 37% of Mexico's total foreign debt but nevertheless used the money to construct and operate offshore drilling platforms. Pemex further expanded by building onshore processing facilities, enlarging its refineries, and vastly improving its production capabilities. These investments led to an increase in petroleum output from 400 million barrels (64×10^6 m3) in 1977 to 1.1 billion barrels (170×10^6 m3) by 1982, the end of López Portillo's six-year term as president.
By 2007, Mexico had a net oil export of 1.756 million barrels per day (279.2×10^3 m3/d).[33]
Oil production[edit]




Oil production in Mexico, 1950-2012 (red) and exports (black)


Mexico produces three grades of crude oil: heavy Maya-22 (accounting for more than half of the total production); light, low-sulfur Isthmus-34 (28% of production); and extra-light Olmeca-39 (20% of production). At the beginning of 2002 Mexico had the second largest proven oil reserves in the Western Hemisphere with 30.8 billion barrels (4.90×10^9 m3). However, according to Pemex, Mexico’s reserves/production ratio fell from 20 years in 2002 to 10 years in 2006, and Mexico had only 12.4 billion barrels (1.97×10^9 m3) of proven oil reserves left by 2007.[34] Mexico stands ninth in the worldwide ranking of conventional oil reserves with only Venezuela higher in the Western Hemisphere (although Canada ranks higher if proven reserves of unconventional oil in oil sands are included).
Pemex is Mexico's state-owned petroleum company and the sole supplier of all commercial gasoline (petrol/diesel) stations in the country. Cantarell Field is the largest oil field in Mexico and one of the largest in the world producing. As of Jan 2001, Mexico has approximately 10.42 billion barrels (1.657×10^9 m3) in proven oil reserves.[35] In November 2006, Pemex reported that Cantarell has produced 11.492 billion barrels (1.8271×10^9 m3) of oil.[36] Several oil fields have also been discovered in the Chicontepec Basin and neighboring Golden Lane. The Chicontepec fields contains Mexico's largest, certified hydrocarbon reserve, totaling more than 19,000,000,000 barrels of oil equivalent (1.2×1011 GJ) with original oil in place of over 139,000,000,000 barrels of oil equivalent (8.5×1011 GJ); recovery is complicated by challenging, low recovery rate reservoirs, but is made more attractive due to the presence of light and super-light oil.[37]
The "South Zone" for Pemex includes the states of Chiapas, Tabasco, Campeche, Yucatán, Quintana Roo and the southern portions of Guerreo, Oaxaca and Veracruz with exploration beginning in 1863 with Father Manuel Gil y Sainz's San Fernando Mine near Tepetitan Town, Tabasco,Dr. Simon Sarlat's well in 1883, and commercial production from the Capoacan and San Cristobal oil fields in 1905 and 1906 respectively.[38] Fields discovered with associated salt diapirs in the Saline Basin, near Coatzacoalcos, include Tonala-El Burro (1928), El Plan (1929), Cinco Presidentes (1946), Magallanes (1957) and Ogarrio (1957).[39] Fields producing from the Chiapas-Tabasco Mesozoic area around Villahermosa include Sitio Grande (1972), Cactus, and Antonio J. Bermudez (1958).[40] Fields discovered with associated anticlines in the Macuspana Basin, between Villahermosa and Ciudad del Carmen, include Jose Colomo (1951), Chilapilla (1956) and Hormiguero.[41]
In 2002, the Ku-Maloob-Zaap oil field was discovered offshore in the Bay of Campeche, 105 kilometers from Ciudad del Carmen. Pemex plans to drill 82 fields and install 17 oil platforms, as well as build an oil pipeline of 166 kilometers to transport the oil produced. By 2011, production is expected to reach 800 thousand barrels per day (130×10^3 m3/d) and 282 million cubic feet (8.0×10^6 m3) of natural gas.




Offshore platform in the Gulf of Mexico


Annual production has dropped or failed to increase each year since 2004.[42] Furthermore, it has been reported the 2005-2006 daily oil production was down by approximately 500 thousand barrels per day (79×10^3 m3/d) on the previous year. Nevertheless, Mexico still produced approximately 2.98 million barrels (474×10^3 m3) of oil per day (2010 est.) ranking it seventh in the world in terms of total production.[43]

The petroleum industry in Mexico makes Mexico the eleventh largest producer of oil in the world and the thirteenth largest in terms of net exports. Mexico has the seventeenth largest oil reserves in the world, and it is the fourth largest oil producer in the Western Hemisphere behind the United States, Canada and Venezuela.[1] Mexico is not a member of the OPEC (the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries) or any petroleum production related organizations, but since 1994 it is a member of the North American Free Trade Agreement.
The state-owned company Petróleos Mexicanos (Pemex) has exclusive rights over all oil production in Mexico. The petroleum sector is crucial to the Mexican economy; while its oil production has fallen in recent years, oil revenues still generate over 10% of Mexico's export earnings.[2] High taxes on the revenues of Pemex provide about a third of all the tax revenues collected by the Mexican government.[3]

History[edit]
Development of the oil industry in Mexico before 1938[edit]




Edward L. Doheny, California oil entrepreneur in Mexico


Petroleum was known in Mexico before the arrival of the Spaniards and used by the natives for incense and to repair canoes.[4] In Mexico's colonial era (1521-1821), ranchers lost cattle to tar pits in the Gulf Coast Region,[5] so it was considered more of a hazard than a valuable resource. Exploratory wells were first drilled in Mexico in 1869 by Mexican and some U.S. entrepreneurs.[5]
Development of petroleum took place as Mexico's railway system was developed in the 1880s and 1890s, allowing petroleum to reach export markets; before that there was no internal market for Mexican petroleum and no way for petroleum to be easily exported.[5] By 1901, commercial production of crude oil in Mexico had begun. California oil entrepreneur Edward L. Doheny opened the Ebano oil field along the Mexican Central Railway.[5]
In 1889, the Veracruz legislature passed a law titled “Ley sobre subdivision de la propiedad territorial", under which the state gave land titles to private owners. The privatization of land allowed state to declare any land that was not privatized to be public land. In 1883, the Mexican Congress passed the “Ley de Colonization," which allowed private land companies to survey public lands for the purpose of subdivision and settlement. For their work surveying this public land, the company would receive one-third the surveyed land, and gave them the opportunity to buy the remaining two-thirds at a very low cost.[6] This allowed more than 132 million acres of Mexican land to be owned by the surveyors. By the early twentieth century the reapportionment was complete.[6] The law divided former communal land and large estates into small, privately owned lots. Dealing with private landowners made it easier for foreign oil companies to buy or lease oil property. Many property owners considered the up-front bonus they received for leasing their property to be “easy money.” A typical oil lease allowed the property owners remain on the land; if the company did not start producing oil from the land within the term of the lease, commonly five years, the company would leave, and the owner still had the lease bonus money.[7]
July 1908, British entrepreneur Weetman Pearson struck oil in San Diego de la Mar, a co-proprietorship, that had been divided up into 87 individual lots, due to the privatization of lands.[8] In 1889, President Porfirio Díaz had contracted British Weetman Pearson, to engineer several major projects in Mexico, such as the drainage of Mexico City, the dredging of Veracruz harbor, and the building of the southern Vera Cruz Tehuantepec Isthmus railroad line.[9] Mexican President Porfirio Díaz also encouraged Pearson to develop petroleum reserves, resulting in the highly successful Compañia Mexicana de Petróleo "El Águila", exploiting the Potrero del Llano reserves located near the central Gulf of Mexico coast town of Tuxpán.[10]
This furthered fueled a massive land rush by the foreign oil companies. The two main companies Edward Doheny’s Huasteca Petroleum, and Weetman Pearson’s El Aguila were able to secure a large sum of land rights through ownership, and leasing. By 1922 Huasteca petroleum owned or leased 1,223,780 acres, and El Aguila 1,890,286 acres of land respectively.[11] Pearson subsequently sold his shares "El Aguila" to Royal Dutch Shell, although "El Aguila" continued to have a majority of British investors.[12] Mexico became an oil exporting nation in 1911, with the first shipment leaving the Gulf Coast port of Tampico.[5]
Article 27 of the constitution of 1917 granted the Mexican government the permanent and complete rights to all subsoil resources. This would cause conflicts between the Mexican government and foreign companies, and “lay basis for a twenty-one-year struggle” between Mexico and foreign oil companies. Foreign oil companies questioned if Article 27 would be applied retroactively, leading to expropriation of oil rights by the Mexican government. At the end of World War I, the United States was concerned with rapid exhaustion of domestic oil resources.[13] United States imports of crude oil, nearly all of it from Mexico, rose rapidly from 30 million barrels in 1917, to more than 100 million barrels per year from 1920 to 1922, before declining.[14] The demand for Mexican oil imports was increased by the United States conservation of oil movement. The United States saw Mexican oil as an opportunity and the US business interests were heavily backed by the United States government
In 1925, President Plutarco Elías Calles decreed that foreign oil companies must register their titles and limited their concessions to fifty years.[15]
Starting in 1918 and extending into the 1920s, Mexico was second behind the United States in petroleum output and led the world in oil exports. Oil production and exports from 1921-25 were at historic high levels. In 1921, production was in thousands of barrels of 42 gallons each 193,398, with exports at 172,268; 1922 production was 182,278 with exports of 180,866; 1923 production was 149,585, with exports of 135,607; 1924 production was 139,678, with exports of 129,700; and 1925 production was 115,515, with exports of 96,517.[16] In 1926 production dropped below (in thousands of barrels) 100,000 and in 1942, net exports dropped below 10,000.[16]
In the 1930s, as a consequence of worldwide economic depression, the lack of new oil discoveries, increased taxation, political instability, and Venezuela's emergence as a more attractive source of petroleum, output fell to just 20% of its 1921 level.[17] Production began to recover with the 1932 discovery of the Poza Rica field near Veracruz, which would become Mexico's main source of petroleum for the next several decades.
1938 expropriation[edit]
Main article: Mexican oil expropriation




Lázaro Cárdenas del Río, president of Mexico from 1934 to 1940. In 1938, Cárdenas ordered the expropriation of all oil companies in Mexico.


The expropriation of lands by the Mexican government started with the ratification of the Mexican constitution of 1917. By nationalizing the land, Mexico and the people would be better able to control working conditions, pay, and environmental impact. However, this privatization of land further marginalized the indigenous population.
In 1935, all companies in the business of oil production in Mexico were foreign companies. Labor practices in these companies poorly benefited the workers since the companies were able to block the creation of labor unions through legal and illegal tactics. Despite legal opposition, the Confederation of Mexican Workers was created and proposed a project of general contracts for each oil company. A strike was planned to push towards an agreement but the matter went to the court instead. On December 18, the Arbitration Board declared in favor of the union and ordered the oil companies had to pay 26 million pesos in lost wages because of the strike.
"Faced with political difficulties in Mexico, as well as the intrusion of saltwater into some of the major producing field, the United States and other foreign oil companies began to seek other sources of supply particularly in Venezuela, and interest in the middle east intensified as well." [18] Foreign oil companies continued to pump as much oil as quickly as possible for exportation, until the Mexican expropriation in 1938, “Ignoring reasonable conservation measures to export as much oil as quickly as possible”.[19] “Mexico only found itself compelled by the rebellious and defiant conduct of the oil companies that is decreed the expropriation of their properties.”[20] The United States refusal to recognize and work with Mexico’s post-revolution government, along with a very hazardous work environment that lead to workers strikes and revolts, forced the Mexican government to expropriate the land.
On March 18, 1938, Mexican President Lázaro Cárdenas announced the nationalization of all oil resources and facilities in Mexico. The government assumed control of all property of nearly every oil company operating in Mexico, including machinery, equipment, buildings, refineries, gas stations, ships and pipelines. At the time, the country's oil industry was dominated by Mexican Eagle Petroleum Company (a subsidiary of Royal Dutch Shell) and American oil firms such as Jersey Standard and Standard Oil of California.
On June 7, 1938, the state-owned company Petróleos Mexicanos (or "Pemex") was founded, with exclusive rights over exploration, extraction, refining, and commercialization of oil in Mexico.
International reaction to expropriation[edit]
The British government demanded immediate compensation for the Mexican Eagle Petroleum Company. However, the company had been founded as a Mexican company under Mexican law. Therefore, the British government couldn’t intervene directly in the company’s favor.[21] Diplomatic relations between the countries were soon broken, but not before Mexico paid a debt claimed by the British government for damages caused during the Mexican Revolution.[22]
The government of the Netherlands sent business manager Arthur Methöfer to defend the interests of their citizens. Methöfer refused to recognize the legality of the expropriation and demanded the immediate return of expropriated property or immediate payment as compensation. Mexican Secretary of Foreign Affairs Eduardo Hay reaffirmed that the Mexican government was willing and committed to pay compensation within the stipulated time period. As the Dutch government began to realize the Cárdenas government would not reverse the expropriation decree, the Anglo-Dutch company Royal Dutch Shell decided to pressure Mexico without the help of the government.[23]
Negotiations with the United States went differently. During Cárdenas’s speech, he claimed that the resources in the subsoil belonged to the Mexican nation, and therefore would not be considered as part of the compensation to foreign businesses. The companies, however, assumed compensation should include the fuel that was estimated to be found in the soil. President Franklin D. Roosevelt in a public speech recognized the right of Mexico to expropriate the oil properties and agreed to accept compensation for the properties of the companies excluding underground oil.[24]
Boycott[edit]
In retaliation for the expropriation, Standard Oil of New Jersey and Royal Dutch Shell began a boycott against Mexico.[25] The companies tried to prevent Mexico from acquiring chemicals necessary to the process of refining (such as tetraethyl lead), and specialized machinery.[26] This plan was supported by several American companies which refused to sell certain products to Mexico such as drilling equipment, pumps, ethyl fluid, air compressors and electrical equipment.[27]
Soon after, students at the Instituto Politécnico Nacional and the National Autonomous University of Mexico were able to synthesize tetraethyl lead, a popular gasoline additive at the time used for boosting octane ratings. Gradually, companies that sold parts and equipment gave in as Mexico opted to buy from Germany, Italy and other European countries.[28]
The U.S. State Department assisted with the boycott in various ways. Purchases of Mexican silver were suspended, which represented an average amount of $30 million annually, although after 1938 sales were resumed in smaller quantities and lower prices.[25] In the United States, government departments prohibited the use of Mexican fuel. Preference was given to the importation of Venezuelan oil. The import tax for Mexican oil increased from 15 to 50 cents on the dollar while Venezuelan oil was only taxed at 25 cents. Shipping agencies were pressured not to transport Mexican oil.[29]
World War II[edit]
Manuel Ávila Camacho was elected president of Mexico in 1940. With the development of World War II, Franklin Delano Roosevelt was more interested in forming a strategic alliance with Mexico to create an anti-fascist front than in protecting private companies. The U.S. government required cooperation to guard its borders and coastlines and to secure the supply of raw materials, including oil. As a result, the Good Neighbor policy was signed on November 17, 1941. The Mexican government agreed to pay $40 million for claims originating from the Mexican Revolution, and the U.S. government opened a line of credit in order to stabilize the Mexican currency. The State Department also resumed purchases of silver from Mexico and investments were made in Mexico’s transportation infrastructure.[30]
In 1938, Mexico had voted during the Pan-American Conference in favor of establishing continental solidarity against non-American and non-democratic influences, an allusion to the governments of Adolf Hitler and Benito Mussolini. Nonetheless, owing primarily to the boycott, Mexico maintained economic and commercial relations with these countries.[31] Gradually, commercial and diplomatic relations between Mexico and Germany and Italy deteriorated. After the attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941, all of Mexico’s diplomatic ties with Germany and Italy were cut.
Post-nationalization[edit]
Between 1938 and 1971, Mexico's oil output expanded at an average annual rate of 6%.[32] In 1957, Mexico became a petroleum net importer after domestic demands exceeded domestic production. However, production rose to 177 million barrels (28.1×10^6 m3) by 1971 with the exploitation of new oil fields in the isthmus of Tehuantepec and natural gas reserves near the northeastern border city of Reynosa, but the gap between domestic demand and production continued to widen.
1973 witnessed Mexican oil production surpassing the peak of 190 million barrels (30×10^6 m3) achieved in the early 1920s. In 1974 Pemex announced petroleum discoveries in Veracruz, Baja California, Chiapas, and Tabasco. In 1976, President López Portillo announced that Mexico's proven hydrocarbon reserves had risen up to 11 billion barrels (1.7×10^9 m3). By 1983, that figure further rose to 72.5 billion barrels (11.53×10^9 m3). López Portillo increased Mexican petroleum production and used the value of the reserves as collateral for negotiating large international loans, most of which went to Pemex.
From 1977 to 1980, Pemex received $12.6 billion in international credit, representing 37% of Mexico's total foreign debt but nevertheless used the money to construct and operate offshore drilling platforms. Pemex further expanded by building onshore processing facilities, enlarging its refineries, and vastly improving its production capabilities. These investments led to an increase in petroleum output from 400 million barrels (64×10^6 m3) in 1977 to 1.1 billion barrels (170×10^6 m3) by 1982, the end of López Portillo's six-year term as president.
By 2007, Mexico had a net oil export of 1.756 million barrels per day (279.2×10^3 m3/d).[33]
Oil production[edit]




Oil production in Mexico, 1950-2012 (red) and exports (black)


Mexico produces three grades of crude oil: heavy Maya-22 (accounting for more than half of the total production); light, low-sulfur Isthmus-34 (28% of production); and extra-light Olmeca-39 (20% of production). At the beginning of 2002 Mexico had the second largest proven oil reserves in the Western Hemisphere with 30.8 billion barrels (4.90×10^9 m3). However, according to Pemex, Mexico’s reserves/production ratio fell from 20 years in 2002 to 10 years in 2006, and Mexico had only 12.4 billion barrels (1.97×10^9 m3) of proven oil reserves left by 2007.[34] Mexico stands ninth in the worldwide ranking of conventional oil reserves with only Venezuela higher in the Western Hemisphere (although Canada ranks higher if proven reserves of unconventional oil in oil sands are included).
Pemex is Mexico's state-owned petroleum company and the sole supplier of all commercial gasoline (petrol/diesel) stations in the country. Cantarell Field is the largest oil field in Mexico and one of the largest in the world producing. As of Jan 2001, Mexico has approximately 10.42 billion barrels (1.657×10^9 m3) in proven oil reserves.[35] In November 2006, Pemex reported that Cantarell has produced 11.492 billion barrels (1.8271×10^9 m3) of oil.[36] Several oil fields have also been discovered in the Chicontepec Basin and neighboring Golden Lane. The Chicontepec fields contains Mexico's largest, certified hydrocarbon reserve, totaling more than 19,000,000,000 barrels of oil equivalent (1.2×1011 GJ) with original oil in place of over 139,000,000,000 barrels of oil equivalent (8.5×1011 GJ); recovery is complicated by challenging, low recovery rate reservoirs, but is made more attractive due to the presence of light and super-light oil.[37]
The "South Zone" for Pemex includes the states of Chiapas, Tabasco, Campeche, Yucatán, Quintana Roo and the southern portions of Guerreo, Oaxaca and Veracruz with exploration beginning in 1863 with Father Manuel Gil y Sainz's San Fernando Mine near Tepetitan Town, Tabasco,Dr. Simon Sarlat's well in 1883, and commercial production from the Capoacan and San Cristobal oil fields in 1905 and 1906 respectively.[38] Fields discovered with associated salt diapirs in the Saline Basin, near Coatzacoalcos, include Tonala-El Burro (1928), El Plan (1929), Cinco Presidentes (1946), Magallanes (1957) and Ogarrio (1957).[39] Fields producing from the Chiapas-Tabasco Mesozoic area around Villahermosa include Sitio Grande (1972), Cactus, and Antonio J. Bermudez (1958).[40] Fields discovered with associated anticlines in the Macuspana Basin, between Villahermosa and Ciudad del Carmen, include Jose Colomo (1951), Chilapilla (1956) and Hormiguero.[41]
In 2002, the Ku-Maloob-Zaap oil field was discovered offshore in the Bay of Campeche, 105 kilometers from Ciudad del Carmen. Pemex plans to drill 82 fields and install 17 oil platforms, as well as build an oil pipeline of 166 kilometers to transport the oil produced. By 2011, production is expected to reach 800 thousand barrels per day (130×10^3 m3/d) and 282 million cubic feet (8.0×10^6 m3) of natural gas.




Offshore platform in the Gulf of Mexico


Annual production has dropped or failed to increase each year since 2004.[42] Furthermore, it has been reported the 2005-2006 daily oil production was down by approximately 500 thousand barrels per day (79×10^3 m3/d) on the previous year. Nevertheless, Mexico still produced approximately 2.98 million barrels (474×10^3 m3) of oil per day (2010 est.) ranking it seventh in the world in terms of total production.[43]

Petroleum industry in Mexico

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


					Jump to:					navigation, 					search





A gas station in Puerto Vallarta


The petroleum industry in Mexico makes Mexico the eleventh largest producer of oil in the world and the thirteenth largest in terms of net exports. Mexico has the seventeenth largest oil reserves in the world, and it is the fourth largest oil producer in the Western Hemisphere behind the United States, Canada and Venezuela.[1] Mexico is not a member of the OPEC (the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries) or any petroleum production related organizations, but since 1994 it is a member of the North American Free Trade Agreement.
The state-owned company Petróleos Mexicanos (Pemex) has exclusive rights over all oil production in Mexico. The petroleum sector is crucial to the Mexican economy; while its oil production has fallen in recent years, oil revenues still generate over 10% of Mexico's export earnings.[2] High taxes on the revenues of Pemex provide about a third of all the tax revenues collected by the Mexican government.[3]

History[edit]
Development of the oil industry in Mexico before 1938[edit]




Edward L. Doheny, California oil entrepreneur in Mexico


Petroleum was known in Mexico before the arrival of the Spaniards and used by the natives for incense and to repair canoes.[4] In Mexico's colonial era (1521-1821), ranchers lost cattle to tar pits in the Gulf Coast Region,[5] so it was considered more of a hazard than a valuable resource. Exploratory wells were first drilled in Mexico in 1869 by Mexican and some U.S. entrepreneurs.[5]
Development of petroleum took place as Mexico's railway system was developed in the 1880s and 1890s, allowing petroleum to reach export markets; before that there was no internal market for Mexican petroleum and no way for petroleum to be easily exported.[5] By 1901, commercial production of crude oil in Mexico had begun. California oil entrepreneur Edward L. Doheny opened the Ebano oil field along the Mexican Central Railway.[5]
In 1889, the Veracruz legislature passed a law titled “Ley sobre subdivision de la propiedad territorial", under which the state gave land titles to private owners. The privatization of land allowed state to declare any land that was not privatized to be public land. In 1883, the Mexican Congress passed the “Ley de Colonization," which allowed private land companies to survey public lands for the purpose of subdivision and settlement. For their work surveying this public land, the company would receive one-third the surveyed land, and gave them the opportunity to buy the remaining two-thirds at a very low cost.[6] This allowed more than 132 million acres of Mexican land to be owned by the surveyors. By the early twentieth century the reapportionment was complete.[6] The law divided former communal land and large estates into small, privately owned lots. Dealing with private landowners made it easier for foreign oil companies to buy or lease oil property. Many property owners considered the up-front bonus they received for leasing their property to be “easy money.” A typical oil lease allowed the property owners remain on the land; if the company did not start producing oil from the land within the term of the lease, commonly five years, the company would leave, and the owner still had the lease bonus money.[7]
July 1908, British entrepreneur Weetman Pearson struck oil in San Diego de la Mar, a co-proprietorship, that had been divided up into 87 individual lots, due to the privatization of lands.[8] In 1889, President Porfirio Díaz had contracted British Weetman Pearson, to engineer several major projects in Mexico, such as the drainage of Mexico City, the dredging of Veracruz harbor, and the building of the southern Vera Cruz Tehuantepec Isthmus railroad line.[9] Mexican President Porfirio Díaz also encouraged Pearson to develop petroleum reserves, resulting in the highly successful Compañia Mexicana de Petróleo "El Águila", exploiting the Potrero del Llano reserves located near the central Gulf of Mexico coast town of Tuxpán.[10]
This furthered fueled a massive land rush by the foreign oil companies. The two main companies Edward Doheny’s Huasteca Petroleum, and Weetman Pearson’s El Aguila were able to secure a large sum of land rights through ownership, and leasing. By 1922 Huasteca petroleum owned or leased 1,223,780 acres, and El Aguila 1,890,286 acres of land respectively.[11] Pearson subsequently sold his shares "El Aguila" to Royal Dutch Shell, although "El Aguila" continued to have a majority of British investors.[12] Mexico became an oil exporting nation in 1911, with the first shipment leaving the Gulf Coast port of Tampico.[5]
Article 27 of the constitution of 1917 granted the Mexican government the permanent and complete rights to all subsoil resources. This would cause conflicts between the Mexican government and foreign companies, and “lay basis for a twenty-one-year struggle” between Mexico and foreign oil companies. Foreign oil companies questioned if Article 27 would be applied retroactively, leading to expropriation of oil rights by the Mexican government. At the end of World War I, the United States was concerned with rapid exhaustion of domestic oil resources.[13] United States imports of crude oil, nearly all of it from Mexico, rose rapidly from 30 million barrels in 1917, to more than 100 million barrels per year from 1920 to 1922, before declining.[14] The demand for Mexican oil imports was increased by the United States conservation of oil movement. The United States saw Mexican oil as an opportunity and the US business interests were heavily backed by the United States government
In 1925, President Plutarco Elías Calles decreed that foreign oil companies must register their titles and limited their concessions to fifty years.[15]
Starting in 1918 and extending into the 1920s, Mexico was second behind the United States in petroleum output and led the world in oil exports. Oil production and exports from 1921-25 were at historic high levels. In 1921, production was in thousands of barrels of 42 gallons each 193,398, with exports at 172,268; 1922 production was 182,278 with exports of 180,866; 1923 production was 149,585, with exports of 135,607; 1924 production was 139,678, with exports of 129,700; and 1925 production was 115,515, with exports of 96,517.[16] In 1926 production dropped below (in thousands of barrels) 100,000 and in 1942, net exports dropped below 10,000.[16]
In the 1930s, as a consequence of worldwide economic depression, the lack of new oil discoveries, increased taxation, political instability, and Venezuela's emergence as a more attractive source of petroleum, output fell to just 20% of its 1921 level.[17] Production began to recover with the 1932 discovery of the Poza Rica field near Veracruz, which would become Mexico's main source of petroleum for the next several decades.
1938 expropriation[edit]
Main article: Mexican oil expropriation




Lázaro Cárdenas del Río, president of Mexico from 1934 to 1940. In 1938, Cárdenas ordered the expropriation of all oil companies in Mexico.


The expropriation of lands by the Mexican government started with the ratification of the Mexican constitution of 1917. By nationalizing the land, Mexico and the people would be better able to control working conditions, pay, and environmental impact. However, this privatization of land further marginalized the indigenous population.
In 1935, all companies in the business of oil production in Mexico were foreign companies. Labor practices in these companies poorly benefited the workers since the companies were able to block the creation of labor unions through legal and illegal tactics. Despite legal opposition, the Confederation of Mexican Workers was created and proposed a project of general contracts for each oil company. A strike was planned to push towards an agreement but the matter went to the court instead. On December 18, the Arbitration Board declared in favor of the union and ordered the oil companies had to pay 26 million pesos in lost wages because of the strike.
"Faced with political difficulties in Mexico, as well as the intrusion of saltwater into some of the major producing field, the United States and other foreign oil companies began to seek other sources of supply particularly in Venezuela, and interest in the middle east intensified as well." [18] Foreign oil companies continued to pump as much oil as quickly as possible for exportation, until the Mexican expropriation in 1938, “Ignoring reasonable conservation measures to export as much oil as quickly as possible”.[19] “Mexico only found itself compelled by the rebellious and defiant conduct of the oil companies that is decreed the expropriation of their properties.”[20] The United States refusal to recognize and work with Mexico’s post-revolution government, along with a very hazardous work environment that lead to workers strikes and revolts, forced the Mexican government to expropriate the land.
On March 18, 1938, Mexican President Lázaro Cárdenas announced the nationalization of all oil resources and facilities in Mexico. The government assumed control of all property of nearly every oil company operating in Mexico, including machinery, equipment, buildings, refineries, gas stations, ships and pipelines. At the time, the country's oil industry was dominated by Mexican Eagle Petroleum Company (a subsidiary of Royal Dutch Shell) and American oil firms such as Jersey Standard and Standard Oil of California.
On June 7, 1938, the state-owned company Petróleos Mexicanos (or "Pemex") was founded, with exclusive rights over exploration, extraction, refining, and commercialization of oil in Mexico.
International reaction to expropriation[edit]
The British government demanded immediate compensation for the Mexican Eagle Petroleum Company. However, the company had been founded as a Mexican company under Mexican law. Therefore, the British government couldn’t intervene directly in the company’s favor.[21] Diplomatic relations between the countries were soon broken, but not before Mexico paid a debt claimed by the British government for damages caused during the Mexican Revolution.[22]
The government of the Netherlands sent business manager Arthur Methöfer to defend the interests of their citizens. Methöfer refused to recognize the legality of the expropriation and demanded the immediate return of expropriated property or immediate payment as compensation. Mexican Secretary of Foreign Affairs Eduardo Hay reaffirmed that the Mexican government was willing and committed to pay compensation within the stipulated time period. As the Dutch government began to realize the Cárdenas government would not reverse the expropriation decree, the Anglo-Dutch company Royal Dutch Shell decided to pressure Mexico without the help of the government.[23]
Negotiations with the United States went differently. During Cárdenas’s speech, he claimed that the resources in the subsoil belonged to the Mexican nation, and therefore would not be considered as part of the compensation to foreign businesses. The companies, however, assumed compensation should include the fuel that was estimated to be found in the soil. President Franklin D. Roosevelt in a public speech recognized the right of Mexico to expropriate the oil properties and agreed to accept compensation for the properties of the companies excluding underground oil.[24]
Boycott[edit]
In retaliation for the expropriation, Standard Oil of New Jersey and Royal Dutch Shell began a boycott against Mexico.[25] The companies tried to prevent Mexico from acquiring chemicals necessary to the process of refining (such as tetraethyl lead), and specialized machinery.[26] This plan was supported by several American companies which refused to sell certain products to Mexico such as drilling equipment, pumps, ethyl fluid, air compressors and electrical equipment.[27]
Soon after, students at the Instituto Politécnico Nacional and the National Autonomous University of Mexico were able to synthesize tetraethyl lead, a popular gasoline additive at the time used for boosting octane ratings. Gradually, companies that sold parts and equipment gave in as Mexico opted to buy from Germany, Italy and other European countries.[28]
The U.S. State Department assisted with the boycott in various ways. Purchases of Mexican silver were suspended, which represented an average amount of $30 million annually, although after 1938 sales were resumed in smaller quantities and lower prices.[25] In the United States, government departments prohibited the use of Mexican fuel. Preference was given to the importation of Venezuelan oil. The import tax for Mexican oil increased from 15 to 50 cents on the dollar while Venezuelan oil was only taxed at 25 cents. Shipping agencies were pressured not to transport Mexican oil.[29]
World War II[edit]
Manuel Ávila Camacho was elected president of Mexico in 1940. With the development of World War II, Franklin Delano Roosevelt was more interested in forming a strategic alliance with Mexico to create an anti-fascist front than in protecting private companies. The U.S. government required cooperation to guard its borders and coastlines and to secure the supply of raw materials, including oil. As a result, the Good Neighbor policy was signed on November 17, 1941. The Mexican government agreed to pay $40 million for claims originating from the Mexican Revolution, and the U.S. government opened a line of credit in order to stabilize the Mexican currency. The State Department also resumed purchases of silver from Mexico and investments were made in Mexico’s transportation infrastructure.[30]
In 1938, Mexico had voted during the Pan-American Conference in favor of establishing continental solidarity against non-American and non-democratic influences, an allusion to the governments of Adolf Hitler and Benito Mussolini. Nonetheless, owing primarily to the boycott, Mexico maintained economic and commercial relations with these countries.[31] Gradually, commercial and diplomatic relations between Mexico and Germany and Italy deteriorated. After the attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941, all of Mexico’s diplomatic ties with Germany and Italy were cut.
Post-nationalization[edit]
Between 1938 and 1971, Mexico's oil output expanded at an average annual rate of 6%.[32] In 1957, Mexico became a petroleum net importer after domestic demands exceeded domestic production. However, production rose to 177 million barrels (28.1×10^6 m3) by 1971 with the exploitation of new oil fields in the isthmus of Tehuantepec and natural gas reserves near the northeastern border city of Reynosa, but the gap between domestic demand and production continued to widen.
1973 witnessed Mexican oil production surpassing the peak of 190 million barrels (30×10^6 m3) achieved in the early 1920s. In 1974 Pemex announced petroleum discoveries in Veracruz, Baja California, Chiapas, and Tabasco. In 1976, President López Portillo announced that Mexico's proven hydrocarbon reserves had risen up to 11 billion barrels (1.7×10^9 m3). By 1983, that figure further rose to 72.5 billion barrels (11.53×10^9 m3). López Portillo increased Mexican petroleum production and used the value of the reserves as collateral for negotiating large international loans, most of which went to Pemex.
From 1977 to 1980, Pemex received $12.6 billion in international credit, representing 37% of Mexico's total foreign debt but nevertheless used the money to construct and operate offshore drilling platforms. Pemex further expanded by building onshore processing facilities, enlarging its refineries, and vastly improving its production capabilities. These investments led to an increase in petroleum output from 400 million barrels (64×10^6 m3) in 1977 to 1.1 billion barrels (170×10^6 m3) by 1982, the end of López Portillo's six-year term as president.
By 2007, Mexico had a net oil export of 1.756 million barrels per day (279.2×10^3 m3/d).[33]
Oil production[edit]




Oil production in Mexico, 1950-2012 (red) and exports (black)


Mexico produces three grades of crude oil: heavy Maya-22 (accounting for more than half of the total production); light, low-sulfur Isthmus-34 (28% of production); and extra-light Olmeca-39 (20% of production). At the beginning of 2002 Mexico had the second largest proven oil reserves in the Western Hemisphere with 30.8 billion barrels (4.90×10^9 m3). However, according to Pemex, Mexico’s reserves/production ratio fell from 20 years in 2002 to 10 years in 2006, and Mexico had only 12.4 billion barrels (1.97×10^9 m3) of proven oil reserves left by 2007.[34] Mexico stands ninth in the worldwide ranking of conventional oil reserves with only Venezuela higher in the Western Hemisphere (although Canada ranks higher if proven reserves of unconventional oil in oil sands are included).
Pemex is Mexico's state-owned petroleum company and the sole supplier of all commercial gasoline (petrol/diesel) stations in the country. Cantarell Field is the largest oil field in Mexico and one of the largest in the world producing. As of Jan 2001, Mexico has approximately 10.42 billion barrels (1.657×10^9 m3) in proven oil reserves.[35] In November 2006, Pemex reported that Cantarell has produced 11.492 billion barrels (1.8271×10^9 m3) of oil.[36] Several oil fields have also been discovered in the Chicontepec Basin and neighboring Golden Lane. The Chicontepec fields contains Mexico's largest, certified hydrocarbon reserve, totaling more than 19,000,000,000 barrels of oil equivalent (1.2×1011 GJ) with original oil in place of over 139,000,000,000 barrels of oil equivalent (8.5×1011 GJ); recovery is complicated by challenging, low recovery rate reservoirs, but is made more attractive due to the presence of light and super-light oil.[37]
The "South Zone" for Pemex includes the states of Chiapas, Tabasco, Campeche, Yucatán, Quintana Roo and the southern portions of Guerreo, Oaxaca and Veracruz with exploration beginning in 1863 with Father Manuel Gil y Sainz's San Fernando Mine near Tepetitan Town, Tabasco,Dr. Simon Sarlat's well in 1883, and commercial production from the Capoacan and San Cristobal oil fields in 1905 and 1906 respectively.[38] Fields discovered with associated salt diapirs in the Saline Basin, near Coatzacoalcos, include Tonala-El Burro (1928), El Plan (1929), Cinco Presidentes (1946), Magallanes (1957) and Ogarrio (1957).[39] Fields producing from the Chiapas-Tabasco Mesozoic area around Villahermosa include Sitio Grande (1972), Cactus, and Antonio J. Bermudez (1958).[40] Fields discovered with associated anticlines in the Macuspana Basin, between Villahermosa and Ciudad del Carmen, include Jose Colomo (1951), Chilapilla (1956) and Hormiguero.[41]
In 2002, the Ku-Maloob-Zaap oil field was discovered offshore in the Bay of Campeche, 105 kilometers from Ciudad del Carmen. Pemex plans to drill 82 fields and install 17 oil platforms, as well as build an oil pipeline of 166 kilometers to transport the oil produced. By 2011, production is expected to reach 800 thousand barrels per day (130×10^3 m3/d) and 282 million cubic feet (8.0×10^6 m3) of natural gas.




Offshore platform in the Gulf of Mexico


Annual production has dropped or failed to increase each year since 2004.[42] Furthermore, it has been reported the 2005-2006 daily oil production was down by approximately 500 thousand barrels per day (79×10^3 m3/d) on the previous year. Nevertheless, Mexico still produced approximately 2.98 million barrels (474×10^3 m3) of oil per day (2010 est.) ranking it seventh in the world in terms of total production.[43]

History[edit]




Weetman Pearson, Viscount Cowdray


Sir Weetman Pearson, Bart. (Viscount Cowdray from 1910) founded the company in 1909 to develop his investments in the Mexican oil fields.
Pearson's interests in Mexico had begun in 1889 when he won a contract from the government of Porfirio Díaz for his civil engineering company, S. Pearson and Sons Ltd, to build the Gran Canal in Mexico City.[1] This was followed by contracts in 1895 to build a harbour at Veracruz and in 1896 to build the Tehuantepec Railway.[2] Pearson diversified into mining, landholding, transport and electrical utilities around Veracruz.[2] He and the engineer F.S. Pearson (no relation) founded the Mexico Power and Light Company, which provided Mexico City's first public electricity supply.[2] Pearson's businesses and government contracts put him in a favourable position with members of the Díaz dictatorship.[2]
Oil production in Mexico was begun in 1901 by a US oil investor, Henry Clay Pierce.[3] He was quickly followed by a rival, Edward L. Doheny, in the same year.[3] Pearson's land surveys in the vicinities of Pedregal and San Cristóbal for the route of the Tehuantepec Railway had reported oil seepage from the ground, so in April 1901 he ordered his manager in Mexico to secure prospecting options on "...all land for miles around".[4] Pearson built a refinery, pipelines and port facilities to handle the oil in 1905–06, but his company didn't make a major oil strike until 1908.[5] In the same year one of Pearson's oil strikes caught fire and burned out of control for eight weeks, destroying the entire oil field.[5]
In 1909 Pearson founded the Compañía Mexicana de Petróleo El Aguila SA ("Mexican Eagle Oil Company") in Mexico to take over S. Pearson and Sons' oil interests.[6] This followed Pearson's creation of Whitehall Securities Corporation Ltd. in the UK in 1908 to manage all of S. Pearson and Sons' investments outside the oil industry.[7] Pearson's prospecting continued without success until 27 December 1910, when a well on the Gulf of Mexico coast between Veracruz and Tampico struck oil that flowed at a rate of 100,000 barrels per day.[8] This single well turned the fortunes of Pearson's oil business. Within a few years he was one of Mexico's two major oil magnates, the other being Doheny.[8] Other oil companies from the USA and Europe had entered the Mexican oil industry but Doheny and Pearson's companies remained pre-eminent until after the First World War.[8]
In 1911 the Mexican revolution overthrew the Díaz dictatorship that had favoured Pearson, ending the civil engineering contracts for which he had first become involved in Mexico.[9] However, Pearson had exclusive rights to prospect for oil in several Mexican states[10] and by 1914 the company 1,500,000 acres (6,100 km2) of prospecting rights, 175 miles (282 kilometres) of pipeline, two refineries (the second being newly built at Tampico) and storage for seven million barrels of oil.[8]
By June 1913 Mexican Eagle was the largest company in the Pearson group, with net assets valued at £6.8 million.[11] However, in December 1918 Pearson claimed in a letter to the UK Chancellor of the Exchequer, David Lloyd George, that Mexican Eagle was worth £8 million.[11] Mexican Eagle was the largest contributor to the Pearson group's valuation in 1913 of £17 million, which made it the seventh largest business in the UK and among the 30 largest businesses in the World.[12] By 1919 the Pearson group was worth £29.6 million, of which in June of that year Mexican Eagle made up £13.4 million.[12] To what extent this represents a growth in value must be considered against the degree of inflation that took place in the First World War.[13] However, in 1919 the Pearson group's share value was £79.1 million, of which Mexican Eagle made up £62.6 million.[14] This made Mexican Eagle roughly the equal of Burmah Oil and far bigger than the Anglo-Persian Oil Company or Shell Transport and Trading.[15]
Buyout offers and eventual sale[edit]
In 1911 Pearson declined an offer from the Texas Oil Company offered to buy his oil interests.[16] In 1912 and 1913 he declined buyout bids from Royal Dutch Shell.[16] and in 1913 and 1916 he declined bids from Standard Oil of New Jersey.[16] By 1916 Pearson was keen to sell, but the UK Government persuaded him for strategic reasons not to do so.[16] Pearson asked the UK Government to buy 50% of his oil interests, but it responded in 1917 by imposing restrictions that prevented him from transferring ownership as long as the war continued.[16] The Constitution of Mexico adopted in 1917 nationalised oil deposits.[16]
In October 1918, a month before the Armistice, Calouste Gulbenkian started negotiations with Pearson for Royal Dutch Shell to buy Mexican Eagle.[17] On April 2, 1919[17] the Royal Dutch Petroleum Company and the "Shell" Transport and Trading Company jointly bought Mexican Eagle for US$75 million.[18]
Mexican Eagle was the dominant firm in the Mexican petroleum industry until March 18, 1938, when the government of Lázaro Cárdenas nationalized it, along with all other foreign-owned oil interests, to create Petróleos Mexicanos (Pemex).
El Aguila formally dissolved itself on May 24, 1963.[19]
Eagle Oil and Shipping Company[edit]
Main article: Eagle Oil and Shipping Company
Pearson started to acquire steam tankers to carry the oil that he hoped to produce. Armstrong Whitworth on the River Tyne launched SS San Cristobal (2,041 tons) in 1906 and Swan Hunter, also on Tyneside, launched SS San Antonio (5,251 tons) in 1909. Pearson also bought SS James Brand (3,907 tons), which had been built by Armstrong Whitworth in 1893, and renamed her San Bernardo.
In 1912 Pearson founded the Eagle Oil Transport Company in the UK to take over his ships and carry Mexican Eagle's products[20] and the Anglo-Mexican Petroleum Company in the UK to sell Mexican Eagle's products outside Mexico.[21]
Eagle Oil Transport immediately ordered 20 modern steam tankers[6] at a cost of £3 million.[11] Eagle Oil Transport lost a number of ships to enemy action in the First World War. After the First World War, Eagle Oil Transport renewed and expanded its fleet. It bought numerous new tankers, including six of about 13,000 tons each. When Royal Dutch Shell bought Pearson's oil interests, that included Eagle Oil Transport and Anglo-Saxon Petroleum as well as Mexical Eagle Petroleum.
In about 1930 the Eagle Oil Transport Company was renamed the Eagle Oil and Shipping Company. In about 1935 the company started adding a new generation of motor tankers of about 8,000 tons each.[22]
Eagle Oil and Shipping was registered in the United Kingdom. Therefore, after 1938 although the Mexican government had nationalised Mexican Eagle Petroleum, Eagle Oil and Shipping remained a subsidiary of Royal Dutch Shell. After 1938 the fleet continued to carry oil from the Gulf of Mexico to the UK.[23] During the Second World War the company played an important role in supplying petroleum and petroleum products to the United Kingdom. Oil tankers were a particular target in Germany's economic warfare against the UK. Enemy action sank 17 Eagle Oil's ships and killed at least 206 officers, men and DEMS gunners serving aboard them.




MV San Demetrio reached the Clyde in 1940 with a cargo of aviation spirit despite having been damaged by shellfire from the Admiral Scheer


Among the ships lost was MV San Demetrio (8,073 tons), which was famous for surviving a naval bombardment by the German heavy cruiser Admiral Scheer in 1940 that set the tanker on fire. San Demetrio was repaired and returned to service, but the U-boat U-404 torpedoed and sank her in the western Atlantic off Virginia in 1942 with the loss of 19 lives.
In 1942 the Ministry of War Transport placed a number of Empire ships under Eagle Oil and Shipping's management. One was sunk by enemy action in 1943[24] but after the war the company bought two of the surviving ships from the ministry. The company also bought two T2 tankers that had been built in the USA. The company further renewed its fleet with 16 new ships between 1950 and 1960, and maximum tonnages steadily rose towards the end of the decade. The Royal Dutch Shell parent group absorbed Eagle Oil and Shipping in 1959.

Among the ships lost was MV San Demetrio (8,073 tons), which was famous for surviving a naval bombardment by the German heavy cruiser Admiral Scheer in 1940 that set the tanker on fire. San Demetrio was repaired and returned to service, but the U-boat U-404 torpedoed and sank her in the western Atlantic off Virginia in 1942 with the loss of 19 lives.
In 1942 the Ministry of War Transport placed a number of Empire ships under Eagle Oil and Shipping's management. One was sunk by enemy action in 1943[24] but after the war the company bought two of the surviving ships from the ministry. The company also bought two T2 tankers that had been built in the USA. The company further renewed its fleet with 16 new ships between 1950 and 1960, and maximum tonnages steadily rose towards the end of the decade. The Royal Dutch Shell parent group absorbed Eagle Oil and Shipping in 1959.

History[edit]




Weetman Pearson, Viscount Cowdray


Sir Weetman Pearson, Bart. (Viscount Cowdray from 1910) founded the company in 1909 to develop his investments in the Mexican oil fields.
Pearson's interests in Mexico had begun in 1889 when he won a contract from the government of Porfirio Díaz for his civil engineering company, S. Pearson and Sons Ltd, to build the Gran Canal in Mexico City.[1] This was followed by contracts in 1895 to build a harbour at Veracruz and in 1896 to build the Tehuantepec Railway.[2] Pearson diversified into mining, landholding, transport and electrical utilities around Veracruz.[2] He and the engineer F.S. Pearson (no relation) founded the Mexico Power and Light Company, which provided Mexico City's first public electricity supply.[2] Pearson's businesses and government contracts put him in a favourable position with members of the Díaz dictatorship.[2]
Oil production in Mexico was begun in 1901 by a US oil investor, Henry Clay Pierce.[3] He was quickly followed by a rival, Edward L. Doheny, in the same year.[3] Pearson's land surveys in the vicinities of Pedregal and San Cristóbal for the route of the Tehuantepec Railway had reported oil seepage from the ground, so in April 1901 he ordered his manager in Mexico to secure prospecting options on "...all land for miles around".[4] Pearson built a refinery, pipelines and port facilities to handle the oil in 1905–06, but his company didn't make a major oil strike until 1908.[5] In the same year one of Pearson's oil strikes caught fire and burned out of control for eight weeks, destroying the entire oil field.[5]
In 1909 Pearson founded the Compañía Mexicana de Petróleo El Aguila SA ("Mexican Eagle Oil Company") in Mexico to take over S. Pearson and Sons' oil interests.[6] This followed Pearson's creation of Whitehall Securities Corporation Ltd. in the UK in 1908 to manage all of S. Pearson and Sons' investments outside the oil industry.[7] Pearson's prospecting continued without success until 27 December 1910, when a well on the Gulf of Mexico coast between Veracruz and Tampico struck oil that flowed at a rate of 100,000 barrels per day.[8] This single well turned the fortunes of Pearson's oil business. Within a few years he was one of Mexico's two major oil magnates, the other being Doheny.[8] Other oil companies from the USA and Europe had entered the Mexican oil industry but Doheny and Pearson's companies remained pre-eminent until after the First World War.[8]
In 1911 the Mexican revolution overthrew the Díaz dictatorship that had favoured Pearson, ending the civil engineering contracts for which he had first become involved in Mexico.[9] However, Pearson had exclusive rights to prospect for oil in several Mexican states[10] and by 1914 the company 1,500,000 acres (6,100 km2) of prospecting rights, 175 miles (282 kilometres) of pipeline, two refineries (the second being newly built at Tampico) and storage for seven million barrels of oil.[8]
By June 1913 Mexican Eagle was the largest company in the Pearson group, with net assets valued at £6.8 million.[11] However, in December 1918 Pearson claimed in a letter to the UK Chancellor of the Exchequer, David Lloyd George, that Mexican Eagle was worth £8 million.[11] Mexican Eagle was the largest contributor to the Pearson group's valuation in 1913 of £17 million, which made it the seventh largest business in the UK and among the 30 largest businesses in the World.[12] By 1919 the Pearson group was worth £29.6 million, of which in June of that year Mexican Eagle made up £13.4 million.[12] To what extent this represents a growth in value must be considered against the degree of inflation that took place in the First World War.[13] However, in 1919 the Pearson group's share value was £79.1 million, of which Mexican Eagle made up £62.6 million.[14] This made Mexican Eagle roughly the equal of Burmah Oil and far bigger than the Anglo-Persian Oil Company or Shell Transport and Trading.[15]
Buyout offers and eventual sale[edit]
In 1911 Pearson declined an offer from the Texas Oil Company offered to buy his oil interests.[16] In 1912 and 1913 he declined buyout bids from Royal Dutch Shell.[16] and in 1913 and 1916 he declined bids from Standard Oil of New Jersey.[16] By 1916 Pearson was keen to sell, but the UK Government persuaded him for strategic reasons not to do so.[16] Pearson asked the UK Government to buy 50% of his oil interests, but it responded in 1917 by imposing restrictions that prevented him from transferring ownership as long as the war continued.[16] The Constitution of Mexico adopted in 1917 nationalised oil deposits.[16]
In October 1918, a month before the Armistice, Calouste Gulbenkian started negotiations with Pearson for Royal Dutch Shell to buy Mexican Eagle.[17] On April 2, 1919[17] the Royal Dutch Petroleum Company and the "Shell" Transport and Trading Company jointly bought Mexican Eagle for US$75 million.[18]
Mexican Eagle was the dominant firm in the Mexican petroleum industry until March 18, 1938, when the government of Lázaro Cárdenas nationalized it, along with all other foreign-owned oil interests, to create Petróleos Mexicanos (Pemex).
El Aguila formally dissolved itself on May 24, 1963.[19]
Eagle Oil and Shipping Company[edit]
Main article: Eagle Oil and Shipping Company
Pearson started to acquire steam tankers to carry the oil that he hoped to produce. Armstrong Whitworth on the River Tyne launched SS San Cristobal (2,041 tons) in 1906 and Swan Hunter, also on Tyneside, launched SS San Antonio (5,251 tons) in 1909. Pearson also bought SS James Brand (3,907 tons), which had been built by Armstrong Whitworth in 1893, and renamed her San Bernardo.
In 1912 Pearson founded the Eagle Oil Transport Company in the UK to take over his ships and carry Mexican Eagle's products[20] and the Anglo-Mexican Petroleum Company in the UK to sell Mexican Eagle's products outside Mexico.[21]
Eagle Oil Transport immediately ordered 20 modern steam tankers[6] at a cost of £3 million.[11] Eagle Oil Transport lost a number of ships to enemy action in the First World War. After the First World War, Eagle Oil Transport renewed and expanded its fleet. It bought numerous new tankers, including six of about 13,000 tons each. When Royal Dutch Shell bought Pearson's oil interests, that included Eagle Oil Transport and Anglo-Saxon Petroleum as well as Mexical Eagle Petroleum.
In about 1930 the Eagle Oil Transport Company was renamed the Eagle Oil and Shipping Company. In about 1935 the company started adding a new generation of motor tankers of about 8,000 tons each.[22]
Eagle Oil and Shipping was registered in the United Kingdom. Therefore, after 1938 although the Mexican government had nationalised Mexican Eagle Petroleum, Eagle Oil and Shipping remained a subsidiary of Royal Dutch Shell. After 1938 the fleet continued to carry oil from the Gulf of Mexico to the UK.[23] During the Second World War the company played an important role in supplying petroleum and petroleum products to the United Kingdom. Oil tankers were a particular target in Germany's economic warfare against the UK. Enemy action sank 17 Eagle Oil's ships and killed at least 206 officers, men and DEMS gunners serving aboard them.




MV San Demetrio reached the Clyde in 1940 with a cargo of aviation spirit despite having been damaged by shellfire from the Admiral Scheer


Among the ships lost was MV San Demetrio (8,073 tons), which was famous for surviving a naval bombardment by the German heavy cruiser Admiral Scheer in 1940 that set the tanker on fire. San Demetrio was repaired and returned to service, but the U-boat U-404 torpedoed and sank her in the western Atlantic off Virginia in 1942 with the loss of 19 lives.

One was sunk by enemy action in 1943[24] but after the war the company bought two of the surviving ships from the ministry. The company also bought two T2 tankers that had been built in the USA. The company further renewed its fleet with 16 new ships between 1950 and 1960, and maximum tonnages steadily rose towards the end of the decade. The Royal Dutch Shell parent group absorbed Eagle Oil and Shipping in 1959.

History[edit]




Weetman Pearson, Viscount Cowdray


Sir Weetman Pearson, Bart. (Viscount Cowdray from 1910) founded the company in 1909 to develop his investments in the Mexican oil fields.
Pearson's interests in Mexico had begun in 1889 when he won a contract from the government of Porfirio Díaz for his civil engineering company, S. Pearson and Sons Ltd, to build the Gran Canal in Mexico City.[1] This was followed by contracts in 1895 to build a harbour at Veracruz and in 1896 to build the Tehuantepec Railway.[2] Pearson diversified into mining, landholding, transport and electrical utilities around Veracruz.[2] He and the engineer F.S. Pearson (no relation) founded the Mexico Power and Light Company, which provided Mexico City's first public electricity supply.[2] Pearson's businesses and government contracts put him in a favourable position with members of the Díaz dictatorship.[2]
Oil production in Mexico was begun in 1901 by a US oil investor, Henry Clay Pierce.[3] He was quickly followed by a rival, Edward L. Doheny, in the same year.[3] Pearson's land surveys in the vicinities of Pedregal and San Cristóbal for the route of the Tehuantepec Railway had reported oil seepage from the ground, so in April 1901 he ordered his manager in Mexico to secure prospecting options on "...all land for miles around".[4] Pearson built a refinery, pipelines and port facilities to handle the oil in 1905–06, but his company didn't make a major oil strike until 1908.[5] In the same year one of Pearson's oil strikes caught fire and burned out of control for eight weeks, destroying the entire oil field.[5]
In 1909 Pearson founded the Compañía Mexicana de Petróleo El Aguila SA ("Mexican Eagle Oil Company") in Mexico to take over S. Pearson and Sons' oil interests.[6] This followed Pearson's creation of Whitehall Securities Corporation Ltd. in the UK in 1908 to manage all of S. Pearson and Sons' investments outside the oil industry.[7] Pearson's prospecting continued without success until 27 December 1910, when a well on the Gulf of Mexico coast between Veracruz and Tampico struck oil that flowed at a rate of 100,000 barrels per day.[8] This single well turned the fortunes of Pearson's oil business. Within a few years he was one of Mexico's two major oil magnates, the other being Doheny.[8] Other oil companies from the USA and Europe had entered the Mexican oil industry but Doheny and Pearson's companies remained pre-eminent until after the First World War.[8]
In 1911 the Mexican revolution overthrew the Díaz dictatorship that had favoured Pearson, ending the civil engineering contracts for which he had first become involved in Mexico.[9] However, Pearson had exclusive rights to prospect for oil in several Mexican states[10] and by 1914 the company 1,500,000 acres (6,100 km2) of prospecting rights, 175 miles (282 kilometres) of pipeline, two refineries (the second being newly built at Tampico) and storage for seven million barrels of oil.[8]
By June 1913 Mexican Eagle was the largest company in the Pearson group, with net assets valued at £6.8 million.[11] However, in December 1918 Pearson claimed in a letter to the UK Chancellor of the Exchequer, David Lloyd George, that Mexican Eagle was worth £8 million.[11] Mexican Eagle was the largest contributor to the Pearson group's valuation in 1913 of £17 million, which made it the seventh largest business in the UK and among the 30 largest businesses in the World.[12] By 1919 the Pearson group was worth £29.6 million, of which in June of that year Mexican Eagle made up £13.4 million.[12] To what extent this represents a growth in value must be considered against the degree of inflation that took place in the First World War.[13] However, in 1919 the Pearson group's share value was £79.1 million, of which Mexican Eagle made up £62.6 million.[14] This made Mexican Eagle roughly the equal of Burmah Oil and far bigger than the Anglo-Persian Oil Company or Shell Transport and Trading.[15]
Buyout offers and eventual sale[edit]
In 1911 Pearson declined an offer from the Texas Oil Company offered to buy his oil interests.[16] In 1912 and 1913 he declined buyout bids from Royal Dutch Shell.[16] and in 1913 and 1916 he declined bids from Standard Oil of New Jersey.[16] By 1916 Pearson was keen to sell, but the UK Government persuaded him for strategic reasons not to do so.[16] Pearson asked the UK Government to buy 50% of his oil interests, but it responded in 1917 by imposing restrictions that prevented him from transferring ownership as long as the war continued.[16] The Constitution of Mexico adopted in 1917 nationalised oil deposits.[16]
In October 1918, a month before the Armistice, Calouste Gulbenkian started negotiations with Pearson for Royal Dutch Shell to buy Mexican Eagle.[17] On April 2, 1919[17] the Royal Dutch Petroleum Company and the "Shell" Transport and Trading Company jointly bought Mexican Eagle for US$75 million.[18]
Mexican Eagle was the dominant firm in the Mexican petroleum industry until March 18, 1938, when the government of Lázaro Cárdenas nationalized it, along with all other foreign-owned oil interests, to create Petróleos Mexicanos (Pemex).
El Aguila formally dissolved itself on May 24, 1963.[19]
Eagle Oil and Shipping Company[edit]
Main article: Eagle Oil and Shipping Company
Pearson started to acquire steam tankers to carry the oil that he hoped to produce. Armstrong Whitworth on the River Tyne launched SS San Cristobal (2,041 tons) in 1906 and Swan Hunter, also on Tyneside, launched SS San Antonio (5,251 tons) in 1909. Pearson also bought SS James Brand (3,907 tons), which had been built by Armstrong Whitworth in 1893, and renamed her San Bernardo.
In 1912 Pearson founded the Eagle Oil Transport Company in the UK to take over his ships and carry Mexican Eagle's products[20] and the Anglo-Mexican Petroleum Company in the UK to sell Mexican Eagle's products outside Mexico.[21]
Eagle Oil Transport immediately ordered 20 modern steam tankers[6] at a cost of £3 million.[11] Eagle Oil Transport lost a number of ships to enemy action in the First World War. After the First World War, Eagle Oil Transport renewed and expanded its fleet. It bought numerous new tankers, including six of about 13,000 tons each. When Royal Dutch Shell bought Pearson's oil interests, that included Eagle Oil Transport and Anglo-Saxon Petroleum as well as Mexical Eagle Petroleum.
In about 1930 the Eagle Oil Transport Company was renamed the Eagle Oil and Shipping Company. In about 1935 the company started adding a new generation of motor tankers of about 8,000 tons each.[22]
Eagle Oil and Shipping was registered in the United Kingdom. Therefore, after 1938 although the Mexican government had nationalised Mexican Eagle Petroleum, Eagle Oil and Shipping remained a subsidiary of Royal Dutch Shell. After 1938 the fleet continued to carry oil from the Gulf of Mexico to the UK.[23] During the Second World War the company played an important role in supplying petroleum and petroleum products to the United Kingdom. Oil tankers were a particular target in Germany's economic warfare against the UK. Enemy action sank 17 Eagle Oil's ships and killed at least 206 officers, men and DEMS gunners serving aboard them.




MV San Demetrio reached the Clyde in 1940 with a cargo of aviation spirit despite having been damaged by shellfire from the Admiral Scheer


Among the ships lost was MV San Demetrio (8,073 tons), which was famous for surviving a naval bombardment by the German heavy cruiser Admiral Scheer in 1940 that set the tanker on fire. San Demetrio was repaired and returned to service, but the U-boat U-404 torpedoed and sank her in the western Atlantic off Virginia in 1942 with the loss of 19 lives.
In 1942 the Ministry of War Transport placed a number of Empire ships under Eagle Oil and Shipping's management. One was sunk by enemy action in 1943[24] but after the war the company bought two of the surviving ships from the ministry. The company also bought two T2 tankers that had been built in the USA. The company further renewed its fleet with 16 new ships between 1950 and 1960, and maximum tonnages steadily rose towards the end of the decade. The Royal Dutch Shell parent group absorbed Eagle Oil and Shipping in 1959.

U.S. petroleum product exports to Mexico rise while Mexican crude exports to the U.S. fall



Source: U.S. Energy Information AdministrationNote: The United States does not export crude oil to Mexico.


The United States imported 850,000 barrels per day (bbl/d) of crude oil from Mexico in 2013, the lowest volume since 1993. In the past decade, U.S. crude oil imports from Mexico fell 47%, primarily as a result of declining production of crude oil in Mexico. Despite the decline, Mexico was the third largest source of crude oil imports to the United States in 2013, behind Canada and Saudi Arabia.  
Conversely, U.S. exports of petroleum products to Mexico have increased 152% in the past decade. In 2013, the United States exported 527,000 bbl/d of petroleum products to Mexico, including motor gasoline (46% of the total), distillate fuel oil (22%), and liquefied petroleum gases (10%). 
While the United States is a net exporter of petroleum products to Mexico, the United States also imports some petroleum products from Mexico. In 2013, the United States imported 68,000 bbl/d of products, most of which was residual fuel oil (41%), pentanes plus (24%), and naphtha (15%). As with crude oil, U.S. imports of petroleum products from Mexico have declined in recent years.

The Petroleum Industry of Mexico




 

The 1917 Constitution
After years of civil war the Mexican government created a new constitution in 1917.
Some say, with justification, that this 1917 constitution was the first socialist constitution.
It preceded the constitution of the Soviet Union by a year.  Article 27 of that 1917 constitution 
declared that all subsoil minerals, including petroleum and other hydrocarbons, belonged to 
the nation; i.e., the government.  Supposedly this was  progressive but, in fact, it simply
copied the position of the Spanish monarchs.  The only differences is that the Spanish monarchs 
did not know about petroleum and hydrocarbons.  Since these were not declared minerals the landowners
before 1917 were entitled to harvest them or sell the rights to do so.  The Mexican revolutionaries of 
1917 were only doing what the Spanish monarchy would have done if it still controlled Mexico.
The truth of the matter is that what is labeled socialism is merely a form of
feudalism.  It was very natural, probably inevitable, for the revolutionaries rising to power through military
action to establish a variety of feudalism once in power. The rhetorical benevolence of monarchy
is no less lofty than that of the rhetoric of socialism, and the performance of socialistic 
government no more impressive in serving the interests of the population than that of
monarchic govenment.

The 1917 constitution which declared petroleum and other hydrocarbons to be the property
of the state was not enforced retroactively.  The leases of oil rights to companies, even 
foreign companies, were allowed to stand.  But land owners who had not leased those oil rights
by the time of the constitution no longer had ownership of those rights.  The 1917 
constituition also provided for the recognition of organized labor and the right to strike.
This element proved to be a crucial factor in the way in which the petroleum industry was
expropriated by the Mexican government under Lázaro Cárdenas in 1938.


The Early History of the Petroleum Industry
Humans had been acquainted with petroleum, literally rock oil, from time immemorial.
It was found as a seepage various places in the world.
It had been used as an ointment and salve. The thicker variety and asphalt were used as a 
caulking.  In 1826, a commissioner for a British mining company in Mexico reported that great
quantities of seepage petroleum, called Chapapote, were marketed in Tampico, a town near the Panuco River in southern
Mexico.  It was used as varnish and to cover the bottoms of canoes.  The going price was a half 
dollar per 100 pounds.
Colonel Drake drilled the first commercial oil well in the world in 1859 in western Pennsylvania.
There had been exploitation of natural gas from drilled wells in ancient China but no prior exploitation
of petroleum from drilled wells.  Petroleum did show up as a nuisance in well drilled for
water and there was some utilization of this petroleum as an ungent and as an ingredient in
medical concoctions of dubious value.
The petroleum industry was not launched until a decline in the supply of whale oil for lamps
led to a significance price increase in whale oil price.  The search for substitutes for 
whale oil revealed that a distillate from petroleum, kerosene, provided a satisfactory fuel 
for illumination.  It was then that the drilling of oil wells became commercially feasible.
Eight years after that first oil well in western Pennsylvania, in 1869, someone drilled 
a shallow, 125 foot deep, well in Mexico.  Not enough oil was found to justify commercial 
operation.  But a few years later a small refinery was built in the region to process seepage 
oil.  Later, over the period 1880 to 1883 a Boston drilled several well in the Tuxpám region
but did not find enough oil to justify commercial exploitation.

Before petroleum was discovered in commercial amounts in Mexico, Mexico was dependment upon 
imports of 
petroleum products, particularly kerosene.  The importation, distribution and marketing of 
kerosene 
and other petroleum products was solely in the hands of one American firm, Waters-Pierce Oil Co.
The price of kerosene in Mexico during that time was about 40 U.S. cents per gallon.  This was the
era of the Porfiriato.  In 1889 Porfirio Díaz invited Weetman Pearson of the British
construction company of S. Pearson and Sons, Ltd. to come to Mexico to construct a railroad
across the Isthmus of Tehuantepec. Weetman Dickinson Pearson, was
a son of one the sons of the founder Samuel Pearson.
It is notable that before it was known that Mexico had petroleum fields the government was 
not willing to risk public funds to explore for oil.  There was too much of a risk that there
wasn't any petroleum there.  
The construction crews for the railroad found seepage petroleum and later the firm drilled oil
wells to obtain fuel for the railroad's locomotives.  That driling found oil in commercial 
quantities.  This was in the early 1900's.  Weetman Pearson, later known as Lord Cowdray, 
created the Mexican Eagle Oil Company (Cia Mexicana de Petroleo El Aguila SA) in 1900 which went
on to become the dominant firm in the Mexican petroleum industry until expropriation in 1938.
A major part of the reason for the Mexican Eagle Oil Company's success was the special favors
granted to it by Porfirio Díaz before his downfall in 1910.  In several Mexican states Eagle Oil had the exclusive
right to explore for oil.  The Mexican public benefited from the success of Eagle Oil because the 
price of kerosene fell from $0.40 per gallon to about $0.14 per gallon.


Flag ofCia Mexicana de Petroleo El Aguila SAThe Mexican Eagle Oil Co. drilled in northern part of the state of Veracruz and in the vicinity
of Tuxpám.  In 1908 the Mexican Eagle Oil Co. brought in a gusher at Potrero de Llano. This 
gusher was brought under control and was a very productive oil well.  This was not always
the case with gushers.

In 1904 the Pennsylvania Oil Co. was drilling at the shore of Lake Tamiahua, between Tampico and Tuxpám.
The drilling had reached a depth of 1800 feet and the crew took a break for lunch.  While they
were eating the tremendous pressures below broke through into the drill hole.  The gas and oil
not only blew through the drill hole but created fissures around the drill hole.  The gas and
oil caught fire.  The fire and the fissures led to the collapse of soil around the drill hole
and eventually the oil derrick and all the equipment dropped out of sight into the crater which
was created.  The site became known as Dos Bocas, two mouths, and the cratered area 
eventually covered a 40 acre area.  This gusher turned out to be a far greater loss than a 
dry hole.

When American oil companies heard about the gusher oil wells that had been found in Mexico
they entered to the market by founding subsidiary companies for Mexico.  Here are some of 
the
new oil companies for Mexico:

The Organized Labor Movement in Mexico
The 1917 constitution provided for the right of workers to organize.  The eight-hour workday
is stipulated in that constitution at a minimum wage "sufficient to satisfy the normal necessities
of life."  It also provided for equal pay for equal work without regard to gender, race or 
ethnicity, but it also provided for special protection of working women and minors.  The constitution
also provided for the creation of arbitration boards made up of equal numbers of representatives
from management and labor with one government representative to serve as tie-breaker.  Strikes 
were legal if they were to redress the balance of power between labor and management.
The full provisions of the constitution with regard to labor relations were not implemented 
immediately, but strong unions were organized in the years immediately after 1917.  In particular
the petroleum workers were organized.
The oil workers union did use its power to raise the nominal real wage of workers so much as
it promoted overstaffing and thus the reduction of work effort, effectively raising the real
wage per hour worked. 
The principle of no re-election that came to prevail in the political sphere did not
apply in organized labor and many of the labor union leaders continued in power for decades.
Labor unions became the archetype institution for the corporatist state of Mexico.

The Nationalization of the Mexican Petroleum Industry
Lázaro Cárdenas who was President of Mexico from 1934 to 1940 was an ardent
collectivist.  It is not surprising that the Bolshevik Leon Trotsky chose Cárdenist Mexico as his
place of refuge.  Cárdenas began implementing the provisions of the 1917 constitution. 
He distributed 18 million hectares of land to the communal farming ejidos.  This was
more than all of the redistributions of his predecessors combined.
Cárdenas sanctioned the formation of a stronger national confederation of organized 
labor under the control of a Marxist, Vicente Lombardo Toledano.  This Confederación
de Trabajadores Mexicanos (CTM) is the strongest labor organization in Mexico.  There is an 
umbrella organization Congreso de Trabajo (CT) that presides over the CTM and other
unions but it is the CTM that has the real clout.  The CTM replaces the older, more moderate
national labor union, Confederación Regional Obrera Mexicana (CROM), as the leader 
of the Mexican labor movement.

The Petroleum Workers Union was one of the most powerful in Mexico.  Petroleum workers
received substantially higher pay than Mexican workers in other industries.  A Mexican government
survey in 1936 found the following comparisons:

All Mexican Industries by Occupation, c. 1936

Petroleum7.422671
Electrical Power5.091832
Street Railways4.551638
Mining4.321555
Textiles3.131127


These were the relatively high-paying industries of the time.  The petroleum industries was
high above all others in the direct wage, but employees in the petroleum industry 
 also had substantial fringe benefits that employees in the other industries did not have.
These fringe benefits included: free company housing, free medical benefits for the workers
and their immediate families, and schools for the workers' children.  These fringe benefits had a value roughly equal to fifty percent
of the wage pay.

The Petroleum Workers Union had effectively achieved a closed shop in 1934.  The petroleum 
companies could not hire employees who were not members of the union.  The company could not
fire any employee without paying very substantial severance pay but the union could expel
any member which meant their loss of their job with the company.  This provision meant that
the union officials had more power over employees than did their company employers.  This provision
was put into the petroleum workers' labor contract at the insistance of President Abelardo
Rodriguez, the immediate predecessor of Lázaro Cárdenas.

Cárdenas  reorganized the official political party, giving it the institutional
structure that enabled it to rule Mexico for seventy years.  Under Cárdenas' reorganization
the party had four sectors: 1. Labor, 2. Agrarian, 3. Military, 4. Popular.  Later the military
sector was merged with the popular sector.  Cárdenas renamed the party as the 
Partido de la Revolución Mexicana but in 1946 it was again renamed as the 
Partido Revolucionario Institucional (PRI).  Under Cárdenas' reorganization the 
labor sector of the party was essentially the Congreso de Trabajo, the umbrella organization
of the labor movement.


In 1937-38 the labor unions in most of the foreign petroleum companies went on strike
estensibly 
for higher pay and more training of Mexican workers for the more technical jobs in the
industry. In reality the goal was to take control of the petroleum companies.  The demands
of the union were so excessive that the companies could not grant them and still function.
For more on the union demands. 
 Cádenas intervened demanding compliance with the workers demands.  It is alleged that in the
negotiations with the President some agreement was reached but the petroleum company representatives
insisted that the agreement be put into writing.  This was supposed to have impuned Cárdenas' integrity at
honoring his word.  Piqued Cárdenas executed orders for the expropriation of the 
foreign oil companies' properties.  No compensation was paid at the time of expropriation in 
1938 but later compensation was made at the value the companies had
reported for tax purposes.


There were international protests but the nationalization of the foreign oil interests held. 
The cost to Mexico was not just the compensation paid.  The far greater cost was the loss
of sources of capital for Mexico for about twenty years.  In addition Mexican petroleum production
declined and at times Mexico was a net importer of petroleum.  Furthermore the labor union
of oil workers controlled the staffing of the national petroleum company PEMEX and vastly overstaffed it.
When President Salinas in 1989 forced the laying off of excess workers the number of excess workers
proved to be equal to about 80 percent of the necessary workers. So from nationalization in 
1938 to the reorganization in 1989 a good share of the earnings of the national petroleum 
company went not to the government of Mexico but to the labor union. 

Distribution of Petroleum Production in Mexico
The distribution of production among the various oil fields in the 1940's shows their
relative importance.  In that period it was the Poza Rica which was dominant.

The focus of the above figures is misleading.  It was the Golden Lane (Faja de Ordo)
which was the biggest field.

The Impact of the Nationalization
Although usually the impact of nationalization is depicted in terms of the effect on petroleum production
this is not the crucial problem.  The crucial problem is the effect on the development of 
new producing oil wells.  The table below shows that in the period 1924-1926 the private oil
industry was bringing in about three hundred new producing wells per year.  In was about 
1926 that the Mexican government began talking about controlling the petroleum
industry.  Immediately the exploration began to drop and continued dropping.  The petroleum companies
had alternative development sites in Venezuela, Colombia and the Far East that seemed safer
investments.  By the time the actual nationalization came in 1938 the annual development of new
successful oil wells was a small fraction of what it had been in the mid-1920's.  Not all of 
the private petroleum companies were nationalized in 1938.  Only the ones which were involved
in labor disputes in 1937.
The national petroleum company, PEMEX, was not notably successful in developing new wells.
The problem was not that it had a lower success rate than the private companies, the problem
was that it just did not drill many wells.  Bureaucrats with their careers on the line have
a problem with risk-taking.  No bureaucrat wants to have to explain the loss of public funds 
in a dry hole.  
After World War II the development of new wells increased from the negligible levels of the
early 1940's but still the number of new producing oil wells developed in the decade after 
nationalization was less than the number brought-in in 1926.  Although production from the
wells expropriated in 1938 was maintained after a few years of declined production the nationalization
during that first decade was a financial failure.  Costs rose because of over-staffing promoted
by the oil workers union.  PEMEX had a difficult time meeting minimal financial obligations
to the Mexican government.

The development of new oil wells improved in 1949 when PEMEX began contracting
with foreign petroleum companies to drill under contract.  The payment for the
drilling was a share of the oil found.  Thus the risk of drilling was shifted
to the drilling companies.
