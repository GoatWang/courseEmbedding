Participation and Protection: With No Annual Fees




When planning for retirement, you can’t risk everything and you can’t protect everything.
But there is a way to have some of both.










A Shield Annuity from Brighthouse Financial can help you use a portion of your assets to take advantage of market
            growth with a level of downside protection that other options may not provide. Shield is designed to provide
            some protection in an unpredictable endeavor — investing.





Protect your retirement assets
A Brighthouse Shield Annuity is designed to provide a level of protection that, when markets inevitably turn volatile,
            ensures your losses are limited.



Participate in growth opportunities
With a Shield Annuity, balance is built-in. This means that even with the protection you enjoy, you can still take
            advantage of growth opportunities in the market up to a certain percentage.



Pay no annual fees
Unlike many financial products, you pay no annual fees with a Shield Annuity.

                                            Your Retirement Big Picture: Where Do Annuities Fit?

1 Guarantees are subject to the financial strength and claims-paying ability of the issuing insurance company.
2 Shield annuities do not invest directly in any index.
3 Product guarantees are subject to the financial strength and claims-paying ability of the issuing insurance company and are solely the responsibility of the issuing insurance company. Annuities and life insurance are issued by Brighthouse Life Insurance Company, Charlotte, NC 28277 and in New York, only by Brighthouse Life Insurance Company of NY, New York, NY 10017 and not by MetLife.
If you're buying an annuity to fund a qualified retirement plan or IRA, you should do so for the annuity's features and benefits other than tax deferral. That's because tax deferral is not an additional benefit of the annuity. References throughout this material to tax advantage, such as tax deferral and tax-free transfers, are subject to this consideration. In addition, non-qualified annuity contracts owned by corporations do not receive tax deferral on earnings. 

Prospectuses for variable annuities issued by a Brighthouse Financial insurance company, and for the investment portfolios offered thereunder, are available from Brighthouse Financial. The contract prospectus contains information about the contract's features, risks, charges and expenses. The investment objectives, risks and policies of the investment options, as well as other information about the investment options, are described in their respective prospectuses. Please read the prospectuses and consider this information carefully before investing. There is no guarantee that any of the variable investment options in a variable annuity product will meet their stated goals or objectives. The account value is subject to market fluctuations and investment risk so that, when withdrawn, it may be worth more or less than its original value even when an optional protection benefit rider is elected. Product availability and features may vary by state. Please refer to the contract prospectus for more complete details regarding the living and death benefits.

Annuities are long-term investments designed for retirement purposes. Brighthouse Financial annuities have limitations, exclusions, charges, termination provisions and terms for keeping them in force. All contract guarantees, including optional living and death benefit riders and annuity payout rates, are backed by the claims-paying ability and financial strength of issuing insurance company. They are not backed by the broker/dealer from which an annuity is purchased, by the insurance agency where an annuity is purchased, or any affiliates to those entities, and none makes any representations or guarantees regarding the claims-paying ability and financial strength of the issuing insurance company. Similarity, the issuing insurance company and the underwriter do not back the financial strength of the broker/dealer or its affiliates. Please contact your financial professional for complete details. 

Withdrawals of taxable amounts are subject to ordinary income tax and if made before age 59½, may be subject to a 10% federal income tax penalty. Some broker/dealers and financial professionals may refer to the 10% federal income tax penalty as an "additional tax" or "additional income tax" or use the terms interchangeably when discussing withdrawals taken prior to age 59½. Distributions of taxable amounts from a non-qualified annuity may also be subject to the 3.8% Unearned Income Medicare Contribution Tax on Net Investment Income if your modified adjusted gross income exceeds the applicable threshold amount. Withdrawals will reduce the living and death benefits and account value. Withdrawals may be subject to withdrawal charges. 

Any discussion of taxes is for general informational purposes only, does not purport to be complete or cover every situation, and should not be construed as legal, tax, or accounting advice. You should confer with your qualified legal, tax, and accounting advisors as appropriate.

Brighthouse Financial, an operating segment of MetLife, Inc. (NYSE: MET), announced on March 6, 2017 that it is now offering its suite of life insurance and annuity products under the Brighthouse Financial brand. 
*Data as of March 31, 2017. Total assets includes certain adjustments for transactions associated with the separation from MetLife, Inc.

Ratings as of May 2017. Operating entities collectively rated include Brighthouse Life Insurance Company (BLIC), NELICO, and Brighthouse Life Insurance Company of NY (BLNY); note, Moody’s and Fitch do not rate BLNY.
A.M. Best’s Financial Strength Rating is an independent opinion of an insurer’s financial strength and ability to meet its ongoing insurance policy and contract obligations. A Financial Strength Rating is not assigned to specific insurance policies or contracts and does not address any other risk, including, but not limited to, an insurer’s claims-payment policies or procedures; the ability of the insurer to dispute or deny claims payment on grounds of misrepresentation or fraud; or any specific liability contractually borne by the policy or contract holder. A Financial Strength Rating is not a recommendation to purchase, hold, or terminate any insurance policy, contract or any other financial obligation issued by an insurer, nor does it address the suitability of any particular policy or contract, for a specific purpose or purchaser. Ratings explanations can be found at www.ambest.com.
Fitch’s Insurer Financial Strength Rating provides an assessment of the financial strength of an insurance organization. The Insurer Financial Strength Rating is assigned to the insurance company’s policyholder obligations, including assumed reinsurance obligations and contract holder obligations, such as guaranteed investment contracts. Ratings explanations can be found at www.fitchratings.com.
Moody’s Insurance Financial Strength Rating is an opinion of the ability of an insurance company to pay punctually senior policyholder claims and obligations and also reflect the expected financial loss suffered in the event of default. Specific obligations are considered unrated unless they are individually rated because the standing of a particular insurance obligation would depend on an assessment of its relative standing under those laws governing both the obligation and the insurance company. Ratings explanations can be found at www.moodys.com.
S&P Global Insurer Financial Strength Rating is a forward-looking opinion about the financial security characteristics of an insurance organization with respect to its ability to pay under its insurance policies and contracts in accordance with their terms. This opinion is not specific to any particular policy or contract, nor does it address the suitability of a particular policy or contract for a specific purpose or purchaser. Ratings explanations can be found at www.standardandpoors.com.

Answer a few questions to get started


















Before investing, consider the investment objectives, risks, charges, and expenses of the annuity and its investment options. Contact Fidelity for a prospectus or, if available, a summary prospectus containing this information. Read it carefully.



          1.
	
	
	       
					
Investing in a variable annuity involves risk of loss - investment returns and contract value are not guaranteed and will fluctuate.



          2.
	
	
	       
					If you are buying a variable annuity to fund a qualified retirement plan or IRA, you should do so for the variable annuity's features and benefits other than tax deferral. In such cases, tax deferral is not an additional benefit.


          3.
	
	
	       
					
Guarantees apply to certain insurance and annuity products and are subject to product terms, exclusions and limitations and the insurer's claims paying ability and financial strength.

			Annuities can be used to help you increase your savings, protect what you've saved, or generate a stream of income.

Have Us Call You








Annuities generally fall into two categories: deferred and income. Each works differently and offers unique advantages.
 Tax-deferred annuities: for retirement savings 
Deferred annuities can be a good way to boost your retirement savings once you've made the maximum allowable contributions to your 401(k) or IRA.1 Like any tax-deferred investment, earnings compound over time, providing growth opportunities that taxable accounts lack.
Deferred annuities have no IRS contribution limits,2 so you can invest as much as you want for retirement. You can also use your savings to create a guaranteed3 stream of income for retirement. Depending on how annuities are funded, they may not have minimum required distributions (MRDs).
Bear in mind that withdrawals of taxable amounts from an annuity are subject to ordinary income tax, and, if taken before age 59½, may be subject to a 10% IRS penalty. Annuities also come with annual charges not found in mutual funds, which will affect your returns.
Deferred variable annuities have funds that may have the potential for investment growth. However, this can involve some market risk and could result in losses if the value of the underlying investments falls. Variable annuities are usually appropriate for those with longer time horizons or those who are better able to handle market fluctuations. Some variable annuities allow you to protect your investment against loss, while still participating in potential market growth.
Deferred fixed annuities offer a guaranteed3 rate of return for a number of years. Fixed deferred annuities may be more suitable for conservative investors or for those interested in protecting assets from market volatility. In this way, they’re similar to certificates of deposit (CDs).
However, deferred fixed annuities differ from CDs in that:

Annuities are not FDIC-insured.
Withdrawals from annuities prior to age 59½ may be subject to a 10% IRS penalty.
Deferred fixed annuities may offer more access to assets than a CD.
Annuity earnings compound on a tax-deferred basis.

 Income annuities: for income in retirement 
Income annuities may be appropriate for investors in or near retirement because they offer guaranteed3 income for life or a set period of time. They may allow you to be more aggressive with other investments in your portfolio, since they provide a lifetime income stream.
Keep in mind that you may have limited or no access to the assets used to purchase income annuities.
Immediate fixed income annuities offer a guaranteed,3 predictable payment for life, or for a certain period of time. Your guaranteed income payment cannot be affected by market volatility, helping shield your retirement income from market risk.
A cost-of-living increase is available at an additional cost to help your buying power keep pace with inflation.
Deferred income annuities4 are fixed income annuities that have a deferral period before income payments start. Because of the deferral period, you may get a higher income payment amount than you would from a comparable immediate fixed income annuity with the same initial investment. The cost-of-living increase is also available at an additional cost for deferred income annuities.

          1. Each individual's situation is unique and therefore seeking additional guidance from a tax advisor is suggested. Although variable annuities offer tax-deferral, if you are considering one to fund a qualified retirement plan or IRA, you should do so for the variable annuity's features and benefits other than tax deferral. In such cases, tax deferral is not an additional benefit of the variable annuity. References throughout this material to tax advantages, such as tax deferral and tax-free transfers, are subject to this consideration.
	
    

          2. Insurance companies reserve the right to limit contributions.
	
    

          3. Guarantees apply to certain insurance and annuity products and are subject to product terms, exclusions and limitations and the insurer's claims-paying ability and financial strength.


          4. Deferred Income Annuity contracts are irrevocable, have no cash surrender value and no withdrawals are permitted prior to the income start date.


Investing in a variable annuity involves risk of loss—investment returns and contract value are not guaranteed and will fluctuate.


Fidelity insurance products are issued by Fidelity Investments Life Insurance Company (FILI), 100 Salem Street, Smithfield, RI 02917, and in New York, by Empire Fidelity Investments Life Insurance Company,® New York, N.Y. FILI is licensed in all states except New York. Other insurance products available at Fidelity are issued by third party insurance companies, which are not affiliated with any Fidelity Investments company. A contract's financial guarantees are subject to the claims-paying ability of the issuing insurance company.


Before investing, consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the annuity and its investment options. Call or write to Fidelity or visit Fidelity.com for a free prospectus and, if available, summary prospectus containing this information. Please read the prospectus and consider this information carefully before investing. Product availability and features may vary by state. Please refer to the contract prospectus for more complete details regarding the living and death benefits.

Answer a few questions to get started



















Before investing, consider the investment objectives, risks, charges, and expenses of the annuity and its investment options. Contact Fidelity for a prospectus or, if available, a summary prospectus containing this information. Read it carefully.



          1.

Fidelity Personal Retirement Annuity (Policy Form No. DVA-2005, et al.) is issued by Fidelity Investments Life Insurance Company (FILI), and, for New York residents, Personal Retirement Annuity (Policy Form No. EDVA-2005, et al.) is issued by Empire Fidelity Investments Life Insurance Company®, New York, N.Y. FILI is licensed in all states except New York. Fidelity Brokerage Services, Member NYSE, SIPC, and Fidelity Insurance Agency, Inc., are the distributors.
	
    

          3. This is a deferred variable annuity; investment returns and contract value are not guaranteed and will actuate depending on market performance.
	
    

          4. Clients are eligible for an annual fee of 0.10% if (1) the contract is purchased with an initial purchase payment of $1,000,000 or more on or after September 7, 2010, or (2) the contract value has accumulated to $1,000,000 or more on or after September 7, 2010, and at that time we are offering the contract to new applicants for 0.10%. See prospectus for additional details.
	
    

          5. Certain funds transferred or withdrawn in less than 60 days of purchase will be assessed a 1% fee, which is retained by the funds. See individual fund prospectus for additional details.
	
    

          6. Some deferred fixed annuities have a market value adjustment (MVA), which generally applies if a client surrenders the contract or withdraws funds in excess of the free withdrawal amount before the end of the guarantee period. The amount the client receives will be adjusted based on interest rate conditions at that time.
	
    

          7.
	
	
	       Deferred Income Annuity contracts are irrevocable, have no cash surrender value and no withdrawals are permitted prior to the income start date.


          8. Restrictions may apply. Please refer to product materials for additional details.
	
    

          9. Minimum subsequent premium amounts and limitations to when they are allowed prior to income start date may apply.
	
    

          10. Restrictions may apply depending on payment option and/or contract type selected. The new income amount will be determined by the issuing insurance company. Please refer to the product materials for additional details.

	This supplement describes a change regarding the variable annuity contracts listed above issued by
	Merrill Lynch Life Insurance Company and ML Life Insurance Company of New York. Please retain this
	supplement with your Prospectus for future reference.


	On or about June 1, 2010 (merger date), the Van Kampen Life Investment Trust Comstock Portfolio
	of the Van Kampen Life Investment Trust will merge into an empty shell fund of the AIM Variable
	Insurance Funds (Invesco Variable Insurance Funds) trust and be renamed Invesco Van Kampen V.I.
	Comstock Fund. This merger will not involve any change in the funds management, investment
	objective or policies because the surviving fund is an empty shell fund.


	Because of this merger, the Van Kampen Life Investment Trust Comstock Portfolio subaccount (the
	Subaccount) will be renamed Invesco Van Kampen V.I. Comstock Fund.


	No action is necessary on your part if you want to remain invested in the Subaccount. If you do
	not wish to remain allocated to the Subaccount, you may generally transfer your policy value
	allocated in this Subaccount to any other subaccount listed in your Prospectus. However, please
	note that there may be negative consequences and you may lose certain benefits if your transfer or
	updated investment allocation violates any allocation guidelines and restrictions applicable to
	allocation instructions for premium payments or other purposes (for example, dollar cost averaging
	or guaranteed withdrawal benefits).


	If you reallocate your policy value to another subaccount from the Invesco Van Kampen V.I. Comstock
	Fund, you will not be charged for the transfer from that Subaccount to another available subaccount
	if made within 30 days of the merger date. This reallocation also will not count as a transfer for
	purposes of any free transfers that you receive each contract year.

The preceding Fee Table and Examples help you understand the costs and
expenses you will bear, directly or indirectly. The Fee Table and Examples      
include expenses and charges of the Separate Account as well as the Funds. The  
Examples assume that current waivers and reimbursements of Fund expenses will   
remain in effect for the periods shown. These waivers and reimbursements,       
however, may be terminated at any time, unless otherwise stated. The Examples   
also reflect the $40 contract maintenance charge as 0.0279% of average assets.  

  THE EXAMPLES SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED A REPRESENTATION OF PAST OR FUTURE
EXPENSES OR ANNUAL RATES OF RETURN OF ANY FUND. ACTUAL EXPENSES AND ANNUAL RATES
OF RETURN MAY BE MORE OR LESS THAN THOSE ASSUMED FOR THE PURPOSE OF THE         
EXAMPLES.

(a) Expenses for these Funds are estimated.                           

 (b) Roszel Advisors, LLC and MLIG Variable Insurance Trust have entered
         into an expense limitation agreement whereby Roszel Advisors has agreed
to reimburse each Fund to the extent total operating expenses 
         (excluding interest, taxes, brokerage commissions, expenses in the form
       of fees paid to Trust service providers by brokers in connection with
directed brokerage arrangements, other expenditures that are  
capitalized in accordance with generally accepted accounting  
  principles, and other extraordinary expenses not incurred in the
       ordinary course of each Fund's business) exceed the following limits:
 1.15% for Roszel/Lord Abbett Mid Cap Value Portfolio; 1.15% for
        Roszel/Seligman Mid Cap Growth Portfolio; 1.15% for Roszel/PIMCO Small
      Cap Value Portfolio; and 1.25% for Roszel/JP Morgan Small Cap Growth
         Portfolio. Any such reimbursement is subject to potential recoupment by
Roszel Advisors within three years.                           

(c) Pacific Investment Management Company LLC ("PIMCO") has agreed to 
      reduce total annual operating expenses to the extent that they would
 exceed 0.65% of average daily net assets, due to organizational
     expenses and the payment by the Fund of its pro rata portion of the
       PIMCO Trust's Trustees' fees. Any such waiver is subject to potential
   future reimbursement within three years from the date the fee was
waived.

policies of these Funds are described below.                                    

Roszel/Lord Abbett Mid Cap Value Portfolio seeks long-term capital    
appreciation. The Fund pursues its investment objective by investing primarily  
in mid capitalization equity securities (generally, those with capitalizations  
between $500 million and $10 billion) that the adviser believes are undervalued 
by the market. The adviser emphasizes qualitative analysis of companies and     
seeks to identify those whose securities have the potential for significant     
market appreciation due to growing recognition or anticipation of improvement in
their financial results. The subadviser for the Fund is Lord, Abbett & Co.      

Roszel/Seligman Mid Cap Growth Portfolio seeks long-term capital      
appreciation. The Fund pursues its investment objective by investing primarily  
in mid capitalization equity securities of companies that the adviser believes  
have a potential for high earnings growth rates. The adviser's approach is to   
screen companies using both quantitative and qualitative analysis. The adviser  
first screens companies for past growth in sales and earnings, as well as a     
strong balance sheet. The Fund may, from time to time, invest in a variety of   
income-bearing securities. The subadviser for the Fund is J. & W. Seligman & Co.
Incorporated.

Roszel/PIMCO Small Cap Value Portfolio seeks long-term capital        
appreciation. The Fund pursues its investment objective by investing primarily  
in small capitalization equity securities that the adviser believes are         
undervalued by the market. The adviser screens small capitalization stocks to   
identify around 500 that it believes are undervalued. The screening is done     
using traditional quantitative factors evaluated both on a relative basis       
(compared to securities of issuers in the same industry) and on an "absolute"   
basis (compared to the overall market). The adviser then narrows its field using
further quantitative analysis of factors such as price momentum (i.e., changes  
in stock price relative to changes in overall market prices) and earnings       
momentum (i.e., changes in analyst's earnings-per-share estimates) relative to  
dividend yields and liquidity and selects from among them, those that pay       
dividends. The adviser generally tries to maintain about 100 stocks in equal    
amounts in the Fund without having more than 10% of total assets in securities  
of issuers in a single industry. The subadvisers for the Fund are PIMCO Advisory
Services Holdings LLC and NFJ Investment Group L.P.                             

Roszel/JP Morgan Small Cap Growth Portfolio seeks long-term capital   
appreciation. The Fund pursues its investment objective by investing primarily  
in small capitalization equity securities that the adviser believes have a      
potential for high earnings growth rates. The Fund generally holds securities   
with market capitalizations within the capitalization range of its performance  
benchmark, the S&P 600 Barra Growth Index. The adviser focuses on small         
capitalization securities of issuers with strong earnings prospects that are    
increasing their market share. The adviser emphasizes companies with            
accelerating revenue growth, sustainable earnings trends, a strong management   
team and attractive profitability characteristics. Qualitative factors that the 
adviser looks for include dominant market share, proprietary technology, new    
product cycle, barriers to entry and modest financial leverage. The Fund is more
broadly diversified than many of its peers and maintains investments in all     
sectors of its performance benchmark. The subadviser for the Fund is J.P. Morgan
Fleming Asset Management (USA) Inc.

Participation and Protection: With No Annual Fees




When planning for retirement, you can’t risk everything and you can’t protect everything.
But there is a way to have some of both.










A Shield Annuity from Brighthouse Financial can help you use a portion of your assets to take advantage of market
            growth with a level of downside protection that other options may not provide. Shield is designed to provide
            some protection in an unpredictable endeavor — investing.





Protect your retirement assets
A Brighthouse Shield Annuity is designed to provide a level of protection that, when markets inevitably turn volatile,
            ensures your losses are limited.



Participate in growth opportunities
With a Shield Annuity, balance is built-in. This means that even with the protection you enjoy, you can still take
            advantage of growth opportunities in the market up to a certain percentage.



Pay no annual fees
Unlike many financial products, you pay no annual fees with a Shield Annuity.

1 Guarantees are subject to the financial strength and claims-paying ability of the issuing insurance company.
2 Shield annuities do not invest directly in any index.
3 Product guarantees are subject to the financial strength and claims-paying ability of the issuing insurance company and are solely the responsibility of the issuing insurance company. Annuities and life insurance are issued by Brighthouse Life Insurance Company, Charlotte, NC 28277 and in New York, only by Brighthouse Life Insurance Company of NY, New York, NY 10017 and not by MetLife.
If you're buying an annuity to fund a qualified retirement plan or IRA, you should do so for the annuity's features and benefits other than tax deferral. That's because tax deferral is not an additional benefit of the annuity. References throughout this material to tax advantage, such as tax deferral and tax-free transfers, are subject to this consideration. In addition, non-qualified annuity contracts owned by corporations do not receive tax deferral on earnings. 

Prospectuses for variable annuities issued by a Brighthouse Financial insurance company, and for the investment portfolios offered thereunder, are available from Brighthouse Financial. The contract prospectus contains information about the contract's features, risks, charges and expenses. The investment objectives, risks and policies of the investment options, as well as other information about the investment options, are described in their respective prospectuses. Please read the prospectuses and consider this information carefully before investing. There is no guarantee that any of the variable investment options in a variable annuity product will meet their stated goals or objectives. The account value is subject to market fluctuations and investment risk so that, when withdrawn, it may be worth more or less than its original value even when an optional protection benefit rider is elected. Product availability and features may vary by state. Please refer to the contract prospectus for more complete details regarding the living and death benefits.

Annuities are long-term investments designed for retirement purposes. Brighthouse Financial annuities have limitations, exclusions, charges, termination provisions and terms for keeping them in force. All contract guarantees, including optional living and death benefit riders and annuity payout rates, are backed by the claims-paying ability and financial strength of issuing insurance company. They are not backed by the broker/dealer from which an annuity is purchased, by the insurance agency where an annuity is purchased, or any affiliates to those entities, and none makes any representations or guarantees regarding the claims-paying ability and financial strength of the issuing insurance company. Similarity, the issuing insurance company and the underwriter do not back the financial strength of the broker/dealer or its affiliates. Please contact your financial professional for complete details. 

Withdrawals of taxable amounts are subject to ordinary income tax and if made before age 59½, may be subject to a 10% federal income tax penalty. Some broker/dealers and financial professionals may refer to the 10% federal income tax penalty as an "additional tax" or "additional income tax" or use the terms interchangeably when discussing withdrawals taken prior to age 59½. Distributions of taxable amounts from a non-qualified annuity may also be subject to the 3.8% Unearned Income Medicare Contribution Tax on Net Investment Income if your modified adjusted gross income exceeds the applicable threshold amount. Withdrawals will reduce the living and death benefits and account value. Withdrawals may be subject to withdrawal charges. 

Any discussion of taxes is for general informational purposes only, does not purport to be complete or cover every situation, and should not be construed as legal, tax, or accounting advice. You should confer with your qualified legal, tax, and accounting advisors as appropriate.

Brighthouse Financial, an operating segment of MetLife, Inc. (NYSE: MET), announced on March 6, 2017 that it is now offering its suite of life insurance and annuity products under the Brighthouse Financial brand. 
*Data as of March 31, 2017. Total assets includes certain adjustments for transactions associated with the separation from MetLife, Inc.

Ratings as of May 2017. Operating entities collectively rated include Brighthouse Life Insurance Company (BLIC), NELICO, and Brighthouse Life Insurance Company of NY (BLNY); note, Moody’s and Fitch do not rate BLNY.
A.M. Best’s Financial Strength Rating is an independent opinion of an insurer’s financial strength and ability to meet its ongoing insurance policy and contract obligations. A Financial Strength Rating is not assigned to specific insurance policies or contracts and does not address any other risk, including, but not limited to, an insurer’s claims-payment policies or procedures; the ability of the insurer to dispute or deny claims payment on grounds of misrepresentation or fraud; or any specific liability contractually borne by the policy or contract holder. A Financial Strength Rating is not a recommendation to purchase, hold, or terminate any insurance policy, contract or any other financial obligation issued by an insurer, nor does it address the suitability of any particular policy or contract, for a specific purpose or purchaser. Ratings explanations can be found at www.ambest.com.
Fitch’s Insurer Financial Strength Rating provides an assessment of the financial strength of an insurance organization. The Insurer Financial Strength Rating is assigned to the insurance company’s policyholder obligations, including assumed reinsurance obligations and contract holder obligations, such as guaranteed investment contracts. Ratings explanations can be found at www.fitchratings.com.
Moody’s Insurance Financial Strength Rating is an opinion of the ability of an insurance company to pay punctually senior policyholder claims and obligations and also reflect the expected financial loss suffered in the event of default. Specific obligations are considered unrated unless they are individually rated because the standing of a particular insurance obligation would depend on an assessment of its relative standing under those laws governing both the obligation and the insurance company. Ratings explanations can be found at www.moodys.com.
S&P Global Insurer Financial Strength Rating is a forward-looking opinion about the financial security characteristics of an insurance organization with respect to its ability to pay under its insurance policies and contracts in accordance with their terms. This opinion is not specific to any particular policy or contract, nor does it address the suitability of a particular policy or contract for a specific purpose or purchaser. Ratings explanations can be found at www.standardandpoors.com.

Answer a few questions to get started


















Before investing, consider the investment objectives, risks, charges, and expenses of the annuity and its investment options. Contact Fidelity for a prospectus or, if available, a summary prospectus containing this information. Read it carefully.



          1.
	
	
	       
					
Investing in a variable annuity involves risk of loss - investment returns and contract value are not guaranteed and will fluctuate.



          2.
	
	
	       
					If you are buying a variable annuity to fund a qualified retirement plan or IRA, you should do so for the variable annuity's features and benefits other than tax deferral. In such cases, tax deferral is not an additional benefit.


          3.
	
	
	       
					
Guarantees apply to certain insurance and annuity products and are subject to product terms, exclusions and limitations and the insurer's claims paying ability and financial strength.




Fidelity insurance products are issued by Fidelity Investments Life Insurance Company (FILI), 100 Salem Street, Smithfield, RI 02917, and, in New York, by Empire Fidelity Investments Life Insurance Company®, New York, N.Y. FILI is licensed in all states except New York. Other insurance products available at Fidelity are issued by third-party insurance companies, which are not affiliated with any Fidelity Investments company. A contract's financial guarantees are subject to the claims-paying ability of the issuing insurance company.



          Annuities at Fidelity are distributed by Fidelity Insurance Agency, Inc. and, for certain products, Fidelity Brokerage Services, Member NYSE, SIPC.


          Fidelity Income Strategy Evaluator is an educational tool.

			Annuities can be used to help you increase your savings, protect what you've saved, or generate a stream of income.

Have Us Call You








Annuities generally fall into two categories: deferred and income. Each works differently and offers unique advantages.
 Tax-deferred annuities: for retirement savings 
Deferred annuities can be a good way to boost your retirement savings once you've made the maximum allowable contributions to your 401(k) or IRA.1 Like any tax-deferred investment, earnings compound over time, providing growth opportunities that taxable accounts lack.
Deferred annuities have no IRS contribution limits,2 so you can invest as much as you want for retirement. You can also use your savings to create a guaranteed3 stream of income for retirement. Depending on how annuities are funded, they may not have minimum required distributions (MRDs).
Bear in mind that withdrawals of taxable amounts from an annuity are subject to ordinary income tax, and, if taken before age 59½, may be subject to a 10% IRS penalty. Annuities also come with annual charges not found in mutual funds, which will affect your returns.
Deferred variable annuities have funds that may have the potential for investment growth. However, this can involve some market risk and could result in losses if the value of the underlying investments falls. Variable annuities are usually appropriate for those with longer time horizons or those who are better able to handle market fluctuations. Some variable annuities allow you to protect your investment against loss, while still participating in potential market growth.
Deferred fixed annuities offer a guaranteed3 rate of return for a number of years. Fixed deferred annuities may be more suitable for conservative investors or for those interested in protecting assets from market volatility. In this way, they’re similar to certificates of deposit (CDs).
However, deferred fixed annuities differ from CDs in that:

Annuities are not FDIC-insured.
Withdrawals from annuities prior to age 59½ may be subject to a 10% IRS penalty.
Deferred fixed annuities may offer more access to assets than a CD.
Annuity earnings compound on a tax-deferred basis.

 Income annuities: for income in retirement 
Income annuities may be appropriate for investors in or near retirement because they offer guaranteed3 income for life or a set period of time. They may allow you to be more aggressive with other investments in your portfolio, since they provide a lifetime income stream.
Keep in mind that you may have limited or no access to the assets used to purchase income annuities.
Immediate fixed income annuities offer a guaranteed,3 predictable payment for life, or for a certain period of time. Your guaranteed income payment cannot be affected by market volatility, helping shield your retirement income from market risk.
A cost-of-living increase is available at an additional cost to help your buying power keep pace with inflation.
Deferred income annuities4 are fixed income annuities that have a deferral period before income payments start. Because of the deferral period, you may get a higher income payment amount than you would from a comparable immediate fixed income annuity with the same initial investment. The cost-of-living increase is also available at an additional cost for deferred income annuities.

          1. Each individual's situation is unique and therefore seeking additional guidance from a tax advisor is suggested. Although variable annuities offer tax-deferral, if you are considering one to fund a qualified retirement plan or IRA, you should do so for the variable annuity's features and benefits other than tax deferral. In such cases, tax deferral is not an additional benefit of the variable annuity. References throughout this material to tax advantages, such as tax deferral and tax-free transfers, are subject to this consideration.
	
    

          2. Insurance companies reserve the right to limit contributions.
	
    

          3. Guarantees apply to certain insurance and annuity products and are subject to product terms, exclusions and limitations and the insurer's claims-paying ability and financial strength.


          4. Deferred Income Annuity contracts are irrevocable, have no cash surrender value and no withdrawals are permitted prior to the income start date.


Investing in a variable annuity involves risk of loss—investment returns and contract value are not guaranteed and will fluctuate.


Fidelity insurance products are issued by Fidelity Investments Life Insurance Company (FILI), 100 Salem Street, Smithfield, RI 02917, and in New York, by Empire Fidelity Investments Life Insurance Company,® New York, N.Y. FILI is licensed in all states except New York. Other insurance products available at Fidelity are issued by third party insurance companies, which are not affiliated with any Fidelity Investments company. A contract's financial guarantees are subject to the claims-paying ability of the issuing insurance company.


Before investing, consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the annuity and its investment options. Call or write to Fidelity or visit Fidelity.com for a free prospectus and, if available, summary prospectus containing this information. Please read the prospectus and consider this information carefully before investing. Product availability and features may vary by state. Please refer to the contract prospectus for more complete details regarding the living and death benefits.

More Information about Annuities





What exactly is an Annuity?

                        An annuity is an investment product that provides safe, tax-deferred growth of your
                        retirement nest egg. Annuities are considered low-risk, and can provide guaranteed, monthly
                        income when
                        you retire. There are many types of annuities with varying features & benefits. These include:
                        fixed,
                        variable, immediate, deferred & hybrid. We strongly suggest you consult with a financial
                        professional to
                        help you understand the various types of annuities before you purchase.
                    








Is an Annuity Right for You?

                        Annuities are NOT a good fit for everyone. Annuities are designed for people looking for
                        guaranteed, monthly income when they retire - they are NOT a high-risk / high-return investment.
                        They are considered to be in the mainstream of conservative retirement planning - over $225
                        billion in annuities have been purchased in the past 12 months alone!
                    








What are your Next Steps?

                        The first thing to do is to see if an annuity fits your specific profile and financial
                        situation. This "fit" is based on the amount of retirement savings you currently have, how old
                        you are, and the State you live in. Simply fill in the information above and our system will
                        generate a free, tailor-made Annuity Report that will include annuity rate quotes from A+ rated
                        companies in your area.

IN THIS REPORT:

Understanding the 3 types of annuities peddled by insurance salesmen
The 4 income traps (“retirement death traps”) hidden in the fine print
A little-known way to collect 14 payouts a year with the “Super 7 Annuity”


Hi, I’m Dr. Mark Skousen.
A word of caution: If you’re thinking of investing in an insurance annuity for its “guaranteed income”…
I urge you to think twice.
You see, annuities are often sold as one thing, but in reality turn out to be quite another thing altogether.
And you could end up making substantially less money than you counted on.
In my new report, I share the truth about annuities… the straight facts you’ll never hear from your annuity salesman.
So here’s what I suggest: Access your free copy of Annuity “Death Traps” by telling us where to send it in the box above or below.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!

About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
