MCP Launches Pan Asia Fund with $66M
Oct 2 2014  |  7:59am ET

Hong Kong's MCP Asset Management has launched its Terra Grove Pan Asia Fund with $62.5 million.
The Caymans-based fund is managed by Masakatsu Hayashi and a team of three who were lured from Millennium Management's Singapore team in 2012. According to regulatory filings, the first date of sale was August 25, 2014, the total offering is $500 million and the minimum investment is $1 million. 
It is one of two funds run by the team, the other, the Terra Grove Japan fund, launched in May 2012 with $66 million of an offered $300 million and the same minimum investment, according to regulatory filings.
The Pan Asian fund—like the Japan fund, an equity long/short statistical arbitrage strategy—will invest in Australia, Hong Kong, Japan, South Korea and Taiwan. Both funds feature high turnovers, with the Japan fund targeting 15% annualized returns and the Pan-Asia fund 20%. 
"Many overseas investors are underweight Japan, and many bigger funds are already closed to new investors, so we're seeing some interest from those who want to have a Japan exposure," MCP CEO Tetsuo Ochi told Bloomberg in 2012, when the new funds were announced.
Hayashi's team features Kohei Hayashi, Atsushi Kiyono and Akira Suzuki. Prior to joining Millennium, Masakatsu Hayashi was head of statistical arbitrage at Société Générale.
