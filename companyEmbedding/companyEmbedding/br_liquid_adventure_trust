B&R Liquid Adventure to Debut Búcha Yuzu Lemon at Expo West

Press Release Mar. 3, 2014 at 3:13 pm









        More 











TORRANCE, Calif. — B&R Liquid Adventure, LLC, a California healthy beverage provider focused on delivering organic certified sparkling kombucha tea products with unprecedented taste under the búcha live kombucha brand name, today announced its newest flavor launch: búcha yuzu lemon. Based on the rare East Asian super fruit hailed for its high levels of Vitamin C, búcha yuzu lemon is an exquisite blend of organic lemon and zesty yuzu fruit – a favorite ingredient of high-end chefs used in international cuisine. It will be demonstrated for the first time to leading foodies, chefs, kombucha drinkers and buyers at the upcoming Natural Products Expo West event (from Booth #5236) March 7-9 in Anaheim, Calif.
With spring and summer around the corner, this lively sparkling kombucha tea arrives to store shelves just in time to complement the seasons.  Búcha yuzu lemon harmonizes with any meal, celebration or just an afternoon pick-me-up, and is expected to contribute to the company’s high-growth distribution and fan base as the popular kombucha line continues to expand its distribution across North America.

“Lemonade is such a popular beverage, but this búcha blend just takes it over the top,” said Ron Lloyd, B&R’s CEO and a lemonade aficionado. “By pairing the benefits of the aromatic, in vogue yuzu super fruit with the delicious and ‘cleansing’ aspects of fermented kombucha tea, it’s something special for springtime rejuvenation and summertime sipping.”
Although all of the búcha flavors are low calorie, this refreshing blend takes the brand to an even lower calorie and sweetener content per serving.  The carefully fermented, non-alcoholic offering, which is made from a base of the highest quality organic teas and live cultures, is designed to refresh souls and excite taste buds without expanding waistlines.
Since launching búcha, the company has introduced new flavors cautiously.  According to Frank Commanday, búcha Brewmaster, “In a category in which efficacy typically comes first while great refreshing taste is an after-thought, we work hard to ensure our taste profile is bold, delicious and unique – so we don’t rush the process.   Our goal is to find unique new flavor pairings that will be interesting to kombucha loyalists and to those new to the category seeking a drink that will dazzle, without the familiar harsh vinegar backlash.  We pair ingredients such as this organic lemon kombucha tea with tangy yuzu flavor to deliver a rare, first-of-its-kind offering which exhibits one of our strengths – exceptional, unexpected flavors. The circle of goodness is completed by great taste enhancing the long-reputed well-being benefits we believe our búcha delivers.”
“The commercial kombucha industry continues to expand quickly via double digit growth each year, despite a 2010 withdrawal hiccup,” said Hannah Crum, industry expert and head of the recently formed Kombucha Brewers International trade association.  “Even more exciting, as market leaders make headway into the non-natural sector, including traditional grocery and convenience outlets, and as more and more small brands enter the kombucha space, the entire category is on pace to surpass $500MM in yearly sales by 2015.”
“Our mission is to deliver the liveliest sparking kombucha tea on the market that boasts bold flavors, unrivaled taste and a package presentation that connects with a range of consumers – both from the natural foods enthusiasts to mainstream shoppers,” said Lloyd.  “While staying close to our roots in the natural food space, our total búcha offering has helped us expand across the country into natural, specialty and conventional stores and co-ops such as Whole Foods Markets, PCC, Mother’s Markets, Kroger and Safeway.”
Bold Fruit, Spice & Herbal Pairings
The búcha family is today comprised of eight flavors: búcha Blood Orange, búcha Grapefruit Sage,búcha Guava Mango, búcha Raspberry Pomegranate, búcha Masala Chai, búcha Verbena Rose,búcha Lemongrass Ginger and now búcha Yuzu Lemon. The sparkling kombucha teas offer a delicious, refreshing and low-calorie alternative to the many sugary, high-calorie, high-caffeine drinks on the market.  For more than 2,000 years, people have been drinking kombucha as the organic acids, antioxidants and probiotics are seemingly beneficial and may aid digestion and help detoxify the body.
Availability
Búcha products, which are all natural, organic certified, VEGAN, Non-GMO and gluten free, are sold in the finest natural, organic and specialty foods retailers, co-ops, supermarkets and restaurants across North America. Distribution includes about 80% of the country, plus Canada.  The flavors of búcha are offered in 16-ounce glass bottles with a suggested manufacturer’s retail price of $3.49 per bottle.  Asbúcha contains live probiotics, the product must be refrigerated.
To taste búcha yuzu lemon for yourself, visit us at the Natural Products Expo West on March 7-9, 2014 – Booth # 5236 in Hall E – at the Anaheim Convention Center in Anaheim, Calif. For more about B&R Liquid Adventure’s kombucha product line, and to find búcha in a store near you, please go to www.mybucha.com or www.facebook.com/buchalivekombucha.
About B&R Liquid Adventure 
B&R Liquid Adventure, LLC, a healthy beverage provider, offers great-tasting sparkling kombucha tea marketed under the brand name búcha live kombucha. The privately held company, founded in 2009 in Southern California, aims to extend the appeal of kombucha beyond the dedicated fans of the category to reach general consumers through its wholesome, low-calorie, probiotic product line.  The company maintains a distribution presence in 80% of the U.S. and Canada with a goal to continue building out its market-leading portfolio of functional, fermented non-alcoholic beverages as a smart alternative to sugary and highly caffeinated drinks. www.mybucha.com.

B&R Liquid Adventure Ships Bucha -- The First Good Tasting Kombucha 



Share Article

















Entering One of the Fastest Growing Natural Beverage Categories, Búcha™ Live Kombucha Offers Health-Conscious Drinkers a Unique Attribute in This Market: Extraordinary Flavor







Forbes and the New York Times have reported that kombucha sales have been doubling every year.


Rolling Hills Estates, Calif. (PRWEB)
June 17, 2010
 B&R Liquid Adventure, LLC, a well-funded California startup focused on delivering quality kombucha with unprecedented taste, today shipped its first three Búcha Live Kombucha flavors – Verbena Rose, Kiwi Passion, and Masala Chai.
Finally, A Good-Tasting Kombucha that is Also Good for You
Búcha Live Kombucha is a refreshing, low calorie, non-alcoholic beverage made from a base of the highest quality organic teas and a living culture of beneficial yeast and bacteria. It is carefully fermented and combined with today’s highest quality ingredients to develop a breakthrough in this market – exceptional flavors. It continues the 2,000 year tradition, which started in China, of people drinking kombucha to enhance their health.
Frank Commanday, Búcha’s food scientist, led a research effort that developed kombucha brewing techniques that eliminate the vinegar taste so common for kombucha beverages. Repeated private taste tests have uniformly shown that Búcha Live Kombucha is the best-tasting kombucha made today. At only 35 calories per 8 oz serving, all Búcha flavors are made with natural and organic ingredients.
The Kombucha Market
“This is a great time to enter the kombucha market, and we’re proud to be the first to deliver a product that doesn’t sacrifice taste for goodness,” said Dennis McLaughlin, Chief Marketing Officer, B&R Liquid Adventure. “Forbes and The New York Times have reported that kombucha sales have been doubling every year as more and more people are switching to this refreshing and healthy option versus settling for sugary, highly caffeinated soft drinks and water beverages.”
In addition to delivering unsurpassed taste, company executives considered the favorable economic conditions within the market segment when deciding to launch the organization and product line. “This market segment, even though it is small and undeveloped compared to the larger beverage market, has already seen favorable merger and acquisition activity,” said Bern Galvin, CEO, B&R Liquid Adventure. “Just last year, the Hain Celestial Group purchased Infinitea, and Coca-Cola took a stake in Honest Tea, two companies that are already helping pave the way in this emerging kombucha category.”
B&R plans to continue sampling all Búcha flavors both in stores and at community events, introducing experienced kombucha drinkers and newcomers to the industry’s first great tasting product. The brand will also be promoted through social media efforts, including a Facebook and Twitter presence.
Product Price and Availability
Today’s three flavors are offered in 16 ounce glass bottles with tamper-evident caps. The suggested manufacturer’s retail price is $3.69 per bottle. Three additional flavors – Grapefruit Sage, Guava Mango and Blood Orange – will ship later this summer. Since Búcha products contain live cultures, they must be refrigerated.
B&R Liquid Adventure is currently setting up a distribution channel that will take product into health and natural foods stores around the country. Initial shipments will be to select stores in the west and southwest, starting in California.
For more information about the full line of Búcha Live Kombucha products, please visit: http://mybucha.com.
About B&R Liquid Adventure
B&R Liquid Adventure, LLC was formed by two successful business people – Bern Galvin and Ross Smith – who are also health-conscious, competitive athletes. They started the company in early 2009 after friends urged them to build a company to produce the delicious home-brewed kombucha they were making for friends and family. Bern and Ross brought in three other partners, each of whom had extensive experience in different phases of product creation, introduction, and marketing. The company was funded by an investment syndicate in 2010. B&R Liquid Adventure maintains a presence in Northern and Southern California. Production and bottling is done in Northern California. The company’s goal is to become a leading provider of healthy non-alcoholic beverages, starting with kombucha. A portion of profits will be donated to charity.
