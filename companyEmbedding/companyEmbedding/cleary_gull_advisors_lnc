Johnson Financial Group to acquire Milwaukee's Cleary Gull Advisors

Johnson Financial Group said Wednesday that it plans to acquire the Milwaukee investment advisory firm Cleary Gull Advisors Inc., a move that will bolster Johnson's goal of expanding its wealth management business.The acquisition will add 40 financial employees and $2.1 billion in assets under advisement to Racine-based Johnson Financial Group.Under terms of the transaction, the firm will be a subsidiary called Cleary Gull Advisors, a Johnson Financial Group Company. Michael J. Cleary, the chairman and chief executive officer of Cleary Gull, will be named president of the subsidiary.Financial details of the deal weren't disclosed. The acquisition is in keeping with a plan announced in 2014 by Thomas M. Bolger, president and CEO of Johnson Financial Group, to grow wealth management. He said the acquisition of Cleary Gull will boost wealth assets under administration by about a third, to $8.5 billion."This is a big step," Bolger said in an interview. "This moves us from about 10% of our total revenue to just under 15% of total revenue attributable to wealth."Johnson Financial Group also is the parent company of Johnson Bank and Johnson Insurance."We are making this move to strengthen our market presence with well-known, highly capable people dedicated to serving their clients with the kind of professional expertise and personal, caring approach that makes us distinctive in all that we do," Bolger said in a statement announcing the deal. "This move is part of our growth strategy for our wealth business and strongly demonstrates our commitment to the Milwaukee market. It positions us to be a leading provider of investment advisory and retirement planning services."Cleary Gull provides advice for high-net worth individuals and families, airline pilots, nonprofit hospitals and senior living communities nationwide. Cleary Gull's investment banking division is not included in the acquisition.Cleary Gull was founded in 1987 by Michael Cleary and several partners."The basic strength and appeal of Johnson Financial Group is they are Wisconsin-headquartered, family-owned company and here to stay for generations," Cleary said. "What this means to investors and the marketplace is two legacy companies with deep roots in Milwaukee and Wisconsin will join forces, become bigger and better together and be able to grow in the best way."Cleary added that all clients, including its specialty practice focused on airline pilots, will have access to all Johnson Financial services, including banking and insurance. Johnson Bank is the second-largest bank based in Wisconsin."I really think that the reputation of the firm — what it stands for, the type of people who work at Cleary Gull, the culture of the firm — is very compatible with who we are," Bolger said.The companies said merger talks began last summer after Johnson Financial hired Brian Andrew, who previously was president and chief investment officer of Cleary Gull, to be its chief investment officer."I've known Tom Bolger for a number of years and always had great respect for the Johnson organization," Cleary said. "I had been thinking about the future of our firm for some time, and when Brian left last year, I reached out to Tom to start a conversation."In an interview, Cleary said: "One of the things our clients are going to be looking for in the next five to 10 years is what's next for Cleary Gull. ... This solves the problem."Cleary Gull has changed owners before. In 1998, the Boston investment banking firm Tucker Anthony Sutro acquired Cleary Gull. But in 2001, after Tucker Anthony Sutro was sold to Royal Bank of Canada-Dain Rauscher, principals and employees of Cleary Gull led a local buyback. Milwaukee's MBO Advisors merged with Cleary Gull in 2003.Cleary Gull has more than 675 clients.Johnson Financial Group offers more than 2,200 wealth clients — individuals, businesses and institutions — investment management, fiduciary trust services and retirement plan services. Michael Cleary will work closely with Dan Kaminski, head of wealth management for Johnson Financial Group, to integrate the companies.Cleary Gull's office is located in the 100 E. Wisconsin Ave. tower. Bolger said Johnson Financial Group plans to assume the lease for that space and may move some of its back-office investment research employees to it from Racine.

Posted on  MAY 31, 2016
Johnson Financial Group closes on Cleary Gull Advisors Acquisition
Racine bank joins forces with Milwaukee RIA
Racine-based Johnson Financial Group on Tuesday completed its previously announced acquisition of Milwaukee-based registered investment advisor Cleary Gull Advisors Inc.
Johnson Financial is the $4 billion parent company of Johnson Bank and Johnson Insurance.
Cleary Gull Advisors offers RIA and wealth management services. It split off from the investment banking arm of Cleary Gull Inc. in the transaction. Its remaining stock was purchased by the 18 employees in the investment banking division.
Cleary Gull has 40 employees, all of whom will become Johnson Financial Group employees and continue to work out of the same downtown Milwaukee office. Johnson Financial will move an indeterminate number of its employees into Cleary Gull’s offices in the 100 E. Wisconsin building this summer, said Michael Cleary, president of the combined company.
“Certainly people affiliated with the research department and the wealth group are candidates to move,” Cleary said.
Together, Johnson Financial and Cleary Gull have $9 billion in assets under administration and will offer customized investment management, fiduciary trust services and retirement plan services for both individuals and businesses. The combined name is Cleary Gull Advisors Inc., a Johnson Financial Group Company.
“We're certainly one of the largest independent, privately-held investment advisors in the state and probably relatively large in the country,” Cleary said. “One of the things that we felt also is the industry is going to a broader array of products and services and it's ultimately good for the client and that's where the growth is.”
Cleary will work with Daniel Kaminski, executive vice president of wealth for Johnson Financial, to integrate the firms.
The technology integration has been completed, Cleary said, but the people integration is ahead.
“With Cleary Gull Advisors, we bring together a quality investment team with a loyal customer base, a successful affinity pilot program and a cohesive institutional business program,” Kaminski said.
“As a privately held organization, we're in a unique position to combine our fiduciary and investment advisory businesses and together create one of the largest privately-owned investment advisory firms based in Wisconsin,” said Thomas Bolger, president and chief executive officer of Johnson Financial Group. “We continually look for ways to strengthen our capabilities, and the combination of Cleary Gull gives us deeper investment capabilities. We see a similar culture based on strong values and a commitment to service excellence that aligns with what's truly important to customers—partnering with a trusted advisor.”
