What Our Clients Are Saying…

 
Thank You Trycera!  After being turned down by many different banks for an auto loan, I went thru your program and was finally able to purchase a $70,000 Work Truck at a 0.9% Interest Rate!  Since then, I’ve been able to purchase a large boat and just recently closed on our new home for our family.  We listened to your experts and followed their instructions.  It was simple, but the impact was great.  WOW, can’t wait to tell all my friends about YOU!
Norm H. Brush Prairie, WA

Trycera Financial is the company to use to solve your credit score issues! Due to my divorce, and my ex wife still using a credit card that was still in my name, my credit score was reduced so that I could not get my house refinanced. But due to Trycera working with the three Credit Score companies, my credit score was raised, and certain bad remarks were removed from my reports. If it wasn’t for Trycera, I would not been able to refinance! I highly recommend them, a professional company, that has the customer first!Norm H. Brush Prairie, WAGrowing up I think many women dream about becoming a wife and a mom. I have been blessed to have a great husband and 5 wonderful children. As a military wife, it is sometimes hard to keep everything in line, but I am very grateful for having been able to work with Trycera and their entire staff.Alexa C. — Prospect Park, NJTrycera Financial is the company to use to solve your credit score issues!

Information Statement

 



CONSUMER RIGHTS UNDER STATE AND FEDERAL LAW.
CONSUMER’S CREDIT FILE RIGHTS UNDER STATE AND FEDERAL LAW. Regarding Credit Bureaus: Consumers have a right to dispute any and all inaccurate information in their credit file by contacting the credit bureaus directly. However, neither the consumer nor any credit repair company nor credit repair organization has the right to have accurate, current, and verifiable information removed from a credit report. The credit bureau must remove negative information from your report only if it is over 7 years old except for a bankruptcy which can be reported for a maximum of 10 years.
 
As a consumer, you have a right to obtain a copy of your credit report from a credit bureau and may be charged a reasonable fee. There is no fee, however, if you have been turned down for credit, employment, insurance or a rental dwelling because of information in your credit report within the preceding 60 days (30 days for residents of MN, NY, PA, and WV). The credit bureau must provide someone to help you interpret the information in your credit file. You are entitled to receive a free copy of your credit report if you are unemployed and intend to apply for employment in the next 60 days, if you are a recipient of public welfare assistance, or if you have reason to believe that there is inaccurate information in your credit report due to fraud. Credit bureaus are required to follow reasonable procedures to ensure that the information they report is accurate. However, mistakes may and do occur. We do not remove accurate items.
 
You may, on your own, notify a credit bureau directly in writing that you dispute the accuracy of information in your credit file. The credit bureau must then investigate and modify or remove inaccurate, unverifiable or incomplete information. The credit bureau may not charge any fee for this service. Any pertinent information and copies of all documents you have concerning an error should be submitted to the credit bureau(s) along with any explanation.
 
If the credit bureau’s investigation does not resolve the dispute to your satisfaction, you may send a brief statement to the credit bureau(s), to be kept in your file, explaining why you think the record is inaccurate. The credit bureau must include a summary of your statement about disputed information with any report it issues about you.

This law, as well as the corresponding state laws, prohibits deceptive practices by any credit services organizations.

Note: Certain States require a statement by Trycera Financial, Inc. informing the consumer about Trycera Financial, Inc.’s obtaining and maintaining a bond and a place of business within the State. However, due to the fact that Trycera Financial, Inc. does not require a Contract for any duration of time with the consumer and the fact that Trycera Financial, Inc. bills consumers only after services are completed each month, Trycera Financial, Inc. and certain subcontractors do not maintain a bond or a place of business in any State other than California.

The credit bureau must include your statement about disputed data – or a coded version of it – with any reports it issues about you. New York law also provides that, at your request, the credit bureau must notify any person who has received a report in the previous year that an error existed and furnish such person with the corrected information. TIME LIMITS ON ADVERSE DATA: Most kinds of information in your file may be reported for a period of seven years. If you have declared personal bankruptcy, however, that fact may be reported for ten years. After seven or ten years, the information can’t be disclosed by a credit bureau unless you are being investigated for a credit application of $50,000 or more, for an application to purchase life insurance of $50,000 or more, or for employment at an annual salary of $25,000 or more.

Testimonials



          Growing up I think many women dream about becoming a wife and a mom. I have been blessed to have a great husband and 5 wonderful children. As a military wife, it is sometimes hard to keep everything in line, but I am very grateful for having been able to work with Trycera and their entire staff and put a plan in place to properly manage our money and build a great FICO score.  I highly recommend signing up for their services.  You won't regret it!        

          Alexa C.          Customer









          Working with Trycera has been wonderful; they helped me in such a big way that I can honestly say it has changed my perception of credit as a whole. The people at Trycera personally helped me realize my true potential and gave me the tools I need to navigate this broken credit system.  With their help, I've been able to qualify for credit cards and a new car!  Thank You Trycera.        

          Leidy Z.          Customer









          In almost two years of working with Trycera, we've been able to close over $8 Million in mortgage loans for our clients.  Without the help of Trycera, there was just no way possible these clients would have qualified for a mortgage loan.  It has been a great partnership and we look forward to growing our business even bigger in the years to come.        

          National Residential          Mortgage Company









          I tried for over 3 years to refinance my home and take advantage of the low interest rates.  After going thru a terrible divorce, I just couldn't qualify.  I was referred to Trycera and I was very skeptical.  In fact, after I signed up with Trycera, I gave a bankruptcy attorney a retainer because I had not faith in Trycera's ability.  They convinced me to give them a chance.  I did. It was the best decision I could've ever made.  Within 8 months, I qualified for my Refinance and am saving over $400 / month!

BBB Accreditation





                This Business Is Not BBB Accredited
            

                
                Businesses are under no obligation to seek BBB accreditation, and some businesses are not accredited because they have not sought BBB accreditation.
            

                To be accredited by BBB, a business must apply for accreditation and BBB must determine that the business meets
                BBB accreditation standards, which include a commitment to make a good faith effort to resolve any consumer complaints. BBB Accredited Businesses must pay a fee for accreditation review/monitoring and for support of BBB services to the public.
            








Standards of BBB Accreditation






Build Trust









            Establish and maintain a positive track record in the marketplace.
        

           An accredited business or organization agrees to:

                   1. Have been operational (actively selling products or services) in any BBB service area for at least the most recent 6 months, unless the principle(s) previously operated a similar business with an eligible record (one that qualifies for BBB accreditation).
                

                   1. Fulfill contracts signed and agreements reached.
                

                   3. Be free from government action that demonstrates a significant failure to support BBB ethical principles in marketplace transactions (this requires a determination by BBB as to the nature of any violation, whether it was caused or condoned by management, and actions taken to resolve underlying issues that led to the government action).
                
4. Be free of an unsatisfactory rating and maintain at least a B rating at the accrediting BBB and the BBB where it is headquartered, if different.

                   5. In its relationship with BBB: 
1. meet all applicable standards within this Code of Business Practices

                            2. cooperate with BBB's activities and efforts to promote voluntary self- regulation within the business' industry
                        
3. honor any settlements, agreements or decisions reached as an outcome of a BBB dispute resolution process

                            4. complete the required application and pay all monetary obligations to BBB in a timely manner
                        









Advertise Honestly









            Adhere to established standards of advertising and selling.
        

            An accredited business or organization agrees to: 

                    1. Follow federal, state/provincial and local advertising laws.
                

                    2. Abide by the BBB Code of Advertising. Supply, upon request, substantiation for advertising and selling claims. Correct advertising and selling practices, when recommended by BBB.
                
3. Adhere to applicable BBB industry codes of advertising.
4. Cooperate with BBB self-regulatory programs for the resolution of advertising disputes.
5. Use the BBB name and logos in accordance with BBB policy.

                    6. Avoid misleading customers by creating the false impression of sponsorship, endorsement, popularity, trustworthiness, product quality or business size through the misuse of logos, trustmarks, pictures, testimonials, or other means
                







Tell the Truth









            Honestly represent products and services, including clear and adequate disclosures of all material terms.
        

            An accredited business or organization agrees to: 

                    1. Make known all material facts in both written and verbal representations, remembering that misrepresentation may result not only from direct statements but by omitting or obscuring relevant facts.
                

                    2. Ensure that any written materials are readily available, clear, accurate and complete.
                







Be Transparent









            Openly identify the nature, location, and ownership of the business, and clearly disclose all policies, guarantees and procedures that bear on a customer's decision to buy.
        

            An accredited business or organization agrees to: 

                    1. Upon request, provide BBB with all information required to evaluate compliance with BBB standards. This may include, but is not limited to business name, address and contact information; names and background of principles; business and banking references; licensing and/or professional accreditation; and a complete description of the nature of the business.
                

                    2. Clearly disclose to customers:

                    
1. direct and effective means to contact the business
2. terms of any written contract
3. any guarantees or warranties accompanying a product

                            4. any restrictions or limitations imposed (e.g. limited supply,maximum number available per customer)
                        
5. the business' return/refund policy

                            6. any recurring commitment into which the customer may be entering, including information on how future billing will occur
                        
7. total cost of the transaction, including tax, shipping and handling, and other related charges



                    3. If selling products or providing services on Web sites or via other electronic means: 
1. provide any required product labeling information

                            2. disclose the nature and terms of shipping, including any known delays or shortages of stock
                        
3. provide an opportunity to review and confirm the transaction before the sale is completed

                            4. provide a receipt summarizing the transaction after the purchase
                        









Honor Promises









            Abide by all written agreements and verbal representations.
        

            An accredited business or organization agrees to: 
1. Fulfill contracts signed and agreements reached. 2. Honor representations by correcting mistakes as quickly as possible.







Be Responsive









            Address marketplace disputes quickly, professionally, and in good faith.
        

            An accredited business or organization agrees to: 

                    1. Promptly respond to all complaints forwarded by BBB by: 
1. Resolving the complaint directly with the complainant and notifying BBB, or

                            2. Providing BBB with a response that BBB determines: 

                                    1. is professional,
                                
2. addresses all of the issues raised by the complainant,
3. includes appropriate evidence and documents supporting the business' position, and

                                    4. explains why any relief sought by the complainant cannot or should not be granted.
                                





                    2. Make a good faith effort to resolve disputes, which includes mediation if requested by BBB. Other dispute resolution options, including arbitration, may be recommended by BBB when other efforts to resolve a dispute have failed.

BBB Accreditation Reviews

BBB routinely monitors its files on all Accredited Businesses to affirm that they continue to meet all BBB Accreditation Standards











BBB Accreditation Process


        Not every business is eligible for BBB Accreditation. Businesses must meet, commit to and maintain the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards) 
        in order to be eligible for and maintain BBB Accreditation. The BBB Code of Business Practices represents sound advertising, selling and customer
        service practices that enhance customer trust and confidence in business. The Code is built on the BBB Standards for Trust, eight principles that
        summarize important elements of creating and maintaining trust in business.
    

        In order to be eligible for Accreditation a business must complete an Accreditation application.        
    

        Upon receipt of a fully completed BBB Application for Accreditation, BBB staff:        
        
Reviews the application
Researches the business
Verifies the information presented in the application 
May request additional information
May request proof of specific information on the application

        After the review and verification process, BBB will then evaluate if the business meets the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards)..
    
    
        Once BBB has finished its evaluation, the application for BBB Accreditation is either approved or denied. If the applicant is found in compliance with the BBB Code of Business Practices it will be presented to the BBB Board of Directors, or a committee of that board, for final approval. If the application is denied, BBB will contact the applicant, indicating the BBB Standard(s) that were not met and any recourse available to the applicant.
