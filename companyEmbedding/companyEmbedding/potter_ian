THE HARRY POTTER PILL! is a Smosh video uploaded on July 15, 2011, the release date of the final Harry Potter film.
Brief Synopsis: We bring you the final solution to get over your Harry Potter depression!


The Infomercial
An infomercial spokesperson, Dickle Sfinkter (Ian, and J.K. Rowling's Pool Boy) asks the Harry Potter fans if [they] felt like their life was over because the Harry Potter movie series was over? Instead of writing crazy fan fiction or buying all their merchandise and waiting for Harry to rescue them from their pathetic life, they can use The Potter Pill ! A single dose of The Potter Pill will end all suffering from the black hole that Harry Potter left in [your] life. It consists of 3 simple ingredients: Enriched Wheat flour, (White half) Vitamin B6, (Red Half) and a leathal dose of Cyanide (Black lightning bolt in the middle). It also makes a great gift. The scene changes to a Pink tie salesman named Mike Hawksmall. He had a co-worker that just wouldn't shut up about Harry Potter, so he gave her the Potter Pill, and he hasn't heard from her since! Then Dickle explains how the Potter Pill works to a paramedic (Anthony) on how it works: 1. Place it in your mouth. 2. Don't forget to swallow. (That's what he said) And 3. Goodbye, cruel world!
Since some kids hate taking pills, there's Potter Pill chewables! Timmy's mother (From REJECTED VIDEOS!) feeds him a Potter Pill Chewable, and while Timmy starts choking, his mom tells him to sleep. It also comes in a suppository fashion, but you really have to be a really hardcore fan to want one of those. It's (technically) FDA approved. According to FDA Sr. Administrator, Dr. Drew Peacock (Played by Anthony) who states (With a gun held up to his head and brusies all over his face) "This product is FDA approved". Most doctors can relate to the effects of the Potter Pill (which is death). So a (toilet hating) doctor, Dr. Splashbottom (Ian) says that he just can't endorse this product and instead tells potential custumors they should obsess on another book series and gives an example (The Twilight Saga), but gets shot in the head. Then Dickle says, "And if you don't believe The Potter Pill will work for you, just listen to these satisfied customers!" The scene changes to a living room full of people (the customers) who are all dead.
All order information appears and Dickle's voice warns to not use The Potter Pill while operating a motor vehicle, or in conjunction with Viagra. It also states that if you order within the next 5 minutes you will recieve a fan fiction about Harry & Dumbledore, and Dumbledore's greatest pickup lines.

Trivia/Goofs
In the Potter Pill chewables scene, Timmy from REJECTED VIDEOS! appears taking the Chewable pill
When Dickle Sfinkter says that doctors can relate to this, his background is upside down
When Dickle Sfinkter explains to the viewers to listen to their customers, one of the hog statues' head is replaced with one of a T-Rex.
During the warning not to use the pill with Viagra, Ian's erect penis is censored with Bob Barker's head, a reference to how in the censored version of HOW TO HIDE A B0NER IN PUBLIC!, Anthony's erection is similarly censored.
Just like Smosh's other fake infomercial videos, (like Easy Step, Easy Poop, Runbrella, Just Like Link, and others) the text that appears at the lower half of the screen during the order infomation has strange details that have very small if not no relation to the product.
Just as the Harry Potter fangirl imagines Harry Potter coming into her room, you can see a Scott Pilgrim Gets It Together poster on her door a split second before it opens.
Dr. Drew Peacock in this video is played by Anthony. However, in I'M POSSESSED!, Dr. Drew Peacock is played by Ian and is an exorcist. It is unknown if the Dr. Drew Peacock in both videos are the same person despite the different actors playing as him.
Mike Hawksmall, one of the buyers of the Potter Pill, sounds like "My Cock's Small."

Ian Potter and TCP are highly recommended.  The lining products are without question excellent and i certainly recommend Ian doing the work for the ultimate finish. 
		    I would also advocate Ian's paintwork as an additional service as the quality of his work is great.
		    Many thanks for your work.

Kawasaki ZX10 tank
 
 




Above: A happy customer from Brussels, I have now done 4 tanks for this customer.
Below: A letter to Real Classic magazine Jan 2012, from a happy customer.	''The tank in the picture is not the one I repaired''

 
 

Hello Ian, 
 
Just to let you know the sealant worked great  on the Sunbeam Tank and with 2 applications it's all out.
 
I used an old hairdryer pointing through through  the filler neck to dry the tank out after it had been flushed out with the  TP1/Water & TP2. 
 
I have written a short article recommending  your products & given your contact details for a future issue of the Sunbeam  M.C.C. Club News. Hope this is OK.
 
Regards,
 
Robert Smith
 
Ian,


I very reluctantly went down the DIY  route with Sureseal because of your massive backlog to do the tank for me. This was compounded by the fact that my wife had threatened to leave me because of the constant smell of petrol coming from my 1955 T100 petrol tank that resided in the garage. In addition  the local fire crew were constantly turning up to investigate a reported  petrol spillage.
The instructions were read and your video's studied. Then the chosen day dawned and the process was executed - it was so simple!
I used a hot air gun to get the tank up to temperature and the microwave to heat the Sureseal (wife was out) and 6 days later filled the tank and no leaks - result! Thoroughly recommend having a go yourself.


Regards,
Jeff

Harry Potter has learned to live with his bullying Uncle Vernon, his callous Aunt Petunia and the constant whining of his greedy, spoiled cousin Dudley. He's even learned to live with sleeping in the cupboard under the stairs. Harry's relatives have just as reluctantly learned to live with the unwelcome presence of their orphaned relation, a constant reminder of Petunia's "wayward" sister and brother-in-law and their mysterious and untimely demise. Even the impending arrival of his 11th birthday offers no excitement for Harry- as usual, there's little chance of cards, presents or any kind of birthday treat. This year, however, is different. On his 11th birthday, Harry learns that he is the orphaned son of two powerful wizards and possesses unique magical powers of his own. Invited to attend Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, Harry embarks on the adventure of a lifetime. At Hogwarts, he finds the home and family he has never had.

As with most cases of movies based on books, it doesn't have anywhere near the detail of the book but is still a really entertaining watch from start to finish. There are a couple scary moments that some young children might be frightened by but for the most part my son loved it and I enjoyed it as well.The picture and sound quality are both great, as you would expect from a blu ray disc. There are a number of special features included on the disc but nothing that stands out.All in all, its a really good start to the Potter movies and highly recommended to all Potter fans.Read more0Comment|Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuse4.0 out of 5 starsOk for older kids - too scaryByLizzyon 7 June 2017Format: Amazon Video|Verified PurchaseI feel this is too scary for younger kids.

His reason: Richard Harris, who played Dumbledore in the franchise before his death in 2002.McKellen said Harris once called him a "technically brilliant, but passionless" actor — something he remembered when he was considering the role."I couldn't take over the part from an actor who I'd known didn't approve of me," McKellen said in an interview with BBC's HARDTalk show.Although he declined the role, McKellen admitted that he sometimes gets confused for Michael Gambon, the actor who wound up playing Dumbledore after Harris died."Sometimes, when I see the posters of Mike Gambon, the actor who gloriously plays Dumbledore, I think sometimes it is me," he joked.Customer ServiceSite MapPrivacy PolicyAd ChoicesTerms of UseYour California Privacy RightsCareers© 2017 Time Inc.

"When they called me up and said would I be interested in being in the Harry Potter films they didn't say what part," he said. "I worked out what they were thinking. And I couldn't [say yes]. I couldn't take over the part from an actor who I had known didn't approve of me."Harris once said that McKellen was technically brilliant but a passionless actor.So does MKellen, who has starred in everything from King Lear to X-Men, have any regrets about turning down the role?"I played the real wizard," he joked. "When I see the posters of Mike Gambon, the actor who played Dumbledore, I think sometimes it is me [anyway]."

Note, all standard
litre prices are those quoted by www.milkprices.com and are based on the following:
The liquid standard
litre 4% bf, 3.3% protein, 30,000/ml Bactoscans, 200,000/ml SCC, 1 million
litres a year on EODC but before seasonality, monthly profile payments,
balancing, B price additions, capital retentions or annual incentive schemes. 
The manufacturing
standard litre is to exactly the same specification with the exception of
4.2%bf and 3.4% protein.
 

 
 
1.5ppl milk price increase for
suppliers Yew tree Dairy (AKA Woodcocks) - from August 14th   (21st
July 2017)
This takes
producers standard liquid litre price to 29ppl (www.milkprices.com)
 
 
1.0ppl milk price increase for
suppliers Paynes Dairies - from August 1st    (21st July 2017)
This takes producers
standard liquid litre price to 28.45ppl (www.milkprices.com)
 
0.81ppl milk price increase for Arla
members - from August 1st   (21st July 2017)
This is actually a
1 Euro Cent per kg increase, which equates to 0.81ppl and results in a standard
liquid litre price of 28.82ppl and a standard manufacturing litre price of
29.98ppl.  Arlas organic price is a
stand on at 42.83ppl.
 
1ppl milk price increase for suppliers
to Dairy Crest Davidstow - from September 1st    (21st July 2017)
This 1ppl increase will be a big
disappointment to 360 producers who are now firmly well off the pace.  The reality is that Dairy Crest and the
producer group DCD reached an agreement in April 2017 for 2 further price drops
in June and July and then having assessed the market decided to agree to a
price hold until 1st October.
 
Dairy Crest
could have held firm until 1st October and refused any price increase but the
lesson for DCD to learn is the difference between a price hold and a price
floor.  Had DCD agreed that the July
reduction would have been the last reduction then further increases would have undoubtedly
have flowed because a flaw would not prevent price increases. 
 
The situation
leaves DCD and Dairy Crest with much head scratching when it comes to negotiating
the 1st October price at the end of August.  The increase for 1st October will
have to be significant and if it isnt agreed our understanding is that
deadlock would mean that Dairy Crest producers could leave on 3 months notice
and that would be a situation that Mark Allen and his team will not want to
take a chance on.  
 
In the latest
addition of Dairy Industry Newsletter, Barry Wilson has described Dairy Crest
and its price movements as shameful, especially given the profits in the
cheese business are up 18% to almost Ł43million for the year to March
2017.  Wilson says that operating margins
at this level are both the highest in the UK cheese sector and probably in
Dairy Crests history.  For August it
seems that Dairy Crest will be at the bottom of the milk price league tables
and Wilson goes on to highlight that Mark Allens salary for 2016-17 at
Ł1.344million with share options worth Ł5.2million.  Wilson then closes his article with a very
hard hitting statement that if he was a Davidstow supplier he would be looking
elsewhere if this is how he was being treated. 
 
It remains to
be seen how tough DCD are in the next round of negotiations but for sure if
Dairy Crest dont play their cards right they could be in for a bruising.
 
Arla unanimously vote to move to 12 months
notice period   (21st July
2017)
At a meeting
this week 94% of Arla representatives voted for UK members to be given a 12
month notice period option with only 6% voting against the resolution.
 
First Milk price contract changes   (21st July 2017)
First Milk have decided to abandon A and B
pricing following the lead of several other milk purchasers.  This
decision is one of several  outcomes of a pricing review, which started in
March.  
 
While some farmers will understandably
criticise the move on the basis that B pricing now should be very high, it has
to be balanced by the fact that First Milks B price for July is only
 25ppl and off the pace.  The reason for this appears to be that
First Milk dont have any  surplus milk with all their members milk
required for their core business contracts.  In fact when questioned First
Milk claim that they are now buying milk from third parties for short term
opportunities  far more often then they are selling surplus.  
 
The co-op believes that the one price
offering will be welcomed by the majority of members, especially now that it is
accompanied by a simple 0.5ppl production bonus paid on all litres if the
amount produced in one month is equal or greater to the corresponding month 12
months earlier.  This is simply a statement by First Milk that they want
to encourage members to deliver more milk.
 
Another change is that the individual
transport/haulage charges have been removed from 1st September.
 
First Milk have also stated that during the
course of next week the expectation is that they will be announcing another
 price rise.
 
3 new board members at Muller    (21st July 2017)
At Tuesdays
farmer forum meeting there were 8 farmers put forward for 3 positions on the
Muller farmer board.   Roddy Catto, as
chairman and board member, lost his position as did Chris Willis.  Grant Hartman was the only one of the 3
candidates to retain his position and he is now joined by John Hocknell and
Stephen Foster.
 
4 other
places taking it to a total of 7 are up for election next year.   At the next meeting in August the farmer
forum will need to elect a chairman, vice chairman and finance officer and the
odds on favourite to take the position of chairman must surely be David Herdman
who is the current vice chairman of the group and former chairman of DCD
 
32ppl
equivalent milk price for July deliveries paid by Friesland Campina   (14th
July 2017)
Having announced a July farm gate price
increase of 0.5 Euro Cents per 1kg, www.milkprices.com
have calculated that at current exchange rates of 1 Euro = 88.2ppl and
converted to our standard liquid litre results in a price paid of
31.858ppl.  This represents an increase
of 12.1ppl compared to 12 months ago.
 
Using the same numbers the Friesland Campina
organic standard liquid litre price equates to a farm gate price of 42.976ppl.
 
Arla
members are encouraged to discuss the proposal to move to a 12 months notice
period    (14th July 2017)
Arla members have been given the minimum
required 10 working days notice to consider and express any views on the
proposed resolution for the immediate removal of the 3 month notice to leave
period to be replaced by a 12 month period as proposed and promoted by the UKAF
Board.  
 
Several Arla members have contacted Ian
during the week questioning the move with some suggesting that an immediate
jump from 3 months to 12 months should have been staged with a 6 month interim
notice period.  It was the UKAF Board who
made the decision to go in one jump.
 
The main bone of contention appears to be the
minimum short 10 working day notice period, which for some, is leading to
speculation and suspicion which clearly will be a disappointment to Arla.  This is especially the case given the fact
that if this is voted through next Thursday (20th July) the 12 month
notice period will take effect immediately.
 
Some farmers believe the option for a farmer
to leave a milk purchaser in 3 months keeps that purchaser sharp and focussed
on the real market place.  As it stands
today all of the main GB milk purchasers who do not comply with the Voluntary
Code are on a 12 month notice period as are some of the Code compliant
purchasers.  Only Muller, Dairy Crest and
Parkham Farms currently operate a 3 month notice period on a price change.
 
Notices for Arla farmers in Denmark and
Sweden vary from 4 months to 16 months depending on when the farmer submits his
notice.  Note, Arlas plan is to
standardise notice periods across all countries during the next 2 years.
 
One thing is clear, in the event a number of
Arla farmers were to leave having given only 3 months notice it potentially
results in the remaining members having to plug any hole with the business
often having to acquire expensive spot milk, which ultimately reflects on the
milk price paid to the remaining members.
 
Arla farmers are urged to raise any concerns
and discuss the implications of the resolution with their local area
representative at the earliest opportunity and ahead of Thursdays vote.

1ppl milk price
increase for suppliers to Belton Farm (Cheese) - from 1st August    (7th

This
takes producers standard manufacturing litre to 29ppl and the liquid standard
litre to 28.25ppl (www.milkprices.com)

NFU accuse Arla CEO
of scaremongering  
(7th July 2017)
Peder
Tuborgh, CEO of Arla has hit the news today with his comments that "butter
and cream will be very short at Christmas time" and "Buy your butter
now".
 
Tuborgh
was interviewed live by BBC Business Live and Radio 5 Live where he pointed to
a reduction in milk production coupled with the move from spreads back to real
butter following confirmation from scientists that eating butter is not
responsible for clogging up arteries. Suddenly butter is popular.
 
Only
last week in this bulletin Ian commented "retail butter prices have not
responded to hit consumers pockets yet".
 
One
year ago a 250 gram pack of butter cost Ł1.35 now it's Ł1.49 but it must surely
be set to head towards Ł2 or more soon.
 
A
powerful, but perhaps realistic, warning from the head of one of the worlds
dairy giants.
 
The
big surprise was the revelation that one or more of the interviewers was told
by the NFU that Arla were scaremongering in relation to suggestions that butter
and cream will be short.
 
According
to current wholesale market prices butter and cream are ALREADY short and very
soon retailers will have to pass on increases to consumers.
 
For
the NFU to comment like this smacks of an industry where its left hand doesnt
know what its right hand is doing, achieved nothing and looks to be a case of
negatively counteracting Arla's message just for the sake of it.
 
The
division comes at a critical time when the industry needs to be joined in its
thinking, especially with the Brexit negotiations.
 
1.5ppl milk price
increase for suppliers to Grahams Dairies (Scotland)  from 1st
August   (6th July 2017)
This
takes producers standard liquid litre price to 27.75ppl (www.milkprices.com)
 
1.5ppl milk price increase for Muller
suppliers  from August 1st    (30th June 2017)
The resulting
liquid standard litre price is 27.69ppl. 

 
Note, the current
0.3ppl June and July forecast retailer supplement will reduce and could
potentially disappear which will mean a reduction in Mullers farm gate milk
price.
 
1ppl milk price increase for Arla
directs  from 1st July    (30th June 2017)
This takes the
liquid standard litre milk price up to 26.0ppl and the manufacturing standard
litre price to 27.04ppl (www.milkprices.com)
 
1ppl milk price increase for suppliers
to Glanbia Cheese  from August 1st    (30th June 2017)
This results in a
standard manufacturing litre milk price of 29ppl and a 0.96ppl liquid
equivalent price rise resulting in a standard liquid litre milk price of
28.03ppl (www.milkprices.com)
 
0.75ppl unconfirmed price increase for
suppliers to South Caernarfon Creameries Limited  from August 1st    (30th
June 2017)
The price increase
is strongly rumoured but no one from SCC was available to confirm it as
correct.  If it is confirmed it will
result in a 29.28ppl standard manufacturing litre milk price.
 
0.21ppl milk price increase for Tesco
(TSDG) Muller and Arla suppliers  from August 1st    (30th June 2017)
This results in a standard
liquid litre price of 29.58ppl.  The
increase follows a quarterly review of the cost tracker.
 
As markets are the
liquid standard litre milk prices for both Arla and Muller non aligned should
comfortably overtake the TSDG price during this quarter.
 
First Milk B price +1ppl but stand on
for July A price     (30th
June 2017)
First Milks member
B price will increase by 1ppl to 25ppl from July 1st whereas the A
price will be stand on until 1st August.
 
29.5ppl net milk price for March to
June 2018!     (30th
June 2017)
www.milkprices.com
UK Milk Futures Equivalent (UKMFE) forward curve is indicating what they
describe as the opportunity to lock into a net farm gate milk price of around
29.5ppl for the March to June 2018 period.  This must surely mean much
head-scratching by farmers as to whether they commit a percentage of their milk
at these prices to hedge their bets.
 
In a similar tone the current average UKMFE
net price to producers stands at at 29.34ppl allowing for costs, margin and
level of risk. (www.milkprices.com)
 
But whos pickpocketing the money?    (30th June 2017)
NFU Scotland have issued a news release
titled Dairy Farmer Patience Wearing Thin pointing to the fact market
indicators are meteoric yet farm gate prices have failed to respond and that
the arithmetic does not add up.  
 
As one industry analyst commented to Ian this
morning some liquid milk purchasers need to up their game if they want to
retain their milk pool and at current July and August 1st farm gate
prices its likely some farmers will vote with their feet and tender
resignations.
 
AHDB Dairy butter prices are at record levels
averaging Ł5,100 tonne (June) and hitting Ł5400 to Ł5500 tonne.  In
addition, AMPE at 36.4ppl and MCVE standing at 36.9ppl are both close to
doubling in value in only 12 months.
 
Questions are being asked as to whether
current butter prices are sustainable and the answer appears to be its
doubtful, especially given the fact retail butter prices have not responded to
hit consumers pockets yet.  
 
The AMPE price of 36.4ppl for June should
have Barbers suppliers smiling because the Barbers above base milk volume price
is set at AMPE minus 2ppl = 34.4ppl, with their standard milk price remaining
the top milk for cheese price in the UK (www.milkprices.com).  Lets
play Top Trumps and see who can beat that?
 
A big thank you to all who sponsored
Ian & Carole in their classic Mini Cooper S trip to Holland in March     (30th June 2017)
Thanks to the
generous sponsorship of readers of this bulletin Ian and Carole raised Ł3630 in
aid of Orchid (fighting male cancer) and Against Breast Cancer.
 
In fact, they also
collected the prize for raising the most money so a big thank you to all of you
who generously supported the tow charities.
 
The total raised by
the Regis Ladies Classic Group in their 20 years of annual tours is a
staggering Ł565,000
 
1.65ppl
(2 Euro Cents) milk price increase for Arla members  from 1st
July    (23rd June 2017)
The increase was inevitable given the seismic
movements in the fat markets, which are now driving prices north with spot
prices having hit 36ppl.  Other milk
processors are expected to follow with useful and meaningful price increases
next week from July 1st and those announced for August 1st
will need to be greater if they intend to be fair to farmer suppliers.
 
The nett Arla price increase is actually
1.44ppl allowing for the currency smoothing and re-balancing of Arlas cash
flow following the milk price support given in May and June when the UK Arla
farmers board agreed to fast forward future currency smoothing benefits due
from 1st July.
 
The resulting liquid standard litre price is
28.03ppl with manufacturing 29.17ppl and the organic manufacturing standard
litre price increases to 42.83ppl and the organic liquid standard litre price
to 39.78ppl.  (www.milkprices.com)
 
GDT
down 0.8%     (23rd June 2017)
Its the first auction decrease for three
months with the average price recorded $3434.
 
Notable movers:
 
Cheddar            down     3.8% to average US$4121 tonne
WMP                down     3.3% to average US$3022 tonne

Butter               up         2.9% to average US$5768 tonne
 
Dairy
UK Beyond Brexit Seminar and comments from EU Commissioner, Phil Hogan     (23rd
June 2017)
Wednesdays gathering of the great and the
good of the UK dairy industry certainly confirmed that Dairy UK is pulling all
the stops out to ensure the UK dairy industry, at both processor and farmer
level, is recognised as a key priority in the Brexit negotiations.
 
Commissioner Phil Hogan spoke in the evening
and gave very positive signs that he wanted to work with the UK dairy industry
to ensure a soft Brexit.  Yes, the
cynical will likely comment that Hogan will want a soft landing given his Irish
roots but he had the perfect opportunity to deliver a hard hitting warning to
the UK dairy industry and he chose to deliver the opposite message of wanting
to work together.
 
Chairman of Dairy UK, David Dobbin, was very
clear that trading with the EU without tariffs and barriers must continue and
that now is the time for the industry to hammer home the significance of
dairy.
 
Dobbin went on to highlight that the UK food
and drink industry is bigger than the car and aerospace industry combined with
73,000 UK families depending on the 14 billion litres of milk output from dairy
farmers.
 
The thinking and the messages from Dairy UK were
very clear, lets hope their efforts yield results and we dont end up on the
cliff edge in the spring of 2019.  At
least we now know we have a dairy organisation fighting our corner.
 
Yew Tree concludes its first 2 year
fixed price contract    (16th
June 2017)
This is certainly
the UKs first 2 year forward contracted farm gate milk price which, like Yew
Trees other volatility smoothing initiatives, has had a good update.  It has been taken up by a number of Yew Tree
Dairies ingredients farmers and backed off with the physical delivery and
contracts with customers, so zero exposure.
 
The contracts will
run until July 2019, so covering two more spring flushes, and at farm level
delivers is 29.028ppl less 1.7ppl haulage to nett 27.328ppl.
 
Yew Tree producers
have contracted to supply between 5% and up to 60% of their output and this
price certainly top trumps the average all prices figure for the last 2 years
(24.67ppl) and 3 years (26.66ppl) (www.milkprices.com)
 
Production and Markets  Update   (16th June 2017)
According to Datum
GB milk deliveries for week ending 3rd June 2017 were 1.5% below
those in the corresponding week a year earlier. 

 
Worldwide there is
no increase in milk production which is running more or less in parallel with
that recorded in 2016. 
 
Commodity wise all
prices continue to head North with the rise in butter prices has been described
as meteoric!  All eyes will be on next
weeks GDT auction with the expectation that once again all prices will increase.  This market is simply a commodity and fat
market driven.
 
Vegan
groups turn sour as European Court says not to Soya Milk and others    (16th June 2017)
The European Court
of Justice has declared that products advertised as milk, butter, cream, cheese
and yoghurt cannot be named as such if they are purely plant based.
 
This means in order
to use these words in advertising and marketing any milk/dairy product must be
derived from animals.  The courts
decision follows a German case.
 
Its a bitter blow
for the European Vegetarian Union and The Vegan Society and their mates, who
when asked to comment were all keen to put their own spin on the decision
rather than keep their heads down and lick their wounds.
 
0.5ppl
milk price increase for members of South Caernarfon Creameries (SCC)
co-operative
 from 1st July   (5th June 2017)
At a time when most, if not all, milk
purchasers are at best holding prices with most reducing Wales oldest dairy
co-operative, SCC, is bucking the trend and not following the pack with this 1st
July increase.
 
Alan Wyn Jones, MD of SCC, commented to Ian:
 
Cheese by-product returns on cream and whey
have continued to strengthen and the outlook on these returns remains extremely
positive.  On the back of these improved
returns its only right we pass this onto our farmer members
 
The SCC business has made significant
investment in recent years and is one of the few milk purchasers in a position
to attract and recruit new suppliers/members. 

 
The increase takes producers manufacturing standard
litre upto 28.53ppl and their liquid standard litre price to 27.57ppl (www.milkprices.com)
 
0.35ppl
and 0.28ppl milk price reductions for members of First Milk  from 1st
June    (5th June 2017)
Details as follows (www.milkprices.com):
 
0.35ppl              Midlands & East Wales (liquid
standard litre price of 25.80ppl)
 
0.35ppl              Scottish mainland (liquid standard
litre price of 25.49ppl)
 
0.28ppl              Lake District (liquid standard
litre 26.48ppl and manufacturing 27.43ppl)
 
0.28ppl              Haverfordwest (liquid standard
litre 27.25ppl and manufacturing 28.20ppl)
 
The First Milk B
price for May is 23ppl, June expected to be 24-25ppl and prediction for July
25ppl plus.
 
The reason given
for these price cuts is as a consequence of other milk purchasers reducing
their prices, which has adversely impacted on First Milks customer pricing
mechanism.
 
Markets continue to head North  (5th
June 2017)
Throughout May
dairy markets for butter, cream and AMF have been aggressively heading up and
this has continued into June and are now at their highest levels for more than
5 years.
 
Current spot milk
prices are now at 30ppl and in Holland and Italy are 31.5ppl (note this is with
4.4% b/f)
 
www.milkprices.coms UK Milk Futures Equivalent increased by an
eye-watering 8ppl in May to 35.39ppl for September 2017 delivery.  (Note, approximately 3 to 4ppl needs to be
deducted to give a realistic farm gate milk price equivalent.)
 
AHDB Dairy report butter
starting in early May at Ł3750 tonne and ending at Ł4800.  Cream started at Ł1700 and reaching Ł2200
tonne
 
Open Farm Sunday  This week 11th
June   (5th
June 2017)
LEAF has 350 UK
farms signed up for this weeks Open Farm Sunday in this, its 11th year.
 
As LEAF correctly
state its a fantastic opportunity for young and old to discover first hand
what it means to be a farmer.
 
Arla are the only
UK milk processor who provide financial support and sponsor the event and more
than 60 Arla member farms are opening their gates to the public this
Sunday.  A great effort and well done to
all who make this happen.
 
South Caernarfon Creameries (SCC) wins
the 2017 Dairy Food Provider of the Year Award   (5th
June 2017)
The award was voted
by members of the public and a real feather in the co-ops cap.
 
0.4ppl
milk price reduction for Arla members  from 1st June     (26th
May 2017)
This takes producers standard litre liquid
milk price to 26.65ppl and 27.73pl for the standard litre manufacturing price (www.milkprices.com)
 
The price cut is obviously unwelcome,
especially when it only applies to Arlas circa 2,500 GB members, however, its
GB members did avoid a cut as a result of the accelerated currency smoothing
payment, which neutralised a May price cut.
 
However, the NFU (England & Wales) appear
to have Arla in their sights and turning almost a blind eye to making any
meaningful comment on the practices and milk price reductions of other milk
purchasers, especially County Milk.  See
last weeks bulletin with 1ppl retrospective producer price cut.
 
As the biggest milk purchaser Arla should
expect to receive adverse press coverage when they drop the price, however,
numerous people are questioning why the NFU havent done a press release
lambasting County Milks 1ppl backdated price cut which effectively waves two
fingers to the Dairy Industry Voluntary Code of Best Practice and firmly takes
the industry back to the dark days, pre the code.
 
So whilst the NFU claim farmers are asking
whats going on reference the Arla 0.4ppl cut Ian can confirm others are
asking whats going on with regards to the NFU applying pressure
proportionally, especially when it comes to retrospective price cuts on which
it has simply made a passing remark.  The
NFU could do much better unless it has been silenced!
 
MCVE
& AMPE both comfortably over 30ppl   (26th May 2017)
The AMPE price for May is up 3.3p in one
month to 31ppl and the corresponding MCVE price up 1.5p to 33.3ppl.
 
Fonterra
price increase    (26th May 2017)
New Zealand dairy giant Fonterra has
increased its 2016/2017 farm gate milk price by 15 cents to $6.15 per kg MS as
a result of stronger world dairy commodity prices and is cautiously optimistic
for the future.
 
EU
milk out put is rising faster than budgeted    (26th May 2017)
March output is up just under 1% across the
EU and the growth is predicted to increase by significantly more than the
budgeted forecast increase of 0.6% for the year, especially for the second half
of 2017 where anticipated growth now expected to be 2%.  This would give a total 2017 increase of
around 1%.
 
Arlas
cheese isnt made from Monster Milk    (26th May 2017)
Arla has rattled some cages in Trumpland with
a racy and controversial advertisement on US TV promoting Arlas cheese as not
being made from cows which are monsters and given added hormones.
 
The advert depicts a six-eyed monster with
razor sharp horns and electrified fur representing a childs impression of the
hormone BST.
 
BST manufacturer Elanco has initiated legal
action against Arla demanding the advert be pulled but as of today its still
running and gaining more publicity everyday, which must be great news for
Arlas US cheese sales.  The jury is out
on whether the advert is pulled on the instruction of the authorities.
 
New
look to Belton Cheese branding   (26th May 2017)
Shropshire farm house cheese buyer, Belton,
has unveiled a new very distinctive identity under the name of Belton Farm with
a strapline Great British Cheesemakers
 
1ppl back dated milk price reduction
for County Milk suppliers  from May 1st     (19th May 2017)
This means County
have dropped producer prices by 3ppl in recent months and this latest price
drop has come as a very big surprise to producers because for those involved at
the sharp end of trading, like County, spot prices are now 26 to 27ppl having
risen from around 20ppl in less than 3 weeks. 

 
Despite all the
efforts of the NFUs and others to introduce a code of conduct its hardly fair
to hear back dated price cuts are still considered fair.
 
Farmers should
certainly be questioning any price drops beyond early May and for those
announced for June and even July, for example Dairy Crests two stage price
reduction, there must be grounds for farmers to insist these to be immediately
rescinded to demonstrate fairness and transparency.  The alternative is some purchasers risk being
tagged as opportunist Robin Hoods, especially for July and/or back dated cuts.
 
Its a certainty
some milk purchasers have made the wrong call with recent milk price drops and
should be challenged.
 
Cream income is
stratospheric and according to AHDB Dairy is worth 10.15ppl compared to only
4.62ppl 1 year ago an increase of 120% and cheese prices are rocketing north
this week.  Come on dont push through
price cuts just because you can.
 
0.5ppl milk price drop for Grahams
Dairies supplies  from June 1st      (19th May 2017)
This takes
producers standard liquid litre price to 26.25ppl (www.milkprices.com)
 
GDT
auction results   (19th
May 2017)
This weeks GDT
auction produced a 3.2% all products average index increase, which is the 5th
consecutive increase.  Out of the 8
commodities on offer 7 out of 8 recorded price increases and the average index
is now the highest its been for 3 years.
 
Key movers    (19th May 2017)
Butter               +11.2% to average US$5479
WMP                +1.3% to average US$3312
SMP                 +1.0% to average US$1998
Average +3.2% to average US$3313
 
UK product goes into Intervention     (19th May 2017)
According to AHDB
dairy UK produced SMP has gone into the EUs Intervention store for the first
time in 12 months during the first week of May with 1,132 tonnes taking total
EU stocks to an eye-watering 356,000 tonnes! 
Do not let anyone try to tell you that SMP prices are why price cuts are
needed because cream values are eclipsing that red herring.
 
The liquid milk merry-go-round kicks
in as Morrisons do some shuffling    (19th
May 2017)
Morrisons have
moved to sole supplier for all their own brand liquid milk, estimated to be
around 400 million litres to Arla from March 2018 for three years until
2021.  
 
Arla already had an
estimated 260 million litres and the 140 million litres which they gain from next
March is at the expense of Muller and is in effect the 140 million litres
Muller acquired as part of the take over of Dairy Crests liquid division.  
 
Whilst Morrisons
are unlikely to go to a segregated pool they are moving towards what some would
call a nominated pool with specific farmers nominated with whom Morrisons will
presumably want to engage in return for which additional funds will be paid to
the retailer.
 
The loss of such a
large quantity will be a blow to Muller as it would be to any processor.
 
More rides on the
merry-go-round are still on the cards with next up the outcome of the Lidl
re-shuffle followed by the big Aldi tender and in summer by the co-op group
(CTRG).  Nett milk movements during the
12 months ending April 2018 will undoubtedly leave some milk buyers smiling and
some crying over the spilt milk.
 
Dairy Crests year end results    (19th May 2017)
Dairy Crests
results show adjusted profit was up 5% to over Ł60 million (57.7m in 2015/2016)
with net debt up by 9% to Ł249.8m.
 
The dividend paid
to shareholders up 2% to 16.3p.
 
Dairy Crest shares
were trading at Ł5.80 a fall from the Ł6.16 briefly recorded on Wednesday.
 
Ulster Farmers Union retaliates
against Go Vegan Worlds anti-dairy campaign     (19th May 2017)
UFU President
Barclay Bell has no issues with the less than 1% of the population who for
whatever reason have decided to go vegan, however, their organisations
anti-dairy campaign targeting dairy farming systems is one-sided and unfair,
which the President has criticised on behalf of the 99%  plus of the population who enjoy eggs, meat
and dairy products.
 
Meanwhile, in the
US, an industry campaign called Undeniably Dairy has been launched to better engage
with consumers with clear transparent messaging about dairy products which has
and is currently twisted, distorted and misrepresented!
 
The campaign
realises that consumers are being spoon fed what is predominantly conflicting
inaccurate information often by anti-dairy groups.  The same could be said in the UK, especially
when it comes to facts on TB in cattle and badgers.
 
Fake invoices and forgery once again
in the Midlands     (19th
May 2017)
Its by no means
the first time middle ground family wholesaler J N Dairies has been the subject
of unlawful activities (2008) lies and propaganda (2014) and its returned to
their doorstep again.
 
No fair and honest
dairy competition in the Wolverhampton and Birmingham area thats too simple
and now its the return of doctored documents painting an untruthful image of
your honest and ethical supplier.  When
will these clowns learn this is not how the dairy industry operates in the UK?
 
Back in 2011 Johal
Dairies and J N Dairies were locked in a multi-million pound expensive high
court battle involving the theft of confidential information belonging to J N
Dairies in 2008 and an alleged bribe of Ł40,000 plus.
 
The end result was
that the court ordered Johal Dairies to pay J N Dairies almost Ł1.3 million in
relation to legal costs, damages and interest on top of which they had their
own costs.
 
Arla opens new Danish innovation
centre     (19th May 2017)
As part of its aim
to ensure a minimum of 10% of Arla UKs net revenue is derived from new
products Arla has officially opened its new innovation centre in Aarhus,
Denmark.
 
The site employs
150 people some of whom will, with respect, resemble Umpa Lumpas working on up
to 50 new ideas at any one time.
 
Arla in winning ways     (19th May 2017)
Arla have received
international recognition having been listed under two ingredients categories
in the 2017 Ingredient of the Year Nutra Ingredients Awards in Geneva, winning
one category and runner up in another.
 
0.5ppl milk price reduction for Muller
non-aligned suppliers  from 9th
June   (12th May 2017)
This reduces
producers standard liquid litre to 26.19ppl (www.milkprices.com) excluding the retailer supplement (see
below)
 
0.276ppl April retailer supplement for
Muller non-aligned suppliers   (12th
May 2017)
This will be paid
to Mullers non-aligned suppliers in addition to the standard price.
 
The consensus is that dairy markets
have turned the corner   (12th
May 2017)
Virtually all analysts
are convinced that the bottom of the market was reached in April and that the
UK farm gate milk price outlook for the remainder of 2017 is cautiously
optimistic.
 
GDT auction futures
and forward contract prices having stabilised are now showing signs of steadily
improving for most dairy commodities. 
This is encouraging news in spring and bodes well for the rest of 2017.
 
The FC
Stone/milkprices.com UK milk futures (UK MFE) price for April of 27.36ppl they
believe will be the lowest for the foreseeable future and May has already
seen the UK MFE average butter price increase by 150/tonne and SMP up a more
modest 10/tonne.
 
The 350,000 plus
tonnes of aged SMP Intervention stocks will one day be a problem.  If, or rather when, the Commission accept
tenders to release stock it will dampen farm gate milk price recovery.  Fortunately in 2017 limited additional SMP is
going into Intervention amounting to under 1,000 tonnes a week placed in store
during April compared to 15,000+ tonnes/week average in April 2016.
 
In a press release
NFU Scotland have called for stability in Scottish farmers farm gate milk
prices.  The press release points to a
realistic farm gate milk price of 27.5ppl depending on the milks end use based
on the fact that AMPE is at 27.7ppl and MCVE is at 31.8ppl.  All signs are pointing north.

2ppl milk price cut for Dairy Crest
Davidstow suppliers    (5th
May 2017)
Split over two
months with a 1ppl reduction from 1st June and another 1ppl from 1st
July.  Accompanying the announcement was
a pledge to hold the new July price for August and September.
 
First Milk May 1st price
reductions    (5th May 2017)
Details are as
follows:
 
0.1ppl               Midlands & East Wales (liquid
standard litre price of 26.15ppl)
0.25ppl              Scottish mainland (liquid standard
litre price of 25.84ppl)
0.35ppl              Lake District (liquid standard
litre 26.76ppl and manufacturing 27.72ppl)
0.35ppl              Haverfordwest 
 
The 0.35ppl
Haverfordwest liquid standard litre price will be 25.88ppl excluding the additional
Tesco cheese payment, which is expected to result in a standard litre price of
27.53ppl and a manufacturing standard litre price of 28.5ppl.
 
Muller sign up all 1900 suppliers bar
6!    (5th May 2017)
In what can only be
described as a remarkable 2nd round PR result Muller have confirmed
to Ian that only 6 farmers have not signed the new Muller contract.  Out of these only 2 are what Ian describes as
The Awkward Squad with the other four either retiring or moving away from the
Muller family.
 
So following on
from Ians current Dairy Farmer article the two Awkward Squad farmers are the
ones with a big call and a potential problem unless they have decided their
future is in not supplying Muller and they already have alternative options.
 
Consequently there
is unlikely to be any need for differential pricing for just two farmers on the
old contract and www.milkprices.com will presumably ignore and no longer refer
to either of the old Muller contracts. 
So far as Muller is concerned its a housekeeping job completed.

Scottish NFUs Vice President calls
for naming and shaming of BVD farmers who fail to take action  (5th May 2017)
Its a bold and
brave move but Gary Mitchell who is a dairy farmer and NFU Scotland Vice President
has put forward the suggestion that farmers who fail to eliminate cattle
persistently infected with BVD should be publically named and shamed.
 
According to Gary
and NFU Scotland there are 382 known BVD PI animals on Scottish farms and 140
farms have two or more PIs and one even has a staggering 24 PI animals on
farm!
 
Gary is suggesting
that if these farmers are unwilling to remove all infected animals their
details should be published and Ian would support this with publication in this
bulletin on a weekly basis if data protection permits it.  See below for very competitive BVD tags from
Potters.
 
No
reduction in EU SMP stocks in 8th tender    (28th
April 2017)
Once again no SMP sold in the recent tender
and stocks are indeed steadily rising and currently stand at 353,680 tonnes.
Current market prices for SMP are precariously close to intervention levels.
 
Friesland
Campina stand on for 3rd time    (28th April 2017)
Arlas biggest European competitor, Friesland
Campina, has held its producer milk price for the 3rd consecutive
month at an equivalent 29.24ppl based on the milkprices.com standard liquid
litre price (4% butterfat & 3.3% protein). Note, the rise in the value of
sterling has wiped 1ppl of this price which would have been 30.25ppl were it
not for currency movement.

1 Euro Cent (0.76ppl) milk price
reduction for Arla members is neutralized for Arla GB members     (25th April 2017)
From next Monday May 1st Arla has announced
a further 1 Euro Cent milk price reduction but this has been neutralised in
cash flow terms due to a decision by the UK Arla farmers board to bring forward
future currency smoothing benefits due to members July onwards.  The nett
effect is to cancel out the price cut at a time when cash flow is already tight
due to peak seasonality deductions and is a welcome move by the UK farmer
representatives and fingers crossed for the next Arla price move to be stand on
or up.
 
2 Euro Cent (1.52ppl) milk price
reduction for Arla Organic members is halved    (25th April 2017)
The accelerated benefit of July currency
smoothing has also been applied to the organic price reduction of 2 Euro Cents,
which means the net cash flow reduction will be 1 euro cent (0.76ppl) instead
of 1.52ppl for a standard liquid litre and on a standard manufacturing litre
the 1 euro cent reduction converts to 0.79ppl as instead of 1.58ppl both apply
from May 1st.
 
In a statement Arla commented that whilst the
organic dairy market is reasonably stable this adjustment has been necessary in
order to reflect current market returns.
 
0.296ppl addition for Muller non-aligned March deliveries retail
supplement    (14th April 2017)
Mullers non-aligned suppliers
will receive an additional 0.296ppl on all milk delivered in March
 
No takers at latest Dutch Dairy Commodity auction  
(14th April 2017)
According to a report in DIN,
the Dutch based dairy auctions online recorded no sales for a second 2017
auction for a total of 451 tonnes on offer. 
The minimum price set for SMP was Ł1680 tonne.
 
Meanwhile, SMP prices continue
to fall with prices, according to AHDB Dairy, trading at 1790 tonne just 92
above Intervention levels.  More SMP has
gone into Intervention from Poland, Germany and Lithuania with an additional
1200 tonnes going into already record quantities in store.
 
Arla confirms a 12 million Euro investment in baby powder    
(14th April 2017)
Arla has confirmed plans to
invest 12 million Euros to produce infant milk formula at its AKAFA site in the
north of Denmark.  The facility is
planned to be operational by August 2018 and interestingly with technology will
only create an additional 2 or possibly 4 jobs.
 
0.32ppl
milk price increase for suppliers aligned to the co-op Dairy (Muller)  From 1st May    (7th
April 2017)
This increase is for the next quarter May to July
inclusive and takes producers standard liquid price to 27.9ppl.
(www.milkprices.com)   
 
Crediton
Dairy stands on with its suppliers ex-farm gate milk price  until the 1st June which maintains the current standard liquid litre
price at 28.5ppl.  (7th
April 2017) (www.milkprices.com) 
Creditons B litre milk price will change from May 1st
to AMPE minus 2ppl as opposed to the current AMPE minus 1ppl.
 
1.25ppl
milk price cut for Barbers suppliers  From 1st
May     (7th April 2017)
This takes producers standard manufacturing/cheese
litre price to 29.05ppl and 28.85ppl for a standard liquid litre
(www.milkprices.com) 
 
0.75ppl
milk price cut for Pensworth suppliers    
(7th April 2017)
This takes producers standard liquid litre price to
26.5ppl. (www.milkprices.com)
 
0.4ppl
milk price cut for Meadow Foods suppliers  From 1st
May    (7th April 2017)
The reduction results in a standard liquid litre
price of 27.15ppl and a standard manufacturing (cheese) litre price of
27.53ppl.
 
Freshways
milk price cut is unknown but will be capped at a maximum 0.39ppl for May
suppliers       (7th
April 2017)
Freshways wrote to its producers on the 31st
March informing them of a May price cut claiming that all 5 companies which
make up the Freshways current basket have reduced their price.  
 
Ian has requested Freshways clarify which Companies
have reduced the basket price because as at the date of the letters Ian
believes a maximum of 2 out 5 have reduced their farmgate milk price (Arla and
Paynes).  Indeed the attachment with the
letter appears to confirm this.  The
price cut will not exceed 0.396ppl.
 
GDT
Auction average up 1.6%    (7th
April 2017)
Noteable movers were:
 
WMP up          
2.4% to average US $2924 tonne
SMP down      
0.8% to average US $1913 tonne
Butter down    
1.8% to average US$4751 tonne

Award for the most money raised for UK Cancer Charities      (7th April 2017)
 
Ian & Carole
scooped the award for being the team (English Bulldogs on Tour) which raised
the most money for the two Cancer charities in last weekends final Regis
Classic car Tour to Holland.
 
So a huge Thankyou
to the 62 readers who donated. Note a very significant proportion of the money
Ian and Carole raised was directed by readers to fighting Male Cancer.
 
Below is a
photograph of Ian & Carole receiving their Awards with organiser Ali Green
who has been key to the annual event for 20 years. Please note Ali isnt as
squashed and sandwiched between Ian and Carole as the picture perhaps
indicates!  Also attached is a great
photograph of the duo in action in their 1963 Mini Cooper S running along the
canal between traditional Dutch windmills.
 
Ian will confirm
how much they raised when the giving page closes but as at todays date it
amounts to Ł2,575 plus Ł314 Gift Aid. Total Ł2,889 with more money received by
cheque than on line.
 
Ian & Caroles
giving page will remain open for any last minute bulletin reader donations.

Background  -  Back
in 2015 Ian & Carole travelled to New Zealand and joined the Pork Pie
Charity Run (www.porkpie.co.nz) in a
classic Mini and raised Ł6,600 for charity.  This weekend the intrepid duo
have taken to the wheel again and have driven Ians 1963 Mini Cooper S to
Rotterdam for a weekend to raise money in the 20th and final
Regis Ladies Classic Car Tour.
100%
of your donations will go to the two charities named below, as Ian & Carole
are self funding all their own expenses, entry fees and accommodation.
This
final 20th Regis Classic Tour is supported by a host of
companies and individuals who have donated money, prizes, auction items and
services to help this group of ladies finish their 20th annual
tour with a bang.  During the past 19 years the tour has raised a
staggering Ł524,000. 
Ian,
more than anyone, fully appreciates how difficult the past two years in UK
dairy farming have been.  If you can dig deep and find a few spare pounds
it will all be very much appreciated.  Its not a competition who can give
the most but if you do value this regular bulletin and Ians monthly Dairy
Farmer article (now 26 years and still going) then please give a little to show
your appreciation.
The
event is not a charity challenge, but more of a non-competitive social weekend
with like minded classic car enthusiasts aiming to have a spring tour at the
same time as raising money for two great charities.  I doubt there is
anyone who is reading this bulletin who has not had at least one friend or family
member affected by cancer.
So
please sponsor Ian & Carole where you can, and don't forget you can
increase the amount you donate with Gift Aid (individuals only, not companies).

you all in advance. 
1ppl milk price drop for County Milk
Products Limited suppliers  from April 1st   (PRODUCER
NOTIFIED)     (24th March 2017)
This is the second
consecutive 1ppl price drop by County according to its farmer suppliers.  However, according to one source County are exposed
to the ingredients market via Yew Tree Dairy, which has certainly crashed back,
especially given the fact the SMP price is now close to Intervention
level.  The likelihood of spring milk
going into intervention stores to add to the existing 350,000 tonnes of old
stock is now almost inevitable for April.
 
County were
unavailable to confirm what their 1st April standard liquid litre
price would be following the 2ppl reduction, which we will endeavour to report
next week.
 
0.79ppl (1 Euro Cent) milk price drop
bombshell from Arla  1st April        (24th March 2017)
Around 2,700 Arla members/ owners  have
been notified that from April 1st their milk price will reduce by 1
Euro Cent equal to 0.79ppl.  The reduction will not apply to Arlas UK
organic suppliers although Arlas mainland Europe organic suppliers will feel
the full force of the reduction.
 
Of some comfort is the fact the currency
smoothing mechanism will provide a 0.37ppl increase resulting in a net
reduction of 0.42ppl.  The reduction reduces the 1st April
standard liquid litre price, including the currency smoothing adjustment, to
27.03ppl and for the standard manufacturing litre to 28.13ppl.
 
Its a big blow to Arla members and
regrettably if Arla sneeze others will catch a cold.  Pretty much everyone
in the industry had expected (or prayed) for a stand on price for April and
May, which with the filtering through of the currency smoothing would have seen
farm gate milk price increases.  This cut will hurt.
 
There are strong rumours that a similar
reduction is already in the pipeline for May 1st coupled with the
belief that Arla have overpaid producers for milk, especially the recent 13th
payment.  If another cut happens on May 1st
Arla will struggle to deal with their farmer communications to justify a second
cut.
 
The Arla cut could easily kick start a trend
which others seize if it does it will be the final straw for a number of dairy
farmers who havent even begun to recover from the last slump in prices.
 
Meanwhile, the Arla brands have been named as
recording the largest growth out of the top 100 UK grocery brands achieving
growth of Ł37m in 2016.
 
Arla members are already questioning whether
achieving such headline grabbing brand growth is actually delivering a better
milk price to the farmer owners given that in cheese some of its competitors
are now paying 30ppl for milk, which is going into branded cheese.
 
GDT
average up 1.7%  (24th
March 2017)
 
The most notable price was the dramatic drop in
SMP of 10.1%, which followed a 15.5% drop only 2 weeks ago.  
 
The GDT average price for SMP has crashed by
an eye watering 24% in just one month.
 
Key movers were:
 
WMP                +2.9%
to average US$1948/tonne
Cheddar            +1%

SMP Intervention tenders halved as
interest plummets   (17th
March 2017)
The latest EU
Commission SMP intervention stock tender resulted in just two bids for only 136
tonnes compared to bids for almost 20,000 tonnes in December.
 
The current two
tender windows each month will be reduced to one and there seems minimal
prospect of any product coming out of store unless the EU Commission
significantly reduce their minimum price.
 
First Milk add to their trophy cabinet   (17th March 2017)
Last night First
Milk won Nestle UKs Supplier of the Year Award as well as a Nestle Quality Award,
both collected by Mike Gallacher.  Both
are viewed as further ringing endorsements that the co-op and its members are
on the right track with its major customer.
 
50 Muller suppliers to battle it out
for 21 forum places    (17th
March 2017)
Healthy competition
is the order of the day in some of the Muller farmer forum regions with 50
candidates competing for 21 places. 
Ballot packs will be sent to members next week with the elected board to
be insitu next month when their task will be to represent 1900 Muller
suppliers.  Lets hope the 21 selected
have ability to represent their area and its not noisy ones with confidence
but little ability.
 
TWO DAIRY CEOs STEP DOWN WITHIN DAYS
OF EACH OTHER    (15th March 2017)
 
1.     Mike Gallacher steps
down as First Milks CEO  Turnaround Job Done    (15th March 2017)
Mike Gallacher is to step down as First
Milks CEO and turnaround guru in April and into his shoes will step Shelagh
Hancock.
 
Its a near as damn it 2 years to the day
since Gallacher was parachuted into First Milk and at the time the co-op was on
life support and at best only weeks away from the life support machine being
turned off.  It wasnt quite as bad as DFOB but it was looking like a sick
dog which needed putting out of its misery.  The dairy industrys vultures
were circling all eager to pick over the carcase but none wanted to be first to
swoop in.  It was a badly run business and the one thing the First Milk
board did get right was to re-shape, re-group and give Gallacher a free hand.
 
As Gallacher leaves, he hands over a very
different business and whilst it will still have to operate profitably in a
challenging environment its a fact today there are other UK dairy businesses
in worse shape than First Milk.
 
Its unusual to see dairy CEOs involved in a
smooth planned succession but this is one such case.  Normally its a
sacking dressed up with lots of spin.  
 
Gallachers successor, Shelagh Hancock, has
25 years of experience having been involved with the First Milk business for
almost 12 months.  She has previously worked for Glanbia, been a key
figure in Milk Link until the Arla takeover and latterly Medina Dairies. 
 
Shelagh is essentially a co-op person and
will steer First Milk on the same course Gallacher has set with little, if any,
need for a change in direction.  There is already at least one new
opportunity on her desk for her to explore and plenty of stuff to keep her
occupied.
 
Its almost 2 years to the day since
Gallacher took charge and he certainly can claim to have turned around the
First Milk business much to the relief of its members who have seen their co-op
go from life support to being discharged and sent home in less than 2 years.
 
Next week the two commence on a GB member meeting
tour to inform members of the turnaround results, direction of the business,
current milk field issues (especially the Tesco field connected to the
Haverfordwest factory), farm contract developments/ideas and the opportunity to
meet their new CEO.
 
2.     Ronald
Kerrs to leave Muller   (15th March 2017)
The departure of Ronald Kerrs as CEO of
Muller and the arrival of Uwe Sommer doesnt appear to have been on the cards
for months and part of a smooth succession plan.
 
Kerrs came to Muller in 2012 initially as
Head of Muller UK before taking the position of group CEO in 2015.  He has
certainly made his mark so far as the UK dairy industry is concerned having
been involved in the Dairy Crest liquid business takeover as well as building a
new butter plant at Market Drayton.  On May 1st Sommer steps
into one of the most important dairy roles in Europe having left his role as
Head of International Marketing at Lindt Chocolate.
 
GDT auction price crashes back 6.3%    (13th March 2017)
Tuesdays GDT
auction results were very sobering with an average all products drop of 6.3%
(to average $3512 tonne) on top of the 3.2% fall only two weeks ago so heading
towards a 10% fall in two weeks.
 
Key prices were
(all in US$ not NZ$)
 
SMP                 down     15.5% to average $2118 tonne
WMP                down     12.4% to average $2782 tonne
Cheddar            down     4.2%
to average $3435 tonne      
 
Traders anticipated
a further weakening of prices, particularly for WMP and SMP but the double
digit drop came as a shock.  The auction
prices were the lowest recorded for over 5 months and for many New Zealand
dairy farmers the price for WMP is now at or below their breakeven COP if the
auction price is a good barometer.
 
Total tonnage
traded was up 9% to 22,328 tonnes, which undoubtedly contributed to the
dramatic drop, especially given the fact the quantity on offer at the same
auction in previous years has declined.
 
0.74ppl February retail supplement for
Muller non-aligned farmers    
(13th March 2017)
 
Ł3.5m investment
programme by Medina   (13th
March 2017)
The
Ł3.5m investment programme has already commenced at Medinas Watsons liquid
dairy facility in Hampshire, where 96 farmers supply milk to a factory
employing 95 staff plus an additional 25 or so new jobs to be created during
the coming 6 months as a result of the upgrade.
 
First Milk extend its
Nestle supply contract    (13th
March 2017)
First
Milk has confirmed it has concluded an extension of its exclusive Nestle liquid
milk contract.
 
The
contract has been in the custody of First Milk for more than 14 years (2003)
and not doubt there were numerous resident cuckoos keen to kick First Milk out
given half a chance, because they appear to be raiding other nests with
feathers flying as Ian writes this piece!
 
Arla confirm the 13th
payment @ Ł9000 per GB farmer member  
(7th March 2017)
Arla have confirmed that its 2500 GB members
will receive a 13th payment averaging Ł9000 into their bank accounts
this Friday.
 
Unfortunately, the Arla press release
referred to the Ł31 million distribution as a windfall and a cash bonus
which has certainly prompted an instant response from several Arla
members.  As one said, this choice of words (windfall & cash bonus)
suggest that this is money for nothing.  
 
The payment is actually a return on farmers
investment in the co-op and the straight forward facts appear to be as follows:
 
Average fully paid up Arla member producing 1
million litres has 7.5ppl invested      Ł75000.00
His average 13th payment paid this
Friday                                                 Ł 
7300.00
Return                                                                                                               almost
10%
 
Conclusion  This part of the Arla model
works in terms of return on the money invested and a benefit of being a
member.  Thats the simplified message and lets hopes that.
 
We sincerely hope that DEFRA and AHDB ensure
last years fiasco is not repeated. Last year in early April Ian described the
joint effort involving AHDB and DEFRA as irresponsible and misleading when the
February average farm gate milk price was published as rocketing up by 2.48ppl.
 
This was achieved because DEFRA allocated the
entire Ł22million 13th payment to Arla members to Februarys
milk price rather than spreading it over the 12 months as Arla do. It was a
move which was lambasted by both Ian and the TFA.

New cheese plant on the cards for
North Wales     (6th March 2017)
Ronald Akkerman (AKA The Flying Dutchman) is
back on the UK dairy industries radar this time to design, build and operate a 40
million litre a year capacity state of the art cheese factory in North Wales on
behalf of a group of around 20 spring grazing farmers who intend to form a
co-operative
 
The initial plant is expected to be up and
running by spring 2018 (?) with plans to expand towards 100 million litres.
 
The output from the plant will be focussed on
domestic consumption rather than exports with all sales through Bradburys
 who have an unrivalled 130 years experience in selling cheese. 
Further details are anticipated in the near future.
 
Muller to offer futures contracts   (6th March 2017)
A Muller Ingredients Contract is to be
launched to suppliers this summer to its 800 or so non-aligned farmers.
 
The contract will give farmers the
opportunity to lock into a margin on up to a quarter (25%) of their milk
production by fixing their milk price based on the ww.milkprices.com/FC Stone
published prices/UK Milk Futures Equivalent (UKMFE).  
 
Volumes available will be limited to the
physical quantities Muller can secure back to back contracts with its
ingredients customers.  In other words, all Mullers farmers contracts
will be backed off with reciprocal contracts with customers.
 
ASDA launches a free range
milk/Pasture Promise branded milk    (6th

ASDA is the first

promise that the milk comes from herds which spend at least 180 days and nights
grazing.
 
ASDA has launched
with an initial 70,000 litres week going into more than 100 ASDA stores priced
at Ł1.50 for 2 litres.
 
RABDF outlines its future focus and
industry event    (6th March 2017)
Following the
disappointing decision in October last year by Holstein UK when it rejected
working with RABDF with a view to holding one national dairy event, RABDF has
reviewed and re-grouped and today announced its plans for the future.
 
There will be no
Livestock Event at the NEC on September 6th 2017. Instead there will
be a smaller annual Dairy Technical Event at Stoneleigh Park in February.
 
There is no
disputing that technology is transforming our lives and changing all businesses
worldwide, including dairy farming.  The
RABDF event will focus on new technology with technology themed seminars and
speakers from across the world.  The
event will examine the potential of new technologies and how dairy farmers
might take advantage, benefit and profit from the latest developments and
innovations.  RABDFs focus is to
transfer the latest technological ideas to grass roots dairy farmers with an
event in central England.
 
In addition, RABDF
will continue its influencing and lobbying role utilising its links to
politicians, policy makers and the trade as well as focussing on encouraging
youth into the industry.  To this end a
youth board will be formed and RABDFs work with Women in Dairy initiativeand
its conference will continue.  There is
even a rumbling that the once sold out and popular RABDF Farmer Conference
might emerge from the ashes in middle England, where there is currently nothing
similar available in England or Wales.

month.
 
This world isnt big enough for the
both of us  theres only milk thats going to win!    (6th March 2017)
The Australian
dairy industry has declared war on non-dairy alternatives to milk such as soy,
almond, coconut and rice stating they should not be called milk because they do
not have anything close to the nutritional health protein or vitamin benefits
of animal milks.
 
They claim its
mis-labelling and that these alternatives should be labelled and branded to
ensure consumers know exactly what they are putting in their shopping baskets
or whats going into their almond plant liquid lattes.
 
Its time there was
a crack down.  Come to think of it whats
all the nonsense about vegetarian sausages, vegetarian burgers and vegetarian
rashers of bacon!
 
Studies show soy milk can destroy your
thyroid     (6th March 2017)
Soy milk is
recognised as coming almost exclusively from GMO which are high in pesticides
and an alarming list of properties leading to claims that you simply should STOP

In a recent study
its claimed soy milk causes severe health problems, including colon cancer, ulceration,
gastrointestinal inflammation etc.

0.38ppl
milk price increase for Arla members  from 1st March     (24th

This takes producers standard liquid litre milk
price to 27.45ppl and their standard manufacturing/cheese litre milk price to

Muller
unveils its single supplier milk contract 
(24th February 2017)
Around 1900 Muller will soon receive the
final version 2 of the processors supply contract and its clear that Muller
have taken on board producer feedback from last Novembers farmer meetings and
revised the offering.
 
There is no doubt one single contract for all
its suppliers is the way forward and whilst the new offering will see some
farmers win and some lose it is claimed the overall package is cost neutral to
the business.
 
The forecast accuracy tolerance has been
increased from 5% to 7.5% prior to any penalty. 
That relaxation should be welcome news; however, Mullers intention is
for the few farmers who fall outside of the 7.5% threshold to have one to one
support from Mullers Agriculture team to help ensure all 1900 farmers are
under the penalty threshold.  Surprise
milk volumes are certainly not an issue confirmed to Muller.
 
The butterfat penalty has been reduced from
0.035ppl in version 1 of the contract to 0.025ppl for every 0.01% less than 4%
and identical payment of 0.025ppl for every 0.01% above 4%.
 
The contract notice period is only 3 months
following a price change or contract variation compared to the old Dairy Crest
12 month notice period.
 
If a farmer wants to expand by more than 10%
he simply needs to have prior (that means prior to spending any Ł) early
engagement with Muller so both parties know when the extra milk will
materialise.
 
Milk payments into the bank will be around
the 18th of each month and this is a midway point between the
current Muller and ex-Dairy Crest payment dates.
 
Finally, individual farmers can utilise the
online modelling software to check how the contract affects their individual
production.
 
The new contract starts on May 1st
with the target sign up date of April 21st.
 
Overall Ian has failed to find any trip wires
or traps and the likelihood is most producers will sign the new contract if
they feel it is fair and they want to join Muller on its ambitious UK journey
and are inspired by Mullers vision.  If
any Muller farmers believe Ian has overlooked any key points please email him.
 
Arla
hunting for milk but Arlas CEO claims rising milk supply keeps prices in check    (24th
February 2017)
Arla has written to its UK members stating it
requires more milk, initially from existing members.  The letter has produced a very mixed response
from Arla members who have contacted Ian today. 
In summary, most state they have not even started on the road to
recovery following almost 2 years of low milk prices at below COP and have
minimal appetite to ramp up production in case prices ease again.  
 
Its
certainly a confusing message from Arla with its CEO Pedar Tuborgh stating
 
"Milk prices are currently at a level
that is sustainable for the whole business, including our farmers," he
said.
 
And according to one report he has also stated 
 
a rising supply of milk on world markets
is likely to rein in further gains in prices that have increased nearly 50
percent since a slump last year.
 
Its certainly a mixed and confusing message
from Arla HQ and Arla UK which members are trying to sieve through.
 
Thats an individual decision but from Arlas
point of view if they do require extra milk existing members must be offered
the chance to fill the gap.  Failing that
Arla will presumably move to Stage 2 and open the door to new recruits to see
what the appetite is.
 
Arla
UK sales and revenue down    (24th February 2017)
Arlas largest market, the UK, has seen its
2016 calendar year results weigh in with a 12% drop in revenue to Ł1.86billion
(2.2billion) down from the 2015 numbers of Ł2.2billion (2.5billion).
 
Within the numbers Arlas UK branded products
saw sales volumes rise by an encouraging 7.6% with branded liquid milk growing
by 12%. 
 
Morrisons Milk for Farmers accounted for 15%
of sales within its competitors on the shelf and Arlas yoghurt sales were up
116% more than double but from a standing start in 2015.
 
Arla Foods as a European co-op saw net profit
grow by a healthy 20.7% to 356m.
 
 
NFU launches a new contract checking
facility     (24th
February 2017)
The NFU, in
conjunction with its panel of legal firms, has launched a contract checking
service for members in the hope they use the facility prior to signing a new
contract.
 
The service comes
in three stages:
 
ˇ        
A free
initial discussion with the NFUs CallFirst Specialist Advisers team,
available to all NFU farmer members
ˇ        
An
initial report produced by an NFU legal panel solicitor considering members
requirements, reviewing the contract and explaining what it means
ˇ        
A
more detailed review with advice on how to renegotiate the contract terms.
 
The service covers areas such as milk
contracts, grazing licences and tenancy agreements.  Its an opportunity for NFU members to seek
professional help and guidance prior to signing on the dotted line.  Its not free but the first 50 LAS
subscribers who take up the offer will be given a Ł100 voucher towards the fee.
 
At this weeks Dairy Breakout Session during
question time Ian suggested that given the fact 1900 Muller farmers are about
to receive a contract to sign and that the NFU Dairy Board Chairman had
commented that it seemed to be a reasonable and fair contract and agreed that
it demonstrated that Muller had listened to its Producers, would the NFU  consider putting out a press release specific
to this contract rather than having dozens or possibly 100s of farmers
individually contacting them for an opinion. 
The idea is understood to be under consideration and the NFU are
expected to give some help to the Muller farmers with their general view of the
new contract.
 
NFU Conference     (24th
February 2017)
Brexit dominated
this weeks NFU Conference and whilst those negotiating on behalf of UK
agriculture will battle for our industry to receive the same level of support
post Brexit as we receive today, most are bracing themselves for a haircut and
a sea change in who receives help and how its delivered.
 
The Environment
Secretary, Andrea Leadson, was keen to point out that 
 
there will be support for our vital food and
farming industry after we leave the EU 
 
but she didnt
confirm what sort of support, how much support or for how long it would last.
 
With 86,000 farmers
receiving BPS payments and these payments representing 50% of the average
farmers income its a near certainty that such payments will not continue at
this level going forward in the next decade. 
The CAP payments were worth Ł3.5billion to the UK in 2016 and will be
very challenging to defend post Brexit.
 
The loss of these
payments would trigger significant consolidation at farm level as many farms
become unviable and unsustainable.  There
were a number of reasons to view the post Brexit dairy industry with enthusiasm
and optimism, especially for those who are low cost milk producers wanting to
expand because if the BPS payments are cut or even axed more land is sure to
become available.  Some were privately
licking their lips at the prospect.

Mullers new farmer representative
structure is in train and the elections are set to be very competitive    (20th February 2017)
Having taken on
board feedback from a nationwide series of meetings last November, Muller has
launched its new farmer representative structure ahead of confirming any
changes to its single contract launch.
 
Democratic
representation appears to be what all parties want and to that end these are
the nuts and bolts of the structure.
 
A Muller Farmer
Forum of 21 supplying farmers will be elected by its 1900 or so farmer members,
which will be roughly 1 per 90 farmers. 
This is split in proportion to the aligned v non-aligned farmers as
follows:
 
9 non-aligned
farmer forum representatives
11 aligned farmer
forum representatives
1 organic farmer forum representative
21
 
The positions will
be for a 3-year period by rotation.  The
forum will have complete responsibility for deciding the future representative
structure with nothing ruled out and they could even consider setting up a DPO.  Basically the 21 farmer members start with a
clean sheet of paper.
 
On the subject of
annual subscription to fund development, training and independent advice it
will be up to the newly elected 21 forum representatives to decide on what
level this should be set at, if any, although its clear if independent advice
is required it needs to be funded. 
Muller has confirmed that initial start up funding will be provided by
Muller until additional funds flow into the forums bank account.
 
Once in place this forum
will elect a board of 7 MMG Board representatives to work closely with the
Muller management.
 
For obvious reasons
of continuity an interim board of 7 will be put in place and it will take 3
years before the forum can say all board members were put in place by the
forum.  However 3 of the existing MMG
Board members will immediately by rotation stand down in June of this year
followed by 2 in 2018 and 2 in 2019.
 
The eventual
outcome should be much better communication from grass roots farmers to senior
management.
 
Its time for
Muller farmers to put up (or shut up) and those interested in standing need to
throw their names in to the hat by March 3rd for a nomination form
to be returned by 13th March and by early April the forum members
should be in place.  Whilst Muller is
tight lipped over the number of nominations they have already received they
have confirmed that there will be elections in several regions, which is a
healthy prospect and bodes well for the future.
 
Code of Conduct with advance notice of
interest rate changes needed for Bankers (spelt with a B)    (20TH February 2017)       
The UK dairy
industry has committed a lot of effort and energy into ensuring all milk
purchasers abide by a Voluntary Code and give advance notice of price movements
and move away from discretionary milk pricing.
 
The same does not
appear to apply to our bankers following the recent decision by Investec Bank
to retrospectively cut its deposit interest rates.  In fact, in their terms and conditions it
states Interest rates may, at our discretion, change.
 
And we all thought
the banking world has cleaned its act up.

Stand on milk prices for March 1st (3rd
February 2017)
            Muller                           (26.69ppl)
            Crediton Dairy    (28.5ppl)
 
With volumes
increasing almost daily, cream prices back almost 25% in just over a month, the
weakening of butter prices and SMP prices combining all of these with a half
decent Spring its likely March 1st increases will be the last for a
while. Most farmers will be praying the surge in production is curtailed
because the way these markets are heading the next price move could easily be
South. Current spot prices for milk are around 26ppl and hovering and if any
producer is not already on 30ppl its a near certainty they wont be for many
months to come.
 
Milk production is still down   (3rd February 2017)
Whilst daily milk
production is estimated to be down 3.8% compared with 12 months ago at around
32 million litres a day (source AHDB) milk is now starting to flow and impact
on forecast deliveries and on European commodity buyers appetite to purchase.
 
Welcome pay-out for First Milk members  (3rd February 2017)
After a difficult and challenging two years
First Milk has announced that its monthly milk payments to members will revert
to normal terms meaning members receive 6 weeks milk money during February.
 
The delayed payments for January
deliveries for which part would have been part paid in February and part in
March will now all be paid in full in February.  Sorting the payments has
cost First Milk Ł6 million in total.
 
The deferred payment started in January
2015 when First Milk had to use farmers money to manage cash flow and paid 50%
on the 24th of the month following supply and 50% on the 10th
of the month after.
 
Its another encouraging sign as to how the
Co-ops fortunes have improved and CEO Mike Gallacher has commented that this
draws a clear line under the turnaround process for First Milk. Job done 
not really but its now down to the mundane day to day stuff.
 
Arla to invest Ł37.5 in the UK (3rd
February 2017)
Arla is to invest a
further Ł37.5 million (44 million) in its 13 UK sites/logistics in 2017
representing a 50% increase compared to its 2016 commitment.  The figure is part of a Ł285 million global
Arla investment. 
 
The goal for Arla
is to move more milk from bulk into brands and improve the profitability of
the farmer owners

move up to 28.11ppl (www.milkprices.com)
 
Lack
of SMP sales from intervention stores is concerning     (27th
January 2017)
Everyone admires a strong seller, especially
when its someone like the European Commission. 
However, their recent third tender involving 7,500 tonnes once again
resulted in no sales of intervention SMP and it looks as if they could have completely
mis-read the market.
 
During three tenders the Commission have only
succeeded in selling 40 tonnes out of a total public stock of more than 351,000
tonnes.
 
Ian has been informed that there is a shelf
life for the SMP and that significant quantities will have to be sold shortly
and if that combines with a levelling off in SMP prices, or even a dip, the
Commission could quickly turn from being a strong seller to an emergency
seller, which will result in most ex-farm gate milk prices catching a chill,
including those in the UK.
 
Not to mention that its not impossible that
there could be calls for further intervention this spring if the market
suddenly dives.
 
Dairy
markets have passed 12 oclock with spot prices down to 26 to 27ppl     (27th
January 2017)
Following a period of rapid upward movement
in dairy trading prices, spot milk prices and futures contract prices its clear
commodity prices are at best levelling off and potentially about to head
south.  Spot milk, which is only a
barometer with relatively small quantities traded is down from 40/41p to
26/27ppl.
 
Dairy commodity prices have eased as on farm
deliveries show signs of increasing not to mention the firming of currency and
the fact cream is struggling to find homes.
 
Freshways have confirmed a rumour that one or
more of its producers under notice to leave them on February 1st
has, at the 11th hour, contacted Freshways in a bid to rescind his
(their) notice within days of ceasing to supply the firm.
 
It will be very interesting to follow whether
farm gate milk prices continue to increase in coming months.  Several milk purchasers gave reasons why
there was a lag in prices moving up so will the same lag apply to prices
levelling off or coming down?  A levelling
off and period of stability for all involved will be no bad thing at this
stage, especially if that stability comes with a farm gate milk price around 28
to 30ppl.  The biggest fear is that we
get an early spring with oceans of milk, which will exert serious pressure on
farm gate milk prices.  Where this market
will end up is anyones guess but on todays evidence its easily passed 12
oclock and looking like it could be about to head south.  You have been warned.
 
Changes
at Muller     (27th January 2017)
Lyndsay Chapman has stood down from her roll
as Agriculture Director of Muller by mutual agreement.  Lyndsay joined Muller from Dairy Crest a year
ago when Muller acquired Dairy Crests liquid division.
 
Rob Hutchinson has taken over the position
with immediate effect.

New
MD at Medina    (20th January 2017)
After one year out of the UK dairy industrys
front line Mike Sheldon, former MD of Dairy Crest Dairies is back, this time as
MD of Medina Dairy.
 
Sheldon was a casualty of the Muller
acquisition of Dairy Crests liquid business and the move to Medina looks a
perfect fit for both parties.  His 22
years of experience with Dairy Crest is likely to bring new ideas to the Medina
board meetings.  He was instrumental in
Dairy Crests adoption of a DPO and the Dairy Crest formula contract both of
which have been axed by Muller.
 
Meadow
results are impressive   (20th January 2017)
Meadow Foods Limited have published their
annual report and financial statements for the year ended 31st Mach
2016 and the financials are impressive in a year when the majority of Meadows
550 supplying farmers and most non-aligned producers were unable to cover cost
of production having to eat into any available cash reserves.
 
Given the worldwide collapse in dairy product
values there is no surprise in the fact that Meadows turnover was down 40%
from Ł376million to Ł228million, however, profit before tax was only down 15%
from Ł14.2million to Ł12million (Ł22,000 per Meadow supplier).
 
However, Meadows profit margin increased
from 3.8% to 5% which is some achievement to maintain your margin in a
collapsing market.
 
The dividend pay-out to shareholders of
Ł3million means MD Simon Chantler for the second consecutive year or more
appears to be the best paid person in the UK dairy industry with a total
pay-out for the year of Ł2.3million slightly down on the previous years packet
by Ł20,000.  No one could confuse him
with the nursery rhyme character Simple Simon.
 
These results no doubt encouraged Paine &
Partners to make their significant investment in Meadow in September 2016.
 
Details will come out in future published
accounts; however, based on these numbers one knowledgeable bean counter is
speculating the total value of the Meadow business at the time of the Paine
& Partners deal could have been in the region of Ł100million.

could you please email us with the name and version.  Thanks, Ian

Iceland,
Medina, Buckleys and FFA    
(13th January 2017)
There were a couple of inaccuracies in last
weeks story connected to the decision by Iceland to switch litreage from Arla
to Medina from 1st April 2017
 
The actual literage involved is 35 million
into Iceland, London and not the 100 million litres Ian was told from two sources.
This means from April 1st Medinas total literage contracted to
Iceland increases to 60 million.
 
Secondly, Medina, along with several other
milk purchasers who use basket pricing, have seen  their suppliers find it
extremely difficult to cope with the one month time lag before farm gate prices
have moved up.  Consequently Medina injected more money into supplying
farmers pockets, including Buckleys farmers.  Note, the same time lag
benefitted farmers when prices dropped much slower.  Medina have confirmed
that like others they are reviewing their basket pricing.
 
The basket price for December deliveries to
Buckleys was 21.42ppl to which Medina added a further 1ppl support to give
22.42ppl. 
 
For January it will be 23.48ppl plus 1ppl to
total 24.48 with the February basket already at 25.77pp and hopefully rising.
 
 
In a nut shell the claim made to Ian that
Buckleys paid 20ppl or less for December deliveries and by default one of the
lowest farm gate milk prices in the UK was inaccurate. In addition none of the
Milk for the enlarged contract will come from Buckleys Suppliers and will
come Medinas Southern sources. 
 
We apologise for this inaccuracy and hope
this clarifies the position and correct numbers.

this clarification and apology does not impact on David Handleys planned

Oxford
Farming Conference accused of snubbing British potato growers   (6th
January 2017) 
 
Whilst Ian did not attend this weeks conference
the key point relayed to him from the days events related to the lunch menu
and nothing from the coach load of ministers, MPs, SNPs and industry bigwigs
who took the stage.
 
Instead of offering delegates a lunch with a
humble British baked potato (or similar) the Conference caterers were
alarmingly permitted to offer couscous, which has its origins in Israel with
pasta shaped rice grains you simply add water to.
 
The offering might be healthy but if the
caterers had wanted something you add water to they should have put out a real
British potato product and offered the delegates and earth people Smash  For
Mash Get Smash
 
The aliens and earth people catering at The
Oxford Real Farming Conference were left smirking at this gaffe knowing they served
British potatoes to British farming delegates at their Conference.  Come on Oxford you could have done better.

First
Milks half year results are encouraging    (16th December 2016)
In the space of 20 months under the captaincy
of Mike Gallacher, First Milk has seen a dramatic turn around in its fortunes
having moved from a position of how many weeks will it continue before its the
next DFOB, Westbury or Amelca to ranking its member milk prices alongside and
indeed in some instances ahead of its main competitors e.g. Arla and Muller.
 
Its six month trading results to 30th
September released this week include the following:
 
Operating profits up to Ł9.2 million
(compared to Ł1.2m 2015)
Profits before tax were up to Ł6.8 million
(compared to a loss of Ł2.4m in 2015)
Bank debt had fallen to Ł26.1 million (vs.
Ł46.1m in the prior year)
 
Once appointed, Gallacher immediately got his
surgical instruments out and sold First Milks loss making side lines and
subsidiaries including Glenfield Dairy, CNP Professional and its stake in
Westbury Dairies to focus on making quality cheese.  Thats what First Milks future depends on
because the big hit items have been dealt with and its down to the day to day
work in which any cheesemaker with a batch of down graded cheese costs serious
money.  Having said that, in times of
shortages, like today, rejects in the cheese world will be scarcer.  According to First Milk and others, the
quality of cheese First Milk are producing is consistently high and long may
this continue.
 
According to First Milk in the period since
Gallacher took the reins to cut out the dead wood and loss making areas his
programme has delivered Ł33m improvement in business performance including a
Ł2.3m reduction in its wage bill.
 
RPA
claim 68% (Ł822 million) of SFO already paid   (16th December 2016)
According to the RPA in the first 10 banking
days of December it paid 59,000 English farmers a total of Ł822 million with
the aim of paying 90% of eligible claims (this word eligible leaves some
wriggle room) by 30th December.
 
Direct
Milk DPO (Muller) formula contracts end at 31ppl plus    (16th
December 2016)
Having operated since April 2013 the Direct
Milk DPO formula contracts adopted by some Muller non-aligned come to an end on
January 31st at between 31.378ppl and 31.188ppl following a January
1st 1.298ppl increase.
 
Following a decision by  Muller to serve  12 months notice on producers to end the
formula options as soon as they acquired the Dairy Crest liquid business almost
a year ago.
 
Over the period of almost four years the formula
has paid producers on average 29.03ppl based on a liquid standard litre which
represents an uplift of 2.5ppl over the equivalent non-aligned average price of
26.55ppl.
 
More importantly the January formula price is
within only 0.3 to 0.2ppl of the current AMPE price of 31.5ppl.
 
Its a blow to non-aligned who signed up to
it because it was an option they had rather than having to rely on
discretionary pricing?  New ideas,
opportunities  and alternatives for
Muller non-aligned are sure to emerge in 2017.
 
From 1st February those on the
contracts will revert to the Muller standard litre price of 25.44 (January
price) plus any retail supplement.

Nick Holt Martyn sums up the situation
in two sentences    (9th
December 2016)
In The Dairy
Groups latest release headed Farmgate Price Is Lagging Too Far Behind the
Market  Nick Holt Martyn wrote the following, which requires no further
comment:
 
On a monthly basis the gap between markets and the
farmgate is as wide as at any time.  With
markets getting to 32ppl a recovery to 28ppl is now overdue .  Failure to pass on market returns is doing
serious damage to farmers businesses and will set back farmer/processor
relationships.
 
AHDB Dairy apologise for their major
mess up   (9th December 2016)
Following
widespread publicity and criticism AHDB Dairy have issued an apology following
their unjustified criticism of Morrisons Milk For Farmers:
Milk for Farmers 
Published 2 December 16
Recent AHDB analysis on Morrisons
Milk for Farmers range, which was used in an article in The Grocer, may have
given the impression that AHDB was critical of efforts by Morrisons and Arla to
improve returns to dairy farmers.
AHDB would like to apologise if this
was the case, and would like to state it welcomes any retailer initiative that
benefits farmers and aids consumer choice. AHDBs usual internal checks and
balances were not followed on this analysis due to an internal error.
 This in no way reflects on the journalistic standards of the Grocer and
we apologise for any misunderstanding.
Whether the matter
is closed and filed depends on the outcome of further meetings involving
Morrisons, Arla and the Arla AMBA Board all of whom intend to hold AHDB to
account and it will be a miracle if the above apology is the end of the matter.

Cows and Catastrophes  The Flights
and Fancies of a Cornish Dairy Farmer by Brindley Hosken   (9th December 2016)
Its the story of
one dairy farmers 35 years of milking cows but it certainly doesnt feature my
old friends, Doom & Gloom, and does have some witty farmer humour and is
well worth reading.
 
In 2010 Brindley
took the heart breaking decision to sell his herd and in the book he talks
through the family emotions of that decision as well was the effects of
TB.  When asked, would he start dairy
farming again?  Id rather stick pins in
my eyes.
 
Its a worthy
stocking filler and the print is fairly large, Ł9.95 from Old Pond Publishing.

Muller
pause for thought on new contract and representation    (2nd
December 2016)
Muller have now completed their first 2016
nationwide series of meetings and have received some thought provoking feedback
on its proposed new milk contract and farmer representation particularly from
its non aligned farmers.
 
The turnout has been around 1,000 of the 1900
farmers supplying the Company and some of the views have been described by
Muller as strong and for sure Muller are now more in touch with the views of
their suppliers.  Consequently they have taken note and have decided to
delay introducing the new contract until into the New Year with
the expectation that farmers will sign from February onwards. Some non
aligned clearly wanted Muller to pull back but at least a pause and
reflect means changes might be factored into the final version.
 
There are still numerous important questions
to be answered and addressed both with the proposed new contract detail and the
new representation structure which will hopefully become clearer during this
month.
 
Undoubtedly one of the issues Muller has
faced has been the timing of the two changes given the fact the non aligned
Muller farmers are rather frustrated and aggrieved at the slow pace of upward
movement in their milk price which for December is a standard litre price of
under 23ppl (22.94ppl) excluding retail winter supplement payment estimated to
be 1.4ppl.

Improve Rural Broadband by making ISP's

December 2016)
Rural
Broadband speeds in Rural areas  are unacceptable. There is no incentive
for Internet Service Providers to improve performance - (they get paid the full
monthly fee whatever the download speed) - they are not accountable and need
government intervention to improve.
In many
rural areas rural business, farms, pubs, shops and private homes endure download
speeds of less than >1mbps. In this day and age in our digital world this is
disadvantaging rural business and communities. Our children are set school
homework on-line and cannot access broadband to research it. Our businesses
cannot operate

1.49ppl (2 Euro Cents) milk price rise
for Arla members  from 1st December (25th
November 2016)
This takes
producers standard litre price to 24.63ppl.
 
The price increase,
whilst welcome, will be significantly below what many had hoped for and to that
end disappointing to remain one of the lowest in the UK.
 
In an unusual move
Arla have declared that they anticipate similar upward price improvement for
January 1st.  Such forward
projections are unheard of and indicate that negotiators have made their point
that prices have to rise and clear signals sent to farmer members.
 
1.49ppl (2 Euro Cents) milk price rise
for Arla Organic members - from December 1st     (25th November 2016)
This takes
producers organic standard litre price to 40.18ppl.   
 
3ppl milk price increase for suppliers
to Freshways  from 27th November    (25th November 2016)
This takes
producers standard liquid litre price to 25.05ppl.
 
However, the plan
is that any Freshways producers who have served notice to leave and supply another
processor (mainly Yew Tree Dairies AKA Woodcocks) will not receive the 3ppl and
will remain on the old Freshways basket price contract assuming they dont
rescind their notice.  Clearly during
2017 and at the earliest opportunity Freshways intends to abandon a farm gate
milk price set by a basket of competitors some of whom today are dragging their
feet big time!
 
This approach is
nothing new and was taken by First Milk in 2010 when then Chairman Bill Mustoe
stated we should recognise the value
of committed volume and therefore future price increases will only apply to
members who are not under resignation.
 
At that time there
was lots of talk about discrimination, unfair trading practices and it being
unreasonable but according to Ians notes nothing came of it and to be fair
Mustoe had a point reference loyalty and commitment.
 
The fact those who
rescind their notice will be offered the extra money is considered a bribe by
at least one Freshways producer who is under notice.  Needless to say he is furious.
 
2.5ppl milk price increase for
suppliers to The Fresh Milk Company (Lactalis)  from 1st January    (25th
November 2016)
This takes
producers standard manufacturing litre price to 28.47ppl.  (www.milkprices.com)
 
28.47ppl guaranteed minimum 2017 farm
gate milk price from The Fresh Milk Company (Lactalis)    (25th November 2016)
Lactalis have
nailed their colours to the 2017 farm gate milk price most having underwritten
the minimum milk price the company will pay producers at 28.47ppl based on a manufacturing
standard litre.
 
If prices head
further North, producers will benefit and at least the move provides some
welcome stability for the full 12 month period. 
On a liquid standard litre price the equivalent guarantee is 27.5ppl.  The move has no doubt been triggered by the
resignation of several FMC producers who are heading to supply Yew Tree Dairy
(AKA Woodcocks).

Muller faces frothing in its
non-aligned milk pool  plus  Muller
makes cost savings a major focus as losses reach Ł106 million    (25th November 2016)
Two headlines from
two different articles in The Grocer Magazine, which numerous Muller
non-aligned and many others claim are linked. 
Muller lost Ł97.8m with its UK & Ireland business in 2014 and in
2015 those losses have increased to Ł106million.
 
Note, the
additional losses cannot be attributable to the acquisition of Dairy Crests
liquid business which didnt complete until only 5 days from the year end on 26th
December 2015.
 
Many are now
pointing the finger to the suspicion that Theo Muller understandably wants a
return on his investment and has sharpened his teeth.
 
There will be
limited scope for Mullers much loved retailer aligned contracts to reverse the
losses given they are effectively toll processors for the supermarkets.
 
So that leaves the
poor non-aligned farmers fearing they will be the weakest link and the ugly
sister who will face further downward pressure including significant contract
changes currently on the table.
 
Some farmers are
claiming that Muller producers will stand up and be counted and have their say
but history suggests they will huff and puff but they are unlikely to stop a
determined Muller army of generals and puppets.

Farmers milk to be sold by ASDA from
Dale Farm    (25th November 2016)
ASDA is the first
supermarket to sell branded farmers milk giving consumers the option to pay an
extra 25p per 4 pint carton with all the additional money going directly to
1300 dairy farmer members of Dale Farm.
 
The new milk went
on sale in 16 ASDA stores on Monday of this week in both whole and semi
skimmed.
 
How long will it be
before AHDBs market intelligence plus any other industry vermin put pen to
paper criticising and belittling this latest initiative.  Heaven knows AHDB have caused unnecessary
carnage with their criticism of the Morrison Milk for Farmers, which has now
negatively attracted the attention of The Telegraph and The Express and The
Times.

EU report talks of victims and unfair
trading practices    (25th
November 2016)
Ian doesnt go big
on reports originating from the European Commission, however, the one released this
week by its Agriculture Markets Task Force titled Improving Market Outcomes 
Enhancing the position of farmers in the supply chain is worth a mention
 
A large number of
GB farmers currently facing new contracts and/or significant variations in their
contractual terms as well as those on low milk prices should try to find time
to read the report or at least the opening 4 page Executive Summary.
 
It looks at the
realities of the new post milk quota world, which is labelled as a more market-orientated CAP.  It goes on to flag up and confirm the well
known fact there is a concern that
farmers  are becoming the main shock absorber in the supply chains as regards
market risks such as price volatility or prolonged periods of low prices.
 
A number of non-aligned
liquid producers would say they are the last domino in the pack and first to
fall over.
 
The report also
highlights what it calls the fear factor farmers face if they wish to
complain about a milk purchaser and the suggestion that victims of unfair
trading practices (dairy farmers) should be able to lodge anonymous
complaints.  If that happens Ian wont
receive all the juicy information because it will be directed to the
Commission!

Muller under fire
from its non-aligned suppliers  (18th
November 2016)
Ian has been somewhat alarmed to receive a
large number of emails this week from Muller non-aligned farmers who were very
keen to report back from 4 of the first 5 regional producer
meetings.  Rarely, if ever, has Ian received so much feedback, in
fact. Given the fact there are several more meetings during the next 10 days
Ian has decided to wait to see what comes in next week, and will discuss the
comments and Mullers proposals in the next bulletin, so please continue to
send in your comments.
 
The meetings have certainly welded opinion in
the Muller non-aligned producers and several have subsequently hit the
keyboard. Literally. Several will now have big holes where the letters M,U,L,E
and R once were.
 
The Muller staff and board members present at
the meetings have certainly been given some very direct messages. The general view
from the emails received is that the non-aligned see the contract changes as
being nothing more than a price cut, heaping further pain and unfairness upon
them. 
 
Ian will also comment on the proposed new
producer representation structure and whether it is a step forward,
particularly with reference to the non-aligned producers representation within
the group of 21 and whether they will be represented, which the board of this
group will select.
 
The Grocer Magazine on-line has summed up the
situation with a very forthright article, written by Kevin White, with the
headline Muller facing frothing in its non-aligned milk pool. The
article points towards Muller pushing more of its own risk on to its 800
non-aligned farmers with the new contract. With Muller purchasing 30% of
Britains milk this is a big issue and there will be many column inches written
on the subject over the coming weeks and months.
 
GDT auction up 4.5%   (18th November 2016)
Tuesdays auction
produced another set of encouraging results with the overall product index up
4.5% compared to that recorded two weeks ago. 
All products delivered increased in value, however, note the volume on
offer was down 13.8% to 23,902 tonnes to that traded two weeks earlier.
 
The reduction is
mainly attributable to Fonterras confirmation that milk volumes have plummeted
during October (-14% and November)
 
Notable movers
Cheddar            +11% to average $3697 tonne
SMP                 +9.8% to average $2562 tonne
WMP                +3.2% to average $3423 tonne
 
Ian Potter, Grahams Dairies and the A
& B deduction scheme   (18th
November 2016)
During the past two of weeks I have commented
on the A & B contracts, in particular in relation to processors who make
milk price deductions to producers who, for various reasons, fail to deliver
their full A litre allocation in a particular month.  With the decision by Freshways to abandon A
litre deductions the focus moved north of the Border to Grahams Dairies, in
Scotland. In late October I was quoted in The Scottish Farmer saying
that Grahams suppliers were given no notice of the A litre deductions. Grahams
has asked me to clarify that it did give notice that there could be A
litre deductions when they introduced the scheme in 2014 and the fact that A
deductions were on the cards was also mentioned in a letter to Producers dated
17th August.  I accept this point and have offered my apologies
to the company for inferring otherwise.
 
My comment regarding the lack of notice
centred on the information that Grahams suppliers were not notified that A
litre deductions were on the cards for October deliveries until a letter was
posted in mid October. However I have now been told that there will be no
October deductions. This is excellent news for Grahams suppliers and a very
positive step forward.
 
I also stated that the Grahams B Price was
cut to 7ppl which was what Grahams told me it would be in July 2015. However
having made enquiries I am now informed that the lowest price paid was actually
10ppl.
 
As part of Grahams robust defence of
the business in the face of negative publicity I was provided with milk
pricing figures from the company. The figures stated that the net average paid
out to its farmers (including A and B prices) from October 2015 to September
2016 was 23.61ppl compared to its main Scottish competitors, Arla, Muller and
First Milk who, according to the numbers I was given, ranged between 22.77ppl
and 17.47ppl. I duly had these other figures checked by independent dairy
analyst Chris Walkland, who has confirmed that the Grahams figure is accurate
and the Arla and Muller figures, while not an exact match to his, are close
enough. He did not analyse the First Milk figure. 
 
Thus Grahams have, overall, paid what appears
to be the highest 12 month average nett pay-out to dairy farmers in Scotland
  even with the B scheme. Grahams claim that the A & B scheme
has succeeded in protecting their farmers milk price does, therefore, have
merit.
 
However I believe that, despite this, the A
& B scheme has not been well communicated by any of the companies who
adopted it, including Grahams, and that the scheme has too many negatives
attached to it. This is especially the case when compared to the simplicity of
other companies who pay a single price for ALL of the litres, even if their
headline price is not be as high as the A price would be. The effectiveness of
the A & B deduction scheme can also easily be disproportionate across
different farmers, with major unintended negative consequences on their
businesses, again not helping the image of the scheme.
 
A & B contracts were believed to be
ground-breaking when they were first conceived in 2014 but back then no one
envisaged the current scenario whereby A litre deductions of 7 to 8ppl or more
could be applied. A lot of time and effort went into the development of the new
contracts but I believe that it is time to evaluate the pros and cons and
either refine them significantly or revert to alternative mechanisms. The risk
of bad press and farmer discontent on an A or B price
deduction outweighs the value. Grahams have today confirmed to Ian that
they are reviewing their A and B contracts on a one to one basis with producers
to canvass their thoughts which is a positive time consuming move by the
company which will give farmers the opportunity to have their say.
 
The bottom line is Grahams, like all other
milk purchasers, have to balance supplies against sales and in the space of 14
months the spot price has varied from 10p to 41p making balancing extremely
challenging. For Grahams the variation for them in that period has been from
20% (2 million litres) of milk above the A volumes (AKA B milk) to now,
where production is 8% (1 Million litres plus) below A volumes. 
 
It is a priority for the industry that a
long-term solution to these swings must be found. But it is my view that the A
& B system requires further reform if it is to have a role in that going
forward.
 
Dairy
farmers in Northern Ireland vent their anger  (18th
November 2016)
An estimated 250 or so dairy farmers in
Northern Ireland have had enough and have agreed to strike.  Part of their frustration is the lack of
upward movement on farm gate milk prices in addition to anger at the stances
taken by Dairy UK in connection with its decision to cease engagement with the
Ulster Farmers Union.
 
The group stated After the news this week that
Dairy UK (NI) have blocked future engagement with the UIster Farmers Union
over their criticism of the failure of co-ops to pass on better milk market
returns to farmers, the contempt and arrogance that milk co-ops now have for
their producer members is totally unacceptable and should result in co-op
farmer board members requesting their co-ops withhold levies for now.
 
Strong words but the only surprise is perhaps
that it has taken this long to boil over.

WMP
GDT auction average jumps by 20% in 2 weeks    (4th November 2016)
The worlds barometer of demand for dairy
products, the GDT auction, has clocked up an eye watering 19.8% average for WMP
to average US$3317 tonne.
 
SMP average was up 6.5% to average US$2329
tonne and the overall all products average for this weeks auction was up
11.4%.  Lets hope its a sustainable
upward trend and not a spike.
 
Freshways
abandon A litre undersupply penalties leaving Grahams exposed   (4th
November 2016)
Freshways and its farmer representatives have
agreed that under the present circumstances all A litre under supply penalties
will be cancelled and they have backdated this to 1st October,
which has been extremely well received by its 180 or so farmer suppliers and
its customers. Note, this is not a temporary amendment to the contract
but a permanent change.
 
Freshways have recognised that when the A
& B contract was introduced a situation whereby some farmers could suffer
huge financial penalties was never planned or envisaged. The move to scrap it
has sent a clear message to Freshways suppliers that the firm is listening to
farmers and keen to retain their supply by supporting them. Good on Freshways. 
 
According to our records this leaves Grahams
Dairies of Scotland as the only UK milkprices.com listed milk purchaser who,
from October 1st, is penalising/deducting significant amounts of
money from any of its farmers who fail to fulfil their A litres by what is
currently an eye watering several pence per litre figure. There is a real
possibility that there will be more on this story, as the issue is sure to run
and run with a lot of questions being asked by Grahams suppliers, competitors
who wish to seize on the controversy and potentially try to mop-up any
disaffected suppliers, and by customers who are keen to see their processors
treat their farmers fairly and well.

1.5ppl milk price increase for

First Milks A price for November will be finalised and announced within
the next 7 days.
 
Grahams producers claim the goalposts
have been moved   (26th
October 2016) 
Grahams Dairies
Scotland were last featured in this newsletter when they dramatically dropped
their B milk price to only 7.5ppl and in doing so sending a very clear message
to its suppliers that it simply did not want any B litres.  Farmers instantly responded by culling cows,
cutting feed and cutting milk production. 
In the past week, some have claimed that they also signed up to the EU
milk reduction scheme, which started on 1st October.  And now another shock has come because
Grahams producers have received a bombshell letter - AFTER the 1st
October! -  informing them that FROM
October 1st any producer who failed to fill their A litres would be
financially penalised!
 
For some it appears
to be the final straw, who are still getting A litres at 22p, which is below
their cost of production.  Some were
furious and arranged a get together to meet fellow suppliers and to send a
clear message to the Graham family as to how they feel about the treatment they
are receiving.
 
Freshways are struggling with angry
loyal producers    (26th
October 2016)
According to
numerous emails Ian has received, Freshways also have significant numbers of
dissatisfied suppliers, many of whom claim to have already handed in their
notice.  In summary, most, if not all,
claim they are not being treated fairly and are being held to ransom by a
combination of their milk buyer and their contract. 
 
Most claim they are
selling A litres at below COP, however, Freshways will not allow them to
cut their losses and exit the industry with dignity, instead insisting they
must give a minimum of nine months notice.
 
So irrespective of
whether its ill health, poor profitability, old age, or simply that the
farmers have had enough of what they call exploitation, its producers cannot
stop milking.  No longer, apparently, can
the Freshways farmer decide when he can sell his cows and even a TB breakdown
is not a valid reason to exit dairy farming. And yet Freshways can serve notice
when they like, as happened a few months ago!
 
In addition, along
with Grahams Dairies (see above), Freshways are one of only two dairies we
know who penalise farmers for failing to fulfil their A litres.  
 
One claimed that
when his A price penalty was added to his A milk price he is still receiving
18ppl for October deliveries.
 
Its clear that
Freshways are approaching a crisis and that they will not retain their current
180+ suppliers and could find it very challenging to attract new replacement
producers.  
 
Non-aligned aggrieved producers  What
can they do?    (26th October 2016)
The discontent
among non-aligned farmers is growing significantly. But what can they do about
their position? In simple terms they can bite the bullet and resign and thats
possibly the only language some processors will understand.  They shouldnt pay lip service to their
neighbour threatening to resign if things dont improve, they should resign
themselves, and resign now!
 
If you feel you are
being exploited and/or treated unfairly by your milk buyer, take charge of your
own destiny and do something about it. 
Please dont let your milk purchaser demoralise you and your family any
more.  Dont let them cripple your
business further and under no circumstances let them promise you jam tomorrow.
 
If the trust has
gone and the relationship broken down, change buyers or get out - even if it
means you have to sell your milk for a slightly lower price for the time being
to a milk purchaser who you trust and thinks is fair.
 
Its jaw dropping
that individual, hard working, honest dairy farmers who are considered the
backbone of the countryside cannot chose whether they exit the industry.  Even some of those who opted for the EU milk
reduction programme now find that the money is simply going to their milk purchaser
in the form of A litre penalties, which is surely not as the EU Commission
planned and from a moral and ethical point of view has to be questioned. 
 
We are in yet
another crisis and as I have said before, dont fall for promises of jam
tomorrow or little tweaks to your contract, because its gone beyond that with
some buyers.
 
Its demoralising
and its exploitation. If some milk purchasers are now concerned over their
future milk supply then I have no sympathy. 
They have made their bed and need to be made to lie in it.
 
One farmer has even
informed me that his milk purchaser suggested that his single farm payment
would soon be in the bank suggesting that that would be his saviour.  Little did he realise that all of that money
is already spoken for.
 
Its time the
Government got stuck into the tactics of some GB milk buyers and looked in to
their contracts in detail.  Whether its
a job for the Groceries Code Adjudicator or for someone else is one for the
future but some producers need urgent help to ensure fair play. And that
requires a referee in one form or another.
 
Australias milk production continues

Meg wins in a mans world      (26th October 2016)
Congratulations to
Meg Elliott for winning the British Farming Awards award of Auctioneer of the

30ppl October milk price Yew Tree Dairies (AKA
Woodcocks)   (17th October 2016)
Yew Tree has confirmed suppliers on its ingredients contract will

4ppl total milk price increase for suppliers to The
Fresh Milk Company (AKA Lactalis) from 1st November & 1st
December   (17th October 2016)
The precise reasons behind The FMCs seismic price increases could be
debated but the fact is its producers should be pleased with the latest
announcement.
 
The total November 1st increase has been increased to 2ppl
with an additional 2ppl from December 1st.  This is the 6th consecutive
monthly increase amounting to 8.5ppl since July.
 
The business is optimistic for further 2017 farm gate milk price
increases assuming returns for its cheese continue to improve.
 
The increases result in the following manufacturing standard litre
prices (www.milkprices.com)
 
23.8ppl November & 25.88ppl December

October 2016)
This results in a liquid standard litre price of 28.616ppl (simplified
formula contract) and 28.808ppl (core formula contract).  The formula has delivered 4.237ppl in the
past 4 months and with only two months left until Muller axe both contracts it
looks like the contracted price could finish up at 30ppl or more which will be
them going out on a high!
 
1.25ppl + 0.25ppl milk price increase for suppliers to
Joseph Heler Cheese  from 1st
November    (17th October 2016)

Sooty & Sweep are under attack from their
non-aligned poor relations   (17th October 2016)
A group of enterprising and active Muller non-aligned farmers have kick
started a campaign based on the fact Sooty and his three friends on the MMG
Board, all on aligned contracts, are failing to represent their interests and
appear to only be accountable to Muller.
 
Clearly they do not intend to sit back and take whats gratefully thrown
their way.  Those wanting to join the
group are asked to email mullernonaligned@gmail.com
 
As one industry leader commented to Ian This is a smart move by Muller
non-aligned who are taking their own initiative due to the complete absence of
consultation and/or leadership from Sooty & Friends.
 
Minimal co-operation from Holstein UK   (17th October 2016)
Negotiations to merge the RABDFs Livestock Event and UK Dairy Day into
one National Dairy Event (identical to the one RABDF ditched) have sadly ended
in no resolution after 15 months of discussions.
 
The fact two of our dairy organisations have failed to agree on a way
forward to hold one national event is damming. 
As one industry leader emailed to Ian, what hope is there for the UK
dairy sector when even out own internal organisations are unable to
co-operate!
 
From the evidence presented to Ian, Holstein UKs board slammed the door
shut in RABDFs face last Tuesday. 
Statements made by Holstein UK as to the reasons they have terminated
discussions are rather limp and at best good excuses.
 
For example, its a bit rich for Holstein UKs CEO Richard Jones to
detail one of the main reasons for Holstein UK pulling out being concerns about
RABDFs financial position given Holstein UKs former CEO was found guilty of
pocketing Ł240,000 of its funds and sentenced to 2 years in prison.
 
The RABDFs planned September Event is likely to need life support but
it will be exhibitors who have the final say as to which event, if either,
succeeds.  Will they support the RABDF at
the NEC or will they support the aggressive upstarts in Holstein UK?  It seems inevitable we will only have one
September Dairy Show and to that end Holstein UK may be successful but its a
very sad state of affairs the two organisations couldnt agree.
 
Nick Everington exits as RABDF CEO with no retirement
party   (17th October 2016)
There was no surprise at the announcement that Nick Everington had left
his position as CEO of RABDF after 15 years, however, the notice to members was
jaw dropping and contained more spin than a childs spinning top.
 
According to RABDF, Mr Everington has retired but the announcement
allegedly came some time after he had left his desk for the last time.  Few, if any, will believe this is retirement
and most will be convinced that his determination to move the very successful
Dairy Event to a July Livestock Event date, which spectacularly bombed, is the
main reason for his sudden retirement. 

 
Had RABDF stuck with a National Dairy Event in September there is little
doubt former events co-ordinator, Richard Evans, would not have gone to
Holstein UK to set up a rival Dairy Day.
 
One area Nick Everington can claim to eclipse Holstein UK on is the
matter of show fixing.  Everington was
shoulder to shoulder with the Great Yorkshire Show on the matter whereas Holstein
UK appear to bow to pressures from breeders with serious financial interests in
showing and insisting on the ability to fix and cheat at shows both home and
abroad.
 
The image of the UK dairy industry will be seriously damaged one day if
Holstein UK continue to turn a blind eye to fixing and fail to police their own
show rules.
 
Ridiculously Cheap Milk   (17th October 2016)

to be 2ppl taking the total non-aligned price to an estimated 23ppl.
 
1.25ppl milk price increase for suppliers to Belton
Cheese  from 1st November   (30th
September 2016)
This takes producers standard manufacturing litre price to 23ppl. 
 
1.25ppl milk price increase for suppliers to Glanbia
Cheese  from 1st November    (30th
September 2016)
This takes producers standard manufacturing litre price to 24.29ppl.
 
1ppl milk price increase for Arla Directs  from October 1st    (30th September 2016)
This takes producers liquid standard litre price to 20ppl
 
1ppl milk price increase for suppliers to The Fresh
Milk Company (Lactalis)  from 1st
November PRODUCER
NOTIFIED    (30th
September 2016)
This takes producers standard manufacturing litre price to 22.77ppl.
 
Clock this AMPE = 28.5p & MCVE = 32.4p    (30th September 2016)
According to the latest figures from AHDB MCVE stands at 32.4ppl and
AMPE at 28.5ppl.
 
This means the MCVE value is up 60% (12.1ppl) in 12 months and AMPE is
up 67% (11.5ppl).
 
40% less dairy farmers in Western Europe by 2026   (30th September 2016)
One of the outcomes presented at the recent IFCN Conference in Holland
predicts the next 10 years will result in 40% of Western European dairy farmers
exiting the industry.
 
In addition, ICFN predict an increase of 25% in the global demand for
dairy products in the same 10 year period, which means an annual demand
increase of 2.3%.
 
European milk reduction scheme almost 100% taken   (30th September 2016)
The Commissions surprise move to introduce a milk reduction scheme
paying farmers 12ppl for reducing milk production between October 1st
and 31st December has seen a 98.9% uptake for the first periods
allocation.
 
In total 52,000 farmers applied, including almost 13,000 from France,
10,000 from Germany, with the UK coming in 3rd place with
applications for 112 million litres from 1,800 farmers, which represents 10% of
the total EU uptake.
 
Of the total 1,800 UK farmer applications, 154 came from Scotland.  
 
It is now clear that some milk purchasers have left it too late to
reverse the fall in winter milk production, currently running at 7.7% down on
the same period a year ago, and with spot prices almost at 40ppl few will have
any sympathy with processors who have completely mis-read the market signals.

Fonterra increases its forecast farm gate milk price   (23rd September 2016)
Fonterra has announced a 50 cents forecast farm gate milk price to $5.25

September 2016)
Muller has confirmed it plans to invest an additional Ł100m in its UK
facilities, innovation and marketing.
 
In a statement Muller comment:
 
What underpins all of this is our desire to increase consumption of
valued added dairy products, which are made in Britain from milk produced by
British farmers.
 
Its part of Mullers 2020 vison plan to unlock an additional Ł700m of
potential category growth in the UK dairy sector by 2020.
 
To put the Ł100m into perspective its more money than Muller paid for
Dairy Crests liquid business.  The area
of product innovation is perhaps one of the most exciting areas Muller plan to
invest in with the aim of bringing to shelves new ways for consumers to consume
our British dairy products.   
 
12.23ppl to cut milk production  (16th September 2016)
Details of the European Unions dairy package have been publicised, in
particular, the 150 (Ł127 million) incentive for producers to cut production
at a rate of 12.23ppl.
 
Its very tight for producers to apply for the first window, which closes on Wednesday
next, 21st September at 11am, and will be for a 3 month reduction
period 1st October to 31st December 2016 with other
windows to follow until the money is fully subscribed.  According to Dairy Market Weekly, any farmer
who applies for the first reduction period may also apply for the fourth period
assuming there is still money in the pot.
 
With many producers facing an October milk price of under 20ppl if they
do qualify it looks like a case of less = more. 
Less milk = less work = less invoices = less pain and more money.
 
The total Ł12.7 million fund has a maximum subscription literage of 1.04
billion litres across all member states.
 
Applications are via the RPA website https://www.gov.uk/guidance/milk-production-reduction-scheme-how-to-apply
 
Spot milk at 37ppl and rising but Arla say no to 5ppl
winter premium  (16th September 2016)
There are really only two forces in the current extremely hot GB spot
milk market.  The two buyers who are
hoovering up virtually all available spot milk are Muller and Arla.
 
Both deny they have any short or medium term supply problems yet both
are buying up spot milk like it was the last in the world.
 
To farmers supplying either of them at 19ppl to 20ppl this will be a big
disappointment to learn that both processors find it economical to fill any
shortfall with spot milk as opposed to paying a higher winter milk price to
encourage existing suppliers to churn out more milk.
 
Spot milk is currently around 37ppl and tipped to hit 40ppl by the end
of September.
 
So far as Arla members are concerned it is now confirmed that its farmer
BOR put forward a proposal in July for the co-op to pay a 5ppl winter
supplement on the additional litres a farmer delivered over and above the
litres delivered in the corresponding month last year.
 
This was done in the full knowledge Arla were on course for a winter
milk supply shortage.  Guess what?  The idea was thrown out by the Arla board on
the basis one countrys producers could not be seen to receive such an
incentive and that it was better to deal with supply problems via high prices
in the spot market.
 
As several Arla members are calling for national pricing convinced the
one size fits all with a single Arla farm gate milk price is unsustainable.
 
Yew Tree Dairy (AKA Woodcocks) launch their farmers milk futures trading  (16th September 2016)
Ian has been involved in discussions concerning the benefits of dairy futures
contracts since 2009 and its taken until this week for a farmer futures
trading contract to be made available.
 
Out of a crisis usually comes some good and solutions and there can be
no doubt that the Woodcock families dairy farming experience , the fact they
have milked cows and their close relationship with many farmers who have turned
to Woodcocks to save their dairy farming business has spurred them to look for
alternatives.  Remember when many farmers were dumped by their existing
milk purchaser and had nowhere to go, Woodcocks pledge was to offer a home for
their milk.
 
Thats part of the Woodcock family offer.  They have alternative
outlets for milk from retail to commodity and ingredient outlets and now its
supplying farmers have the option to lock into a margin and trade a percentage
of their milk on futures. The bulk of the work to get to this stage has come
from a team  effort involving Stephen Bradley of www.milkprices.com ,  FC Stone and  Carl Woodcock. 
 
This week farmer suppliers listened to presentations from both Stephen
and Carl and the opportunity for farmers to trade and lock into a margin
 is expected to commence in early October. 
The meetings were well attended particularly the one in Ayr which was
standing room only and Stephen Bradley commented that it brought back memories
of the huge interest generated when the DCD  Formula contracts were
launched 
Some farmers may be large enough to take out single contracts however it
is expected that the majority of Yew Tree suppliers will see Woodcocks group
farmers together into squadrons in order to fill futures contracts.  All
contracts will be backed off at farm level in order to protect a farm margin it
is recommended a futures feed contract is taken out.
 
Farmers decide what percentage of their milk they forward sell and its
clear that doing nothing and making your dairy business suffer the pain of
recent months is a huge gamble but trading futures and locking into a margin is
a safety belt. For some this way of doing business could potentially be a life
line.
 
Now its a case of ensuring the Yew Tree farmers who are keen to trade
are futures ready and thats in hand.  We believe it will work and the
likelihood is that other processors will be forced to offer similar schemes to
help insulate their farmers from some of the price volatility extremes.
 
Its a big project but the Woodcock family are never phased by the size
of the project and only focus on the outcomes.  All eyes will be watching
how their famers get on as we move into 2017 with what is a new, exciting and
different way to lock into a margin for future months/years.
 
In the US, dairy farmers have to use these risk management tools to
justify expansion and investment and to demonstrate they are globally
competitive.
 
 
Vote for the female who takes control of farmers for
breakfast (16th September 2016)
When I was livestock auctioneer I worked with a young girl called Meg
Elliott.  When she stood on the pig
rostrum with me she told me she wanted to become a livestock auctioneer  I was
sceptical and curious as to how she would get on in what was a mans world.
 
During the past 25 years she has gained, particularly dairy farmers
trust and respect.  She is an inspiration
to other women to step onto the rostrum with a gavel and to take charge of an
auction.
 
So it came as no surprise to me when I heard Meg was one of five
auctioneers shortlisted for the Auctioneer of the Year Award.
 
I hope as many of my readers of this free weekly dairy bulletin will
spend 30 seconds and click on this link and simply tick the box to vote.  The top vote is Meg Elliott and with your
help thats where she will be when voting closes at the end of this month.
 
Please vote now because in Ians eyes she is not only the number 1
British female livestock auctioneer, she is now on course to top trump four men
and rise to the very top of her profession by winning this award.

Paine
& Partners buy a significant share of Meadow Foods   (12th
September 2016)
A significant share of Meadow Foods is now
owned by US private equity firm Paine & Partners, who have purchased the
35% shareholding owned by the Pickering family plus part of the Chantler
familys 65% shareholding.  The deal has
taken around 12 months to conclude following an initial approach to Simon
Chantler from Paines.
 
For the staff, management and executives at
Meadow Foods its business as usual with all staff retained under the same
managerial control.  For the Meadow Foods
farmer suppliers its also business as usual. 

 
For the business it will be a major game
changer because Meadow Foods are now catapulted into the big boys playground when
it comes to acquisitions and expansion given the capital backing and fire power
Paine & Partners bring to the table. 

 
It will be interesting to see where the new
business makes its first big move but for sure Meadow Foods and Paine &
Partners are going to figure in the UK and European dairy news frequently from
now on as the business grows and possibly at a rate few had previously
contemplated.
 
The challenge for Paine & Partners,
Meadow staff and executives will be to try to maintain the personal one to one
family relationship Meadow have cultivated with their 550 producers, whilst
embarking on its ambitious expansion plans. 
In addition to continue to pay a leading ex-farm gate milk price to
retain existing loyal suppliers and attract new recruits and not give the
impression that the new private equity investors want more than a fair return
on their capital at the expense of farmer suppliers.
 
Paine & Partners website www.painepartners.com is agriculturally
impressive and claims current assets of $2.7 billion (Ł2 billion) having been
set up only 9 years ago.  They are
certainly a very professional and ambitious operation and the only question is
where will their next UK dairy acquisition be.
 
Meadow currently handle around 650-700
million litres, (including Selky Vale), of GB milk each year and are the 4th
largest UK owned dairy processor.

The actuals are 0.9ppl increase for Muller
non-aligned and 1.189ppl for the former Dairy Crest non-aligned now badged

The Muller price increase press release left
those who read it and understood it close to speechless.  Amongst the all time gems was the line from
the Chairman of the Muller Milk Group (MMG) farmer board, Roddy Catto.
 
Nevertheless, this has been extremely
painful and challenging period for Muller suppliers.
 
Now come on Mr Catto you are on a Tesco
aligned contract and the other 3 out of 3 fellow MMG board members are also on
aligned contracts.  I dont think anyone reading
your statement will believe any of you on aligned contracts have found 2015/16
extremely painful.  The quote should have
stated for Muller non-aligned suppliers.

Whos having all the
cream?   (5th September 2016)
Spot
milk prices are now 35ppl and rising with most traders anticipating 40ppl in
the near future.
 
In
this weeks Provision Trade Federation, Chris Walkland highlights some
astonishing facts on cream, which prompted Ians headline.
 
The
cream price is almost twice what it was in May and currently stands at around
Ł1.70 and its still heading north.  This
means to a processor cream is worth 8.5ppl to 9ppl the highest amount since
December 2013.
 
AHDB
point to the fact that for liquid processors, fat as a by-product
has increased in value by around 4ppl since April.  This improvement is cream returns is not
currently flowing through into farm gate prices for those supplying the liquid
market.
 
However,
if that wasnt enough the killer statistic is that normally the ratio between
the cream income and farmers milk cheques is 25% of the milk price received at
farm gate level.  Now its 45% for the
non-aligned.
 
Farmers
and their so-called negotiators would have to be stupid not to realise who is
banking all of this extra cream income.

Longley
Farm Dairies    (26th August 2016)
Often under the radar but Longley Farm
Dairies from Holmfirth, Yorkshire operate an A & B system with their producers
and it appears to be operated in a more producer friendly and fairer way than
is the case with one or two other processors.
 
Both Longleys A & B prices are currently
26.5ppl and that was the same in July.
 
Both prices are for a standard litre and not
for the Jersey milk they take it, which attracts a significant constituent
premium.  One of its producers described
it simply as fair pricing for all parties where there is total trust.

Whole

This weeks GDT auction produced some
eye-wateringly cheery results.  The all
products average jumped a whopping 12.7% (US$295) to average US$2731/tonne and
this increase comes on the back of a 6.6% increase only 2 weeks ago.  This is the highest average price since
October and is up 45% compared to that recorded 12 months ago.  
 
Analysts in New Zealand are now suggesting
markets are heading towards delivering an average break even price for New
Zealand farmers at near NZ$5.
 
All products lifted in price and notable
movers were:
 
WMP                +18.9%

The quantity sold was up at 37,766 tonnes and
more important was the fact 177 bidders participated of which 119 purchased.
 
Woodcocks
(Yew Tree Dairy) and Freshways targeting a 1.5ppl October milk prices increase  (19th
August 2016)
Yew Tree Dairies have announced to their
suppliers that they expect a 1st October farm gate price increase of
1.5ppl or close to it.
 
Freshways have declared a minimum 1.5ppl farm
gate A milk price increase for October. 
Note, Freshways July B price was 25.21ppl and for August Freshways
anticipate its B price could be knocking on the door at 30p.  In comparison Meadow Foods B price for July
was 17.5ppl and its August B price has been announced at only 22pl.  So comparing the two B prices the difference
for July and August is likely to be 7.5ppl.
 
However, headline grabbing B prices dont
relieve the pain of low A prices and a number of Freshways producers are
grumpy.
 
The smaller guys are certainly no longer
waiting for the big players!  quote from www.milkprices.com
 
Some middle ground milk processors claim to
be pushing customers for immediate price increases and frequently they are
quickly kicked back with words like but Arla and Muller havent increased farm
gate prices yet.  Well come next
Wednesday Arla are expected to take the lead on Muller with a member price
increase for September following which Muller will have to follow.
                
Milk supply is dropping worldwide and has
tipped the supply and demand balance upside down in a matter of months and
processors need to realise it will only continue to fall irrespective of any
delayed upward movement in ex-farm gate milk prices.  Some have overcooked it and robbed producers
blind.
 
Is
this all fair or is there evidence of tactical moves?  (19th
August 2016)
Some processors are claiming they work on
basket prices, which include the likes of Muller and Arla and until they move
their farm gate milk prices up they cant move theirs up.  Its what is called hanging on the shirt
tail.  Muller know that their refusal to
lift prices in September catches out a number of their smaller competitors
because their farmers are screaming for more money and customers are resisting
until the likes of Muller move on price.
 
On top of that some liquid processors are
guilty of packing milk for customers at ridiculously low prices.  They were desperate to retain volume so they
dropped their trousers and pants to keep existing customers and to smash and
grab new ones at unsustainably low prices.
 
The problem here is they did it using a milk
into powder price of 14p so the odd penny more and they thought they were
slightly better off.
 
But those cheap contracts are still running
and they could cripple the processor alternatively the processor cripples their
farmer suppliers with low or non-existent milk price increases.  Either way the farmer pays for the fact some
processors have completely mis-read the market and are now under serious pain
just as their farmers are.  The worry is
whether all processors can weather the storm and still retain their milk field.  Notices to leave some buyers milk should now
be flooding in because they understand that language.  Sadly, it will be a miracle if all survive
and some farmers need to remember processors who didnt and dont play fair.

Holstein
UKs Chief Executive pocketed Ł240,000 of Society funds   (19th
August 2016)
The RABDF is clearly not the only one with
some challenging financial issues to get to grips with, now the future of its
(once) cash cow the Livestock / Dairy Event is in doubt.
 
During his tenure Holstein UKs former Chief
Executive Greg Watson managed to illegally trouser a cool Ł240,000 from the
organisation, and he might have got away with it if it wasnt for the
determination of the then board and its chairman John Edge. 
 
They ensured justice was done and in Greg
Watson has been sentenced to two years in prison and ordered to repay the
money.  Lets hope the organisation and
its trustees have learned their lesson and that proper independent
accountability of activities prevails going forward.
 
This has to rank as one of the biggest
financial scandals any UK dairy organisation has allowed to happen.

lift in bulk cream prices which are up by almost 75% since April worth 3.37ppl
on the milk price.  Sadly for the farmers
involved come the 1st February 2017 the formula pricing mechanism
will be axed by Muller.  
 
The new liquid core formula standard litre
price will be 26.2ppl compared to the comparable 1st September no
aligned standard litre price of only 18ppl (www.milkprices.com).    
 
0.5ppl
milk price increase for suppliers to Pattesmores  from 1st
August (PRODUCER
NOTIFIED)    (12th August 2016)
 
Muller
defends their corner & attempt to dig themselves out of a PR grave  (12th
August 2016)
CEO of Muller UK Ronald Kers has responded
to mounting criticism on his firms refusal to move non aligned farm gate milk
prices up with a letter to his producers. 
It states the case for the defence and in bold letters once again claims
he is building Britains Biggest and Best Dairy Business.
 
 The
letter is clear that Muller prices will not go up until we actually realise these higher returns within our business.  Clearly Muller havent achieved that for
August or September which is a worry and some believe this is because Muller
have forward sold quantities of milk which now look vey cheap and could be
holding prices back.
 
Where the letter is silent is with reference
to the question asked by Michael Oakes, NFU Dairy Board Chairman last week which
was for Muller to explain why farmers have received some of the extra cream
money (see above).  
 
However analyst and journalist Chris Walkland
has commented he does not blame Muller for not moving the price up in
September.  He points the finger to the
incredible lack of lobbying of milk buyers like Muller sooner which if it had
happened might have persuaded Muller to move its non aligned price for
September 1st.  The evidence
points to a very limited number of complaints about the Muller no aligned milk
price from its own farmers.
 
To be fair the letter does make some valid
points several of which were mentioned in this bulletin last week in addition
there are a couple of irritating ones. 
No matter what the defence is the reality is that heading into winter on
a farm gate milk price of 18 to 18.6ppl is painful, unstainable, disappointing
and will not promote additional production.
 
Finally the letter should ideally have gone
out at the end of July with the announcement that milk prices for Muller non
aligned were frozen.  At the same time it
could have addressed where the extra cream returns money Muller has received
has gone.
 
Arla
Farmer Milk Brand broke the 1 million litre barrier in two weeks   (12th
August 2016)
Arlas farmers milk sales in Asda stores
have broken the 1 million litre barrier in just over two weeks since its launch
at the Great Yorkshire Show.  An extra
25p from each 4 pints sold will be paid to Arla members, so thats an extra
Ł250,000 to kick start. 
 
Cheap Milk   (12th August 2016)
Booker
cash and carry in Cardiff is selling Muller Wiseman milk 8 litres for Ł2.35 and
this incredible offer runs for 2 months until the 4th October.  Thats 29.4ppl!   
 
2ppl
milk price increase for Glanbia Cheese suppliers  from 1st
September  (5th August 2016)
This takes producers standard manufacturing
litre to 20.54ppl (www.milkprices.com)
 
2ppl
milk price increase for Arla Direct Suppliers  from August 1st   (5th
August 2016)
This takes producers standard liquid litre
to 18ppl (www.milkprices.com)
 
1.55ppl
plus milk price increase for suppliers to Paynes Dairies Limited  from August 1st  (5th
August 2016)
This takes producers standard liquid litre
price to 19.2ppl (www.milkprices.com)
 
The increase comes in two parts with 1ppl on
the basic milk price, in addition producers no longer face the balancing charge
deduction, which is equivalent to an additional 0.55ppl so total increase of
1.55ppl.  On top of that the promise that
if Paynes ongoing discussions with customers deliver results there could be a
further backdated increase on top of the 1ppl. 
However, the reality is that with Muller holding until at least October
1st those discussion will be extra challenging.
 
1ppl
milk price increase for suppliers to Dairy Crest Davidstow  from 1st
September  (5th August 2016)
This takes producers standard manufacturing

First
Milk milk price increases including 5ppl on B litres   (5th
August 2016)
First Milk has increased the price it pays
for B litres by 5ppl to 20ppl for August.
 
In addition, the following A price increases
have been announced by the co-op, spread across August and September.
 
                                    August/September
Increase                                1st
September Standard Litre
Haverfordwest                1.25p                                                                18.74p
Lake District                  1.25p                                                                17.71p
Scotland                       0.70p                                                                17.08p
North of England            0.70p                                                                16.90p
Midlands                       0.50p                                                                16.34p
 
First Milk  are not moving mountains but
each and every snippet of news is encouraging for  a large group of co op
farmers who just over a year ago feared the Co op would be the next DFOB,
Amelca or United Milk.
 
The   B price above the standard
litre A price is exactly how A and B should operate with the two ratcheting up
and the B price sending a clear signal to members that more milk is required by
First Milk.
 
It wont be enough for some but it will
provide encouragement and optimism for many especially in the full knowledge
that First Milk are no longer paying a milk price they cant afford just to keep
up with other milk purchasers as happened under the previous management.
 
WMP
auction prices jump 10%   (5th August 2016)
Tuesdays GDT auction saw WMP prices increase
by 10% compared to a fortnight ago and the overall average all products price
was up 6.6% to average US$2436, which was significantly more than analysts
anticipated.
 
Key movers were:
 
WMP                averaged           US$2265 tonne +9.9%
Butter               averaged           US$2871 tonne  +6.6%
SMP                 averaged           US$1965 tonne  +2.1%
Cheddar            averaged           US$2889 tonne  -0.8%
 
AMPE
& MCVE rocket up   (5th August 2016)
AHDBs AMPE & MCVE values for July have
rocketed up and in one month AMPE has increased by 24% (to 23.4ppl from 18.9ppl)
and MCVE is up by 20% (to 23.5ppl from 19.6ppl)
 
Muller
under attack for announcing no price increase before October 1st   (5th August 2016)
This weeks dairy news and chatter has been
dominated by Mullers announcement its non aligned suppliers will not see any
increase until at least October 1st. 
There was talk of a possible mid September rise, however, Muller have
subsequently ruled this out.
 
The announcement attracted widespread
criticism, particularly from NFU Dairy Board Chairman Michael Oakes who
certainly sharpened his teeth and let go with both barrels in a press release.
 
His language was unusually strong for an NFU
press release but his frustration was understandable.
 
In the NFUs release Michael Oakes refers to
Mullers 3ppl retailer premium with a hint that Muller could be using this as a
reason not to increase producer prices in September.  He commented:
 
Müllers non-aligned suppliers will no doubt be dumbfounded
by Müllers decision to hold. The decision
is an insult to its suppliers and is completely out of line with recent
positive market movements which are bringing some confidence to the industry at
last.
 
Im
sincerely hoping that Müller isnt hiding
behind the retail supplements paid by Lidl, Aldi and Morrisons, rather than reacting
to the market realities we are seeing in cream incomes, wholesale prices and
volume reductions. Cream incomes to a liquid retailer have increased by a
whopping 77% since Müller last increased
its base price and current daily deliveries of milk are down 10.2% on this time
last year. This stand on milk price also makes a mockery of the support
retailers gave, and continue to give, dairy farmers in minimum farm gate
pricing.
 
Similar comments came from Graeme Kilpatrick
Chairman of NFUS with:
 
I can think
of no justifiable reason why Muller has chosen to ignore the market and leave
their non-aligned suppliers languishing with an unsustainable milk price.  I sincerely hope that Muller isnt hiding
behind this retailer supplement and using it as an excuse for not lifting
prices now.
 
Farmers for Action are equally ignited and
protests are on the radar (see below)
 
The Muller Milk Group Chairman and former
board have come under attack with the group collectively described as impotent
as well as Muller messengers rather than negotiators.  In addition the fact it doesnt affect most
of the Muller farmer board because they are on retailer aligned contracts has
not gone unnoticed.
 
Did this group prepare their case for an
increase if so why did they agree to the stand on or were they simply told
thats the position? They claim to represent 1200 plus farmers and will know
that Muller have pocketed money on the cream price alone.
 
Muller have certainly received additional
income, particularly from cream and questions are being asked whether they have
retained it or given part or all of it away to retail customers rather than
passing it back to farmers.
 
To be  balanced it has to be remembered
that like Arla Muller have paid one price for every litre and not introduced A
and B pricing with which comes the opportunity to create chaos in the liquid
market  by playing smash and grab with competitors customers using B milk
bought for as little as   6 or 7ppl. Muller have had to defend those
predatory prices and retain customers.  In reality they cut prices slower
and by smaller amounts than they could have and thats perhaps one explanation
as to why upward price movements arent coming as quickly as some producers
desperately need it to.
 
The move leaves Muller non-aligned farmers on
only a 18.66ppl standard litre price and the ex-Dairy Crest producers on only
18ppl.  Note, when Muller do decide to
move up on milk prices they will equalise both the Muller Milk Group (18.66ppl)
and Direct Milk (ex-DC 18ppl) milk prices, which is undoubtedly a factor in
their equations and decision to hold producer prices.
 
The
NFUs release concluded with Müller is
throwing its support to the British team at this years Olympics and its about
time it showed similar support to its non-aligned farmers who deserve improved
milk prices.
All eyes now point towards Arla and whether
their member milk price increases for September 1st.  If it does increase by a useful amount it
wont help Muller in its bid to be both the biggest and best GB milk
processor.  If Arla dont move the NFU
will have to sharpen their teeth for the second time in a month.
 
Farmers
for Action go back out on the picket lines this Sunday   (5th

Predominantly in response to the Muller stand
on price announcement FFA are planning direct action.  For details log onto www.farmersforaction.org latest

A demonstration will take place this Sunday
10th at Market Drayton at 8pm according to FFAs website posting

5000
entries from 31 countries means Nantwich the biggest in the world   (5th
August 2016)
The Nantwich Cheese Show continues to grow
and it is without doubt the biggest cheese show in the world where this year
5000 cheeses came from 31 countries with 53% of the entries from UK processors.
 
Champion UK cheese went to Arla Foods Taw
Valley Creamery Double Gloucester.
 
The Tesco Red Leicester Trophy was awarded to
First Mills Haverfordwest Creamery, which is good news given Haverfordwests
close relationship with Ornva Foods (AKA Adams) and Tesco.  It means Tesco are buying the champion
cheese.
 
Haverfordwest also won the best Extra Mature
Cheddar against a class of almost 100 entries.

4.8ppl
record breaking milk price increase to suppliers to Bowland Fresh (Lancashire)  from 1st
August (PRODUCER
NOTIFIED) (28th July 2016)
This takes producers standard litre price
from 17.2ppl to 22ppl.
 
The price increase is a headline grabber but
needs to be balanced out with the pain Bowland suppliers have endured,
particularly in recent months.
 
Bowland operated an A & B pricing
mechanism with historical deliveries ratcheted back to 80% paid on an A price
of 16.2ppl in April, May & June and the remaining 20%+ paid on the jaw
dropping B price of 6ppl in April & May and 8ppl in June.  Is this the lowest B price paid to
producers?  If any readers know of a
lower B price, please email Ian.  By our
calculations Bowlands blended A & B milk price paid in April & May
would be around 14.2ppl.  Note, producers
supplying Bowland believe that the A & B mechanism will be abandoned by
Bowland from 1st August.
 
4.5ppl
milk price increase for suppliers to Lanchester Dairies  from 1st
August (28th July 2016)
After 1st August Lanchester
acknowledge the serious financial implications and pain farmers have taken and
that unless seismic increases are confirmed now supply bases will be further
decimated.
 
Along with SCC (see below) Lanchester are one
of two milk buyers who have re-opened the doors to new recruits.  Lanchester are seeking farmers ideally
situated in an area roughly between the Yorkshire Dales & Moors, up to the
Scottish Borders.
 
1.75ppl
milk price increase for suppliers to South Caernarfon Creameries  from 1st
September  (28th July 2016)
In addition, SCC is now recruiting new
suppliers in North & Mid Wales as they ramp up production in their new
factory.
 
1ppl
milk price increase for suppliers to Belton Cheese  from 1st
September  (28th July 2016)
This takes producers standard manufacturing
litre to 20.75ppl (www.milkprices.com)
 
1ppl
milk price increase for suppliers to Joseph Heler Cheese  from 1st
September  (28th July 2016)
 
Joseph
Heler Cheese hit the nail on the head  (28th July 2016)
In a letter to producers notifying them of
the 1ppl increase, Mike Heler opens up with a very thought provoking paragraph:
 
We are very
aware that some milk purchasers are increasing milk prices particularly those
who are paying market related or A/B prices. 
This has to be welcome news however we are concerned that some milk purchasers
are introducing penalties for under supply and are encouraging increased milk
production direct from farms.  The UK is
not short of milk and milk buyers should be careful and diligent in encouraging
producers to increase supply if we are to see a sustained recovery.
 
The final sentence should be studied by all
dairy farmers.
 
No
change for Arla members milk price for August at 19.05ppl  (28th July 2016)
One must surely come for September!
 
Spot
Milk @ 31ppl - if you can find it!   (28th July 2016)
The 30ppl spot milk barrier has been broken
but it is very scarce. In March some milk buyers told suppliers they wanted
less milk and had no home for all the milk they were receiving. Consequently,
farmers responded and cut production, in some instances turning cows into meat.
 
However, whilst spot milk price headlines are
sensational the total amount of spot milk traded in GB accounts to a maximum of
1% of total production.  It is however,
an important barometer of daily supply & demand.  
 
According to www.milkprices.com, if farmers deduct
2.5ppl from the headline spot price it will give them an approximate farm gate
equivalent milk price.  
 
Milk
prices are moving up but no news from the big guns yet  (28th July 2016)
Price increases are coming through but there
is still no positive news from either of the two GB liquid big guns, namely
Arla and Muller, other than the fact both have declared that their member milk
price will not increase before 1st September.
 
GB milk production is now down almost 11%
(3.7m litres a day) compared to the same weeks in 2015, and GB in 2016 has seen
the biggest fall in production compared to the other 27 EU member states. In
Holland the corresponding 6 months of 2016 has seen production drop by 8.6%
compared to 2015.
 
To be fair to Muller and Arla they were not
guilty of crashing their producer price as quickly or by as much as many other
processors did. This is an area were the likes of the NFUs should be doing some
analysis to see who went down quickest and who is hanging back and slow to
increase.
 
Is
the Freshways A & B system working as it should?  (28th July 2016)
Freshways have written to its farmer
suppliers and confirmed to Ian that farmers who produce below their agreed
weekly litres are likely to be penalised. 
Freshways do regularly trade in the spot market and will now be facing a
30ppl+ price for any top up milk they require. They do however anticipate that
their July B milk price is likely to be heading towards 25ppl, which if paid,
leaves a huge gap between themselves and the likes of Meadow Foods whose
estimated B price for July is only 17.5ppl.
 
If Freshways do pay a B price in the region
of 25ppl they will be able to claim that their operation of A & B pricing
is exactly how it was designed. 
 
Note, in reality some milk buyers could say
they will pay 40ppl or 50ppl for B milk in the full knowledge that their
producers are unable or unwilling to produce any B litres in that particular
month.
 
Unless some processors start to operate the A
& B pricing mechanism as it was designed its image is likely to be
tarnished for life.
 
500m
dairy aid package has missed the low point   (28th July 2016)
The latest 500m additional EU dairy aid
package announced last week indicates that the Commission is definitely out of
touch with the direction of travel of milk prices.  
 
Of the 500m a total of 350m will be
allocated in the form of a national envelope handled by each member state with
the UK down to receive Ł25m (30m). The Commission say that member states can
match fund this taking the total compensation for the UK to Ł50m.  But if anyone believes our Treasury will put
Ł25m into dairy farming they are likely to still believe in the tooth fairy.
 
The remaining 150m will be paid as an
incentive to producers for cutting milk production based on milk they do not
produce in a 3 month period compared to the same 3 months period production in
2015.  Exact details are still to be
confirmed, however, the rate is expected to be around 12ppl for each litre not
produced and rather surprisingly the payment will be available to retired
farmers as well as on farm processors. 
This extra money takes the total paid by the Commission to over 1
billion during the crisis.
 
Holstein
UK statement on Dairy Day (for the decoded version see below)   (28th July 2016)
Following the disastrous Livestock Show
Holstein UK has issued a statement on its UK Dairy Day. The full statement
reads:
 
UK Dairy
Day - Media Statement
 
 
Richard
Jones, Holstein UK Chief Executive, commented;
Holstein UK acted on behalf of
its members and the dairy industry to ensure that there was a dedicated dairy
event held in the UK every September. We are determined that UK Dairy
Day will continue to showcase the very best of British dairying and feature all
cattle breeds from all over the UK. The one day event is tailored for the dairy
sector and has established itself as the leading event for dairy farmers to
network, meet industry suppliers, share knowledge, innovations and ideas  and
this will continue until at least 2020.
In response to recent speculation
surrounding RABDF and Livestock Event, with plans to change the date of this
event to early September, Holstein UK can confirm that discussions with RABDF
have occurred, but there are many issues to be resolved before any joint
activity can be confirmed. Our foremost priority is to protect our members and
the financial security of Holstein UK and the current framework for
UK Dairy Day already achieves this very successfully.
The positive reaction that UK Dairy Day has
received over the last two years demonstrates Holstein UKs understanding
of exactly what the dairy industry needs. In 2015 visitor numbers exceeded
7,000 and this is expected to grow. The variation on offer for dairy farmers
and those related to the industry, from topical seminars, new product
competitions, college and charity displays  to leading cattle shows and over
300 businesses represented provides a diverse, informative and valuable business
event.
UK Dairy Day 2016 takes place on Wednesday
14th September at the International Centre in Telford.
In response to the challenges currently facing the industry, UK Dairy Day
has made important changes for the 2016 event to support farmers by offering
free visitor entry, and free car parking onsite and off-site. Were also
extremely appreciative of a new partnership with Anglia Farmers which is
enabling free entry for all show cattle.
That
Holstein UK statement on Dairy Day  decoded  (28th July 2016)
Holstein UK acted on
behalf of its members and the dairy industry to ensure that there was a
dedicated dairy event held in the UK every September. = RABDF, in moving its event to July and
renaming it Livestock made a huge balls-up.
We are determined that UK Dairy Day will

make a profit out of UK Dairy Day and we are going to continue doing so.
0.452ppl
milk price increase for Muller formula contracted producers  August  (15th
July 2016)
This increase is
almost entirely down to the extraordinary improvement in cream prices during
June, which has resulted in a 0.453ppl uplift in the formula price for August.
 
In fact, the cream
price for June (which drives the August price) has, according to AHDB,
increased by Ł240/tonne, which is the biggest monthly increase for almost seven
years.
 
The increase
results in the following standard litre prices:
 
Liquid core
formula     25.02ppl
Simplified
contract      24.83ppl
 
(www.milkprices.com)
                            
The difference
between the formula priced litres and the standard contracted litre is now
6.713ppl.
 
3ppl extra
for Muller non-aligned suppliers  (15th July 2016)
Non-aligned
farmers supplying both Muller Group and Muller Direct will receive a June
retail supplementary payment of 3.047ppl in addition to their published
standard litre milk price.
 
0.5ppl milk
price reduction for suppliers to Pattemores, Somerset - from July 1st (PRODUCER NOTIFIED)  (15th July 2016)
Thank you to the
readers who emailed Ian last week to inform him of this price cut, which was
one of only two recorded for the 1st July. Several producers have
commented that pressure has been applied to Pattemores to follow the lead of
others and to rescind this cut. The fact Pattemores havent rescinded has
understandably alarmed some of those producers.
 
UK
deliveries crash  (15th July 2016)
According to AHDB
UK milk deliveries are crashing and are now down 10% on the weekly statistics,
equivalent to a 4 million litres a day drop on
the amount produced last year.
 
Arla brand
to pay more money to farmers  (15th July 2016)
Following the
extremely successful launch, 11 months ago, by Morrisons of its Milk for
Farmers brand comes the Arla Farmers Milk brand, which has been initially
rolled out in 500 ASDA stores this week. In
those ASDA stores consumers have the choice between standard ASDA discounted
milk at 95p for 4 pints or to pay an extra 25p for the new brand. Note, the
Morrisons success is such that volumes sold are almost 8 times the amount
budgeted.
 
As well as coming
on the back of the Morrisons success its launch will have been spurred on following
Arlas recent research, which confirmed that 63% of consumers care about dairy
farmers and are willing to pay more for dairy products if they know the extra
money actually goes back to dairy framers. 
 
So all eyes are
waiting for the tweets and interviews from the small vocal family of grim
reapers who quickly came out when the Morrisons brand was launched, all of whom
either supplied another retailer or were a tiny processor with an Arla axe to
grind. From Arlas point of view these people were described as being like
mosquitos biting an elephants backside.
 
Floating 40
cow dairy farm to open in January  (15th July 2016)
Yes the worlds
first floating dairy farm is to be built by Dutch developers in Rotterdam with
40 cows at a cost of $4million (Ł3 million).  The milk will be processed
on the floating deck into yoghurt and the project is fully integrated with, for
example, the cows urine treated and utilised to grow red clover, alfalfa and
grass under artificial light.  Due to open in January next year, the main
question is whether cows get sea sick?
 
RABDF 
Houston we have a problem  (15th July 2016)
Following on from
last weeks reports of a disappointing NEC Livestock Event comes information
from RABDF members that its finances are rapidly sliding down hill.
 
In 2014 RABDF had
balance sheet reserves of over Ł1 million and by the end of 2015 this had
slipped to Ł763,000. The main blow is down to declining income from its events
with the provisional 2015 accounts showing an eye watering Ł238,000 loss.
However, that was with ticket sales amounting to Ł963,000 compared to this year
when entry to the event was free.
 
It appears almost
inevitable that the organisation will lose money again in 2016 and that the
Ł763,000 in reserve will be further eroded, which has led to one hack
questioning whether the situation could spell the end of the organisation,
which now has less than 750 paid up members. Its certainly looking like a 999
situation, which has been allowed to continue too long and needs arresting.
Given the numbers and facts we doubt even the First Milk magician, Mike
Gallacher, could pull a rabbit out of the hat if he were to be parachuted in
not withstanding the fact he has plenty to keep him occupied at First Milk.
 
For 2015 RABDF
budgeted to make a loss of Ł170,000 but the actual deficit was Ł265,000 and
this loss came on top of a 2014 loss of Ł156,000. Houston we have a problem and
we are almost stranded.
 
2ppl milk
price increase for suppliers to The Fresh Milk Company (AKA Lactalis) (8th July 2016)
This is another two stage price increase of 1ppl from August 1st
and 1ppl from September 1st.
 
Previously FMC had declared a 3 month price holding guarantee, which,
like others, it has decided to bin by announcing a price increase, which comes in
addition to the previous 0.5ppl July payment.
 
The 2ppl results in a standard manufacturing litre of 19.13ppl on
September 1st under their company profile contract and 19.70ppl
under their seasonality schedule.  Both
are manufacturing standard litre values calculated by www.milkprices.com
 
0.5ppl milk
price reduction for suppliers to The Wensleydale Creamery - from 1st July  (8th July 2016)
This price decrease is certainly against the flow and is one of the few, if
not the only, GB cheese processor farm gate milk price decrease to be
implemented without any indication of an upturn or freeze on farm gate prices.
 
Spot price
at 28ppl plus!   (8th
July 2016)
Spot milk prices are only an indication of supply and demand on a daily
basis and come with a wealth warning.
 
However, www.milkprices.com
have recorded daily spot prices during June and the average months spot price they
calculate as 22.5ppl having started in early June at 17/18ppl and ended at
25/26ppl.
 
During the first week of July spot prices have traded at 28ppl and
possibly more.
 
Livestock
Event 2016 was like a sick dog on life support needing to be put out of its
misery (8th July 2016)
Ian only attended the first day of the Event, which was poorly attended
and the dairy exhibitors he spoke to were extremely disappointed at the number
of farmers attending and the enquiries. Apart from the farmers the number of
company absentees was staggering. Take the feed sector alone. No For Farmers.
No Carrs Billington. No NWF. No Devenish. No Mole Valley. And why? Because
having a show in July is just a crap month! 
 
There is no way RABDF can run a successful one-day event in 2017 in
direct competition to UK Dairy Day. The exhibitors Ian spoke to all claimed
that if there was no agreement on merging the event they would only either
attend the UK Dairy Day in 2017 or alternatively would boycott both events.
There is talk of the two events amalgamating but the truth is if RABDF had
consulted and listened to exhibitors and not moved to July in the first place
we wouldnt have two events. The disastrous date change and loss of direction
by moving the name away from Dairy to Livestock left the door wide open to UK
Dairy Day and Holstein exploited it very well indeed.
 
But as personalities battle for positions, its quickly heading for a
knock-out in which Holstein UK are favourites to win. But it shouldnt come to
that. If the UK can negotiate an exit from Europe then two dairy organisations
should be able to negotiate over trade shows. They will both be laughing stocks
if they cant.
Its a miracle heads havent already rolled over the rapid demise of the
RABDFs flagship cash cow event, the profits of which are used to fund the
whole organisation.
One dairy farmer emailed Ian to simply state The Livestock Event was
rubbish, another described this years two-day event as resembling a sick dog
that needed taking to the vets and putting out of its misery.
Michael King (RABDF chairman), Peter Alvis (vice), Lord Curry (president)
and others within the RABDFs council are desperately trying to shake things up
and turn the ship around but its now much tougher than it was earlier this
week. 
 
Sean
(Marmite) Rickard to chair First Milks Member Council (8th July 2016)
Sean Rickard is well known to farmers and is best described, like Ian, as
Marmite. Some love him whilst others hate him, however, both groups tend to
listen to what he has to say and talk about it. 
 
Sean is to immediately take the Chairmanship of First Milks Member
Council who will oversee the co-ops strategy and represent its farmer
members/owners.
 
Sean is sure to ruffle some feathers with his rather blunt straight talking
style , which occasionally gets very serious when he wags and points his finger
at you saying let me tell you my friend. 
He wont be every farmers cup of tea but he will call it how it is no
matter how unpalatable or unpopular.
 
Note, at last Fridays SGM First Milk members approved the conversion of
all Capital Account Balances, B Shares and Debentures into C Shares.
 
Russian
dairy import ban extended to 2018 (8th
July 2016)
Since August 2014 European dairy product has been banned from entering Russia
and that ban is now extended until at least 31st December 2017.  Further proof that the EU might have
permanently lost that customer.
 
1.25ppl milk price increase for
suppliers to South Caernarfon Creameries (SCC) (1st July
2016)
This is split into two
increases:
 
1st July              0.5ppl
1st
August          0.75ppl
 
In addition, SCCs
new cheese production facility will be officially opened next Tuesday (5th)
by The Prince of Wales and Duchess of Cornwall.
 
Dairy Crest rescinds 1ppl July 1st
milk price cut  (1st July 2016)
Dairy Crest has
done right by its Davidstow producers and rescinded the previously announced
1ppl milk price cut, which will mean for July producers manufacturing standard
litre will remain at 21.72ppl (www.milkprices.com)
 
0.65ppl First Milk member milk price
increases  from 1st July   (1st July 2016)
From 1st
July First Milks A litre milk price will increase by 0.5ppl whilst the B price
will increase by 2ppl.  The combination
results in a nett 0.65ppl member price increase from 1st July.
 
350,000 tonnes is the new intervention
SMP ceiling   (1st July 2016)
From June 30th
the SMP intervention ceiling has been raised from 218,000 tonnes to 350,000
tonnes at a fixed price of 1698 tonne (approximately Ł1,400 tonne).  This ceiling is unlikely to be reached this
year given the current direction of travel of markets.
 
Total tonnage in
store has reached almost 300,000 tonnes of which 218,000 are at the fixed price
and 80,000 tonnes via tender.
 
In the space of
weeks SMP intervention storage has gone from 109,000 tonnes to 350,000 tonnes
and the 300,000 tonnes of product in store will have to come out and be sold,
which will hamper any recovery.  Its a
huge tonnage and a big black cloud.
 
Now dairy prices really have turned
the corner   (1st July 2016)
AHDB Dairy this
week has a headline titled Wholesale prices move off the floor.  This surely officially confirms what others
have been stating for the past 2 to 3 months, that prices have bottomed and are
on the up.
 
6,500 cows in the worlds biggest
robotic milking farm   (1st July 2016)
A farm in Chile
will install 64 robots and become the biggest robotic milking farm in the
world.
 
RABDF does a U-turn abandoning its
Livestock Event in 2017   (1st
July 2016)
In 2012 the RABDF
broadened the scope of the two day Dairy Event and once again re-named it to be
The Livestock Event.
 
In 2013, they
switched the event from September to July, a move which was heavily criticised
by a number of exhibitors who felt they should have had prior input and
consultation.
 
At the time of the
2013 move, eyebrows were raised at the press releases from RABDF with claims that
the date change had been a huge success and that the main trade halls
buzzed.  Last year one industry leader
commented to Ian he had seen more customers at his local car boot sale than
were present on day two and that most of the people wandering around were, in
fact, bored trade stand and cattle exhibitors.
 
 
Well, next weeks
two day event will be the last Livestock Event and in 2017 the RABDF will
revert to a one day event called The National Dairy Event on 6th
September 2017 at the NEC.
 
Clearly with the
now firmly established Holstein UKs Dairy Day Show there simply isnt room for
two specialist dairy events in England let alone two within only 7 days of each
other.  With the announcement that next
years RABDF one day show will not include any cattle showing its a near
certainty which of the two will be the first choice of dairy farmers.
 
The two
organisations are already in negotiations with a view to holding one joint
event each year.  If those negotiations
fail, one of the events is likely to be axed by 2018 at the latest.  
 
Given the RABDF
Event has had so many name changes in the past decade or so, we reckon its at
least five; we are tempted to run a competition for the name of the 2018
event.  
 
28ppl farmgate milk price from
wwwfreerangemilk.net from September 
(1st July 2016)
In an update from

Tesco (TSDG) Cost of Tracker is almost
unchanged   (1st July 2016)
The second
quarterly TSDG Cost Tracker review has confirmed that a small nett 0.02ppl
increase in the COP taking the current 28.69ppl to 28.71ppl from August 1st.
 
In addition Tesco
has unveiled a new Fresh Milk Fair for Farmers Guarantee on all of its fresh
milk which is 100% British sourced from 600 farms.
 
Tesco claim that
since it started its TSDG relationship with farmers it has paid a whacking Ł240
million above the market price.  Note the
market price is taken as the AHDB average published price.
 
From Monday next 4th
July the switch of around 200 million milk litres of liquid from Arla to Muller
together with Tesco farmers will take place.

Meadow Foods 2ppl increase   (24th June 2016)
Last weeks
newsflash that Meadow Foods had announced a 2ppl producer milk price increase
in two stages triggered a flurry of interesting emails to Ian.
 
The bulk of them came
from suppliers to Meadow Foods who were keen for Ian to highlight that the 2ppl
increase only applies to the A deliveries, which amounts to 80% of
deliveries.  A number of suppliers were
keen to highlight the fact Meadows B price during April and May, has been under
12ppl.  However, the B price is expected
to up around 2ppl to over 13ppl for June and rising.  
 
In addition a couple of readers questioned Ians claim
last week that Meadow announced a 5ppl increase in 2007.  Having checked our records and compared them
with www.milkprices
.com the Meadow price was increased by  +8.79ppl over a seven month period
split as follows:

May07 +1.0ppl, Aug 07 +1.8ppl, Oct07 +4.99ppl and Nov07 +1.0ppl = Total
+8.79ppl in the 7 month

Paynes Dairies axe B litres  Is that
fair?   (24th June 2016)
Producers supplying
Paynes Dairies have been informed that their B litres will be abolished and
become 100% A litres with immediate effect from 20th June.  Some producers have rightly questioned
whether this is how A&B milk pricing is designed to operate.  The reality is what should happen is the B
price should lead the A price up and on occasions overtake it.
 
Charlie Payne is
coming in for some criticism with this latest surprise move having recently
paid only 9ppl for B litres and as soon as the spot price is rallying (today
20ppl) he intends to buy all milk at a standard litre (A) price as well as
require production profiles from producers.
 
As stated in this
weeks AHDB Dairy Market Commentary B
prices should be the first to move upwards  assuming they work as they were
intended to.  Now it seems the
ending to that sentence should be  work
as they were intended unless the milk processor suddenly scraps alphabet milk
pricing.
 
Arla and Muller make the top 20 league   (24th June 2016)
The 2015 ICFN
league table of the top 20 milk processors by volume puts Arla at no. 4 (no. 5
in 2014) with 14.2m tonnes and Muller no. 14 (no. 17 in 2014) with 6.3m tonnes.
 
The top 20
processors account for 25% of the worlds milk processing.
 
Belton Cheese is officially recognised
as one of Britains fastest growing international sales businesses  (24th June 2016)
The latest Sunday
Times HSBC international league table of 200 businesses has seen Shropshire
based Belton Cheese ranked 135th as a mid market private company
with fast growing international sales.
 
Belton produce
8,000 tonnes of handmade cheese a year from milk sourced from 85 local farmers
of which 15% is now exported to the USA, EU, Canada, South Africa, Australia,
China and Japan and growing at a pace.
 
Sorn Milk producers call it a day   (24th June 2016)
David Shaws Sorn
Milk business in Ayrshire will make its final collections from its 49 supplying
farmers next Thursday, June 30th after which its doors close.
 
Recently the
business has failed to pay its farmers anything more than what is almost
certainly the lowest milk price and the final straw was a nett milk price paid
to producers of 10ppl when the milk was delivered into Yew Trees new drier in
Lancashire at 14ppl.  It is claimed that
48, if not all 49, Sorn producers tendered their resignation because they
simply couldnt take any more pain.
 
The loyal
producers, some of whom have been with Sorn for almost 22 years since it
started, wanted owner David Shaw to share the pain and take a haircut on his
margin but it didnt happen.
 
Ironically, many of
those Sorn producers from July 1st will be supplying Yew Tree direct
achieving 16ppl and trending upwards whilst some have joined First Milk.
 
One of the major
problems Sorn encountered was when their relationship with Arla irretrievably
broke down.  Had that situation been
handled differently, particularly in terms of a Sorn margin haircut the closing
of the doors next Wednesday would likely not have happened.
 
Sorn farmers have
been quick to alert Ian to the fact that David Shaw has stated that he is not
selling his milk tankers and that they are bought and paid for.  Thats led at least one Sorn producer to
discuss the matter with his lawyer because he claims that earlier in the year a
2ppl milk price deduction for 3 months was taken by Sorn to finance the
purchase of a new lorry.
 
Lets all hope it
all ends amicably, peacefully and financially fairly for all involved in the
shut down.
 
!!!!!!!!!MILK PRICE NEWS FLASH!!!!!!!
 
 
2ppl
milk price increase from Meadow Foods breaks the log jam early   (17th June 2016)
Last week in this bulletin
Ian made it abundantly clear that the UK milk market is on the move and even
suggested the possibility that the odd milk purchaser might announce an August
producer milk price increase.
 
Well, once again,
Meadow Foods have come up trumps by today announcing a 2ppl producer price
increase split over two months, with 1ppl from 1st July and the same
from 1st August.
 
This is a very
important signal to other milk purchasers to step forward and pay farmers a
fair share of what they are entitled to, especially those involved in the
liquid and spot market.
 
Back in 2007
Meadow shook the industry when they announced a whopping 5ppl price
increase.  They had correctly read the
market signals then and only a fool would suggest that the bean counters in
Meadow have got it wrong this time.
 
Some milk
purchasers will be desperate to re-build their own balance sheets and would
love to be able to delay producer milk price increases by a month or more.
Well, Meadow has once again broke rank and announced that they will pay
producers any extra as soon as they can. Now all eyes will be on who follows
suit. Its a certainty that the two price drops for July 1st from
cheese makers Dairy Crest and Wyke must be the last and there will even be
pressure on them to rescind part or all of their July cut. Its time to cut out
the spin and for the market to follow Meadows lead, which Ian believes is not
only a UK first, but possibly a European and world first price increase
following this serious milk price crisis. 
 
Simon Chantler,
Chief Bean counter at Meadow commented:
 
We are starting to see
the green shoots of recovery in the price we are able to pay for our milk and
wanted to pass this on to our producers as soon as it was possible.  
 
Although there is still
some way to go before the pressure is lifted from producers, we feel that the
slowdown in EU milk production over the flush period, a general tightening of
supply are offering a better market outlook.  These developments are the
most positive we have seen for a number of months and this has led us to adopt
a more optimistic position for the recovery of milk prices in the medium
term.   
 
We know the last two
years have been incredibly difficult for producers across the UK, Europe and
the world and Meadow Foods hopes to be writing again soon to producers with
further positive news on the market and milk price. 
 
1ppl milk price reduction for Dairy
Crest/Davidstow producers  from 1st July 
(10th June 2016)
This takes producers manufacturing
standard litre price down to 20.72ppl (www.milkprices.com)   
 
1ppl milk price reduction for Wyke Farms
producers 
from 1st July  (10th June 2016)
This takes producers
manufacturing standard litre price down to 18.92ppl (www.milkprices.com)  
 
2ppl performance bonus from First Milk
together with further price cuts   (10th June 2016)
Its a bitter sweet combination
from First Milk with its latest price cut announcement plus its performance
bonus.
 
A 2ppl business
performance payment will be made to all members during the coming months
starting now with the first 0.25ppl.
 
This means the
net outcome to producers allowing for the extra 0.25ppl will be the following June 1st price
cuts
 
0.44ppl price
reduction for Haverfordwest, Lake District, Arran & Campbeltown cheese
suppliers
0.34ppl price
reduction for the Scottish mainland pool
0.32ppl price
reduction for the Midlands pool
The
resulting www.milkprices.com standard
litre prices are still under 15ppl for liquid and 16.51ppl to 16.64ppl for manufacturing/cheese
so there is a lot of work to be done to lift member milk prices out of the
relegation zone into those of the main pack.  However, just over 12 months
ago most First Milk producers knew they were staring down the barrel of a very
large gun, which would see the co-op fold.  Things have changed since Mike
Gallacher took to the helm and he knows he still has a lot of work to do but he
should be over the worst part of the turnaround work or should we say what was
on day one a rescue plan.
More signals that the bottom of this crisis is well
and truly behind us   (10th June 2016)
A few weeks ago Ian said we were at the bottom and
since then all of the signals are pointing north.
Commodity
prices are moving higher and quickly. They are moving A LOT! 
Not that anyone
would get this from AHDB's latest market bulletin which drably states in the
headline that "EU prices
picking up...a bit". In the commentary it says that "Average monthly prices still showed
little change, although the feeling seems to be that the market has hit the
bottom".
NO AHDB! Wrong!
The market hit the bottom seven weeks ago and has been climbing ever since. Now
prices are shooting up!
There are good reasons to
talk the market up for your levy payers so come on! Get with it! This is not what you would call cutting edge market intelligence.
Ian has also stated that when major processors start to talk about
holding prices for two or three months to give stability to their supplying
farmers it would be a clear signal that the bottom had passed.
Dairy Crest have announced a 1ppl price drop for
July with a guarantee that no further deductions to farm gate milk prices will
take place until at least the end of September.  Well the reality is they
and others know that the next move will be upwards and Dairy Crest along with
others will soon be looking at a September milk price increase.
B prices should be moving up and are highly likely
to overtake A prices within a few months until processors push the A prices
up.  Ians best guess is that at least one of our major processors will go
for a September price increase and possibly even an August one but thats
perhaps a bit optimistic.
Some of the July milk price cuts are a combination
of needs as well as the fact processors know this is the last cut they can get
away with. Ian is hopeful that Arla and Muller will not have to cut producer
prices further and that their next move will be up.
Farmers will need to have good memories as to
whether their processor treated them fairly during this crisis and if they
didnt the next 12 months will present opportunities to change processor.
Thats certainly the case with Sorn Milk whose
processors are leaving David Shaw like rats jumping off a sinking ship as soon
as they possibly can.
There are now a number of producers who were under
notice from their current milk buyer to leave who are now receiving letters
saying the notice is rescinded. The next move will be a recruitment drive,
which could come by the end of the year. There is a long way to go in what will
be a long haul but at least  we have passed the bottom of the crisis.
SMP volumes smash the Intervention
ceiling  (27th
May 2016)
Its a
little over a month since the Intervention door opened to a doubling of the
tonnage it would accept a 1698/tonne (Ł1300). 
The new tonnage capacity of 218,000 tonnes was filled on 24th
May and moves are already afoot to add more than 60% to a new ceiling of
350,000 tonnes.  That sounds good but
its a ridiculously high tonnage which still has to be sold out of store and
will certainly check any recovery.
 
Milk production up 10%  (27th May 2016)
According
to AHDB Dairy EU milk deliveries for the 12 month period to the end of February
are up an eye watering 10%.
 
0.67ppl milk price reduction for
Waitrose suppliers - from June 1st   (27th May 2016)
This
takes producers standard liquid litre down to a healthy 30.88ppl.
 
1ppl milk price reduction for Arla
members  from June 1st  
(27th May 2016)
Its a
1.3 Euro Cents litre reduction equating to 1ppl for 13,000 Arla members, which
takes their liquid standard litre price down to 19.12ppl, including the current
forecast 13th payment of 0.73ppl (www.milkprices.com)
 
Will this be the last Arla member price
reduction?   (27th
May 2016)
Its a
hefty one at 1ppl and given the comments made at the DIN Conference last week
by Peter Giortz-Carlsen, Head of Arla Europe, its clear Arla are successfully
moving large quantities of milk from commodities into higher value branded
products and there was more than a slight hint of optimism from the very
positive looking Carlsen that prices had reached the bottom.  There was no doubt that Carlsen is acutely
aware of the financial pressure his 13,000 members are under.
 
Ians
bet is this is likely to be the final Arla member price cut but that does not
mean prices will start to increase soon.
 
All
eyes will be on other processors next week to see who sticks or chances a
further farm gate price drop.  This
market is fragile but privately virtually all processors who are in the real
world acknowledge commodity prices have certainly passed their low point.
 
Sainsburys tender results in processor
changes and swap shop for farmers 
(27th May 2016)
When
Muller announced its plan to acquire Dairy Crests liquid business Ian posed
the question whether Sainsburys would be comfortable having virtually all of
its liquid and cream business in the hands of Muller.  The no answer comes as no surprise.
 
It was
a near certainty the retailer would bring in a third wild card processor to mix
things up but few, if any, anticipated the introduction of two processors.
 
The
Sainsburys farmer merry-go-round will see Medina (South of England) and Tomlinsons
Dairies (Wales & Cheshire area) supplying milk to three Sainsburys regions
from July 2017.
 
Its
easier to get the Popes mobile number than to get information on how the new
arrangement is likely to pan out but the following will be very close to the
reality of the new split.
 
Sainsburys
have around 270 producers in its aligned SDDG supplying circa 450 million
litres of which more than 95% are currently under the Muller umbrella with the
remaining 5% (13 farmers) with Arla.
 
From
July 2017 Muller will surrender four of the regions they currently service,
with two moving to Tomlinsons, one to Medina and one to Arla.  This gives Arla 2 regions.  
 
Simple
maths means an average region is circa 50 million although at least two of the
switched regions are understood to be larger than 50 million litres and one is
bang on 50 million.
 
It is
believed there are 9 Sainsburys regions, which leaves Muller with 5 or 55%
(250 million litres) and still the main supplier having lost four regions and
close to 200 million litres.
 
The
120 or so SDDG farmers in the four regions will not be affected in terms of
milk price but they will be requested to do a Bossman transfer from Muller to
one of the three successful processors,
 
In the
case of the 30 or so who are involved in the Bossman transfer from Muller to
Arla they will be given the additional option to become Arla directs or full
Arla members.  Conversely a handful of
the existing Arla SDDG farmers will transfer to Muller.  For most of the former Dairy Crest
Sainsburys suppliers they will have been transferred from Dairy Crest to
Muller and now to Medina or Arla in less than 18 months.
 
This
could perhaps be interpreted that Sainsburys support the dairy co-operative
model more than their rivals Tesco do.
 
Whats next in the liquid retailer
merry-go-round?   (27th
May 2016)
All
eyes will now turn to the outcome of the ongoing Lidl liquid milk tender and
the co-op (CTRG) liquid tender.  
 
Muller
currently supply almost 100% of the liquid milk to the co-op (CTRG) and the
lions share, if not 90% plus, to Lidl. 
Sods law says these tenders will result in more chaos and destruction
as processors once again knock seven bells out of each other.
 
Fonterra raise its forecast farm gate
milk price   (27th
May 2016)
Fonterra
has increased its 1st June milk price forecast for the new season by
35 cents to NZ $4.25 per kg milk solids, which converts to 15ppl.
 
Many
analysts had hoped predicted the opening price forecast would have been at
$4.50 but understand why Fonterra are airing on the side of caution.
 
DEFRA meeting to discuss the current
crisis   (27th
May 2016)
Liz
Truss, Secretary of State for Environment Food & Rural Affairs, was
congratulated for hosting this weeks dairy industry meeting but she quickly realised,
whichever muppet or organisation who briefed her is not to be trusted in
future.  
 
The
meeting was held at Nobel House in London involving representatives of the main
processors, Dairy UK, EC and European Investment Bank, farmers and the NFU.
 
Unfortunately,
Lizs opening comment was that the reason that dairy GB farming is struggling
is because there is not enough processing capacity and investment in GB
processing has been adequate.
 
Jaws
were heard to hit the tables at which point Dairy UK informed her that during
the past 5 years a total of Ł876 million had been invested in UK processing and
that an unprecedented increase in global milk production was at the heart of
the crisis.
 
1ppl milk price reduction for suppliers
to Dale Farm   (20th

0.129ppl milk price reduction for
Muller/Direct Milk DPO formula contracted suppliers  from 1st June  (20th
May 2016)
This
is the sixth consecutive price reduction and takes the core and simplified
formula standard litre price to 24.47ppl  24.661ppl.
 
GDT average index up 2.6%  (20th May 2016)
Tuesdays
auction saw the lowest volumes of product on offer for over three years so the
increase needs to be balanced against the tightening of supply with only 18,113
tonnes sold averaging US$2283.
 
Key
movements:
Butter
              up         3.8% to average US$2697 tonne
WMP                up         3.0% to average US$2252 tonne
SMP                 down     0.9% to average US$1658 tonne
Cheddar
           down     0.8% to average US$2693 tonne
 
Glanbia rescind part of a 2ppl price
cut   (20th
May 2016)
Glanbia
has written to producers to inform them that the previously notified 2ppl price
cut for May 1st will be reduced to 1.5ppl.
 
This
takes producers standard manufacturing litre price to 16.54ppl as opposed to
the planned 16.04ppl (www.milkprices.com)
 
In
addition, Glanbia has capped its seasonality deductions at 4.2ppl reduced from
6.3ppl as additional help to its hard pressed suppliers.  A rebate will be paid on April deductions to
those who were deducted above the new 4.2ppl cap.
 
The
move has been interpreted as Glanbia sensing a glimmer of light that commodity
prices have passed the bottom (see below).
 
Intervention stocks are rocketing  (20th May 2016)
When
the Commission doubled the SMP intervention limit from 109,000 tonnes to
218,000 tonnes most believed that would comfortably get the EU dairy industry
through the flush.
 
Well
the way its going the new ceiling could be hit before the end of this month
and last week a staggering 22,018 tonnes was placed in to store taking the
total to 182,518 tonnes, leaving only 35,482 tonnes which could be filled in
less than two weeks.  At this weeks DIN
Conference Tom Tynan from the EU Commission confirmed that if the new ceiling
is reached the Commission will continue to support the dairy market but he
didnt say at the same level.
 
Note,
the intervention price for SMP is 1698/tonne or Ł1300.
 
World dairy markets have passed the
bottom   (20th
May 2016)
Whilst
few, if any, processors and traders are informing the town crier the
conversations Ian had at this weeks Dairy Industry News Conference reinforced
his belief that the world dairy commodity market has already passed the bottom.
 
All
the signals are pointing north; especially the upward movement in dairy futures
and the fact the Dutch Dairy Board have this week raised all of their dairy
commodity prices up.  New Zealands farm
gate milk price pay out is also moving upwards. 
Spot price in GB is not in single figures as some suggested and
is 10ppl plus and we are now just past peak daily production.  Throw into the mix the increase in cull cow
slaughtering and worldwide, especially EU, production cuts and it looks to be a
certainty that the positive talk is fully justified.
 
Its
positive news but its certainly not recovery and any road to recovery
is set to be a long one.  Several are
predicting average prices around 20ppl to 23ppl for the next 5 or even 10 years
with most, if not all, believing 30ppl plus could be a once in a lifetime
experience.
 
Anyone
banking on recovery equating to 30ppl is likely to be very disappointed but
miracles do happen like Leicester winning the Premiership.
 
Dairy Industry Conference (DIN)  (20th May 2016)
Ian
has attended most of the DIN Conferences but never one where the room was packed
to capacity with the majority of Europes big hitters in the dairy industry
keen to listen to the speakers.
 
There
was a positive buzz in the air at this weeks event tempered by the
acknowledgement that farmers cannot continue at current farm gate milk prices
and processors are also under the cosh.
 
More
on the Conference in Ians next Dairy Farmer article but for the 2017
Conference it looks like either a larger room is required or the ceiling on
attendees could be reached well ahead of the main event.
 
OMSCOs claim to be the first into
China is under attack  (20th
May 2016)
OMSCO
issued a press release this week, which in its opening paragraph claimed:
 
Following a historic
international partnership between leading global organic cooperatives, Organic
Valley/CROPP and the Organic Milk Suppliers Cooperative (OMSCo), the first
shipment of UK produced organic UHT milk, has been delivered to China under
this collaboration.
 
According
to Ian this is factually incorrect because Daioni from South Wales have been
exporting organic UHT milk to China for at least four years.
 
Rather
cheekily OMSCOs PR spin doctors responded to Ians request for clarification
by claiming that the wording refers to the fact its a first for OMSCO since the collaboration with
Organic Valley
 
Daioni
have subsequently confirmed that they have already raised a complaint with
OMSCO and are seeking a correction and apology having read the press release as
Ian did.
 
All eyes
are now on other claims made by OMSCO to check for accuracy and possibly even a
correction and apology from its PR spin doctors.
 
Its
great news that OMSCO are continuing to find new markets outside the EU but
they need to check they hold sufficient evidence to back up any claims.
 
Arla to incentivise farmers to convert
to GM Free Feed 
(20th May 2016)
Arla
believe they have a consumer driven market opportunity for milk and dairy
products produced using GM Free Feed for which consumers will pay a premium.
 
There
will inevitably be some segregation and logistical issues to resolve but from
work in Germany it is believed its a commercial marketing opportunity, which
Arla intend to capitalise on.
 
The
expectation is to pay invited farmers an additional 1 Euro Cent (0.8ppl) a
litre for GM free milk to defray the on farm cost of conversion for those who
are interested.
 
The
money will also be paid to members who currently produce GM free milk for Arla,
particularly; those in Sweden where all milk is produced with GM free feed.
 
Note,
Arla are the biggest organic milk processor in the world and along with the
other GM free milk it collects translates to 20% or Arlas total milk intake as
GM free.

(excluding retailer supplementary payments)
 
GDT
results are still unsettled    (6th May 2016)
Tuesdays GDT auction results produced an all
products average down 1.4% and the hope and expectation had been for a third
consecutive auction rise.
 
Fortunately, prices for the key product WMP
were slightly up (+0.7%) to average US$2176 tonne, perhaps further confirming
analysts belief that we have just passed the bottom of the price curve.
 
Other notable price movements were:
 
Butter               down                 5.5% to average US$2601/tonne
SMP                 down                 3.6% to average US$1676/tonne
Cheddar            up                     1.8% to average
US$2727/tonne
 
When
will the peak spring flush come?   (6th May 2016)
Likely in the next two weeks and fortunately it
will be lower than first feared on account of recent weather and increased
cullings.  Meanwhile, the quantity of SMP
going into EU intervention stores is rising rapidly including SMP coming from
the UK and a staggering 7,100 tonnes from France in one week!
 
Total EU production in January 2016 was up
5.3% or 620 million litres with Irish production up a staggering 33% in January
and 28% in March.
 
South
Caernarfon Creameries (SCC) gain Sainsburys own label cheese business at the
expense of Arla    (6th May 2016)
Sainsburys have switched a significant
tonnage (rumoured to be circa 5,000 tonnes) of its own label cheese from Arla
in favour of SCC which will be a major boost to the West Wales Co-ops expansion
plans.
 
Currently the factory is geared to produce around
12,000 tonnes of cheese a year with further expansion plans in the
pipeline.  An orderly switch in suppliers
is likely to be completed towards the end of this year or early 2017 by which
time Arla will have emptied their stores of all cheese made on behalf of
Sainsburys. So hopefully no surplus stocks to be offloaded as feared by some.
 
Up until last year SCC supplied own label
cheese to Tesco on a time limited contract which was not renewed however it is
believed that the tonnage involved in the Sainsburys deal eclipses that of the
Tesco deal and in addition it is better quality business for SCC.
 
Several in the industry claim the switch
would not have happened in the old Milk Link days due to the extremely close
relationship between Milk Link Mangers and Sainsburys.
 
Muller
closure of Hanworth is reversed   (6th May 2016)
Muller has reversed Dairy Crests earlier
decision to close the former Dairy Crest Hanworth Dairy, near London, now owned
by Muller. This is welcome news to milkmen given the fact Hanworth is one of
the countrys largest glass bottling facilities for Milk More and doorstep
milk.  It is also welcome news for the
170 or so employees.
 
Compulsory
milk levy is suspended from May 1st    (6th May 2016)
Recognising how tough it is for dairy farmers
Ornua (AKA the Irish Dairy Board) have suspended monthly levy payments from its
Irish dairy farmers.  Estimates from
Ornua indicate the levy suspension will be worth 6 million to Irish dairy
farmers (Ł4.8m).
 
German
farmers receive less than 12ppl / 15 Cents Litre   (6th

(15 Euro Cents)
 
It
can only be called cheese if its made from animal milk   (6th

within the EU law when they advertised cheese made from plant based ingredients
as cheese.

Cheap
Milk Watch  4 litres (7 pints) for Ł1    (6th May 2016)
Yes, 25p a litre for FarmFoods milk supplied
by Paynes Dairies on sale across 300 plus GB stores. 
 
Perhaps this is what Charlie Payne was
referring to in his 28th April letter to producers notifying them of
a 1ppl milk price reduction from the 1st May when he stated:
 
But
if the customer is adamant that they want the lowest milk price then we have to
be reactive and negotiate a deal, which inevitably means lowering the
price.  If we lose the customer then that
milk has to go somewhere!  That means
either the spot market or no market.  
 
Earlier in the letter a current spot price of
13 to 14ppl is quoted.
 
MCVE
38.8p to 15.7p in 30 months   (6th May 2016)
AHDB Dairys MCVE figures confirm it is now

2013, which means today it stands at only 40% of its high point.
 
Ł1
million plus for former Westbury Chairman  who has been accused of milking it   (6th
May 2016)
Richard Ashworth, Former Chairman of United
Milk, who built the Westbury plant prior to it going into administration, is
reported to have received more than Ł1 million from the EU over the past 5
years in salaries, expenses and allowances etc. for his position as an
MEP.  According to an article in The Sun,
the ability to receive a basic salary plus Ł237 day tax free sustenance allowance
helped boost the pot.
 
Its not the first time Richard has been in
the news for his EU expenses claims and one of the previous headlines he
attracted was Tory MEP Expenses Milker.

Second consecutive lift in GDT auction prices   (22nd April 2016)
This weeks GDT
auction produced a 3.8% average price increase to average US$2263.
 
The big story was
the rather surprising 7.5% jump in the key commodity WMP to average
US$2156/tonne.  SMP held its own at
US$1727, Cheddar down 3.9% to average US$2636/tonne.  
 
Traders claim the
auctions results instantly injected life into the worlds WMP trading
activity.

The promotion is
branded as Robert Wiseman milk but we dont think its that old and should
state Muller Wiseman milk.
 
One off opportunity for Arla Tesco suppliers to
switch to become Tesco Direct contracted producers   (22nd April 2016)
The Arla AMBA
Board have agreed a short window for current Arla members to switch to a Tesco
Direct contract.  The window is open
until the 30th April.  
 
The Arla members
who decline to make the switch and sign up to remain full members of the co-op
will receive a one-off 2ppl lump sum payment based on the volume of milk they
delivered in 2015.  The lump sum will be
paid either at the end of this month or in May, depending on the date they
decide to reject the switching offer. 
Note, the 2ppl bonus is in addition to the 1.42ppl paid by Arla to
enable members to fulfil the Tesco supplier requirements.
 
Suspension of the ability
to switch was instantly implemented by Arla in early February when the news
broke that Arla had lost 200 million litres of Tesco liquid business to
Muller.  The argument put forward to the
Arla board was that immediate suspension was unfair without giving prior
warning and that the right thing to do was to re-open the window to give
producers one last opportunity to make the switch.  However, given the 2ppl bonus the likelihood
is that very few will actually make that switch.
 
Of the Arla Tesco
Directs, 39 are on a Bosman free transfer to Muller predominantly located in
the South-West and Midlands area.

GDT auction prices lift 2.1% (all prices are in
US$)  (8th April 2016)
This weeks GDT
auction produced an average price of $2188, which was a 2.1% increase on the
average recorded two weeks ago which was down 2.9% at that time.
 
According to New
Zealand analysis the $2188 is only 70% of the estimated $3000 required to cover
the full cost of production.
 
Notable movers
were:
 
Cheddar            + 10.5% to average $2778 tonne
WMP                + 1.5% to average $2013 tonne
SMP                 + 0.1% to average $1721 tonne
Butter                 2.0% to average $2702 tonne
 
The original intervention tonnage limit was hit in
March   (8th April 2016)
Had the European
Commission not doubled the tonnage of SMP, which could go into intervention
stores from 109,000 to 218,000 tonnes, we could be looking at further downward
pressure an EU milk prices.
 
The European
Commissions original limit of 109,000 tonnes was hit in March, which is weeks
before Europes spring flush.
 
Formal
ratification of the proposal to double the tonnage is yet to be confirmed but
traders and processors believe this is an automatic formality and indeed a
necessity. However, because the limit has been hit and the 218,000 tonnes ceiling
is yet to be ratified its back to bi-weekly tenders for SMP, which will not
help prices.
 
Rabobank report writes off any recovery of milk
prices in 2016   (8th April 2016)
Rabo quarterly
global dairy report reinforces what most others have concluded that any global
price recovery in 2016 is unlikely. They cant say impossible but thats what
should be said because global markets and its dairy farmers will be depressed
throughout 2016. The report comments that EU exporting countries will find 2016
equally, if not more, challenging than 2015.
 
DEFRAs February milk price increase is a joke at
27ppl  (8th April 2016)
In last weeks
bulletin we highlighted the bizarre and irresponsible claim by DEFRA that the
average UK farm gate milk price for February had increased by 2.48ppl (+10.8%)
compared to that recorded in January due to the Arla 13th payment. 
Well it gets worse
because the average farm gate milk price paid to dairy farmers in Northern
Ireland in February was 18.54ppl. When you do the maths this means DEFRA are
stating that the average February price paid to GB farmers was a staggering
26.9ppl or as near as damn it 27ppl. 
 
During the week
DEFRA have resisted all complaints and dug their heels in and stand firm on
their figures. 
 
Dairy industry
journalist Chris Walkland has received an acknowledgement that his official
complaint to the National Statistics office has been received and is under
consideration/investigation.
 
He, like most
others, believes the reporting of the increase fails to meet the high quality
standards required by DEFRA.
 
Questions have
also been asked as to the reaction from AHDB Dairy whose remit is supposed to
be to deal with market failure on behalf of its levy paying farmers. Its
chairman, Gwyn Jones, has commented that AHDB Dairy has no influence whatsoever
with DEFRA in this area. Meanwhile, the NFU Dairy are on mute which is very
unusual for them. They usually issue a press release if they change their
toilet roll brand.
 
The big question
is, are DEFRA the big bad wolf they are all afraid of? 
 
The matter is now
bringing into question DEFRAs credibility and its unlikely to disappear until
DEFRA hold their hands up and issue revised figures which reflect the real
situation.   
 
Big changes in new Tesco Cheese Model  (8th April 2016)
Tesco have
completed their review of their cheese model and a new TCG - Tesco Cheese Group
model will be operating from 18th April 2016.
 
The new model will
involve a market tracker based on a basket of cheese processors milk prices, which
are transparent and easy to calculate plus a 2ppl uplift/premium which is
partly attributable to the farmers compliance with Tescos farm assurance and
welfare standards.
 
The 26 farmers
supplying Parkham Farms have enjoyed a Tesco Cost of Production model for
almost four years and have now been given 12 months notice that this ends on
the 17th April 2017, when the new TCG market tracker model will be
used. 
 
First Milks
Haverfordwest producers move onto the new model almost immediately in 10 days
time on 18th April 2016. Note, between September and April Tesco
have paid First Milks Haverfordwest producers a winter supplement, which ends
this month. 
 
The changes will
not be welcome but looking forward the Cost of Production (COP) cheese model was
unsustainable and its hoped the new model will be sustainable for all
involved, not just the farmers. 
 
Put simply the
supplement and the cost tracker were good whilst they lasted. Its a big cut
for Parkhams Farmers but both First Milk and Parkham will want to remain on the
Tesco cheese bus. 
 
The likelihood is
that the Tesco cheese model would pay a farm gate price in the early/low
20ppls, including the 2ppl bonus today. 
 
The new model will
instantly breed competition amongst First Milk farmers because in 12 months
time Tesco plan to operate the model with a dedicated group of Haverfordwest
suppliers. 
 
That gives First
Milk a 12 month transition period to work out the detail and decide which of
the 200 or so members will be on the Tesco bus. Only the selected dedicated
Tescos farmers will receive the 2ppl bonus in 12 months time post the
transitional period.
 
The penny will
drop very quickly with the realisation that the Tesco cheese model is not one
which automatically encourages production but one which pushes farmers to cut
cost to be the best. Tesco, by nature, will want the best farmers and thats
their direction of travel with their cheese and liquid models and those who
dont want to listen or deliver will be dropped. 
Tesco have
confirmed that they anticipated in excess of 100 dedicated producers from First
Milk and Parkham will be involved in the cheese group by April 2017, including
all 26 farmers currently supplying Parkham Farms.
 
The new cheese
model will cover all Tescos British hard cheese.
 
Note, one of
Tescos competitors, Lidl, are out to tender for cheese at the moment and
thats making grown man cry! 
 
CORRECTION & Apology  (8th April 2016)
0.43ppl milk price reduction for suppliers to
Waitrose  from 1st April (PRODUCER NOTIFIED)
The resulting
standard liquid litre price will be 31.55ppl not 19.4ppl as incorrectly quoted
in last weeks bulletin. Apologies.
 
It's no April Fool as DEFRA's average
UK milk price soars by 11% and 2.48ppl in February!   (4th April 2016)
According to DEFRAs latest UK average farm
gate milk price calculation the average February milk price soared by 2.48ppl
and 10.8% from 23.09 to a whopping 25.57ppl!
 
Ian and others have challenged both AHDB and DEFRA
over what they believe is a wholly irresponsible and totally misleading
calculation, but to date DEFRA is digging their heels in and refusing to
explain the numbers or back down while AHDB seems to be sitting back
putting absolutely no pressure on DEFRA whatsoever to review the
figure. In an email received by Ian from DEFRA they basically stand firm on the
numbers.
 
The 2.48ppl uplift predominantly
originates from Arlas 13th payment to members amounting to
0.73ppl. The bean counters in DEFRA have allocated all 0.73ppl (around
Ł22million) of Arlas 13th payment to Februarys milk income,
as opposed to spreading it across the whole year to the tune of around 0.2ppl.
At least Arla and www.milkprices.com allocate the
0.73ppl across each month.
 
Frankly, this is just ridiculous and
irresponsible and paints a far, far rosier picture of the dairying situation
than is the case and sends completely the wrong signal to everyone. At 25.57ppl
the industry would not be in difficulty, although losses would be made by many
farmers still, let alone be in crisis!
 
So let's consider the implications:  FFA
held a march in London a few days ago and delivered a letter to The Prime
Minister outlining the crisis the industry faces.  David Cameron will
respond, but if he sees the average UK milk price paid to farmers for February
INCREASED by 2.48ppl he will say Whats the problem Handley & FFA and
farmers? Stop moaning! And it doesn't look as if AHDB Dairy wants to do
anything about this absurd portrayal of the reality of the current
crisis situation! GET A GRIP AHDB! CAN YOU NOT SEE HOW SERIOUS THIS COULD BE?
 
Once again, first out of the traps and onto
the case was George Dunn and the TFA, whose input and pressure is very
professional and visible. The farming press and media have also jumped onto the
story.
 
The issue is one of a number of dairy statistical errors
DEFRA have recently been pulled up on only this one puts its credibility firmly
on the line as well as the market intelligence at AHDB in terms of its potency
or impotency to persuade DEFRA to issue a
correction. DEFRA have now stated that they hope to produce a February average
milk price excluding bonus payments by 28th April. This is a
very poor show given to obtain this information they only need to contact a
handful of the 34 milk purchasers they survey.

Buckle
up this could last until Spring 2018!    (4th April 2016)
Westland, a New Zealand dairy co-op and milk

Muller
to close its Aberdeen and East Kilbride processing facilities  (4th
April 2016)
A 45 day consultation period has commenced with
staff at Mullers Aberdeen and East Kilbride facilities, which will affect 229
employees as well as 43 dairy farmers in Aberdeen.
 
Assuming the closures are confirmed all 43
dairy farmers will be given the option to continue milking and for the milk to
be shipped to Bellshill, however, it will mean a flat rate deduction of 1.75ppl
for the 300 mile round trip.  The same
distance as Aylesbury to Leeds minus the M1.
 
Any producer who does not wish to supply
Bellshill and wear the transport charge deduction can leave after 12 months
notice and will not have to pay the charge during their notice period.
 
Muller have stated that its currently
Aberdeen Dairy is operating at only 40% of its capacity, which is a key factor
in the move.
 
In addition, Muller has announced a three
year investment programme in its Bellshill plant amounting to Ł15 million.

FFA
march is a credit to the Handleys and all involved    (24th
March 2016)
Estimates suggest around 2,000 people joined
yesterdays FFA march in London and there is little disputing the fact that if
some had fully backed and promoted FFA and the Handleys more numbers could
easily have ramped up to 5,000.  However,
it was a well organised peaceful march which received widespread media coverage
for the right reasons.
 
It was so successful that a second march on
Wednesday 22nd June will take place just 24 hours prior to the EU
referendum.
 
German
co-op informs its farmers exactly how it is   (24th March 2016)
German dairy co-op Milchwerke Berchtesgadener
has circulated a very blunt flyer to its members, which amongst other things
features two highway STOP signs.
 
The poster basically instructs its members
to:
 
(a)  
Stop
producing additional unwanted milk
(b)  
Stop
using milk powder to feed calves and to use raw milk
 
The flyer states that the co-op has its back
against the wall and all they can do with the extra milk is to sell it on the
spot market for 17 Cents (13.4ppl).  It
also states that the co-op has seen deliveries from members increase by 11% and
continuing to grow resulting in our dairy is now close to collapse and in
the name of all members of our co-op we request you reduce the milk supply.
 
Meanwhile, GB production is on target to be
up 3% for the year ending 31st March 2016 with cow numbers up.
 
First
Milk announce plans to convert around Ł60 million loan capital into tradable
shares   (24th March 2016)
First Milk under Mike Gallacher have taken yet
another bold step in a bid to re-shape the business and this time its a
complete re-shaping of its capital structure.
 
The move comes almost 12 months to the day
since Gallacher took up the challenge to turnaround the fortunes of the
business and it is perhaps his biggest and boldest decision.
 
Total member loan capital is estimated by Ian
to be in the region of Ł60 million and one of the key points is that by far the
lions share belongs to existing supplying members.  It is clearly the interests of those
supplying members and the future of the business that Gallacher and his new
board decided to make the change.
 
Unless they were numerically naďve by
February 2015, at the latest, all First Milk current and former members had
psychologically written off receiving any capital repayments.  In early 2015 the talk was that First Milk
were sinking quickly and most farmers were worried whether they would lose both
capital, milk cheques and be forced out of dairying with nowhere to go.  A number feared the writing was on the wall
and there was no one banking on capital repayments.
 
Gallacher surprised most by taking on a huge
turnaround challenge and on this occasion had a straight choice.  Do we do whats in the best interests of the
current supplying members and the business or whats in the interests of those
who have ceased to supply?
 
The capital restructuring announcement was
made on the 17th March, a week ago, and Ian has had a few enquiries
from members but no complaints because most seem to understand the situation
that the Ł60 million loan capital is set against minimal nett asset value,
which could easily be in the region of 10p in the Ł1.  Put bluntly, the situation whereby First Milk
continued to pay out the capital Ł1 for Ł1 was unsustainable.
 
Trading in the shares is some months away but
if Gallacher his team invest wisely in the business it should by default
increase the share value.
 
Intervention
ceiling is doubled   (24th March 2016)
The European Commission has doubled the
volume of SMP, which can be placed into intervention at the full price
(1698/tonne) to 218,000 tonnes. 
Simultaneously it has lifted the quantity of butter which can be placed
into store from 60,000 to 100,000 tonnes. 

 
The aim is to stabilise the market,
particularly through the imminent spring flush, however, the more product which
goes into intervention stores the more drawn out any recovery will be because
it has to come out of store on to the market within a relatively short time
frame.  Hopefully the intervention price
is at a level which will dissuade most, if not, all EU dairy farmers from
producing more milk and ideally less.
 
AHDB
backs milk promotion and market development with up to Ł3.5m   (24th
March 2016)
AHDB Dairy has revised its three year
business plan and one outcome is a board decision to allocate up to Ł3.5m
over three years for promotion and market development.  This is an additional Ł1.8m on top of the
previously allocated Ł1.7m.  Note, the
exact wording states up to Ł3.5m.
 
The plan is for AHDB Dairy to work with Dairy
UK to apply for European Union co-funding to boost the total pot.
 
Never
forget to kick a man when he is down   (24th March 2016)
Congratulations to Public Health England who
have issued new dietary guidelines in an Eatwell Guide recommending that our
consumption of dairy is cut by 50%.  The
guide is circulated to GPs, nurses, midwives, schools, teachers, dieticians,
nutritionists and caterers.
 
The best analogy Ian heard was that its like
knowing someone is dead but for Public Health England to load its gun and shoot
another bullet into the head to be sure. 
Just when dairy farmers thought it couldnt get worse.  Public Health England give them another
kicking.  It wouldnt happen in countries
like France & Germany.

Watsons Dairies (Medina) short notice changes to
milk contracts   (11th March 2016)
Watsons Dairies have
given less than one months notice of a change to producers milk contracts,
which means from April 1st seasonality will be introduced for the
rest of 2016 and into 2017.  This will be
a one way negative downward price adjustment only of up to 1.5ppl on deliveries
in the period April to July and up to a 1ppl deduction for the period August to
January (2017).
 
Any aggrieved
producers have the option to serve 20 weeks notice to terminate their milk
contract if they give proper notice by around the 24th March. Note,
this date must not be relied on and is based on the fact the letter to
producers was sent out on the 3rd March.

Farmers for Action march attracts evil forces   (11th March 2016)
There are strong

encouraging both sponsors, businesses who have pledged support and the farming
press to pull back or at least dilute their enthusiastic promotion.  The question is why would they spend time
doing this?

Paynes
dairies edges back into profit after cutting farmer prices    (12th
February 2016)
Thats a headline from an article in the Grocer which goes onto
report that Paynes 30th April 2015 profit of Ł69,000 reverses two
years of losses and is some way off the 1.6 million profit in 2010. From the
outside it looks like Paynes, fell into the same trap as others in 2012
to  2014 trying to keep up with the likes
of Arla in the price it paid producers for milk. 
 
PTF
scoops the Top Industry Award for a 2nd consecutive year   (12th
February 2016)
The Provision Trade Federation (PTF) has been named Best Trade
Organisation at the Food Management Today Industry Awards for the second
consecutive year.
 
The PTF represents in excess of 90% of the UK trade in Dairy and
pigment but its in dairy where those involved in the UK Dairy Industry
regularly appreciate its forward thinking regular updates, alerts and market
predictions.
 
Its dairy predictions and market outlook simply eclipse and dwarf
the very basic outlooks produced by other organisations. 
 
For example, in its latest edition it calculates that 20% of the
milk cheque money goes to 12% of the dairy farmers with the expectation those
12% (1500 farmers) will soon take 25% of the money, the 1500 farmers are those
on   retailer aligned contracts (Tesco,
Sainsburys, Co-op, Waitrose, M&S, Nestle etc).
 
In Scotland the figure is closer to 40% going to 23% of dairy
farmers.
 
 On a more amusing but never
the less serious note there is an opening article in the PTFs latest dairy
update headed 
            Our Father, who
art in heaven
Reporting that 140 representatives of the European Milk Board
(100,000 members) met his Holiness Pope Francis in late January at the Vatican
where they were blessed and all prayed for divine intervention. 
            Hats off to them
for doing something that doesnt involve tipping milk in the streets or burning
tyres. Given that The Almighty hasnt got much on his plate these days the job
should be sorted quite soon commented Walkland in the PTF bulletin.
 
The Author of the PTFs Dairy report is Chris Walkland who will
make a guest appearance at the NFU AGM Dairy Break out session at its
conference in 10 days (23rd & 24th February) time
where he will provide a Dairy Market Outlook & update. Its sure to be hard
hitting with no primary school basic analysis as to where the UK Dairy Industry
is and what the outlook for the rest of 2016 and beyond is.  
 
First
Milk pricing changes see the A litres increased from 80% to 90%   (12th
February 2016)
First Milk has written to members confirming a schedule of pricing
changes which take effect from April 1st
 
The key changes include the following:
 
A). The current A literage will increase from 80% to 90%.
 
b).  A new milk price index
will be utilised to track First Milks price against its main competitors and
will be independently audited by www..milkprices.com and reported to members on
a quarterly basis.
 
c). The current complex matrix of milk price schedules will be cut
and this will be simpler for First milk to manage and      easier for members to audit and monitor.
 
d). For members supplying First Milks Haverfordwest and Lake
District Creameries there will be a transport charge ranging from zero to
1.5ppl according to the distance between the factory and the supplying farm.
 
e). Move money will be paid for quantity and less on hygiene.  There are more details on this to be
circulated to members and whilst there will be winners and losers the nett
overall effect to First Milk are basically cash neutral.  In other words its NOT a sneaky price cut
but a re jig which is market related and visible.    
 
Another disastrous GDT auction  (Tuesday 2nd February 2016)
Todays GDT
auction results were nothing short of a disaster with the average price
plunging 7.4% to US$2276.
 
All products
dropped in value compared to the results achieved only two weeks ago, in
particular, WMP which suffered the heaviest fall down 10.4% (US$236 tonne to
average under US$2000 tonne).
 
Notable movers
were:
 
WMP                down                 10.4%   to
average US $1952/tonne
Butter               down                 8.3%     to
average US $2905/tonne
Cheddar            down                 4.2%     to average US $2807/tonne
SMP                 down                 2.2%     to
average US $1792/tonne
 
The WMP crash
prompted an instant reaction from several New Zealand processors whose farm
gate milk price is now at or close to $4 compared to an industry wide accepted
breakeven figure of $5, which the majority of New Zealands diary famers need.
 
One significant
contributor to the fall is credited to the lack of demand from countries
heavily dependent on oil revenue.
 
1ppl milk price reduction for suppliers to Joseph
Heler Cheese  from 1st March (PRODUCER NOTIFIED)  (5th February 2016)
 
ASDA confirm its commitment to Arla until at least
2019  (5th February 2016)
There were
concerns that following the Tesco decision to switch around 40% (180 to 200
million litres) of their Arla supplied milk to Muller that other retailers
would jump on the merry-go-round piling further pressure on non aligned milk
prices.
 
Whilst such
pressure from ASDA cannot be completely ruled out they have at least
re-affirmed their commitment to source all its circa 600 million litres of  fresh liquid milk from Arla until 2019.
 
In addition Asda
has confirmed it will continue to support and promote the Arla (quality) mark
landed last year with a minimum price guarantee of 28ppl.
 
Given this
commitment it must surely be fair to assume that as part of the new 3 year deal
a minimum price at a similar level of around 28ppl will be part of the package.

 
Meadow Foods to hold its March milk price (5th February 2016)
Meadow Foods have
written to suppliers confirming that the March milk price will be stand on
meaning a standard liquid litre price of 19ppl (www.milkprices.com)

Private Storage Aid extended (5th February
2016)
The European
Commission announced last Friday that it has extended Private Storage Aid (PSA)
for butter and skimmed milk powder until September 30th, 2016.  PSA was scheduled to close at the end of
February.  Regrettably, the announcement
didnt mention a an extension to the PSA scheme for cheese..
 
Under PSA
processors retain ownership of the products and receive EU payments for leaving
them in store off the market
 
 
Responses to AHDB Dairys 3 year business plan  (5th February 2016)
Following several
requests Ian has decided to publish his response to the AHDB Business
Plan.  Click on this link: Ian
Potter response
 
In addition, Kite Consultancy have published their
response. Click on 
http://www.kiteconsulting.com/getattachment/856687c8-5511-4126-8a10-f18dc4d18665/Kite-comments-on-AHDB-Corporate-plan-13-1-16.aspx
 
A couple of Kites
comments jump out at readers: They (Kites clients) think it (AHDB Dairy) produces far too much
information that is relatively basic, focused on average operators.
 
Also Many also believe that
some of the intelligence work AHDB Dairy carries out is a waste of time and
resources.  There is no need for Market
Intelligence to report on general dairy news, which is more than adequately
covered by the general farming media, industry websites and social media.
 
In AHDB Dairys
news article published 11th January the commentary read:
 
A recovery in prices to
more sustainable levels for the whole supply chain is needed but, when this
will happen, and how quickly, relies on a combination of three key events: a
reduction in milk production, the sale of excess stocks and a rise in demand. This supports the view that it is, indeed, teaching Grannie to suck
eggs. If a dairy farmer doesnt understand those fundamentals there is no hope!
 
Another comment in a previous report from AHDB
diary stated that one of the really important findings in the report was that
there is a big gap between current farmgate prices for aligned and no aligned
fresh milk.
 
As one farmer emailed  No shit Sherlock and we pay
levy money for this sort of commentary which is about as much use as tits on a
bull! 
 
From emails Ian
has received there appears to be a significant number of levy payers who want
to see AHDB Dairy bin its 3 year plan and rewrite it, in particular with an
emphasis to support domestic dairy promotion, assist with an export strategy,
help farmers in these unprecedented times to make tough decisions and big
changes as well as up their game on communication and what is currently below
average market intelligence commentary.
 
AHDB states
that  AHDBs dairy staff and Board have been out meeting
and listening to levy payers in Scotland, England and Wales.  Well they might be
claiming to listen, but the jury is out as to whether its board will take any
notice or change!
 
One things for certain
they are going to have to overcome their genetic phobia of associating
themselves as the messengers for bad news when attempting to inform farmers of
what they term as news.
 
NFU Vs AHDB   (5th
February 2016)
In Robert Forsters
excellent Beef Newsletter he recently referred to a disagreement between The
NFU and AHDB, which appears to be spearheaded by the high heels of presidential
candidate, Minette Batters. Her stance is evidently in contradiction to the
position adopted by both the current and former NFU presidents Meurig Raymond
and Peter Kendall.  
The snippet reads
as follows:
 



 
If Meurig wants to
calm the waters in the run up to the NFU presidential election by supporting
his old mate Kendall it could be his ultimate downfall.  Farmers across all sectors want someone who
will stand up for them and make a difference.
 
As a famous quote
goes Anyone can hold the helm when the sea is calm
 
That sea is far
from calm now so far as the UK dairy industry is concerned or AHDB and its
three year plan.

AHDB Dairy price reporting back on the radar   (5th February 2016)
DIN has
highlighted the decision by AHDB Dairys Market Intelligence analysts to cease
publishing an average wholesale cheese price whilst continuing to publish the
MCVE price.
 
Given the fact
anyone with any idea of how to add up can calculate the cheese price from MCVE
its a puzzle as to why publication of a key price like wholesale cheese has
ceased.
 
DIN commented that
It is believed that
AHDB Dairy are not publishing a mild Cheddar quote because they dont trust the
market reports they are getting.
 
Ian questioned the
cheese price quoted by AHDB in his October Dairy Farmer article. He questioned
AHDB over who they contacted for prices, tonnes traded and how the average was
calculated.  Alas, the response was Its
commercially sensitive information.  It
appears that since that article no cheese price has been published.
 
Its likely that
in obtaining their prices either AHDB analysts asked the questions in the wrong
way, leading to questionable answers or simply took shortcuts.  Similar concerns have been voiced over AHDBs
bulk cream prices as to what questions are asked, and to whom, in arriving at
the published prices.
 
Dairy UK publish its Export Strategy (5th February
2016)
Dairy UK have
published UK Exporting Dairy to the World, where they highlight whats
required to allow the industry to unlock the potential in international
markets.
 
In the report is a
list of actions and recommendations that will boost our exports, including
creating a one-stop shop for dairy exporters. 
 
Farming Minister,
George Eustice, commented Exports are a crucial part of growing and strengthening the dairy
industry and a key part of our plan is to see new markets opened, so that the
sector can become more resilient, competitive and profitable.
 
Now, how do the Ministers
words of encouragement fit with AHDBs three year zero budget to help exports
and this strategy? As it stands they dont, and a revolt is brewing.
 
500 jobs axed at Arla  (5th February 2016)
Arla has announced
its global restructuring including a 500 head count reduction.  Staff involved are expected to all be
consulted and notified by mid March.
 
Its a sad fact
that across the world dairy processors of all sizes are cutting back on staff
in order to remain lean and competitive.
 
In addition to announcing
its plan current head of Arla UK Peter Giortz-Carlsen will take on the new
position as Head of Europe and his UK role will be taken by Thomas Pietrangeli
who is currently in charge of Arla Denmark
 
Another disasterous GDT auction   (3rd February 2016)

auction results were nothing short of a disaster with the average price
plunging 7.4% to US$2276.
 
All products

Tesco
drop industry bombshell moving circa 180 million litres of milk from Arla to
Muller (1st
February 2016)
Speculation on the shock surprise by
Britains biggest retailer Tesco to switch up to 200 million litres of its
Tesco aligned milk from Arla to Muller has now been confirmed and its piled on
the negative PR, the Tesco Comms Team will have to wrestle with.
 
Ian has exchanged emails with Tesco and had
several conversations with them as he attempted to obtain answers to basic
questions for example:
 

Is the litreage
     involved circa 200 million?
When does the
     switch take effect?
Whats the
     reason e.g.; money, quality, service.

 
All three questions are currently
commercially sensitive and a secret, however the switch will not take place
until after the spring flush.  So on the
basis Tescos track record is not to do anything for free one has to assume
that money is changing hands as usually happens when big milk volumes
switch.      
 
 
For GB milk its neutral. For the chosen few
in Muller its good news, for the rest it will further fuel the argument that
the non aligned (the have nots) are subsidising the chosen few.
 
Many in the industry believed that Mullers
take over of Dairy Crests liquid division effectively making 3 liquid
processors become one would be good news for the industry but following this
move the jury is out.
 
What
it means for Arla?   (1st February 2016)
Tesco have stated that the Arla Tesco direct
farmers will
be protected and continue to be aligned directly to Tesco.
Translating this must mean that if the 300
million or so litres Arla retain of the Tesco liquid business the Tesco Arla
directs are protected.  This means the
200 million or so litres Arla has lost is a loss to Arla Co-op members at the
Tesco price.  More evidence that the non
aligned are paying for the chosen few.
 
This sounds very much like a deal has been
struck to favour Arla (direct) Tesco producers which is certainly not one of
the core foundation stones a Co-op is built on of working of working for its
members.
 
In addition Tesco Arla directs look likely to
be one of the last dominos with the announcement of a 3.25ppl price cut and the
real possibility that in 12 months time their milk will need to find another
home unless this market turns North before then. 
 
 
Arla now need to find a home for an extra 200
million litres of milk. In addition with immediate effect no Arla member can
switch to become an Arla Directs or vice versa. 
This means whatever happens to the Tesco Arla Directs they will not be
able to join Arla as members.
 
Lets hope the Tesco move doesnt energise
the liquid merry go round where the only people who cant afford the ride are
dairy farmers.
 
John Beckett 1935  2016  (1st February 2016)
It is with
great sadness we announce the passing of John Beckett after a long and
distinguished career in the agricultural industry.
 
John was a highly
respected Director of Belton Cheese and recently retired as Chairman of the
family business.
 
Away from
Belton Cheese, John has been a champion for the dairy industry.  He has been a past President of the Royal
Association of British Dairy Farmers (RABDF), Chairman of Cheshire County
Landowners Association and in 1977 he became the Chairman of NWF Group for 11
years.
 
In 2012 John
was presented with the Royal Association of British Dairy Farmers Princess
Royal Award.  The honour was made for his
outstanding services to the industry. The following year John received the
National Agricultural Award from the RASE.
 
The
transformation of Genus is probably one of Johns greatest achievements. In
1994 John was appointed Chairman and 7 years later the Genus business became
the biggest breeding company in the world, trading in 70 countries.  
Despite
wearing many hats, Johns passion was to help young people acquire the business
knowledge that he felt was lacking in some parts of the industry, believing
that if farmers are to compete on more equal terms they need to fully embrace
the science of management.
 
To this end
John established the MBA Agrifarm Charitable Fund, administered by The
Worshipful Company of Farmers, which would enable enterprising farmers to study
for an MBA alongside executives from other sectors at the Cranfield School of
Management.  This is an initiative that
will pay dividends for generations to come. 

 
John was also
past Chairman of The 300 Cow Club, Farmhouse Cheesemakers Ltd, Goodwins Cheese
Ltd and M K Richmond Ltd John Deere dealership. He was a Liveryman of The
Worshipful Company of Farmers and Honorary Fellow of Royal Agricultural Society
of England.

Tesco  guilty again     (25th January 2016)
The Groceries Code Adjudicator (GCA)
Christine Tacon has today published her report into her investigation into
Tesco PLC in terms of how Britains biggest retailer has failed to comply with
the supply code of practice. Her conclusion is simple: Tesco have seriously
breached paragraph 5 of the code. 
In her report she states she found
evidence that Tesco deducted or deferred payments owed to suppliers for goods
with some payments taking up to two years to be paid by Tesco.
In addition, she saw instances where
Tesco overcharged or underpaid supplies without rectifying the matters.
It was clear from the evidence that a major
focus of the Tesco Commercial Team during the investigation was on hitting
budgeted margin targets.
Its a report full of examples about
Tesco charging extra fees, delaying or failing to pay, and for its buyers
leveraging (i.e. leaning on!) suppliers.
She concludes her report with five
recommendations and I guess if she could add number six it would be for her to
fine Tesco for its breaches (legally she cant.)
Tesco could be fined Ł500m   (25th January 2016)
This comes on top of an ongoing Serious
Fraud Office investigation into the Ł326 million Tesco accounting scandal. One
city analyst has warned that Tesco could face a Ł500 million fine for the
scandal. The big question will be who will Drastic Dave Lewis get to pay the
Tescos fines?
Do leopards change their spots? We shall see, but they certainly dont
change into pussy cats. At the moment they look as if they have the morals of
an alley cat     (25th January 2016)
Britains biggest retailer (but far
from being its favourite) Tesco are having a PR kicking on a scale never seen
before in the UK with any retailer. 
Drastic Dave Lewis, CEO, will be
scratching his head with his bean counters as to how he can prop up his margins
and pay the fines whilst turning in a healthy profit. Its a near certainty
Tesco will find a way for suppliers to pay for its errors and mistakes because
that how the track record reads. We had better hope, pray and be ready to
ensure that Tescos dark forces dont try and recoup their fines, lost margins,
and lost routes to margins by pick-pocketing hard working dairy farmers in an
already crippled dairy industry (thats apart from its pampered directs whose
bonus money indirectly comes from non-aligned farmers). If they do the industry
will have to put differences to one side and stand shoulder to shoulder to take
them head on, no matter how big they are.
Tesco V NFU   (25th January 2016)
The Tesco PR nightmare and how the NFU
handle it is now favourite to be the deciding factor at next months NFU
elections. Deputy president Minette Batters won over most of the audience with
her measured, professional presentation at the Semex conference two weeks ago.
President Meurig Raymond will get his main chance at the NFU conference at the
end of February.
Who will have the nerve to go head to
head with Tesco, because that is what is required and what will make or break
the presidential bid. Career defining speeches beckon, and the reputation of
Tesco and its allies in the supply chain are hanging in the balance.
Will the next NFU president wear black
lace up shoes or high heels? Either the way, as the Nancy Sinatra song goes,
the boots need to be made for walkingwalking all over Tesco until it really
does change its spots.
 
1.5ppl milk price reduction for Grahams Dairies
(Scotland) producers from the 1st
February   (22nd January 2016)
This takes
producers standard liquid litre down to 22.25ppl.
 
0.8ppl milk price reduction for Arla members  from 1st February   
(22nd January 2016)
This is 1 Euro Cent
and takes producers standard litre price to 21.81ppl liquid & 22.68ppl
manufacturing (www.milkprices.com).  The 0.8ppl comprises of a 0.75ppl price
reduction plus a 0.05ppl forecast 13th payment increase.
 
GDT Auction down 1.4%   (22nd January 2016)
This weeks GDT
Auction average continued to head South with the average price down 1.4% to
US$2,405/tonne.
 
Notable movers
were:

Cheddar down 3.4%       to average         US$2867/tonne
SMP down 3.2%            to average         US$1835/tonne
WMP down 0.5%           to average         US$2188/tonne
 
 
Whats coming down the line?    (22nd January 2016)
Between now and
February 1st it is a near certainty that most, if not all, milk processors
have already decided to announce price reductions for 1st February
or 1st March.
 
There is simply no
light at the end of this tunnel, in fact the tunnel is getting longer each
day.  A group of farmers in Scotland are
reporting a current brutal 14ppl milk price and post 1st April it
could easily be lower when they are forced to change the destination of their
milk.
 
Add to this
rumours of one or two extremely aggressive liquid processors (one XL and one
medium) raiding existing contracts by offering eye-wateringly cheap milk to
attract new and existing customers and the end result is simply lower ex-farm
gate milk prices.  Its grim and its
going to get a damn site worse.
 
AHDB Dairy Market Intelligence raises eyebrows  (22nd January 2016)
AHDB Dairy
attracted the attention of two eagle eyed Potter bulletin readers with their
news item produced by the Market Intelligence Department.
 
The top story was
headed DAIRY MARKET RECOVERY RESTS ON THREE KEY FACTS
 
It went on to
explain that A
recovery in prices to more sustainable levels for the whole supply chain is
needed but, when this will happen, and how quickly, relies on a combination of
three key events: a reduction in milk production, the sales of excess stocks
and a rise in demand.
 
As one reader
commented Is this the sort of Peter & Jane market analysis our levy money
pays for?  Heaven help the famers who
hadnt figured this out months ago.
 
Llaeth Cymreig Accounts show Ł714,000 loss  (22nd January 2016)
The accounts for
the milk processor to the 31st March 2015 show a Ł714,000 loss and
declare that a much lower loss of Ł70,000 has been recorded in the period April
1st 2015 to October 2015.
 
Worryingly is the
note on page 4 of the Independent Auditors Statement indicating the existence of a material uncertainty which may cast
doubt about the companys ability to continue as a going concern.  In the Directors report they, like others,
incurred significant losses having to deal with surplus milk.  They refer to an extra 143 artic loads of
milk amounting to 4 million litres and state the calculation summary as
resulting in a 12 to 15ppl spot market sale loss.  12ppl x 4 million = Ł480,000.  They certainly are not alone with such
problems.
 
1ppl milk price reduction for Muller Wiseman  -  from 15th February (15th
January 2016)
The new standard
litre prices will be:
 
21.35ppl Muller
Wiseman non-aligned.
20.69ppl Muller
Direct (ex-Dairy Crest liquid).
 
Increased volume payments boost Glanbias farm gate
milk price by 0.25ppl (15th January 2016)
Whilst Glanbia
decided to hold its February milk price its increased volume bonuses mean a
standard 1 million litre producer will benefit from a 0.25ppl increase and for
those producing more than 20,000 litres/day it is worth 1.5ppl.
 
The volume bonuses
increase the www.milkprices.com
liquid standard litre to 19.68ppl and its manufacturing standard litre
increases to 20.34ppl.
 
First Milk exit Westbury (15th January 2016)
First Milk have
wanted out of Westbury for some time to rid themselves of what has been a
millstone and now they have concluded the deal to exit the facility for an
undisclosed sum.  For First Milk
relieving itself of the burden to pay half the cost of running the Westbury
plant with a one off payment to Arla of a few million will be good business and
further evidence that Mike Gallacher is determined to turn the business
around.  
 
Westbury Dairies
Limited is now 100% owned by Arla along with the site, which Arla acquired in
December 2013.
 
Arla are now free
to further develop the 750 million litre a year site where it currently
produces Anchor butter, own label butter for retailers as well as powder.
 
Its a certainty
that First Milk do not require circa 350 million of balancing capacity with a
maximum 1 billion litre member milk field only to lose money on every litre of
milk processed through Westbury. 
Actually some might claim in doing so First Milk were carrying a
balancing charge and running half a plant to benefit the rest of the UK dairy
industry.
 
Note going
forward, First Milk have negotiated preferential access to the facility during
the Spring flush and at other times.
 
The exit from the Westbury joint venture is another
smart  move by Gallacher in connection with his  turnaround plan. The
savings from the exit form Westbury should unlock milk price moves for members
in the coming months. 
 
Ian has also been reliably informed that First Milk
are now on the front foot and actively looking for additional milk in Cumbria,
West Wales and the West Midlands.
 
First Milk Sharpens its act again  by name and by
nature (15th January 2016)
Experienced
businessman Clive Sharpe has filled the position of First Milks Chairman from
February 1st, following the departure of Sir Jim Paice.
 
Sharpe has been
involved in food manufacturing for 35 years and comes with an impressive CV
having been Chairman of Quorn Foods and Burton Biscuits, former CEO of WT
Foods, Golden Wonder and Homepride Foods and former non-executive director of
Duerrs Jams and Tangerine Confectionery as well as his current role as
Chairman of Peters Foods, which he retains.
 
Looking at his
track record he certainly appears to know his way around the food industry and
hasnt previously shied away from challenges. He is badged as a self-made down
to earth man, with experience and buckets of energy.  On paper it should be considered a coup for
First Milk to get someone with Sharpes pedigree and experience.
 
 
Meadow Foods under attack (15th January 2016)
The NFUs Dairy
Board chairman has lambasted Meadow Foods in a press release following its
13.7m pre tax annual profit announcement.
 
In the release he
highlights the fact that Meadow languish at the bottom of the milk price league
table. According to AHDB Dairy they sit only second from bottom.
 
The NFU has hit
out at the fact Meadow pay one of the lowest milk prices, do not participate in
the Voluntary Code of Conduct have no formal producer representation and last
week announced that only 80% of the A litres delivered from April will receive
the headline A milk price.
 
Ian admits that
until he posted his news item on Meadows decision to cut the A litres it pays
for milk to 80% from April he hadnt appreciated how much anger and unrest
there is among Meadow producers.  
 
Intervention storage increases (15th January 2016)
During the past
couple of weeks the quantity of SMP placed into EU intervention stores has
escalated with EU wholesale SMP prices now trading below the Intervention level
of 1698/tonne (approximately Ł1280/tonne), which is a 6 year low.
 
In the past four
weeks to 4th January, 16,286 tonnes of SMP have gone into EU
intervention representing a 54% increase in the tonnage placed into store.
 
Of the total
46,639 tonnes of SMP offered into intervention nearly 5% (2,183 tonnes) has
originated from the UK.  In December a
token 882 tonnes of SMP were removed from EU intervention stores.
 
Butter stocks
offered into EU Intervention have also steadily increased with 166,914 tonnes
by 4th January of which 4.2% (7,065 tonnes) originated from the UK.
 
Arla launches BOB brand (15th January 2016)
Arla has launched
the Arla Best of Both (AKA Arla BOB) branded milk, which utilises the same
filtration process used with Cravendale and they claim it tastes as good as
semi-skimmed and has taken three years to develop.
 
It is on sale at
RRP Ł1.50 for 2 litres and Ł1 for 1 litre packs and will be launched and
supported by a Ł7 million advertising campaign, including TV campaign, which
starts on 8th February.  Its
classed as a fat free containing no more than 0.5% fat. Its more innovation,
and hopefully more added value milk from GB processors.
 
 
Danish Dairy Farmers to receive EU cash (15th January 2016)
The Danish Government
have decided to pay the lions share of the $12 million (Ł8.4 million) the
country receives from the EU emergency agriculture aid fund to its hard pressed
dairy farmers who are having difficulty making ends meet.

GDT
auction prices down on average 1.6%    (8th January 2016)
There were no surprises in the first auction
of the year, which continued to trend slightly down.
 
Notable price movements were:
 
Cheddar            up         3.5% to average US $2964/tonne
SMP                 down     0.8% to average US $1890/tonne
WMP                down     4.4% to average US $2210/tonne
 
UK
milk production continues to rise   (8th January 2016)
November milk production totalling 1.163m
litres shows a 3.8% (43m litre) increase on that recorded in November 2014.
 
In the first 8 months of the dairy year to
the end of November the UK has produced an extra 303 million litres (+3.13%) compared
to that produced in 2014 equivalent to an extra 1.26 million litres everyday.
 
Meadow
Foods milk price calculation changes   (8th January 2016)
Meadow Foods will change how they pay
suppliers from April 1st with the A price paid on 80% of producers
100% A (quota) allocation with any remaining production paid at the B litre
price.
 
Is this a price cut, a price adjustment that
will be more or less neutral or will producers never know the truth?
 
The reality is just like most, if not all,
milk processors Meadow simply has too much milk on its hands and a limited
number of resignations and/or farmers quitting. 
With this move Meadow have decided to spread the risk across all
producers making those who produce any B litres plus 20% off the A litres take
the pain.
 
If Meadow are paying the A price on only 80%
of the milk it should mean that the A price improves.  If that happens the adjustment will be
neutral and if the B price is say 15p those who produce the extra litres bear
the pain until prices turn the corner and head North.  At this point the B price will be the first
move and will drag the A price up with it.
 
Only time will tell whether Meadows A price
improves on April 1st.
 
MCVE
and AMPE continue to head south   (8th January 2016)
AHDBs dairy market indicators MCVE and AMPE
next month are likely to both hit their all time record lows.  The December MCVE stands at 18.9ppl and AMPE
at 16ppl (see the table at the top of this bulletin).
 
Dutch
cull cow slaughtering rocket with 1.5ppl premium   (8th
January 2016)
Within a matter of hours cull cow prices in
Holland fell 15 cents per kg (11p/kg) as cow numbers sent to slaughter rocketed
resulting in slaughter houses bursting at the seams and waiting lists forming.
 
One of the key factors has been the decision
by Friesland Campina who are now paying a 2 Euro cents kg (1.5ppl) to members
who supply the same or less milk between 1st January to 11th
February compared to the base period of 13th to 27th
December.  It does not apply to organic
producers where extra milk is required. 
The fact is Friesland Campina members are producing far more milk than
the company requires or can handle.
 
US
blizzard results in 40,000 cattle deaths  
(8th
January 2016)
Over the Christmas period between the 24th
to 29th December, a blizzard called Goliath in Texas and New Mexico
saw an estimated 30,000 to 40,000 cattle die and hundreds of tanker loads of
milk fail to be collected.
 
Most of the animals perished in up to 14 foot
snow drifts created by 80mph winds and thats in what is geographically
described as a desert area!  Crazy
weather.
 
 
Snap
to it on Snaptags!    (8th January 2016)
Ian Potter Associates has, for the last 3
years, been actively marketing the Snaptag brand of cattle, sheep and
pig ear tags. Repeat orders from every customer (OK, with the exception of one)
speak for themselves in terms of their quality and durability. Basically
they're the bull's/boars/rams nadgers when it comes to tags.
 
And this, of course, is the bull's nadgers
when it comes to dairy bulletins, which we send to you FOC because we're nice
people.
 
There is, though, no such things as getting
summut for nowt, and we strive to sell something on the back of it - hence
our plugs for these tags and the occasional request
for information for our database cleansing so we know who's genuinely
a dairy farmer and who's just pretendin'.
 
So if you've got livestock and are in the
market for tags (and even if you aren't - we're not fussy!) then give us a
call! Our general tags &
sample tags (BVD) are extremely
competitive so why not ask us to quote! Go on...you know you want to...

Arla to
hold its January member milk price but exchange rate takes 0.43ppl  (24th
December 2015)
Arla members on account milk price for
January deliveries will be a stand on. 
 
However, the three month average exchange
rate mechanism results in Arla GB members milk price reducing by 0.43ppl to
give a standard litre price of 22.61ppl.
 
The exchange rate mechanism adjustment is
an unwelcome Christmas present but its unavoidable and Arla farmers were aware
and given fair warning that it was coming down the track to hit them.
 
Dairy
Crest buy remaining share of GOS business for Ł6million   (24th
December 2015)
Within days of the 27th of
December sale completion of its liquid business to Muller, Dairy Crest (DC) has
confirmed its purchase of the remaining 50% share of the GOS business Promovita
from Fayrefield Foods Limited for Ł6 million.
 
The Promovita business was a joint venture
between the two set up last year to develop GOS which is a prebiotic for use in
baby powders.
 
The sale gives DC full control of the
business alongside its Ł20 million GOS production investment at Davidstow,
which is due to be in production in early 2016. The Ł20 million is part of a
Ł65m investment in the plant with the remaining Ł45 million invested in the
production facilities for demineralized whey powder at Davidstow.
 
The powder will be marketed and sold by
Fonterra and the Chinese Governments decision to relax the one child per family
rule to two children from March is perfect timing for DC and its new venture.
 
British
(Welsh) Daioni Organic products into China    (24th December 2015)
Full marks to Lawrence Harris and his team
from Daioni Pembrokeshire in becoming the first Organic Dairy Board to receive
Chinese Quality Certification.
 
The Company recently took the bold move to
exhibit at the Beijing Trade Exhibition and is all set to export its brand into
China having a recently appointed a brand manager in China.
 
Daionis exports will be Organic flavoured
milk and milk shakes produced on its family farm from milk from their own herd.
 
First
Chinese baby powder plant in New Zealand completed  (24th
December 2015)
Yashilis Ł92 million baby powder factory
in New Zealand is now completed and in production and will aim to produce 1,000
tonnes of baby powder each week aimed at the chinses market.
 
End of
Year food for thought   
(24th December 2015)
One end of year International dairy
publication headline stated Last year makes dairy farmer wiser and
poorer.  Next years could easily state
survival of the fittest which in reality means those who succeed in coming out
the other end of this big trough should be stronger, fitter and wiser. For most
Dairy Farmers 2016 at first glance looks Dark and Grim.   
 
 
This crossed Ians desk a couple of weeks
ago and whilst its a serious matter it also makes you smile.
 
Suffolk man had sex with 450 tractors
 reproduced with the permission of the Suffolk Gazette   (24th
December 2015)
 
 
 
 
 
A
Suffolk man with a bizarre sexual attraction to tractors has been banned from the
countryside and forced to sign the sex-offenders register.
Ralph
Bishop, 53, was found by police with his trousers around his ankles
interfering with a tractor parked in a field outside Saxmundham.
 
He was arrested
on suspicion of outraging public decency, and admitted to having had sex with
around 450 tractors all over the Suffolk countryside.
 
When
officers searched his terraced home they found a collection of more than 5,000
tractor images on his laptop.
 
The
photos showed Bishop had a special desire for John Deere and Massey Ferguson
tractors, particularly green ones.
 
A
police insider said: We couldnt believe it when we found him in the field. He
was wearing a white t-shirt and Wellington boots and very little else. He was
clearly in state of high excitement at the rear of the machine.
Thankfully
nobody else was around, but the field is close to a village primary school so
we had to arrest him and educate him about the error of his ways.
He
told us he was particularly in to axle grease and the presence of this around
the back of tractors was all too much for him.
Bishop,
twice divorced, was released without charge on condition he sought
psychological help. He was put on the sex-offenders register.
He is
also banned from the countryside and is now not allowed to go within one mile
of a farm, the police insider added. So he has to live and remain in the
middle of Ipswich to comply with that.
However,
we are watching him because we are worried about the safety of several
street-cleaning machines.
Another
policeman added: Hell also need to keep away from the towns gardens  if he
takes a fancy to a lawn mower he might find he loses more than just his
liberty.
 
 

Real Complaints to Councils - You couldnt make them
up  (24th
December 2015)
Extracts
from letters written to local   councils: 
1. Its
the dogs mess that I find hard to swallow.   
2. I want some repairs done to my cooker as it has backfired and burnt my knob
off.   
3. I wish to complain that my father twisted his ankle very badly when he put
his foot in the hole in his back passage.   
4. Their 18 year old son is continually banging his balls against my fence.
  
5. I wish to report that tiles are missing from the outside toilet roof. I
think it was bad wind the other day that blew them off.   
6. My lavatory seat is cracked, where do I stand?   
7. I am writing on behalf of my sink, which is coming away from the wall.
  
8. Will you please send someone to mend the garden path? My wife tripped and
fell on it yesterday and now she is pregnant.   
9. I request permission to remove my drawers in the kitchen.   
10. 50% of the walls are damp, 50% have crumbling plaster, and 50% are just
plain filthy.   
11. I am still having problems with smoke in my new drawers.   
12. The toilet is blocked and we cannot bath the children until it is cleared.
  
13. Will you please send a man to look at my water, it is a funny colour and
not fit to drink.   
14. Our lavatory seat is broken in half and now is in three pieces.   
15. I want to complain about the farmer across the road. Every morning at 6am
his cock wakes me up and it's now getting too much for me.   
16. The man next door has a large erection in the back garden, which is
unsightly and dangerous.   
17. Our kitchen floor is damp. We have two children and would like a third, so
please send someone round to do something about it.   
18. I am a single woman living in a downstairs flat and would you please do
something about the noise made by the man on top of me every night.   
19. Please send a man with the right tool to finish the job and satisfy my
wife.   
20. I have had the clerk of works down on the floor six times but I still have
no satisfaction.   
21. This is to let you know that our lavatory seat is broke and we can't get
BBC2.   
22. My bush is really overgrown round the front and my back passage has fungus
growing in it.   
23. He's got this huge tool that vibrates the whole house and I just can't take
it anymore.   
1.724ppl
retail supplement addition for Muller Wiseman producers  (18th
December 2015)
This is the November
deliveries supplement paid to producers on the standard non retailer aligned
contracts.
 
0.57ppl Muller Wiseman formula price
reduction   (18th December 2015)
 
The reduction will
apply for deliveries in January to March inclusive and takes the standard
liquid litre price down to 17.67ppl. (www.milkprices.com)  
 
GDT    (18th December 2015)
The average price of
this weeks auction crept up a little by 1.9%. 
The anticipation from analysts was for WMP to see a double digit
increase of 10% plus however the reality was only a 1.8% lift.
                                                           
Key prices were:
 
ˇ        
Butter
average US $3136/tonne + 9%
ˇ        
WMP
average US $2304/tonne + 1.8%
ˇ        
Cheddar
average US $2856/tonne + 1.1%
ˇ        
SMP
average US $1891/tonne + 0.2%  
 
First Milk successfully concludes its
refinancing package   (18th December 2015)
Mike Gallacher and
his commercial gurus have successfully agreed terms with Barclays and Lloyds to
extend loans well ahead of the 1st February deadline.
 
This sends a very
important signal to members that the same two banks have clearly decided the
turnaround plan looks good consequently both have decided to support it.  I doubt in this environment either of the
banks have been charitable or in the Christmas spirit so one assumes they have
detected confidence is the plan.
 
First Milk Members vote for a Commercial
Board   (18th December 2015)
At a special General
meeting this week Members unanimously approved First Milk governance shake up
which will see only two farmers on the board.
 
The day of
enthusiastic amateurs believing they have the necessary skills to help run
First Milk by sitting around the board room are finally over.
 
For continuity its
likely one of the two farmer positions will be filled by one of the existing
farmer board members and the hunt is on for the second who could come from the
existing board or could be a new face. 
Whoever it is he or she simply has to come with a proven track record in
the commercial world and not just in milking cows.  Gallacher has to have a very commercially
focussed board and he is almost there.
 
It is late for First
Milk to realise the serious damage its governance and management team has done in
the past 3 to 4 years but as they say its better late than never and its time
to turnover a new page for 2016.       
 
What next for First Milk   (18th
December 2015)
The announcement of a
new commercially experienced chairman should come in January.
 
The goal for 2016
must surely be for Gallacher to significantly close the gap between First Milks
lower member prices and its competitive set. 
If signs of that appear in the First half of 2016 the talk will no
longer be whether First Milk can survive but more that it will have turned the
corner which some may claim has already happened in 2015.
 
There are signs of
glimmers of hope for First Milk but sadly in this environment they will come
too late for some members
 
 
1.425ppl milk price reduction for Dairy Crest
formula contracted producers  from 1st
January (11th December 2015)
This comprises of
a 1.6ppl reduction as a result of the re-basing announced 12 months ago and a
positive +0.175ppl increase in the 5 parameters used in the formula for
November.
 
Note, the
adjustment means there will still be a 3.6ppl advantage in favour of the
formula liquid standard litre (25.37ppl) compared to the Dairy Crest standard
liquid (21.81ppl).
 
1ppl milk price reduction for Booths Supermarkets
suppliers  from January 1st  (11th
December 2015)
This reduces
producers www.milkprices.com
standard litre price to 32ppl, still a chart topper.
 
1ppl milk price reduction for Wensleydale Creamery
suppliers  from December 1st
This reduces
producers www.milkprices.com
price to 22.75ppl on the liquid standard litre and 23.82ppl for the
manufacturing standard litre.
 
Southern Irelands November milk production +50%    (11th December 2015)
This was the
headline in an Irish Farmers Journal article where estimates claim an
additional 150 million litres of milk were processed in Southern Ireland in
November compared to November 2014.  The
range extremes used were +22% for the processor Aurivo to +76% for Dairygold.
 
Note, in November
2014 over production resulted in many dairy farmers cutting production and
drying off cows early, which a factor is contributing to the seismic increase.
 
Milk price
prospects do not look great between now and 2020 at 23 to 24ppl?  (11th December 2015)
The European
Commission has published a report Prospects for EU Agricultural Markets Income
2015-2025
 
The report
predicts the world will increase milk production by 16.1 million tonnes a year.
Of more concern is the prediction that the EU is expected to be the area which
will see the highest production increase and the highest world exports increase
with around 50% of the extra milk produced in the EU going into powders for
export whilst 30% will go into cheese. This all means that the EU will
account for almost a third of all dairy product traded on the world market. So
effectively, as if we didnt realise it before, the extra dairy products will
have to be exported.
 
Of more concern is
the expectation that for the next four years plus to 2020 the average EU milk
price will run between 32 to 33 Euro Cents kg or 23 to 24ppl at todays
exchange rate with very slow recovery  from the current lows
 
Arlas Vision to 2020 (11th December
2015)
Arla has published
its 2020 growth strategy in which it anticipates its 12,700 members will
increase milk production by 2.5 billion kg by 2020.
 
Arlas strategy

Consultation is open on AHDB Dairy Business Plan
2016 to 2019  Ian urges Dairy farmers are urged to have your say (11th December
2015)
 
AHDB, including
AHDB Dairy, has launched a consultation on its 4 year business plan and budget
to 2019 in which they are particularly interested in answers to the following
questions:
 
Do you agree with
the proposed activities for the dairy sector? If not, which activities will
make the biggest difference to improving the competitiveness of dairy, and
why?  
 
What
levy funded activity (ies) in your view could be stopped, and why?
 
Do you
agree that levy rates should remain unchanged for 2016/17?
 
Any other comments
you have on the Plan
 
Ian has studied
the plan and was stunned to learn that if dairy farmers assume AHDB Dairy is
facilitating exports of surplus dairy products they can think again. Their
current budget to help dairy exports is a nice round jaw-dropping zero, nothing
and nowt!
 
It is the only
AHDB sector that fails to have a budget to assist exports. The other five AHDB sectors (EBLEX, Cereals/Oilseeds, Horticulture,
Pork and Potatoes) all show an average Ł1.05m a year allocated to export
development until 2019. Yes, thats a total Ł5.24million a year compared to the
black sheep of dairy which hasnt allocated so much as Ł1. 
 
In the 2014/15
year AHDB Dairy received total nett income of Ł8 million and spent Ł8.1
million. Levy payers are urged to send even a brief email with your thoughts as
to whether you believe AHDB Dairy will invest the levy tax to deliver the
maximum benefit to you, based on the plan and budget. 
 
The Dairy Board
and its chairman have to be challenged as to whether their plan is the best way
of spending the money and, with increased milk production, they should surely
be asked why they have decided not to allocate any funds to promote dairy
consumption domestically or to exports. If invested professionally and correctly
this is very likely to enhance the profitability of all British dairy farmers.
There is no demand creation plan at home or abroad, but presumably the AHDB
Dairy board have good reasons for this.
 
I am beginning to question
whether the AHDB Dairy Board fully understand the implications of having a
strategy to produce more milk (i.e., the current one) without having a strategy
one to actually deal with it.  At least
we all know they have a strategy to ensure they spend all of the extra levy
money they collect.  Do they actually
know which direction the UK dairy industry is heading?
 
Instead processors
are having to explore exports in their own whilst farmers produce milk at 30
year record levels.
 
Back in 2010
Northumberland sheep farmer Graham Dixon took on EBLEX on behalf of group of
sheep farmers when he stated we want more say in how our levy money is
spent.  We must direct more of the levy
money towards a new marketing and promotion campaign! The result was a joint
attack by EBLEX to bolster both exports and promote consumption of lamb by our
own domestic consumers.
 
Ian also believes
Ministers should be looking at the budget and plan before they sign it
off.  The Secretary of State claims she
stands behind exports but there is no real substance to her claims. Both DEFRA
and AHDB are keeping their hands firmly in their pockets.
 
Its ironic that
AHDB have declared that they are picking out the best bits from each sector and
rolling them out across the piste, yet this doesnt appear to have affected the
dairy sector where they have ignored export development completely.
 
Alternatively, you
might have a view on the necessity or not for AHDB Dairy to continue to spend
significant amounts on genetic and genomic evaluations when a number of
competent private operations are already at the cutting edge of this field. Is
this a case of using levy money in areas which are already been adequately
serviced by others?
 
As one person
commented to Ian this week AHDB Dairy needs grabbing by the scruff of the neck
on this issue and it needs some real leadership.
 
Ian will be making
a submission to AHDB on its dairy business plan and hopes all of you will too,
even if its only a few lines by email. 
He has tried to contact both its Chairman Gwyn Jones and its Strategy
Director on the export issue. Both opened the email a week ago, but neither has
found the time to respond.
 
This consultation closes at 17.00 hours on
Wednesday 13 January 2016 - Responses can be submitted by email to ruth.ashfield@ahdb.org.uk or
via post to Ruth Ashfield, AHDB, Stoneleigh Park, Kenilworth,
Warwickshire  CV8 2TL.
 
Allegedly,
feedback from this consultation will be considered when the plans are finalised
in January before submission to Ministers for approval.

Of the 13 people
included in the Muller fresh milk top team four have transferred to the Muller
camp from Dairy Crest under a Bosman ruling including Lyndsay Chapman who takes
the role of Agriculture Director.

Year.
 
In
addition, it will continue to show retailer supplementary payments both
transparently and separately each month.
 
The
supplementary payment is calculated on actual sales after each month end and

an early unwelcome Christmas present in the form of a 0.6ppl milk price
reduction.
 
According to our records this is the first
and only December 1st liquid milk price reduction to be announced.
 
First Milks half year finances show
a  small profit   (27th
November 2015)
In contrast to the First Milks recent end of
year accounts where it stated that the business had continued to be loss making
to the end of September 2015, the co-op has announced that it has made a small
profit in the same period. It made an operating profit of Ł1.1million compared
to a loss of Ł7.6million in the corresponding 6 month period in the previous
year.  It has also declared that it anticipates its full year end results
will return a profit at 31st March 2016. The reason for the
difference in the two versions is that in the end of year accounts they
included figures for the exceptionals, whereas this latest announcement is
restricted to the day to day activities excluding the one off costs.
 
During the same six month period debt,
excluding member capital contributions, has reduced from Ł60.7million at 31st
March to Ł46.1million at the end of September.
 
AHDB appear to have grown some hairs and,
dare I say balls, with a refreshing up front analysis of  First Milk financials.
 
They have pointed out in their news section
that its effectively the farmer members who have taken the pain, which has
resulted in the six month profit declaration. In other words its the
significant farm gate milk price cuts which are the main reason for the
turnaround.
 
AHDB estimate that in the six month period
April to September 2015 the milk price paid to First Milk members was 4ppl plus
adrift from its competitive set.  Note, the set does not include
retailer aligned COP milk prices.
 
This 4ppl figure compares to the same period
in 2014 when the gap was less than 1.5ppl. The difference to the half year
financials of a milk price gap of 4ppl to that of 1.5ppl amounts to Ł15
million, so in effect, if First Milk had continued to maintain a 1.5ppl or less
difference between its paid out milk price and that of the competitive set it
would have shown a Ł15m loss but as it is that loss has been shouldered by the
members in the form of a much lower milk price.
 
AHDB comment It
appears that from April to September 2015 a big part of FMs turnaround in
fortunes was achieved by passing lower prices onto its farmer members

First Milk sells Kingdom Foods/Glenfield
Dairy business   (27th November 2015)
First Milk has agreed to sell its struggling
Glenfield Dairy Business (AKA Kingdom Cheese) as a going concern to rapidly
expanding Scottish family business Grahams for a yet to be disclosed sum.
 
The business was acquired by First Milks CEO
Kate Allum in May 2011 for Ł5million, which included Ł1.4million towards an
outstanding loan.
 
At the that time the employees numbered 140
and when the sale is completed in the next few days the staff head count
transferred to Grahams will be 79, which is a big chunk of First Milks 400
head payroll when it reduces to 320 (-20%).
 
The business predominantly produces cottage
cheese/soft cheese and Quark and has some key retail customers, for example
M&S & ASDA.
 
The venture has archived next to nothing for
First Milk during its ownership and is estimated to have lost in the region of
Ł1million a year.
 
Its no secret that the plant requires
significant investment to remove some of the labour intensive operations. On
that score either Grahams will attract some funding to make the improvements or
alternatively they will surely be weighing up the costs of moving some of the
useful kit to their new greenfield site project.
 
In terms of milk supply, from the day that
Grahams take over they will utilise their own milk, leaving First Milk to find
a new home for their extra milk, which is unlikely to be an exciting profitable
prospect for the first half of 2016.
 
First Milk what next?    (27th November 2015)
The fact that the finances show a small
profit is perhaps the first real evidence that after almost 8 months at the
helm CEO Mike Gallacher is starting to visibly demonstrate that his mission is
to turn the business around. This will
undoubtedly be encouraging to First Milk members and the expectation is that
further positive news will be forthcoming very soon and likely next month.
 This includes an announcement on a new Chairman, who must surely be
very commercial, a different board structure with less farmer involvement and
more commercial experience, the outcome of the refinancing deal with the
Barclays and Lloyds and further divesting of interests allowing Gallacher to
focus on his core business of making quality cheese for Adams to sell. These are just some of the announcements members
are  waiting for.
 
At the same time as all of this is going on
he desperately needs to deliver a significantly improved member milk
price.  For sure all of these deals take time to put in place and time isnt
a luxury Gallacher has on his side, however, for those who were circling like
vultures believing there would be some First Milk easy pickings to be had they
will now realise Gallacher may have come to the table late but he is setting
his stall out to slim down and turnaround the business rather than let it sink
during his watch.  He has a lot of work to do and a long way to go but the
indications that he both has a plan and will execute it.
 
Only 30,000 lucky farmers are set to
receive their BPS payment next week 
(27th November 2015)
The RPA has announced that only 30,000
English farmers will receive their annual BPS payment next week.
 
Those who will not be paid by the end of
January will receive a letter very soon informing them that they will be paid
after February but with no current facility for an on account or partial
payment.
 
 
Arla holds members milk

0.086ppl milk price formula increase for Dairy Crest
formula contracted producers  from
December 1st   (20th November 2015)
This takes producers standard litre to 26.80ppl for those on simplified
and core formula and 26.99ppl for those who signed with the extra premium in
April 2014.  The upward movement is
attached to the improvement in the cream price.
 
1.751ppl Muller Wiseman monthly retailer supplement   (20th November 2015)
Muller Wisemans non-aligned producers will receive an extra 1.751ppl on
their October deliveries.
 
GDT auction prices fall for the third consecutive
auction   (20th November 2015)
Its certainly a roller coaster ride so far as GDT auction prices are
concerned.
 
During four auctions in August, September and early October, the average
auction price rose 56% but admittedly it came on the back of a disastrous run
of 10 consecutive falls to all time records lows.  On the 6th October the average all
products price was $2834.
 
Now GDT has experienced three consecutive falls pulling prices back
17.2% to this weeks average of $2345.
 
Notable price movements:
 
WMP                down     11% to average US $2148
SMP                 down     8.1% to average US $1851
Cheddar            down     5% to average US $2874
 
Note, the quantity of product on offer at this weeks auction was down
11.6% (3953 tonnes) to 30,044.
 
Glanbia Cheese boost volume bonuses   (20th November 2015)
Glanbia Cheese will introduce a welcome revised volume bonus schedule
from 1st February and all deliveries will see a positive benefit
other than anyone who produces less than 1,000 litres day where its no change
to their bonus.
 
The bonus increases range from +0.05ppl for those delivering an average
1,000 to 2,499 litres day to +0.45ppl for deliveries averaging 20,000 litres
plus each day making their new bonus +1.5ppl.
 
With
friends like these who needs enemies?  (20th November 2015)
With Farmers For Action once again giving
retailers a beating to try and get them to pay more money to farmers comes news
this week that Morrisons has had a beating for (wait for it) paying more money
to farmers via its successful Milk For Farmers brand.
 
And starting the beating was none other than
the magazine which says it is Working for Your
Farming Future i.e.  The Farmers Weekly. In an article on the 10th November
Philip Case wrote that A supermarket shopper has accused Morrisons of
misleading the public over its premium milk brand.  Note, only one complaint from a so called
consumer!  He went on to write about
something every Arla farmer has known all along, in that the additional money
raised goes to all Arla farmers across Europe and not just to UK ones. 
 
What he didnt say was that all of Arlas
product revenues such as the brand giant Lurpak was also spread across UK farmers,
and not just with Danish farmers where the product is made. He also printed (on
line) the extensive exchange of emails from the shopper, who is Mr Brown from
Derby, who has since confirmed he has lodged a complaint with the Advertising
Standards Authority.
 
The story was then picked-up by The Sunday
Telegraph on the 15th November, and subsequently by other news
outlets, including the Farmers Guardian.
 
Thus, in one fell swoop through a wholly
irresponsible piece of journalism that does nothing for any dairy farmers
future, The Farmers Weekly has potentially compromised not only the Morrisons
milk brand but other such schemes as well which could have put more money in
farmers pockets.
 
With regards to the article in todays
Farmers Guardian it is more balanced than the very one sided view printed in
Farmers Weekly.  However, I do take issue
with their claim The chain
has received a barrage of criticism from farmers who said consumers had been
duped into thinking the extra money would benefit only UK producers. 
I dont believe The Farmers Guardian hold sufficient evidence to
back up the use of the words a barrage of criticism because one complaint is
hardly a barrage.  Also, is the use of
the word duped correct?
 
Morrisons have 11 million customers a week.
One complaint = .0001% of its weekly shoppers. And the Farmers Weekly made a
story out if it. Shameful.
 
No doubt all of this will give FFAs protestors
much to talk about as they wait on the picket lines in the cold until the early
morning hours.  A sponsored coach trip
and picket line outside FWs HQ at Quadrant House, Surrey is now under
consideration.
 
 
Whats
good for the Goose is good for the Gander  (20th November 2015)
On the 19th October this bulletin reported on
the onset of dirty tactics against Morrisons Milk for Farmers brand, and
reported on the Twitter activity from the Midlands milk company Nemi Milk, made
by the feed company Independent Feeds Ltd. It accused the Morrisons brand of
misleading consumers and posted tweets comparing the brand and Arla to FIFA,
and even sending Liz Truss messages about someone milking British public
emotions and the UK dairy crisis. The milk is shameful, the marketing
ill-informed and Arla is a co-op who deliberately misleads. It is a
#scandal.
 
Since then a Richard Brown from Derby who
has a lifetimes experience of farming has admitted on Facebook that he has
submitted a complaint to the Advertising Standards Authority over the milk (see
above story with friends like these who needs enemies). Although it has not
been proven yet, there is a strong suspicion that there is a link between
Richard Brown and Nemi Milks / Independent Feeds boss Andrew Henderson, who
denied on Twitter that he contacted Trading Standards. Whether they know each
other or not really doesnt matter, however. Both clearly have a gripe that
Milk for Farmers is misleading. The ASA will no doubt rule over time whether the
brand or the marketing is, or isnt.
 
Mis-representation or elaboration of any
facts surrounding a product would, of course, be the last thing that anyone in
the industry would want. 
 
To that end, therefore, Ian is now
questioning the credentials on which Nemi Milk is marketing its milk as
Britains First Natural Antioxidant Plus milk and milk that is naturally
enriched with selenium.
 
Under EU rules all health claims on food
products have to be approved by the EU, of course. Currently claims for antioxidant
properties are not-authorised, which makes Nemis claim somewhat, er, suspect.
For selenium a claim may only be made where the increase is at least 30%
compared to a similar product.
 
Needless to say the necessary investigations
have been out in train to make sure that the claims Nemi Milk is making also do
not mislead consumers. If they do then that will naturally also have to be a
matter for The Advertising Standards Authority or Trading Standards to
investigate. After all, whats good for the goose is good for the gander!

it.  Shameful.

GDT results are a rollercoaster   (6th November 2015)
This weeks auction saw all prices pulling back significantly compared
to those recorded only two weeks ago. 
The average all products price fell on eye-watering 7.4% with all
commodities falling between 5% to 11%. 
Its certainly a rollercoaster and further confirmation that this is
going to be a long drawn out road to recovery.
Key price movers were:-
 
WMP                down 8% to
average $2018 tonne
SMP                 down 8% to

Dairy Crest half year results are not rosy   (6th November 2015)
Dairy Crest has released its half year results to the 30th

Tesco reviews will result in casualties and
opportunities   (6th November 2015)
The Tesco Sustainable Dairy Group (TSDG) have completed their review of
the milk purchasing scheme the result means opportunities for the best and
casualties in terms of the loss of their TSDG contract for the poor performers.
 
One of the key outcomes is that in future all TSDG producers will be
core producers with no seasonal producers and all will be measured and rated
annually on a traffic light system. 
 
Those who fall into the bottom 5% as the worst performing suppliers in
terms of animal welfare standards, milk quality, environmental management,
carbon foot printing and generally engaging with their customer Tesco will be
given six month notice of contract termination.
 
Once notice is served there will be a three month period when Tesco will
support these farmers in an attempt to improve their performance and score
rating. If, after that period, they have not achieved the required standard
they will be axed three months later.
 
Conversely the top performing 5% will received an extra 100,000 base
litres of production allocation, which will be an annual award with the extra
literage predominantly coming from suppliers who exit as Tesco suppliers either
voluntarily or who are axed.
 
Tescos two key liquid suppliers Arla and Muller Wiseman will now
compile a waiting list for the 150 new core producers who are required. The
list will be evaluated on a combination of geographical location and a score
card. Whilst current Tesco seasonal producers (estimated to be circa 300) have
a slight advantage in getting onto the waiting list many will fail the
geography test and the expectation is that completely new TSDG suppliers will
be required to make the numbers up. In addition, a Tesco young/new entrant
reserve pool will be created.
 
Participation in Promar costings could be considered optional in terms
of, if you dont want to participate in the costings you are free to supply
another buyer but not Tesco.  So its
compulsory for Tesco suppliers and whilst the 0.5ppl payment towards Promar
will be stopped it will be replaced by a standardized payment/subsidy per farm.
 
COP budget prices will change from twice a year to four times/every
quarter so far as the three Fs are concerned.
 
Tesco utilize a QVIS (Quality, Value, Innovation and Service) score card
as a transparent measure to rate all its suppliers and now it will be tailored
to dairy. 
 
Finally, the processor price matching clause is to be removed from the
contract in the event the non aligned price eclipses the TSDG price.
 
The idea is to bring the bottom up for those who want to engage. It
wont all kick off overnight but 2016 will be when the starting whistle is
blown by Tesco and a league table of producers will be created. Those in the
relegation zone after one year will drop off unlikely to be offered a second
chance as will those who refuse to provide Promar with their costings.  
 
Overall most farmers will realise its time to put up or exit as Tesco
suppliers if they cant achieve the standards. 
We have asked a handful of key questions about the new ideas to Tesco to
which we await a response which we will report back on. 
 
24
hours in the life of David Handley from Praise to Police  (6th
November 2015)
Farmers
for Action founder members David & Marilyn Handley have been threatened and
intimidated by a 35 year old Staffordshire dairy
farmer who also claims to be a spokesperson for breakaway group United Action
for Real Farmers.
 
The
threat came by text message and whilst it was a
long text the relevant sentence read:
 
. I
will be in your yard within hours to ram them where the sun does not shine The
threat was in relation to retired FFA Committee member Paul Rowbotom who
it appears is central to the breakaway groups organisation.
 
During
recent weeks the Handleys have been the subject of a number of playground taunts
on social media from the breakaway group but now at least one has turned to
threatening behaviour.
 
Its
similar to the 1970s when, in football, we had small groups called firms who
were convinced they were the best supporters and anyone who got in their way
got a good kicking.
 
Only
24 hours earlier the Handleys were a topic of conversation around a table of
dairy industry leaders where Marilyn Handley was once again referred to as the
unsung hero of the  UK dairy industry and David was congratulated for what
he and his FFA team & committee had achieved with retailers in recent
months.
Lets
be honest if you were David Handley you would be asking do I really need this
sort of aggro from a handful of Mavericks who by their own admission were not
very long ago staunch supporters and admirers of his efforts. Many would say
stuff this and walk away.
 
We have the contact details of the farmer whose
mobile phone was used to send the text as do the
Police and we are hoping it was sent without thinking. We contemplated exposing
the details but at this stage it would only fire up more trouble for those
involved.
 
 If you have any
comments email us so we can gauge the responses because threats of violence we believe cross the line.  In addition we understand the farmers   milk
purchaser is likely to be questioned as to whether it condones this behaviour
and whether such threats are a breach of his milk contract.  If the farmer
involved wants to communicate his thoughts   we
are happy to listen to his version. Alternatively
consideration of an apology wouldnt be out
of place if he feels one is appropriate.
Retailers
will be laughing their heads of at the fact our most passionate dairy farmers
who want to make a difference are squabbling and posting inappropriate messages
on social media about the Handleys. Come on lads Handley surely cant be the
enemy. Its a sad state of affairs.
 
Scottish
dairy farmers to give their views on repatriation of AHDB dairy levy  (6th
November 2015)
Following on from a lively well attended
dairy meeting organised by Mole Valley and SNFU in Coylton this week, the
suggestion to poll farmers views at the Agriscot event on 18th
November regarding repatriation of Scotlands producers AHDB dairy levy is on
the card.
 
Northern Irelands dairy farmers do not pay
the AHDB levy, however, they do pay a levy for milk promotion, which is topped
up by milk processors.  Whilst AHDB would
argue that repatriation of the levy money wouldnt raise enough money the fact
is in Northern Ireland they still succeed in raising and spending more money
for milk promotion than AHDB do in the whole of Great Britain.
 
Speaking
at the event, industry journalist Chris Walkland emphasised the great story
there is behind the Scottish Dairy brand and believes Scotland should sell its
brand by adopting the NI model, with money coming from either a new separate
promotional levy or by having promotion money coming out of repatriated AHDB
levies. "Where the money comes from is one for Scottish farmers to decide
on," he said.
 
A straw poll by the meetings Chairman of the
dairy farmers in the room showed that when asked how many of you believe AHDB
do a good job and are value for money? Not one hand was raised.

 
Gaff
of the week goes to Oliver McEntyre, Barclays Bank National Agricultural
Specialist   (6th November 2015)
Thank you to the readers who were keen to
alert Ian to a quote in the latest Holstein UK Journal/Newsletter. 
 
The Barclays National Agricultural Specialist
stated
 
 "From high input high output systems to low input
low input milk from grass systems, large herds to smaller ones, from the
uplands to the lowlands, the cost of production reaches towards 20p/litre in
some cases."
 
So with the current Tesco COP over 30ppl, is
this not simply and extremely unhelpful comment?  Was this 20ppl a typo or for real?
 
Chinas ending of its one child policy is big news for
world dairying  (6th November 2015)
China has announced its one child policy will end and with it comes the
expectation that up to 2 million extra babies will be born every year leading
to an estimated 10 to 20% boost in Chinas demand for infant formula as
produced by the likes of Dairy Crest and Arla. 
The move from the one to two child policy will happen in March 2016.
 
 
0.75ppl milk price reduction for Glanbia suppliers  from December 1st   (30th October 2015)
This is likely to
result in a standard litre price of 20.6ppl. 
Glanbia have also announced
a review of their volume bonus schedules to apply from April 1st.
One or two emails to Ian have suggested that in the current environment a
review means a negative adjustment. This is a bold and negative assumption and
is by no means automatic. 
 
0.6ppl milk price reduction for Dairy Crest
Davidstow suppliers  from December 1st   (30th
October 2015)
This takes
producers standard litre price to 23.24ppl (www.milkprices.com).  Note, this reduction comes with a guaranteed
price floor until 29th February so no reductions for at least three
months.
 
0.58ppl milk price reduction for First Milk cheese
contracted members  from November 1st   (30th
October 2015)
 
SMP Intervention almost dried up    (30th October 2015)
SMP going into
Intervention continues to decline.
 
A total of 3,116
tonnes entered Intervention in the two week period straddling August and early
September and now its down to 417 tonnes from France and Lithuania.
 
The UK has placed 1048
tonnes of the total 23,371 tonnes put into Intervention with the last
consignment from the UK in early August. 
EU wholesale commodity prices are gradually trending north, which will
be the key influencing factor.
 
Arla UK report losses of Ł88m    (30th October 2015)
First Milk
certainly arent the only UK processor to report losses.  Arla Foods UK division clocked up Ł88million
in losses in 2014.  Note, that is across
a 12,700 farmer pool (of which 3,000 are in the UK) who supply 13.5 billion
litres (UK share 3 billion litres).  So
on a ppl basis its tiny.
 
New Zealand milk production   (30th October 2015)
New Zealand has
now passed its peak production and nationally output is plummeting with
September down 7.2% on September 2014.
 
Glanbia is unlikely to be good news   (30th October 2015)
Glanbia has
announced the temporary closure of its state of the art Kilkenny powder plant,
which was officially only opened in March. 
The milk will now be diverted into one of its cheese plants.  The move is due to low returns on powder and
anticipated better returns on cheese. 
This means up to 3 million litres of milk/day is now going into Irish
cheese although production is much lower and the plant can be used on a
seasonal basis, which could be a factor in the shut down.
 
Lets hope the
move does not result in any more Irish cheese landing at our ports.
 
First Milk AGM  (30th
October 2015)
Surprisingly the
number of First Milk members who attended yesterdays AGM was similar to
numbers attending in previous years and certainly estimated to be under 40
actual member producing farms.
 
Another surprise
to some was that none of the existing farmer board tendered their resignations
or announced they will stand down when requested to do so.  However, some are almost certain to recognise
they have to shoulder part of the responsibility for the mistakes made and
follow Chairman Sir Jim Paice with dignity rather than believe they are
candidates for re-election to the new board, which desperately needs commercial
experience.
 
There will be an
SGM in December to adopt the new governance proposals following which First
Milk aim for a new slimmed down board to be in place for 1st
February.
 
At yesterdays AGM
a new farmer board member, Robert Craig, was elected as a non-executive farmer
director and farmer Jim Baird was re-elected to a similar position.
 
Sir Jim Paice
stood down as Chairman to be replaced by Vice Chairman, Nigel Evans, who stands
in as interim Chairman.  So for the next
three months and during the re-negotiation of the banking facilities the First
Milk board is more farmer orientated than before, which must be a concern.  As one person commented Gallacher desperately
needs a board focussed on the business not the farms and farmers.
 
The Great British Game Fair is born   (30th October 2015)
Hot on the heels
of the announcement that after 57 years the CLA Game Fair had admitted defeat
and closed its doors comes the welcome news that a new 3-day event at Belvoir
Castle, Leicestershire will take place on 22nd-24th July.
 
 
All of the articles below all relate to
First Milk and were posted on our website earlier this week
 
First Milks Accounts and Annual Report are grim
reading   (30th October 2015)
Ian takes little
pleasure in writing about First Milks financial results. But its members will
take no pleasure from seeing them.  On
receipt of the accounts he faced two choices:
(1)  
Take the easy route and skim the results saving a heap of time and money
or
(2)  
Take a detailed look and report his observations and the facts as he
sees them to his regular readers.  His
conclusion was to go for option 2 mainly because he feels he owes that to
readers, especially the FM members who find the delving challenging as well as
depressing.  He wont receive any
Christmas cards from either the First Milk Board or Management but the details
are there for members to study, and what is in the report needs to be aired.
 
Below are bullet
points relating to the co-ops accounts to 31st March 2015, which
Ian has pulled together with limited commentary highlighted in blue.  Note, all comparison figures relate to the
changes in the past 12 months. The detail is sobering, nay grim, and should stimulate
significant discussion at the AGM this Thursday (29th). For those
who want to check the facts Ian urges them to put these accounts before their
accountants requesting their comments and questions.  
The facts are these

Turnover was
     Ł442m, down 28% from Ł610.5m 

 

Ł8m loss due
     to cheese quality issues. This is huge, and unforgivable. But at least the new
     management team quickly accepted it, and have put in place strategies to
     improve.
Balance sheet
     reserves down from -Ł8m to -Ł45.1m. The numbers also confirm that FM held
     Ł50.9m of members capital retentions at 31st March 2015, with
     only Ł6m assets to set against this figure.There must surely be a case that the
     business should specify the capital repayment amount due from members who
     no longer supply them as a debt to the business. This should be separated
     from the capital held from members who still supply milk.  The way it is currently accounted for it
     is not transparent.
Capital repayments to leaving members delayed by one year to March
     2016, following which they are to be spread out over 3 years.  This added Ł9.3m to the pot.  

The harsh reality, which most members
already realise, is that the likelihood of members receiving any repayment of
capital is slim.  

Member capital
     retentions were increased from 0.5 to 2ppl from December 2014 to August
     2015.  This adds Ł15m to the
     financials if FM still handle 1 billion litres of members milk.  In addition, the member capital limit
     rose from 5ppl to 7ppl.
Barclays and
     Lloyds will provide a finance facility until 1st February
     2016.  The facility is payable on
     demand so First Milk depend on the two banks continued support. The
     facility available at 31st March 2015 was Ł62.2m. The
     Directors/Board state the current facility may need to be supplemented
     with additional borrowing and funding during this year. The
     existing bank loans ideally need to be extended, renewed or replaced this
     year.  There is no time for
     Christmas to get in the way!. If they arent then the new year leading up
     until February will be a very tense and uncertain time.
Pre-tax loss
     of Ł24.9m compared to a loss of Ł4.3m, but excluding one off exceptional
     costs in the year it was a loss of Ł23.5m compared to a surplus of Ł3.5m
     the year before. During the year FM consistently paid one of the lowest
     farm gate milk prices to members, but it still paid more out than the
     business generated.  In other words,
     FM should have cut the price they paid for milk harder and sooner, to
     perhaps the tune of towards an extra 3ppl throughout the year.

 

Producers milk
     payments continue to be delayed by 2 weeks, which has given the business
     around a Ł5m cash flow benefit. These delayed payments continue to favour the
     bankers at the expense of the members.
A Ł600,000 write
     off for a loan with First Milk Energy Limited
Poor financial performance of the CNP business, acquired in 2012,
     resulting in a significant reduction in the businesses valuation and a
     Ł1.2m adjustment charge in the accounts. Its a head
     scratcher to understand how come FM has ended up paying the farmer owners
     of the CNP business an extra Ł200,000 when the value of the business is
     impaired.  The CNP business has now
     cost FM Ł10.6m, and it recently lost its Team Sky contract (probably
     because it couldnt afford to renew it). This purchase must rank as one of
     the worst acquisitions ever in the British dairy industry, even top
     trumping DFOBs acquisition of the ACC business.
The Pensions
     Liability is a huge millstone around FMs neck, and is something former
     CEO Kate Allum tried to reduce in negotiation with government in 2013/14.

Nett pension
liability is up from Ł13.8m to Ł20.1m and growing at an alarming rate and needs
to be funded. According
to the accounts, FM are paying Ł2.3m a year but this simply has to increase or
the deficit will continue to increase unless someone can wave a magic wand.

Kate Allums
     total pay in the year was Ł332,000 and Sir Jim Paices was Ł90,000. Nice work
     if you can get it!
Directors and
     former directors continue to resign to supply other processors.
FM own 59.3% of Westbury Dairies Limited with Arla owning the
     remaining shares. This now looks
     to be a liability as opposed to an asset to FM. However, the volume of
     milk travelling from Scotland to Westbury is a concern if FM were to exit
     Westbury.
Staff numbers
     down from 649 to 430


ˇ        
FM have spent Ł2.1m reviewing the financial position of the business
along with its future prospects. That must be Ł2,000 plus per current supplying
member or 0.2ppl plus.  Where was it
spent and what real tangible value has it delivered?

 
In summary we refer
to the auditors report on Page 14:  The Group
incurred a loss of Ł27.5 million during the year ended 31 March 2015 and continued to be loss making for the six month period to
30 September 2015. Additionally, the Group's and the Society's
bank facilities are payable on demand and are
available until 1 February 2016. As set out in the directors'
report and Note 1 to the financial statements, the ability of the Group and the
Society to realise their assets and discharge their liabilities in the normal
course of business is dependent upon the adequacy of the bank facilities and
the continued support of their lenders, achievement of forecast financial
performance and securing financing for the period beyond the expiry of the
current facility. These conditions, along with the other matters explained in
Note 1 to the financial statements, indicate the
existence of material uncertainties which may cast significant doubt upon the
Groups and the Societys ability to continue as a going concern. This requires
no further commentary.
Both
the auditors and the directors cast doubt over whether the business can
continue as a going concern mainly due to the need to renew the banking facility
and to meet its financial performance projections.
Note, Ian is NOT an accountant and no one
should rely on this analysis as advice. It is Ians assessment based on recent
FM publications. No representation or warranty is provided as to the accuracy
of the information and it should not be used as a basis to make on farm
decisions.  However, it could be used by
members when questioning the board and management of FM, if they so wish.
Was First Milks claim - Slightly
better than break-even the reality? (30th October 2015)
In its 3rd July members
newsletter FM claimed the following:
 
April & May resulted in a
slightly better than break-even position. June is expected to be similar.
P&L is being run at marginal break-even
to ensure that milk price is max we can afford.
First quarter results is a
critical milestone and demonstrate the impact of changes so far.
 
Was this the
reality, though, and the truth? Or did it make a profit in April, May, and June
only to lose more than it made in July, August and September? The report issued
today clearly states that the business has continued to be loss making for the
six-month period to 30th September 2015. In addition, at that time losses
were stated to be around Ł22m but at the end of the day were 25% greater at
Ł27.5m.
 
First Milk Board lambasted in Governance Report  (30th October 2015)
 
First Milk has also
announced its action plan following its overdue independent review.  They key points are:
A 49 page
independent review by Greenburn into the governance of First Milk has
effectively lambasted its current board. 
In short it is distressing reading, especially the time line on pages 12
to 15, for FM members but at least the grim facts are now out in the open.
 
The conclusion is
unambiguous in that its Farmer Board is left wanting.  The report states there have been severe short comings in
governance both at Board and Senior Management level for a number of years.
This includes failure to follow conventional business practice in a number of
ways.
 
It goes on to say:
 
The Board of Directors lacked the
collective knowledge and experience to successfully navigate the business
forward .. and it refers to a
catalogue of inadequate accounting systems.
 
The Board are ultimately responsible for
ensuring the co-operative has a strong and sustainable business.
 
The authors
question whether the Board managed the CEO or was it the other way around?  They refer to The perceived lack of competence at Board
level, the Boards inability to understand the financial information provided
and the protracted decision making.
 
The report refers
to a lack of
leadership from the Board
 
This report is set
to go down in the UK dairy industry history books along the lines of the famous
Myners Report for The Co-Operative.  Its
hard hitting and leaves nowhere for those involved to hide. Frankly few, if
any, of the current farmers members of the First Milk Board should be up for
re-election.
 
The key recommendations
are:
 
ˇ        
The board will be reduced from 9 to 7 with an independent commercial
chairman
ˇ        
Going forward an elected farmer council of 7 members will represent the
farmer owners
ˇ        
Farmer board members will reduce from 5 to 2 with the aim of bringing in
more commercial board members.  One of
these farmers will be Vice Chairman.
 
ˇ        
Given the incompetence of the existing board few, if any, are likely to
be required under the new structure as board members.
 
First Milk continues to fail despite the recommendations of the
Governance Report  (30th October 2015)
The final insult for FM members is their
continued failure to adopt good practices.
Members have been given less than a week to
study the accounts and the report ahead of the AGM.  One Scottish member spoke to Ian today about
this and he was extremely unhappy. Highlighted in the Governance Report it
confirms that in May 2015 a review of FMs financial governance stated that:
The monthly reporting pack is often released for review too late in the
month for there to be any effective analysis done prior to Board meetings. 
In some cases only
24 hours before a meeting.
To give farmer members less than a week
must surely be inadequate given the state of the finances and the situation
their co-op faces.
So where is the good news?  (30th October 2015)
The reality is that
there is no good news in these reports, other than the fact that that the
senior management have gone and a new team are in place. Have they got the
skills to turn this business around? Have they got the time? We wont know
until January 2016 when we find out about the financing. There isnt much time
at all. 
 
Snap to it on Snaptags! (30th October
2015)
Ian Potter Associates has, for the last three
years, been actively marketing the Snaptag brand of Cattle, Sheep
& Pig ear tags. Repeat orders from every customer (OK, with the exception
of one) speak for themselves in terms of their quality and durability.
Basically they're the bull's / boars / rams nadgers when it comes to tags.
 
And this, of course, is the bull's nadgers when it
comes to dairy bulletins, which we send to you FOC because we're nice people.
 
There is, though, no such things as getting summut
for nowt, and we strive to sell something on the back of it - hence our
plugs for these tags and the occasional request for information for
our database cleansing so we know who's genuinely a dairy farmer and who's just
pretendin'.
 
So if you've got livestock and are in the market
for tags (and even if you aren't - we're not fussy!) then give us a
call! Our general tags &
sample tags (BVD) are extremely
competitive so why not ask us to quote! Go on...you know you want to...
 
For more information please contact Lydia on 01335 320016 or
email her on lydia@ipaquotas.co.uk.
 
Thank you, and we look forward to your custom and
to continuing to be able to send this bulletin out FOC.
 
Arla
to hold its milk price  (23rd
October 2015)
Arla is to hold its member milk price for November
and the price it pays it direct suppliers and organic suppliers for December.
 
The member standard litre price remains at 23.04ppl
for Arla AMCO and Arla Milk Link members. 
The Arla AMCO Tesco price is 23.74ppl.
 
In its communication to members Arla states The
outlook for the coming months is mainly stable, which in itself is a small
welcome glimmer of light from one of the European milk processing giants,
especially when you consider that UK and European milk supplies continue to
increase.
 
GDT
shows 3.1% downward blip  (23rd
October 2015)
The road to recovery was always going to be a rocky
one as demonstrated by this weeks auction results in which the auction average
dropped 3.1% on the back of 4 significant consecutive auction rises.  The quantity of product on offer was down
1531 tonnes (4.2%) to 34,519 tonnes.
 
Key results were:
 
Average price           US$
2735/tonne (-3.1%)
Butter                     US$
2850/tonne (-11.1%)
WMP                      US$
2694/tonne (-4.6%)
SMP                       US$
2178/tonne             (-4.5%)
Cheddar      US$
3163/tonne (-2.2%)
 
All in the global dairy industry expect prices to
continue to increase, however, further downward corrections this side of
Christmas are equally anticipated.
 
Muller
get green light on Dairy Crest acquisition but .!  (23rd October 2015)
UK Competition & Markets Authority (CMA) have
given the green light for Muller Wiseman to acquire Dairy Crests liquid business
having accepted the undertaking that Medina Dairies will have the facility to
toll processes up to 100 million litres of milk a year at Dairy Crests
Severnside factory in Gloucestershire. 
The deal will be completed on or before 26th December 2015.  
 
In a statement whilst the Ł80 million price paid
was re-confirmed it was accompanied with a Ł15 million allowance, which was
attributed and dumped on the CMAs modified undertakings.
 
This is a staggering figure and in simple terms if
Medina were to process the full 100 million litres a year for five years the
Ł15 million deduction equates to 3ppl.
 
The more likely reason for a sizeable part of the
deduction is that in addition to the modified undertakings with Medina, Dairy
Crests liquid business profits and performance has deteriorated and part of
this deduction is due to this hidden factor. 
However, Dairy Crest will still be delighted at the nett Ł65 million and
to be out of the liquid business by the year end allowing them and others to
focus on their cheese business, which is sure to be open to offers in 2016 from
European hunters. 
 
Dairy Crests shares were under Ł4 a year ago and
on the announcement jumped to Ł6.55 yesterday.
 
Medina
what next?  (23rd
October 2015)
Medina will have the facility to use the toll
processing for up to 100 million litres of milk but this does not mean they
will utilise the full facility during the 5 to 8 year period. However, Medina
are ambitious and intend to continue to grow their existing business.  
 
Medina stated to Ian its strategy is find customers
1st, milk sourcing 2nd . 
Ian believes this is very sound business policy and one some dairy
farmers should take note of.  
 
DairyCo/AHDB Dairy yesterday suggested in their
commentary that the Medina involvement means Medina will likely need milk
close to the factory to achieve it .. Farmers should be ready to compare any
offers .
 
Medina have confirmed to Ian that this is pure
speculation.  First job is for Medinas
commercial team to secure new long term sustainable business.  They then have the option to process their
existing farmers milk at Severnside or take milk from Muller Wiseman or a
hybrid of the two.  Recruitment of new
milk suppliers whilst possible is not on their radar so please dont form an
orderly queue because its likely to be a long wait.

New
Non-Executive Director at First Milk 
(23rd October 2015)
Until recently Carl Ravenhall was MD at Muller

He has now been appointed to the First Milk board.
 
First Milk will be in the news next week in the run
up to their AGM next Friday (30th) ahead of which their financial
accounts for the year will have to be released as will details of when Chairman
Jim Paice will stand down and who will take his place.  In addition, the independent review of the
co-ops governance announced on the 1st May is overdue (due summer) and
members will expect it on or before next Fridays meeting and must surely
recommend a re-shaping of its board.
 
1.54ppl extra to

Morrisons Milk for
Farmers is flying off the shelves 
(19th October 2015)
Firstly Ian has to eat a large slice of Morrisons own brand humble pie
and apologise for the fact he initially doubted the wisdom of the Morrisons
Milk for Farmers brand, and indeed referred to it as a gimmick.
 
The new milk was on the Morrisons shelves on time and sales are flying,
so much so that they caught processor Arla and Morrisons out, who both
underestimated its likely popularity. The office has
had several emails reporting of empty shelves with store managers receiving
complaints from customers that the milk was unavailable.
 
Initial sales are accounting for close to 10% of all Morrisons liquid
sales with the 10ppl premium/23ppl extra for a 4 pint carton going to farmer
members of Arla only.
 
Ian has made enquiries and Morrisons have not taken any money out of the
farmers pot to cover marketing or design and have stumped up the money from
their own coffers.
 
In addition, if the situation should arise whereby close to sell by date
Milk for Farmers has to be discounted this cost is shouldered by Morrisons
and not the farmers, so the farmers still receive the extra 23ppl.
 
So the early indications are that consumers ARE willing to pay an extra
10ppl, and if all of this carries on for the long term its a win-win for the
Arla boys.
 
Next on the supermarket shelves should be Morrisons own label cheddar,
which will sell for a 34ppl per pack premium equivalent to 10ppl.  If and when you spot it, please send us the
details.
 
Dirty tactics on
Morrisons milk  (19th
October 2015)
The success of the Morrisons Milk for Farmers appears to have aggrieved
a few people and brought the industrys dark side into play.  
 
Welcome to the bulletin for the first time Andrew Henderson from Crewe,
Cheshire, MD of a small liquid milk business Nemi milk, dairy nutritionist and
owner of a feed firm called Independent Feeds Limited. Hes well known to some
farmers on twitter as @Nemi Milk, and for his love of Arla-baiting, having
posted charming tweets comparing the Morrisons brand and Arla to FIFA, and even
sending Liz Truss messages about someone milking British public emotions and
the UK dairy crisis. The milk is shameful, the marketing ill-informed and
Arla is a co-op who deliberately misleads. It is a #scandal.
 
If that isnt enough he has picked a fight with David Handley and told
him that he has requested Trading Standards investigate the Morrisons brand.
The claims are the initiative and its delivery are illegal, and the move could
single handed stop the initiative. There is a possibility it could be withdrawn
from sale pending an investigation. If this happens it will enrage Arlas dairy
farmers on an unimaginable scale.
 
 
But Henderson isnt alone in his endeavours to stir the pot. Hail,
incredibly, Tesco supplier Roddy Catto, who is a founder member of the Muller
Wiseman Milk Group and until very recently its former chairman. And yes, you
read it right. Hes a Tesco supplier supplying no milk whatsover to Morrisons.
 
He went on local television wearing his Scottish NFU hat commenting on
the Morrisons offer: In the interview Catto states the scheme is a shambles
and How would I be able to calculate how much extra money Im going to get
from Morrisons?  That is an easy
calculation. Its zero. Consequently he should not have been commenting on a
Morrisons initiative.
 
For the full
interview click on:            http://news.stv.tv/north/1330565-morrisons-more-expensive-milk-for-farmers-range-a-shambles/
 
Next, and not to be left out of the murk comes dairy farmer Stuart Heath
from Staffordshire, who is one of Muller Wisemans farmers who sits on the
Tesco Sustainable Dairy Group Committee and, again supplies Tesco, not
Morrisons. He also was on national TV commenting on the Morrisons initiative
and was also less than complimentary about it. For the full interview click on:      https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5sCEybRrqc&feature=youtu.be&a
 
Questions are flying around as to why, only a day or two before the CMA
announce their decision on the takeover of Dairy Crests liquid business by
Muller, that two high ranking Tesco-Muller Wiseman farmers end up on TV
commenting in a hugely negative way on the Morrisons initiative. Quite what
Tesco say about the ethics of two of their farmers commenting so publically and
critically on a rival is one that Ian intends to find out. 
 
In addition, since the announcement on the 6th November 2014
that Muller Wiseman intended to buy Dairy Crests liquid business (which has
been ratified by the CMA today  google CMA accepts remedy in dairy merger) the deal has had a clean run. Journalists, media, industry
organisations and competitor processors have been careful not to jump in with
their size nines. And yet within hours of the deadline for the announcement by
the CMA we have these antics. One of the videos could be put down to naivety;
two of them are definitely questionable; two plus the Trading Standards
referral certainly dont look as if they are accidental. 
 
Its murky stuff, not befitting The White Stuff.
 
AHDB Dairy/DairyCo come under fire again from industry leaders
 
Shot
No. 1  AHDB Dairy is particularly impotent 
(19th October 2015)
The Tenant Farmers Association (TFA) have issued a
press release headed Dairy Sector needs much improved levy board, which challenges
the performance of AHDB Dairy and how it delivers value for money with the Ł7
million it spends of farmers money each year.
 
The release follows a recent meeting in which the
TFA commented if this was a school inspection our findings would be that AHDB
Dairy required improvement and in areas was inadequate.  We need to see a much improved board as soon
as possible.  The full press release
makes for interesting ready, click on

FFA leader David Handley questions AHDBs recent recruitments and
suggest that as part of its consultation document farmers are given the choice
to vote to opt in or out of paying the Ł7 million levy.

First
Milk executive has an eye-watering remit  
(19th October 2015)
Brian Mackie has been appointed as First Milks
Chief Operating Offices following the surprise departure of Gerry Sweeney, who
was First Milks Finance Director.
 
Mackie has a very wide ranging and potentially
eye-watering remit to cover, including leading First Milks finance, legal, HR
and to drive its corporate development agenda. 
Its a big job and a significant commitment compared to his initial
appointment as non-executive director in June 2015.  We wish him luck and the ability to create an
8-day working week.

Correction     (19th October 2015)
Our report on the prices achieved at the last GDT
auction incorrectly stated that prices have risen by 100%.  The correct number was 10%.  Apologies.
 
Next auction is tomorrow, 20th
October.  Results will be posted on our
website late tomorrow or early Wednesday morning.
 
4th
consecutive auction rise as average prices jump another 10%    (7th October 2015)
Yesterdays Global Dairy Trade auction results continued to head north
at speed.
 
The average price was up 9.9% to average $2834 tonne.
 
Notable movers were:
 
SMP up 13.4% to average $2267
WMP up 12.9% to average $2824
 
This is the fourth consecutive increase since the all time low result
recorded in August.
 
1.469ppl milk
price reduction for Dairy Crest M&S suppliers  from 1st November (PRODUCER NOTIFIED)   (7th
October 2015)
This take producers standard litre price to 31.33ppl (www.milkprices.com)
 
0.31ppl milk
price reduction for Muller Wiseman CDG suppliers  from 1st November  (PRODUCER
NOTIFIED)    (7th October 2015)
This takes the standard litre price for those
contracted to the co-operative dairy group to 28.01ppl (www.milkprices.com)
 
Tescos supplementary
cheese payment is confirmed by SCC   (7th October 2015)
South Caernarfon Creameries will pay an additional
2.5ppl to all its co-op members for the three month period September, October
& November.  This will be shown
separately on milk payments and represents Tescos commitment to pay 29.93ppl
on milk supplied into its own label British cheddar.
 
The three month commitment is due to the fact SCCs
three year contract to supply British cheese to Tesco via Adams Foods (Leek)
ends in December.
 
1ppl milk
price drop from SCC  from 1st
November (PRODUCER
NOTIFIED)   (7th October 2015)
So its plus 2.5ppl (see Tesco supplementary payment
above) less 1ppl below.  The result is
that after this 1ppl drop and excluding the Tesco additional payment the 1st
November standard litre price is 21.89ppl and on the more appropriate
manufacturing standard litre the price it is only 20.03ppl (www.milkprices.com)
 
Signs of
international price improvements   (7th October 2015)
There are now signs of upward price movements some of
which are already filtering down to farm level.
 
For example, Friesland Campina +0.5 Euro Cents for
October (approximately 0.35ppl).
 
In addition, futures trading are trending upwards as are
international and EU commodity prices. 
Fingers crossed the trend continues.
 
Sainsburys
agree a supplementary payment to Barbers cheese producers   (7th October 2015)
Sainsburys are understood to have agreed to pay an
additional 2.5ppl on the milk equivalent, which goes into Sainsburys own label
cheddar cheese supplied by Barbers.
 
Arla launches
its own farm assurance scheme in the UK   (7th October 2015)
Arlas own farm assurance scheme called Arlagarden has
been launched in the UK.  The assurance
scheme and mark already operates in Sweden, Denmark, Germany, Luxembourg and
Belgium.
 
The assurance scheme focuses on animal welfare, milk
quality and food safety.  Put another way
care in every step from cow to consumer. The standards apply to both Arla co-operative
members and direct suppliers.
 
Morrisons Milk
For Farmers has been spotted   (7th October 2015)
In both Morrisons, Melton Mowbray and Corby at Ł1.12
for 4 pints.  Unfortunately, the price
comparison stated that this equated to Ł493.40 a litre, which is sure to soon
by amended to 49.34ppl.
 
 
 
1.5ppl milk price
reduction for Dairy Crest Davidstow producers  from 1st November   (2nd October 2015)
This takes producers (www.milkprices.com) standard litre price to
23.84ppl.
 
Whilst the reduction is unwelcome and unpopular the 2015 history of the
Davidstows ex-farm gate milk price is, under the current market conditions,
impressive.
 
It is only the second reduction in 2015 and there was even a small
0.25ppl August milk price increase.  In
addition, the new price still (we believe) leaves Davidstow at the top of the
milk for cheese league table.
 
1.2ppl milk price reduction
for The Fresh Milk Company (AKA Lactalis) producers  from 1st November (PRODUCER NOTIFIED)
  (2nd October 2015)
The standard litre price is still to be
confirmed but expected to be 21.01ppl.
 
0.35ppl milk price
reduction for Tesco (TSDG) suppliers  from 1st
November  (2nd
October 2015)
This takes producers (www.milkprices.com) standard litre price to
30.58ppl, including the 0.5ppl Promar costing premium, or 30.08ppl, excluding
this payment.  The price is fixed for the
six month period 1st November to 30th April 2016 for the
600 or so producers involved.
 
Tesco producers should be pleased with this announcement confirming
Tesco have maintained their promise to pay the cost of production (now 30.08p),
however, the outcome of the ongoing review is still to be announced and
implemented.  The announcement is
expected next month.
 
Stand on for Dairy
Crest liquid contracted producers plus estimated supplementary payments of
0.39ppl & 0.65ppl   (2nd October 2015)
This means producers standard litre price for November will be 21.69 (www.milkprices.com),
excluding the additional payments.(see below) 
 
The additional financial support payments from both Morrisons and Lidl
will be shown separate on producers milk cheque payments starting in October.
 
The October supplementary payment is expected to be 0.39ppl and will be
paid on November 15th. The first full month will be 0.65pp based on
September milk sales and paid on 15th December.  The reason for the delay in DC paying out the
first support payment is cash flow based and revolves around the payment terms
Lidl and Morrisons work to.  In a
nutshell DC have no reason to bank roll or bridge the gap.  The flip side is that the payments to
producers will continue around two months after the deadline date.
 
Clearly once the sale of Dairy Crests liquid division is approved
different arrangements concerning these payments by Muller may be adopted
however they are sure to be honoured.
 
Ł15.5million of
English aid to be distributed to all     (2nd October 2015)
DEFRA has decided to distribute the English share of the EU support
package amounting to Ł15.5million based on deliveries in 2014/2015 year.  The same decision has been made in Wales
where Ł3.2million is to be distributed.
 
Note, the payments are not connected to quota held at 31st
March 2015.
 
The expected payment will be around Ł1700 to Ł1800 per 1 million litres
of production and will be paid in December by the RPA.
 
Scotland (Ł2.3million) has yet to declare how they intend to distribute
the pot.
 
Sharing it evenly is perhaps understandable, however, for those on
premium contracts, for example the retailer aligned and organic, its a
surprise unexpected windfall as opposed to those who are currently receiving
under 18ppl where it could be a necessity and almost a lifeline.
 
Would be Tesco
producers  form an orderly queue    (2nd October 2015)
Tesco have announced their intention to add a further 150 or so
producers to its core pool during the first quarter of 2016.  Those interested should form an orderly queue
whilst Arla and Muller decide who the chosen few will be and what each
processors respective share is.
 
Competition
Markets Authority announcement on Dairy Crests liquid sale is imminent  (2nd October 2015)
Whilst a decision from the CMA on the Muller Wiseman acquisition of
Dairy Crests liquid business could come earlier than the 19th
October 2015 it is expected that the announcement will not be publicised until
the deadline date of the 19th.
 
The clear expectation on all sides is that the sale will be completed by
the 31st December 2015.

Ten steps to help save British
dairying
 
LAST week I spoke
to an 80-year-old farmer in my constituency who told me that in a lifetime of
dairy farming he had never seen times as so bad. With farm gate milk prices falling
30 per cent in a year  in many cases below the cost of production - its far
from an exaggeration.
 
I have spent the
last few weeks speaking to dairy farmers, industry experts and government
ministers about the terrible difficulties the industry is facing. Its clear
nobody can wave a magic wand and resolve a situation ultimately caused by a
global glut of milk, but I believe there are ten key steps that can, and must,
be taken if we are to protect this most valuable element of our rural community:
 
1. More retailers giving farmers a fair deal
Many supermarkets
have worked hard through a time of rock-bottom global milk prices to ensure
that British farmers receive a sustainable price. That said, more can be done
and it is absolutely vital every major
retailer pays a fair price for British dairy produce. You can see how your
supermarket treats its famers by checking the National Farmers Union website 
if youre not happy, vote with your wallet.
 
2. An end to milk being used a permanent loss leader
All of us have
seen the price of milk plummet in recent years, with many supermarkets now
charging only Ł1 for four pints. This kind of pricing can have widely
detrimental effects. Thats because low prices in supermarkets force down
prices all across the market, forcing your corner shop to cut its milk price in
order to compete, in turn putting pressure on milk producers. Milk is a quality
product, and pricing should reflect that.
 
3. Better labelling of British produce
It might seem like
there is little that could be more English than a slice of Cheddar, but what
many consumers dont know is that many of the major cheddar brands on the
shelves are produced in Europe. We need to have clearer packaging that empowers
consumers to buy British.
 
4.  More domestic
production of dairy products 
Its a scandal
that two thirds of our cheese and 30 per cent of our butter is imported from
overseas. We need to invest more in processing technology to make sure we are
adding value to British milk by turning more of it into British butter, yogurt
and cheese rather than importing so much.
 
5. More supply chain transparency and enforcement 
We know how much a
farmer gets paid for a pint of milk, and we know how much we pay for it in the
shops. What we dont know is how big the margins are in-between. We need to
work towards the kind of transparency that allows us to follow milk from farmer
to shelf in order to ensure a fair price is being paid at every stage. Good
supply chain practices then need to be enforced by a tough Grocery Code
Adjudicator and strong code of practice.
 
6. More dairy Producer Organisations
Groups of farmers
banding together to negotiate a better sale price for milk and a lower purchase
price for feed and machinery are commonplace across Europe, particularly in the
successful German market. In the UK we currently have only one such producer
organisation. If farmers are going to balance out the power of big processors
and retailers that needs to change.
 
7. Government must buy British
National government
is working hard to purchase British dairy products, but more can be done at a
regional level. We must push local government, hospitals, schools, and military
establishments to do more.  
 
8. A working dairy futures market
Futures are a way
for farmers to agree a pre-arranged price for milk they will produce in the
future. The price stability this can give has the potential to be invaluable to
the volatile dairy industry. We need the UK to follow in the footsteps of the
USA and New Zealand in making a working dairy futures market available.
 
9. Review of levy board spending
Every dairy farmer
in the UK currently pays a percentage of their income to a government- run levy
board. Many farmers feel that more of that money needs to be spent promoting the
benefits of milk and encouraging consumers to choose British. It is vital that
farmers feel like their levy money is being spent in a way that actually helps
them.
 
10. Immediate financial assistance
The EU has
announced a 500m crisis fund to support vulnerable dairy farmers and we must
get our fair share. Also, it is important that regular CAP payments to farmers
should be made as quickly as possible to ease cash flow problems. Lastly, HMRC
and banks must understand the inherent volatility in farming incomes and be
flexible in how they treat farmers.  
 
COMMENT FROM RISHI    (2nd October 2015)
Without its dairy farmers, Yorkshires
magical landscape would soon see its lush fields turn to scrub and its
dry-stone-walls go unrepaired. Meanwhile, with Britain already only 60 per cent
self-sufficient in food, our countrys ability to feed itself in a time of
crisis would be diminished. Only by working together can we preserve our dairy
industry, and with it our beautiful countryside, for generations to come.

0.38ppl Arla Amba
milk price increase netts down to 0.03ppl   (25th
September 2015)
From 28th September the Arla Amba member milk price will
increase by 0.38ppl (0.5 Euro Cents/litre), however, the strength of sterling
means the currency smoothing mechanism eliminates 0.35ppl resulting in a nett
0.03ppl gain.
 
This results in the following www.milkprices.com standard litre prices:

First Milk
Haverfordwest producers to receive an extra 1.5 to 2ppl courtesy of Tesco   (25th September 2015)
The 240 or so First Milk members who supply the co-ops Haverfordwest
Creamery have been informed that the Tesco initiative on cheese, agreed earlier
this month, will result in a price increase of between 1.5 to 2ppl.
 
The extra money will be paid by Tesco on all milk supplied for its own
label British cheese (via Adams Foods).
 
The payment will be shown separately on each farmers milk statement
with the first payment for September deliveries showing on producers October
milk statement.
 
Some non-Haverfordwest First Milk suppliers are unhappy with the ring
fencing of the money; however, it is consistent with the pricing model, which
CEO Mike Gallacher introduced on his appointment in a bid to ensure they no
longer paid out more money than they received as happened in 2014/15.
 
Russian EU dairy
import ban could easily be permanent   (25th
September 2015)
According to a report from this weeks IDF Conference in Lithuania, a
speaker from the Russian dairy publication has stated that the ban on the
importation of European dairy products will last until at least 2018.
 
Realistically the likelihood is that the ban will be permanent given
Russias plans to expand domestic milk production on an industrial scale

The CLA has announced that it will not be running future game fairs
including the 2016 event scheduled for Ragley Hall.
 
The surprise announcement has come on the back of three consecutive loss
making years.
 
Whether another operation/organisation will step forward to run a
replacement event remains to be seen. 
The first CLA game fair was held in 1958 in Ellesmere and Ians first,
in shorts, was in 1972 at Raby Castle he has attended most years since 1972.
 
Date:  Thursday 1st October 2015   (25th

in the global market place       
 
Dairy Crest to stand on with prices for October   (16th September
2015)
The move means the non aligned liquid
suppliers standard litre price holds at 21.69ppl and the Davidstow price holds
at 25.34ppl (www.milkprices.com).
 
0.36ppl milk price reduction for Dairy Crest/DCD Formula contracted
producers  from October 1st
  (16th
September 2015)
This results in a new standard litre price of
27.08ppl (www.milkprices.com)
 
Another massive jump in GDT auction prices at + 16.5%  (16th September 2015)
This is certainly a roller coaster ride for
GDT auction prices as this weeks prices saw the third consecutive double digit
increase.
 
The average was up 16.5% to $2568 (US) 
 
Key movers were:
 
WMP          +
         20.6%   to average $2495
SMP           +
         17%      to average $1992
Butter         +          13.3%   to
average $3108
Cheese       +          10.7%   to
average $3206
 
The lift comes on the back of 14.8% and 10.9%
increases and is partly due to a further 15,200 tonnes cut in the volume
Fonterra will offer for sale in the next three months and a total 12 month
volume cut amounting to 78,000 tonnes. At this weeks auction the amount of WMP
on offer was 5% less than two weeks ago and 43% less than the corresponding
auction a year ago.
 
During the last three auctions the average all
products sold price is up 42% with WMP up a staggering 57% and SMP up 42%.
Farmers will no doubt be cautiously optimistic that prices have bottomed out
but note these headline increases come from record low averages are we not out
of the wood yet but analysts are now claiming we are past the bottom.
 
From the New Zealand farmers point the fact WMP
prices have passed the $2,200 tonne mark is significant because this is the
level required to maintain the current seasons farm gate milk price forecast. 
 
AMPE hits its lowest point to date    (16th September
2015)
August AMPE has dropped to only 15.5p, which
represents a 15 year low since it was invented by Barry Wilson/DIN. AMPE now
weighs in at 1.3p above IMPE (14.2ppl). Note, the European Commission last week
declined to raise the intervention price of SMP, which was viewed as a way The
Commission could have helped stabilise the market. (Source DIN)
 
Intervention SMP continues to increase      (16th September
2015)
Close to 15,000 tonnes of SMP are now in
intervention including 1048 tonnes from the UK and 261 tonnes from Southern
Ireland.
 
Irish Cheese Advert says up yours to clear labelling      (16th September
2015)
Everyone in the UK dairy industry is aware
that tensions are mounting over country of origin labelling on cheese with retailers
displaying multi origin milk.  
 
The Irish Dairy Board appear to be waving two
fingers to all involved having launched an advert with a Pilgrims Choice label
stating Improve the sales of your cheddar category in two easy steps:
 
1.     Take the Pilgrims Choice label 
2.     Stick it onto any other cheddar pack
 
This sort of promotion, seen in The Grocer,
has to be challenged and remember the annual milk equivalent we import from
Southern Ireland in cheese is a staggering 1 billion litres. Displace this and
you make significant headway with the present demand problem. We must push for
clean origin of milk labelling on cheese and back our own Red Tractor.
 
Commissions Dairy Support Package comes under attack and could involve
milk quota  (16th
September 2015)
Last weeks news that EU dairy farmers are to
receive the most significant chunk of a 500 million support package was
lambasted by the European Milk Board who are demanding politicians intervene to
reduce the production of milk in the EU and described the package as very
disappointing.  Stating that 5,000 dairy
farmers did not take to the streets for this. 
 
The fact is little of this money will filter
down to UK farmers. In addition its yet to be decided how to distribute the
money with milk quota held at 31st March 2015 an option under
consideration because it would be simple to administrate.
 
So far as the UK is concerned the figure of
Ł26.5 million is equivalent to 0.173ppl on all our production. So for a 1
million litre producer it will be worth Ł1,733. Its not a lot but better than
nothing.
 
Fonterra farmers rush for interest free support loans    (16th September
2015)
Over 1300 New Zealand dairy farmers signed up
to Fonterras offer of interest free loans to help them through these difficult
times in the first four days. The loans are interest free until at least 31st
May 2017 after which Fonterra has the option to change interest.
 
No security is required over shares or other
assets. Oh to be part of a co-operative who can make such an offer.
 
Muller is the official 2016 GB Olympic Partner    (16th September
2015)
The announcement was made by Lord Coe and
gives Muller Wiseman fantastic marketing rights across all the Muller brands of
yoghurts etc. and it is hoped that retailers will pay their part in the deal.

1ppl milk price reduction for suppliers to Fresh Milk Company (AKA
Lactalis)  from 1st
October (PRODUCER NOTIFIED)   (7th September 2015)
This takes www.milkprices.com standard litre price down to
21.01ppl (liquid) and 21.74ppl (manufacturing) 
 
0.5ppl milk price reduction for South Caernarfon Creameries suppliers  from 1st October (7th
September 2015)
This takes producers standard litre price down
to 20.35 (liquid) and 21.03ppl (manufacturing) www.milkprices.com
 
However, it is anticipated that following last
weeks Tesco cheese milk price pledge that this decrease will be rescinded and
replaced with a 1st September producer price increase. See story
below.
 
0.5ppl milk
price reduction for suppliers to Barbours Farmhouse Cheese- from 1st October (7th
September 2015)
This takes producers standard litre price down to 23.3ppl
 
0.348ppl milk price reduction for Dairy Crest liquid formula contracted
producers  from 1st
September (7th September 2015)
This takes the www.milkprices.com
standard litre price down to 27.63ppl.
 
0.2ppl milk price reduction for First Milk balancing pool  from 1st September (7th
September 2015)
 
Plus 0.3ppl milk price reduction for First Milk balancing cheese pool
members  from 1st
September   (7th September
2015)
 
This takes producers www.milkprices.com
standard litre price down to:
 
18.6ppl for Scotland
18.9ppl for North of England
17.9ppl for Midlands & East Wales
19.89ppl for Haverfordwest
 
2nd consecutive double digit bounce in GDT results    (7th
September 2015)
GDT prices rose another 10.9% at last weeks auction
to average $2226/tonne (US)
 
This follows hot on the heels of the 14.8%
rise only two weeks earlier.
 
A contributory factor is the fact Fonterra
have seriously reduced the volume of product on offer down 50% compared to that
offered at the same auction a year ago.  
Milk production world wide is still ahead of
demand and in New Zealand production is still rising due to the fact farmers
are ramping up production in an attempt to receive the same value into their
banks each month. Irish Milk production is still rocketing up with July output
up 12.2% year on year. Until global milk production falls a full recovery seems
impossible.
 
However, the latest auction results were as
anticipated by a number of leading analysts following positive uplift signals in
both futures and EU trading prices. 
Dairy futures prices across the globe appear to be heading north e.g.
$2000 (US) today/tonne with 2016 @ $2600 (US)
 
Key movers were:
 
Butter Milk Powder               +30%    to
average         $1829
WMP                                              +12.1% to average         $2078
SMP                                               +11.7% to average         $1698
Butter                                             +8.1%   to average         $2746
Cheddar                              +4.7%   to average         $2913
 
Whilst this second consecutive bounce in
prices is encouraging the fact is two swallows still dont make a summer and the
road to recovery is set to be a long haul with plenty of in store product still
to be cleared.
 
FFA & NFU partnership works with Tesco    (7th
September 2015)
David Handley & Michael Oakes are to be
congratulated for their joint achievements in negotiations with Tesco in
connection with Tescos latest cheese announcement.
 
Tesco have agreed to extend its pricing model
to include milk, which goes into Tesco own label cheese sourced from both First
Milk and South Caernarfon Creameries by paying 29.93ppl for the milk on the
basis the additional money feeds back to the farmers.  This will run from 31st August
2015 to 28th February 2016. The money will be paid by Tesco to Adams
Foods who will pay the respective Co-ops. Its still unclear whether all Co-op
members will enjoy the benefit of the extra money or whether it will be divided
up amongst a select group.
 
The move compliments the existing TSDG cheese
model set up two years ago between Tesco and Parkham Farms.
 
So far as Tesco is concerned the next issue to
tackle is multi-country of origin milk labelling in own brand cheese.
 
The promise from Tesco is to be more
transparent from January 2016 with its cheese labelling. However this
correction is required now and not only from Tesco.
By default this latest move points to the near
certainty the TSDG liquid COP milk price will be at a similar level of 29.93ppl
for next winter which will be a relief to some.
 
Muller Wiseman (MW) declare transparency in paying the extra money  (7th
September 2015)
Muller Wiseman are separately identifying the
additional money pledged and paid by retail customers following recent protests
and negotiations.
 
The extra money will be ring fenced and shown
as a supplementary payment and will be paid monthly based on actual sales
commencing week 17th August 2015 when a string of deals and pledges
were announced.
 
For August the supplementary payment will
amount to 0.595ppl and had it been paid for the whole month with similar levels
of sales the equivalent supplementary payment would have been circa 1.2ppl.
 
The money will be paid to Muller Wiseman 430
non-aligned who on average will produce around 1.4 to 1.5 million litres
annually.
 
What does this mean for the piggy back milk purchasers?   (7th
September 2015)
A number of milk purchasers and formulas
utilise the Muller Wiseman non-aligned price in their basket of prices.  There will certainly be some moaning and
wriggling from both processors and their producer representatives when they
realise the extra money from retailers will not be added to the Muller Wiseman
standard litre price.
 
Will some of their so-called representative
negotiators seek to change the basket and/or the formulas?
 
Thats for them to sort out but for sure it will
mean that for 430 or so Muller Wiseman non-aligned producers they have
transparency.  In addition it will
greatly assist Muller Wiseman in demonstrating an audit trial to confirm
farmers have received ALL of the extra money paid by its retail customers.
 
Cheap Milk   (7th September 2015)
Co-op Chester 8 pints for Ł2!
 
Cheap Cheese   (7th September 2015)
The Co-op continued to promote Irish Cheese
with Pilgrims choice Extra Mature Cheddar at half price selling for Ł2.25 for
350 grams or Ł6.43 per kg.
 
1ppl
milk price reduction for suppliers to Fayrefield liquids  from 1st
September   (21st August 2015)
This takes producers standard litre price to
18.5ppl (www.milkprices.com)
 
Arla
to stand on with its September farmgate milk price   (21st
August 2015)
Arla members milk price for September will be
a stand on at 23.01ppl standard litre (www.milkprices.com)
for its 13,500 member owners. This could be considered a positive result even
if the resulting price is not one to sound the trumpets on.
 
3ppl
Organic milk price increase to Arla Organic suppliers  from 31st
August  (21st August 2015)
This is on the back of the continual
strengthening for organic dairy products. 
 
Aldi
to pay at least 28ppl  from 17th August  (21st
August 2015)
 
Lidl
to pay at least 28ppl  from 17th August  (21st
August 2015)
 
Morrisons
to pay 26ppl minimum for all its liquid milk  from the end of August  (21st
August 2015)
This is 2ppl less than Asda, Aldi & Lidl
have agreed to pay.
Now we are starting to understand why several
have commented that Morrisions are extremely difficult to deal with as
customers or words to that effect. Their smart and skin flint moves are sure to
put them back on FFAs radar if indeed they were ever off it. 
Note according to The Grocer the steepest
retailer liquid milk price reductions have come from Morrisons who have wiped
36.5% off their retail price of milk in the past five years (source Kantar
World Panel). In addition The Grocer reports that Tesco hold the record for the
steepest price reduction in butter at 35.3%. 
 
Morrisons
Farmers Brand now extended to cheddar    (21st August 2015)
The Morrisons Milk for farmers brand will be extended
to its own label cheddar with a 34p per pack premium equivalent to an extra
10ppl going to farmers. It might be what some of our organisations wanted but
its a gimmick.
 
GDT
Auction price + 15%   (21st August 2015)
This weeks average auction index price rise
of almost 15% (+14.8%) was a shock and even more surprising was the 19% rise in
the WMP average.
 
Prior to this weeks GDT result there were
clear signs that prices had lifted with futures contract prices for September
WMP lifting from US $1550 to US $1700 tonne with plenty of trading and market
activity.
 
The auction results were helped by the fact
Fonterra cut the amount on offer to only 18,000 tonnes of WMP at this weeks
auction a 35% reduction on the scheduled 27,500 tonnes. In addition from
September until the end of January the volume of WMP to be offered in the
auction has been reduced by 15%.
 
Key prices were 
WMP up 19.1% to average US $1856 tonne
Butter up 10.8% to average US $2541 tonne
SMP up 8.5% to average US $1521 tonne
Cheddar up 4.4% to average US Ł$2778 tonne
 
Next GDT auction will be September 1st

 
The fundamentals remain the same and it will
take time before anyone starts to talk about a wholesale recovery. At best you can
be cautiously optimistic but we certainly arent out of the wood yet but these
results are a welcome sign for prices to perhaps hold for a while.
 
Asda
is the first retailer to be authorised to use the Arla marque    (21st
August 2015)
Asda has ticked all the boxes to enable the
retail giant to use the new Arla marque on its own label milk together with its
own label British Cheddar which uses 100% British Arla milk. The spotlight
should now turn to others who are less British especially in their cheese
sourcing. (See below) 
 
Iceland
are back on the radar  Part 1  (21st
August 2015)
Icelands Farm Vale mild white cheddar states
on the packet thats its produced from milk originated from the UK &
Ireland. Another pack of cheese with multi origin milk to confuse consumers!
 
Iceland
Part 2     (21st August 2015)
The one retailer which has managed to keep
off the radar during recent protests and activities is Iceland.
Back in late 2014 FFA were heavily involved in
negotiations with Iceland and at the time a spokesman stated that with regards
to FFA it would be happy to open our books to any independent adjudicator that
may be appointed by the government in the future. 
Iceland declared that the price it pays for
milk would be directly linked to the farmgate price received by dairy farmers
in future. Perhaps its time FFA and others revisited this declaration to see
where Iceland currently sit which is hopefully somewhere between the 26ppl
pledge of Morrisons and 32ppl paid by M & S and Waitrose. 
 
UK
SMP goes into Intervention   (21st August 2015)
A UK processor (rumoured to be Town of
Monaghan from their leckpatrick plant in Northern Ireland) has placed 432
tonnes of SMP Intervention which represents 10% of the total intervention
stocks of 4,246 tonnes. The milk price equivalent of this is around 16ppl.
 
Danish
discount retailer REMA 100 increases the price it pays Arla for milk   (21st
August 2015)
In a move which mirrors those made last week
by retailers operating in the UK REMA has increased the price it pays Arla for
its liquid milk by 50 Danish ore (approximately 5.3ppl) with a view to the
additional money supporting circa 13,000 Arla members.
 
"It must be seen as a long-term
initiative. I am well aware that price increases are not in the curriculum of
the grocery book for discount chains, but Danish agriculture has been put under
financial pressure from the declining prices. If we do not take this seriously,
we risk squeezing dairy farmers out of business. If that happens, consumers
will run the risk of not being able to buy Danish milk in the future. And we
don't want that to happen. In REMA 1000 we have always only had Danish milk on
the shelves, and we would like to continue having that, "says Anders Jensen,
Purchasing Director of REMA 1000.
 
Surely
its time for a Back British Dairy Products campaign   (21st
August 2015)
From the very recent research we have done
its clear there is groundswell support for a Back British Campaign particularly
on cheese.
Current own label retailer cheese labelling
is a disgrace and whats needed is to highlight how several retailers are
mixing Irish, New Zealand and UK milk to confuse consumers with multi origin
cheese.  
The only way to persuade these retailers to
source 100% British cheese using British milk is if consumers vote with their
feet. 
The opportunity is here today and whats
needed is transparent honest labelling in an attempt to displace more than 1
billion litres milk equivalent of Irish cheese we currently import. Oh and
whilst we are having a Campaign lets get the government and food service to
back British cheese. They are both huge users of cheese and both use Irish
and/or multi origin cheese.
 
We dont need the Clap Trap excuses as to why
we cant address our own market failure as have recently been aired. We need
people with a can do mentality because this momentum is gathering pace and its
going to be a slow road to recovery and this must surely by self help.
There is still some work to do on liquid but
the elephant in the room is now cheese and we need to look at a professional
marketing Agency run Campaign funded by either the existing milk levy or new
sources.

1ppl milk price reduction for Meadow Foods  from 1st September (14th
August 2015)
 
0.348ppl milk price reduction for Dairy Crest formula
producers   (14th August 2015)
This takes effect
from 1st September and widens the gap between the formula standard
litre price @ 27.44ppl and Dairy Crests standard liquid price of 21.81ppl to
5.63ppl.
 
Arla launch the equivalent of the Arla Fair Trade Marque  (14th August 2015)
 
Arla have launched a farmer owned marque
which from autumn will feature on all Arla branded UK products. 
 
This is certainly not a silver bullet to
solve the current dire situation in the industry but it will be heavily
promoted with the aim of emphasising that the milk which goes into the products
is responsibly sourced from its farmer owners who retain any profits. In
addition the marque will confirm that the milk is produced to the highest
expectations in terms of the environment and animal welfare. 
 
Arla will include the logo/marque on all
its branded products and should find it easy to win the support of major retail
customers like Morrisons, Asda, Lidl and Aldi presumably allowing them to use
the marque on own label dairy products processed by Arla subject to jumping
through hoops one of which farmers will hope relates to fair pricing by the
retailers involved. On reflection perhaps using the word easy in conjunction
with British retailers is naďve!  
 
Morrisons could do with some positive PR
and compliance with the marques terms of use and permission to utilise it would
at least be a step in the right direction and signal that the retailer supports
the Arla farmers. 
 
Once one retailer supports the marque on
own label others will be exposed. It wont be universally popular and will have
its critics but its a small smart positive step of encouragement and sends a
clear message to consumers as to what they are buying & supporting. 
 
In reality its similar to a Fair Trade
mark and can only do good.
 
Morrisons 10ppl gimmick is possibly the best stunt
Ian has seen   (14th August 2015)
Full marks to
Morrisons who, in the space of hours, temporarily changed their position from
the dairy industrys villains and number 1 protesting target to become almost
heroes.
 
On Tuesday
Morrisons emerged from meetings with industry leaders to announce a new milk
brand called Morrisons Milk for Farmers with a whopping 10ppl of the retail
price going directly to its major supplier, Arla.
 
I guess leaders
could hardly criticise Morrisons move having banged home to them that the
majority of consumers are willing to pay more for milk if the extra money goes
direct to farmers.  If thats correct
Morrisons have obliged and put the NFUs theory to the test.  
 
Morrisons
certainly pulled a rabbit out of the hat with this new brand.  In Ians opinion its a stunt, a gimmick and
it will cost Morrisons nothing.
 
In reality its
doubtful whether it will succeed following its autumn launch.  At the launch it is anticipated Morrisons may
well oblige the NFU President Meurig Raymonds request to
 
make sure there is plenty of
resources available to promote this product. 
It must also be displayed prominently in store.
 
So lets assume it
happens and retailers continue with their obsession to offer the cheapest milk
as a loss leader and are still selling 4 pints for 89p.  The Morrisons Milk for Farmers will then sit
along side the 89p milk at Ł1.12 for 4 pints.
 
The extra 10ppl
will go to Arla as Morrisons dominant supplier but because Arla are a
co-operative the money is not ring-fenced to GB but in the pot to benefit
13,000 members. See below for latest NFU gaff on this point.
 
Ian hopes it works
and that all the farmers benefit but somehow history tells him its doomed to
fail and could even experience a backlash before it is launched. If Morrisons
are serious about helping they should cut the gimmicks and try to adopt the
Arla Marque on all Dairy Products. See below reference cheese.
 
Once its on the
shelves we will soon learn whether consumers are willing to pay an extra 10ppl
but its a massive 26% uplift.
 
Only time will
tell whether the Morrisons move will be sufficient to satisfy those who were
protesting at Morrisons premises a week ago.
 
What Next?   (14th
August 2015)
If I were Asda,
Lidl & Aldi I would be banging on the NFUs door offering my own variation
on the farmers milk brand and agreeing to pay 10ppl or more direct to the
farmers in the hope it buys more time and ensures protesting farmers stay
away.  If thats considered part of the
solution all retailers should be pushed to do it.
 
Contrast Morrisons to the pledge retailer Booths
have made   (14th August 2015)
Northwest retailer
Booths have 32 stores and have pledged to pay the very best price for liquid
milk to its farmers under their Fair Milk scheme.  Currently they pay their farmers 33ppl.  Now thats worthy of real publicity and is
certainly fair trade.
 
NFU Gaff in announcing Asda commit to pay 28ppl for
100% of its liquid milk   (14th August 2015)
According to an
NFU press release Asda have delivered, what is undoubtedly, a significant
improvement in the farmgate milk price it pays Arla for all of its liquid milk
from next Monday 17th to 28ppl. However interestingly in the
official Asda press release, which came out after the NFUs there is no mention
of the 28p and no mention of the money going to British Farmers. 
In its press
release the NFU state that the 28p will then be expected to pass this
onto its British Farmer suppliers.
No way NFU because
to do this would necessitate a complete re write of the Arla Co-op principles
which 13,000 dairy farmers have signed up to. This would spark a Dairy War.
 
In addition its a
dangerous road to even consider because it could be met with thankyou cards
from the Danes & Swedes to the NFU. Think about it the Danes could say if
thats the game we will retain all the money from lurpack butter in Denmark.
 
Surely the NFU as
a farmer organisation understand how a successful Co-op works and Arla are
certainly not going to rewrite their constitution and rules to re nationalise
its milk pricing.
 
NFU President
Meurig Raymond commented It is now important that Arla
ensures this is delivered to British Farmers on the ground, with immediate
effect.
Oh dear perhaps
more thought and less haste from NFU Communications department is required,
because this is pants.
 
However, the move
by Asda is seismic and on the issue of cheese it is already well ahead of Tesco
and Morrisons for its Red Tractor support.
 
Milk is now 6ppl cheaper than bottled water   (14th August 2015)
That was the strap
line in last weeks Grocer.  The research
requires no further commentary.
 
Irish & New Zealand cheese & Milk  The
facts on own label  (14th August 2015)
Here is a sample
of cheeses found this week in two retail stores:
 
Morrisons Mature White Cheddar packaging confirms it is
produced in the UK using British and Irish milk.
 
Morrisons Red Leicester packaging confirms it is produced in
the UK using British and Irish milk.

If you have
further similar evidence please email us photographs of both sides of the

Cheese imports from
Ireland equate to an estimate 100,000 tonnes annual equivalent which is a
whopping 1 billion litres of milk. The Irish have virtually closed their market
to British and Northern Irish produce and French farmer demonstrations are
heading towards closing down their markets to foreign imports despite the EU
market principles. If British consumers and food service back Red Tractor
cheese 100% processors claim the farmgate price paid to farmers for milk for
cheese would increase by between 3 to 5ppl.
Thats where the
battle ground is with retailers and food service to keep the Irish cheese out. 
If the French
agriculture minister can state:
In the current crisis, everyone is
responsible, from the consumer to the local politician who must favour French
products
Why cant all our
leaders be nationalistic for once?
 
Medina and Freshways involved in Muller and Dairy
Crest Deal  (14th August 2015)
The competition
have announced that they are inclined to accept Muller Wisemans undertakings with
a view to eliminating the need to progress to what would be costly multi
million pound stage 2 in terms of fees etc.
 
The competition
and Markets Authority have opened up a consultation period until October 19th
with the proviso matters could be concluded earlier. 
The proposed
undertaking and remedy will see Muller Wiseman process around 100 million
litres of milk a year for either Freshways or Medina for up to 8 years. 
These two
processors are considered by the CMA to be effective competitors to Muller.
However it must be noted that Medina already trade large quantities of milk
with Dairy Crest.
If the remedy is
adopted and a deal struck it could be up and running by January 1st
2016.

2.35ppl
(1.85 + 0.5) milk price reduction for suppliers to Bowland Fresh Milk with only
24 hours notice (PRODUCER NOTIFIED)   (7th August 2015)
The 1.85ppl reduction results in a producer base
price of only 18.1ppl from August 1st.  In addition Bowland Fresh have raised the
base price protein from 3.2% to 3.3%, which producers say is equivalent to a
further 0.5ppl price cut on top of the 1.85ppl cut.  That equates to a milk price of only 17.6ppl.
 
0.8ppl
milk price reduction for Muller Wiseman suppliers  from 7th September  (7th August 2015)
This takes producers standard litre price down to
22.35ppl.
 
1ppl
milk price reduction for suppliers to Glanbia  from September 1st    (7th August 2015)   
This takes producers standard litre price down to
21.35ppl.  
 
In addition, from 1st January Glanbias standard
litre will be based on 4.2% butterfat & 3.4% protein following the earlier
decision by independent milk price analyst, Stephen Bradley of www.milkprices.com
to change the manufacturing cheese milk price constituents in his standard
litre comparison to these levels.

Fonterra
slash its forecast milk price by 27% in only 10 weeks to only 12.2ppl    (7th August 2015)
On the 28th May Fonterra set its opening
forecast farm gate milk price at $5.25 per kg of milk solids for the 2015/2016
year.  Today, only 10 weeks later, that
forecast has been slashed by 27% to only $3.85 due to a continued significant imbalance in the global
dairy market between weak demand and surplus supply.
 
New Zealand dairy farmers have an estimated break
even cost of production of around $5.30/kg ms.
 
The equivalent UK standard litre price at todays exchange
rate is 12.19ppl with a total forecast payout including a co-op dividend of
13.78ppl.
 
GDT
results (continued)   (7th August 2015)
Tuesdays catastrophic auction results were partly
due to a 78% increase in the volume of WMP offered.  In addition, it is clear that a significant
volume of the product sold was at the opening bid equivalent to a reserve
price.
 
The WMP average at $1590/tonne (US) is equivalent
to half the average New Zealand cost of production.
 
The next auction will be on 18th August
when prices are almost certain to fall further.
 
How
big is the UKs milk problem?  
(7th August 2015)
Mullers bean counters have been doing some
interesting number crunching.  The extra
1.6 billion litres of milk we have produced in the last 12 months represents
80,000 ex-farm tanker loads equivalent to a whopping 220 extra loads a day or
40 pints of extra milk for every person in the UK.
 
NISA
driving down milk prices   (7th August 2015)
Ian has received a copy of a circular letter from
NISA (the so-called family of independent grocers) sent out dated 4th
August where they say:
 
This is the latest step in our continual aim to
drive down members cost of fresh milk.
 
In the letter they inform members of a 4.5ppl
saving bringing down the price of 2 litres of milk.
 
NISA will certainly attract the attention of
protesting farmers with such antagonist statements.  A copy of the letter is in FFAs inbox.
 
Morrisons
 Number 1 target of protesting dairy farmers   (7th August 2015)
For obvious reasons protesting dairy farmers have
this week focussed their efforts on Morrisons, Asda, Lidl & Aldi.
 
Rather than seeking to sit round the table with
leaders of the protesting farmers Morrisons decided to issue an ill thought out
antagonistic letter to the protesters, which was interpreted as Morrisons
stamping their authority as to who is really in charge and sticking two fingers
up at dairy farmers.
 
The letter refers to potential
personal liability, we reserve the right to commence court
proceedings, injunction, reserve the
right to commence trespass actions against you personally, Personally
liable for the financial consequences of these protests and the court
proceedings which follow.
 
And, in bold print we have and are arranging for further
evidence to be gathered about your identity.
 
We may use CCTV footage; take photographs of individuals or vehicles
present.
 
The letter closes yours faithfully but with no
individuals name attached, however, the name Darren Blackhurst, Morrisons Group
Commercial Director, is one name on farmers radars, even though he has been on
annual leave this week.  He is ex-Tesco
and B&Q and nicknamed Captain Chaos on account of his reputation for
firing first then thinking about what he has done later.  Note, the original Captain Chaos was
diagnosed with a multiple personality disorder.
 
David Handleys response on the FFA news page
summed it up All we want is a fair price, a
living wage and be able to make a profit from our business.
 
Handley has also stated publically that FFA would
prefer to meet face to face with retailers. 
In the case of Morrisons, if they are serious they need to wheel out
Dave Potts, their CEO and not send stand in substitutes who have little or no
power to change anything.
 
Note, when Radio 4 Farming Today attempted to
arrange to speak to a representative of Morrisons ahead of this mornings
programme they simply hung up on them. 
Second choice to a Morrisons representatives was yours truly who also
has numerous nicknames!
 
The Milk
Trolley Challenge is viral   (7th August 2015)
Protesting farmers buying up all the milk,
especially in Morrisons but also in Asda, Lidl and Aldi is spreading like a
forest fire across the UK and attracting worldwide interest.
 
OMSCO
secure new export contracts   (7th August 2015)
OMSCo, who process milk from 250 UK organic
members farms, have secured further export business to the USA with its
organic mozzarella.  The expectation is
that 800 tonnes of Mozzarella will be made and exported in the first year.
 
OMSCOs total organic cheese production is expected
to be around 1800 tonnes a year.
 
Putin
destroys around 9 tonnes of EU cheese  
(7th August 2015)
Russia has marked the first birthday of its ban of
EU dairy products by destroying 9 tonnes of cheese plus 300 tonnes of other
products and showing the destruction on Russian TV.
 
The move has caused outrage in a country where over
20 million people try to survive below the poverty line.  Around 170,000 people have signed a petition
criticising the stunt, however, its doubtful their protests will prevent
further destruction.

Another Disastrous GDT result with prices down 9.3%  (4th August
2015)
Volume of product
on offer at todays auction was significantly increased and prices continued to

should be suspended.
 
Todays prices
plummeted to average $1815 tonne.

1.5ppl (-0.5 +
1.0) milk price reduction for South Caernarfon Creameries Limited producers (PRODUCER NOTIFIED)  from September 1st 
(4th August 2015)
In early July SCC confirmed a 0.5ppl price reduction for 1st
September, however, this has now been tripled to 1.5ppl.
 
This results in a liquid standard litre price of 20.84ppl and a
manufacturing one of 21.53ppl (www.milkprices.com)
 
1.4ppl milk price
reduction for Dairy Crest liquid suppliers  from September 1st   (4th August 2015)
Dairy Crest have held their liquid price for six consecutive months but
its come to an abrupt end with the announcement of a 1.4ppl September price
cut and the reality is further cuts are almost inevitable.
 
This results in a liquid standard litre price of 21.69ppl (www.milkprices.com)
 
Dairy Crests Davidstow milk for cheese price remains unchanged at a
healthy 25.34ppl (www.milkprices.com).  At least in this environment it looks to be a
healthy price.
 
Dairy Crests organic price also remains unchanged at 38.43ppl (www.milkprices.com)
 
0.5ppl milk price
reduction for First Milk members (PRODUCER NOTIFIED) - from 1st August   (4th August 2015)
First Milk have copped for criticism over the fact this latest cut only gave
producers ˝ a days notice as First Milk abandon part, if not all of the
Voluntary Code. We assume the 0.5ppl is an across board reduction.
 
This should result in the following standard litre prices (to be
confirmed) 
 
The Midlands & East Wales balancing Pool 18.1ppl
Mainland Scotland 18.8ppl
North of England 19.0ppl
Haverford West 19.67ppl

FFA takes the
crisis to retailers and the public  (4th August 2015)
The current crisis down on the dairy farm is wrecking generations of
farming families efforts and aspirations.
 
FFA are holding a series of rallies and protest with two big ones
planned for this Thursday (6th) in Somerset/Devon and Cheshire.
 
The gathering of dairy farmers will not simply be a protest or a
blockade because it comes with an invitation to the general public to come
along and meet grass roots dairy farmers to understand how grim the situation
is and how the outlook is to get worse.
Numbers of farmers attending protest meetings is increasing as the level
of discontent rapidly escalates with the continual erosion of milk cheques.

Some farmers try to switch from Compete to Grow
to Shrink to Survive  (24th July 2015)
Regrettably the
market sentiment across the world is worryingly negative with all respected
analysts having written of any possibility of any sort of ex farmgate price
recovery in 2015 and some even questioning whether a glimmer of light will be
seen until the second half of 2016 and one or two privately talking into
2017.  
 
Hollands milk
production is up 10% in June and Ireland is reported to be up 12.5% in April
and May.
 
There appears to
be two alternatives.  A Natural
disaster/weather event pops up to cut production or producers cut production.
 
Those in the UK
planning to milk cows out and then cull them could be in for a shock when it
comes to booking cull cows in this autumn.
 
Its almost two
years to the day that the NFU launched its strategy Compete to Grow and two
years later some of those who decided to push on are in a financial
stranglehold and are now facing the need to shrink to survive.  Some farmers are in serious financial trouble
and there is not even a glimmer of light at the end of a very long tunnel.

Grahams The Family
Dairy drops 7ppl B price bombshell onScotlands family dairies   (21st July 2015)
Robert Graham, MD of
Grahams The Family Dairy, from Stirling, Scotland wrote a letter on the 9th
July to the firms 100 or so family dairies, which in one fell swoop savaged
the incomes of around 60 farms.
                       
Grahams were one of
the first UK processors to introduce A&B pricing, and grabbed the headlines
last week by being the first to impose a B price of between 6 to 7ppl
(estimated for August and will soon be closer to 6 than 7ppl) for unwanted
surplus litres.
                         

In the letter Robert
Graham states to this end we must reduce the price paid on the
ingredient litres (aka the B litres) to 50% of AMPE. In
addition there was a 1.5ppl cut to the firms A price, which probably cant be
argued with given the state of the market and is still a healthy liquid
standard litre price.
 
Under the Grahams
formula for August producers will receive 23.75ppl on the A litres (based on
90% of a farms 1st September 2013 to 30th August 2014
production) and the B litre price will be paid on the rest. This will affect at
least 60 of the 100 or so Grahams producers, and will reduce their income by an
estimated Ł180,000 each month, or equivalent to Ł3000 per farm per month for
those affected.
                                                              
The NFUS believe that
Grahams will be the only GB milk buyer paying 10ppl or less for any of their
milk.
 
Emails to Ian show
the main bone of contention is that producers spent time providing the company
with  2015 production forecasts, which
they believe have proved to be accurate. If that is true then they believe
Grahams should have anticipated the milk they have received and managed their
pool better. But according to Robert Graham some of the 60 B milk producers are
30% to almost 50% above their 100% allocation.
 
In addition, during
2015, Grahams have supposedly had new producers start to supply them and
others are in the pipeline and due to start to supply soon. However Ian has
verified that the agreement to take on four farmers goes back a year or more,
so while this is unpalatable it is not untoward and is a case of Grahams
honouring their commitment and not dumping anyone. 
 
Farmers believe that
as part of the Grahams family the B price move warranted a producer meeting
to discuss the issues and agree a way forward rather than receive the bombshell
letter. With hindsight the indication is that Grahams agree they could have
handled the situation better. Their letter came out of the blue and rocked the
industry and resulted in serious heartache on the farms affected.
 
However whilst a
producer meeting to transparently explain the problem would have been
preferable the outcome would not have been different. Basically Grahams
producers are sending the Company in excess of 1.5 million litres of milk each
month which the firm are having to sell into a very weak spot market, mainly in
England & Wales, for under10ppl delivered at present and weakening.
 
One producer
commented I remember your fathers words when I joined Grahams: We are
only looking for young ambitious men who want to expand their businesses in a
similar way to us.
 
He agreed its those
same ambitious farmers who have been hit hard with this short notice price B
price annihilation.
So Grahams have
created a PR problem and next month, they have a planning meeting for a new
dairy where they may need some friends in high places. 
 
On further
examination the basic problem is Grahams have 11% (1.5 million litres surplus)
more milk each month than they have customers for. Options available to them
were as follows:-
 
a.    
Give
notice to some producers. That is harsh and takes months to affect total milk
intake and how are they selected? Presumably starting with those who produce
the highest percentage of B litres.
 
b.    
Cut
the A price by more but that penalises the 40 who have not expanded and kept
within the limits and appears unfair.
 
c.    
Reduce
the A volume from 90% to say 80 or 85% - that penalises the wrong farmers i.e;
those who have not expanded.
 
d.    
Do
nothing and dig a financial black hole- not an option 
 
e.    
Penalise
the farmers who are producing the extra milk by halving the B price. 
 
Its harsh for those
who have expanded believing they could spread their fixed costs receiving the
AMPE price on their B litres at 14.8ppl (June price).  Note the Grahams B price is transparent and
takes AMPE less 2ppl haulage less 5% processer margin and from August 1st
less 50%.  This price is independently
calculated by Stephen Bradley www.milkprices.com.  So it might be a low price but it is still
very transparent.
 
Whilst there is no
volume limit for Grahams farmers the move has instantly affected production
with one producer switching from x3 to x2 day milking. 
 
The dilemma faced by
Grahams is unfortunately not unique and partly attributable to aggressive
retail discounting of milk together with one or more predating processors
attempting to undercut the existing liquid supplier. 
In some cases its a
case of either cut the price you charge us for the milk or risk loosing some
volume.

Please can we draw your attention to the letter at the bottom of
this report from Dairy UKs Farmers Forum on generic promotion and protection
of dairy products.
 
 It is an important subject
and replying will only take a few seconds. Send your reply to us if you prefer
as we are more than happy to receive it.
 
Lets get a lot of responses in so we can really debate this
subject!
 
 
Letter from The Farmers Forum:
 
Dear
fellow producer,
 
The
Farmers Forum has been debating whether in the current climate, we as an
Industry are making the best of promotional and educational opportunities. The
end of quotas, for example, does pose the question that if more milk is being produced,
are we doing everything we should be doing to maximise the understanding of
dairy foods and drive up demand?
 
We
your fellow producers on the Farmers Forum believe it is important to gather
as much valuable information on this issue from you directly. We have
accumulated much anecdotal evidence already that you would like to see more
investment in promotion to, and education of, the consumer.
 
In
order for us to play an active role in addressing this issue we need your help
in answering the following two questions.
 
1.    
Do you support
financial investment in the generic protection and promotion of all dairy
products and the education of consumers with professionally-researched activity
such as promotion, marketing or sponsorship? 
2.    
If the answer is yes,
how do you think such industry-wide activity could be funded?
Rest
assured your answers count. They will be treated in confidence and will be used
to take this issue forward, hopefully stimulating constructive dialogue across all
sectors within the industry.
 
We
need your help in answering these questions and would ask you to send your
replies either to us at farmersforum@dairyuk.org or reply to the email sent to
you, preferably by the end of July.
 
 
Alternatively
reply to this bulletin with a Yes or a No in the subject and your comments.
 
 
0.169ppl Dairy Crest formula contract
deduction
 from August 1st   (17th July 2015)
This results in a
standard litre price of 27.788ppl (www.milkprices.com).  This gives a 4.578ppl price differential
between milk supplied under the formula contract to that supplied under the
standard DC contact (23.21ppl).
 
0.5ppl milk price reduction for suppliers to

Plus a further 0.5ppl
reduction from September 1st
 
Disaster as GDT crashes a further 10.7%(17th July 2015)
This weeks GDT
result could not have been worse with the average price down 10.7% as the 9th
consecutive fall was recorded.
 
This is now seriously
desperate and world wide cows will surely be culled en mass to cut production
and expenses.  In the case of SMP the
average price of $1702 tonne equates to under Ł1100 a tonne or 1550 tonne,
which is 148 below the intervention price of 1698 tonne.
 
Readers might ask why
a processor would sell product at 148 per tonne below the intervention price?
The reason is the intervention payment terms are 120 days and processors need
the cash flow now. Having said that EU product is expected to go into
intervention within the next 2 weeks.
 
For weeks we have
said it couldnt get worse but it is and the next auction on August 4th
sees volumes on offer go vertical with 60% more product on offer.  
 
Within this figure
WMP volumes will increase by a staggering 88% from this weeks 15,575 tonnes to
29,550 tonnes and SMP product to increase by 39% - ouch.  The likely outcome can only be more price
pain.
 
Key auction results
from today were:
 
Cheddar                  down                 13.9%    to
average $2613 tonne (Ł1680)
WMP                                  down                 13.1%   to average $1848 tonne (Ł1190)
SMP                                   down                 10.1%   to average $1702 tonne (Ł1095)
Butter                                 down                 9.5%     to average $2460 tonne (Ł1585)
 
Most of the product
sold was on one bid by each buyer at the opening/reserve price which is not
good news.
 
At next weeks Royal
Welsh Show the European Commissioner, Phil Hogan will surely be challenged on
his stance that the EU dairy industry is not in crisis. Surely this is a
CRISIS!
 
Houston we have a
very serious and big problem.
 
Grahams The Family Dairy drops 7ppl B price
bombshell onScotlands family dairies (17th
July 2015)
Ians take on the
above headline will be posted on our website on Monday and feature in next
weeks bulletin, following detailed conversations with both Grahams producers
and Robert Graham Snr.  
 
35% of Gighas cows go in one hit (17th July 2015)
The four remaining
dairy farmers on the Scottish island of Gigha, who supply First Milk, will be down
to only 3 following Dan Jacksons decision to quit at the end of this month.
 
This will leave three
producers with around 180 cows in total, making the viability of dairying on
the island very finely balanced.
 
 
Letter from The Farmers Forum:
 
Dear
fellow producer,
 
The
Farmers Forum has been debating whether in the current climate, we as an
Industry are making the best of promotional and educational opportunities. The
end of quotas, for example, does pose the question that if more milk is being produced,
are we doing everything we should be doing to maximise the understanding of
dairy foods and drive up demand?
 
We
your fellow producers on the Farmers Forum believe it is important to gather
as much valuable information on this issue from you directly. We have
accumulated much anecdotal evidence already that you would like to see more
investment in promotion to, and education of, the consumer.
 
In
order for us to play an active role in addressing this issue we need your help
in answering the following two questions.
 
2.    
Do you support
financial investment in the generic protection and promotion of all dairy
products and the education of consumers with professionally-researched activity
such as promotion, marketing or sponsorship? 
3.    
If the answer is yes,
how do you think such industry-wide activity could be funded?
Rest
assured your answers count. They will be treated in confidence and will be used
to take this issue forward, hopefully stimulating constructive dialogue across all
sectors within the industry.
 
We
need your help in answering these questions and would ask you to send your
replies either to us at farmersforum@dairyuk.org or reply to the email sent to
you, preferably by the end of July.
 
Alternatively
reply to this bulletin with a Yes or a No in the subject and your comments.
 
 
 
Last
weeks cheap milk at The Livestock Event  (17th July 2015)
Thank you to all the
code crackers who confirmed that last weeks cheap milk on sale at the NEC for
25ppl, which was an increase from the 16ppl the same milk was on sale the
previous week came, from Wells Farm Dairy.
 
 
Disaster at GDT
crashes a further 10.7%   (15th
July 2015)
Todays GDT result could not have been worse with the average price down
10.7% as the 9th consecutive fall was recorded.
 
At next weeks Royal Welsh Show the European Commissioner, Phil Hogan
will surely be challenged on his stance that the EU dairy industry is not in
crisis. Surely this is a CRISIS!
 
This is now seriously desperate and world wide cows will surely be
culled en mass to cut production and expenses. 
In the case of the SMP the average price of $1702 tonne equates to under
Ł1100 a tonne or 1550 tonne, which is 148 below the intervention price of
1698 tonne.
 
For weeks we have said it couldnt get worse but it is and the next
auction on August 4th sees volumes on offer go vertical with 60%
more product on offer.  
 
Within this figure WMP volumes will increase by a staggering 88% and SMP
by 39% - ouch.  The likely outcome can
only be more price pain.
 
Key auction results from today were:
 
Cheddar                  down                 13.9%    to average $2613 tonne (Ł1680)
WMP                                  down                 13.1%   to average $1848 tonne (Ł1190)
SMP                                   down                 10.1%   to average $1702 tonne (Ł1095)
Butter                                 down                 9.5%     to average $2460 tonne (Ł1585)
 
Houston we have a very serious and big problem.

Tesco announce a comprehensive review of TSDG  The status quo is not
an option    (10th
July 2015)
Tesco aligned producers have been put on
notice that Tesco have started an in depth comprehensive review of the Tesco
Sustainable Dairy Group (TSDG), which has run for close to 8 years.
 
The review will cover everything and some of
the key phrases from the letter for farmers to focus on are as follows:
 
1.     The letter is from Tescos Commercial
Director of Fresh Food & Commodities and not from the Tesco Dairy
Agriculture Manager.
 
2.     ..
allows us to adapt the TSDG to the industry changes we have seen, and make it
sustainable into the future. This
means sustainable for Tesco as well as the farmers.
 
 
3.     Fairness
 we want to pay a fair price for our milk and reward farmers who are driving
performance, efficiency and standards This means the current model is almost certain to change by the next price
review date of November 1st.
 
4.     96%
of you told us (Tesco) that you have benefitted from being a member (of TSDG).  Its
a pity the other 4% didnt top it up to 100%.
 
 
5.     We want you (the supplying farmers) to be
part of this process.  Your views and opinions
really matter to us.
 
Whilst Tesco will listen to producers
opinions I suggest you forget it if your opinion is simply stating we need the
money.  All Tesco core farmers will have
to get involved in this review or face the consequences if they simply leave it
to their respective processors committee members and then scream when the
outcome is not to their satisfaction.  
 
I asked one Tesco committee member how many
times he had been thanked for his efforts and he said once with dozens
of criticisms.  Comments welcome but for Tesco suppliers its
time to be on the pitch in attack and defence not on the side lines chanting
and hurling abuse!
 
Defending the status quo is, in my opinion,
indefensible and not an option.  There
will be change and its best done by negotiation and consent.
 
The outlook for 2015 is grim   (10th July 2015)
Regrettably both the EU and world dairy
outlook for the second half of 2015 is nothing short of very grim. There are
even signs that some European processors are on the brink of supplying product
into intervention, which now seems to be inevitable by August at the latest. 
 
Next Wednesday will be the next fortnightly
GDT auction and already analysts are anticipating another 10% fall in the key
product auction price of WMP with more falls expected in August as the quantity
of product on offer rockets up.
 
1500 jobs to go   (10th
July 2015)
Fonterra is expected to cut around 1500 jobs
as part of a wholesale restructure and streamlining. 
 
Cheap milk at NEC Livestock Event at 25ppl   (10th July 2015)
There is nothing like rubbing dairy farmers
noses in it. Several eagle eyed farmers were quick to alert Ian to the fact
Eden Fresh Milk was on offer at the NEC for 25ppl.
 
At least it was going up in price because they
claimed that last week it was selling at the NEC for 16ppl or 6 litres for
Ł1.  Perhaps the RABDF suggested the
price should be increased for the duration of the event.
 
Could one of our readers please confirm who
processes and packs Eden milk?
 
Grim GDT auction
results with WMP down 10.8%!!   (3rd
July 2015)
Wednesdays GDT auction results were grim with the all products average
down 5.9% with the biggest hit coming in the form of a brutal 10.8% drop in WMP
prices leaving them only just above $2,000 (US) a tonne averaging $2,054.
 
This hurts because both in New Zealand and globally the WMP price is a
huge influencer in determining farm gate milk prices.  Such low prices were last seen 6 years ago in
July 2009.
 
Note, in exactly 12 months the auction value of SMP has more than
halved to what it was in July 2014 when prices started to tumble big time and
its not ended yet.
 
Note, the volume on offer at this weeks auction was more than 40% up
on the volume put forward only two weeks ago with 30,000 tonnes forward.
 
There is only one question everyone is asking:
 
How long will global dairy prices continue to drop before they bottom
out?
 
Despite the continued downward spiral the EUs Agriculture Commissioner
Phil Hogan maintains there is no
crisis in the dairy sector. 
Well it looks like a crisis to Ian.
 
Key prices from the auction
WMP                                  down                 10.8%   to average         $2054/tonne

1.5ppl milk price reduction
for Grahams Dairies (Scotland) suppliers  from 15th

This takes producers standard litre price down to 23.75ppl (www.milkprices.com)
 
1ppl milk price
reduction for Crediton Dairies suppliers  from 1st
August     (3rd July 2015)
This takes producers standard litre price down to 25.36ppl (www.milkprices.com)
 
0.25ppl milk price
increase for Dairy Crest Direct Davidstow suppliers  from 1st August    (3rd July 2015)
This increase is in recognition of the new production standards farmers
have to adhere to and comply with in preparation for DCs exciting infant
formula production facility.
 
Its the first increase the farmers have had since November 2013 and
increases producers standard litre price to 25.34ppl (www.milkprices.com)
 
Stand on for
August milk prices for Dairy Crest liquid suppliers    (3rd July 2015)
This will bring the Dairy Crest liquid and Muller Wiseman non-aligned
standard litre prices almost on parity, which will help oil the wheels for the
buyout of Dairy Crests liquid business when it is given the green light later
this year.
 
Dairy Crest liquid standard litre price 23.09ppl v Muller Wismans
23.15ppl.
 
Stand on for Dairy
Crests organic milk price for August  standard
litre price 38.43ppl.    (3rd July 2015)
 
95.3% of Dairy
Crest Direct farmers sign up to DPO   (3rd
July 2015)
Dairy Crest Direct (DCD) have signed up 95.3% of their 1050 supplying
members to their DPO (Dairy Producer Organisation).
 
A key feature of the DPO status is it will ensure future contractual
term variations and price changes will be by negotiation and not at Dairy
Crests discretion.
 
The wonder is why only 95.3% have signed up and not 100% unless the
remaining 4.7% who havent signed are planning to exit the industry.  On that score if only 4.7% hang the clusters up
in the next 12 months that could be a fantastic result.
 
1ppl milk price
reduction for First Milk  A price milk  from 1st July  (30th June 2015)
The reduction is across the board with the exception of those in the
Midlands balancing pool whose reduction will be 0.7ppl.
 
The resulting new www.milkprices.com standard litre prices will be
as follows:
 
The Midlands & East Wales balancing pool 18.6ppl
Mainland Scotland 19.3ppl
North of England 19.5ppl
Haverfordwest  20.17ppl
Lake District 20.2ppl
 
After deduction of the 2ppl capital retention plus the 80:20 mix of
A and B prices means at least an estimated 3ppl will be deducted from producers
delayed payments to the bank and thats before any adjustments are made in respect
of individual profiles.
 
This effectively gives a standard litre paid into the bank of between
15.8ppl and 17.2ppl.
 
Note, First Milks forecast July B milk price is between 14ppl to 17ppl,
however, its a certainty if will be closer to 14ppl than 17ppl.
 
Finally, in making the announcement with only a weeks notice of the
price change to members First Milk has, on this occasion, abandoned the
Voluntary Code of Practice.
 
I dont think anyone will criticise them for that move on two counts.
 
One is why should they subscribe to the code when it comes to price
changes, when others clearly dont?
 
Secondly, they have to do what they have to do to ensure they stop the
barmy practice of paying members more money for milk then they can obtain from
the market place. Simple.
 
1.18ppl milk price
reduction for Arla AMBA members - from 6th July   (30th June 2015)
This is made up of a 1 Euro Cent across the board price reduction
(0.77ppl) on a UK standard litre plus 0.41ppl reduction as a result of the currency
smoothing mechanism adjustment
.
This takes producers standard litre price to 23.81ppl (www.milkprices.com)

 
1ppl milk price
reduction for Arla Directs - from 1st August  (30th June 2015)
This takes producers standard litre price down to 21ppl (www.milkprices.com)
 
EU milk production
is a problem   (30th June 2015)
An estimated 5% increase in May milk production is estimated as recorded
and more seriously it equates to the need to increase exports by a whopping 40%
in order to shift the additional product from this extra milk.
 
Individual countries positions are as follows:
 
Southern Ireland production in April +14.5%
Italy production in April + 9.7%
Holland production in May + 7.5%
Poland production in April + 4.1%
In the case of the USA, production for May was +1.4%
 
Little wonder no one is predicting that ex-farm gate milk prices may
have bottomed out. 
 
Sir Jim Paice to
stand down as Chairman of First Milk  (30th
June 2015)
Following on from his comments as to the need for commercial and
business skills on the board of First Milk, Sir Jim has announced he is to
stand down as soon as a replacement is agreed.
 
Two or three points spring to mind connected to this announcement.
Firstly, he is sure to shortly be followed by others who will step down from
the board of First Milk as it re-groups to execute Gallachers turnaround plan.
 
Second, there was minimal, if indeed, any recognition in the NFUs press
release/NFU reaction bulletin in terms of normal protocol, which many had
expected would have included a line suggesting Sir Jim had done a good job. Not
a word along these lines from either the President of the NFU or its Dairy
Board Chairman, both of whom were quoted. The situation was even worse in the
Scottish NFUs press release of the same date.
 
New Chairman of
Muller Wiseman Milk Group Board   (30th
June 2015)
Philip Rowney takes over as Chairman of the group from Roddy Catto and in
doing so represents 1200 dairy farmers who supply MW.
 
The press release paid tribute and thanks to the work of the outgoing
Chairman. 
 
Roddy deserves enormous credit for the hard work, commitment and energy
he has shown as Chairman of the MWMG board
 
More than half of
UK consumers are willing to pay more for milk - according to Mintel   (30th June 2015) 
One of the leading market intelligence research companies, Mintel, have
found that over 50% of consumers surveyed would be willing to pay more than Ł1
for 4 pints of milk.
 
So as retailers battle to sell the lowest price milk at 89p or less for
4 pints, in a bid to get customers through the door, Mintel is asking the key
question.
 
Whether that level of price cutting is needed?
 
First Milk announce eye-watering losses of Ł22m  (19th June 2015)
 
First Milk have informed members that its
losses for the financial year ended March 2015 will be around Ł22m equal to
Ł61,000/day or nearly Ł2m/month. At least that has got the bad news out early, Tesco
style, but the big question for its members will surley be by how much have
these loses slowed down in April and May of 2015 and in what month do they
budget to breakeven?
 
First Milk have consistently paid one of the
lowest, if not the lowest, ex-farm gate milk prices, yet still they paid out
more than they could afford to pay and have consequently returned to members
for money to bridge the gap.
 
Several First Milk members who emailed Ian
today seem to have come to the conclusion that all the blame sticks with the
former CEO, Kate Allum. That may be a convenient place to hide but its unlikely
to be the whole story.
 
The First Milk board have to accept
responsibility for the part they have played in achieving these appauling
results because they have a clear remit and it appears they have failed.
 
In todays letter to members, Chairman Sir Jim
Paice, has commented Personally,
I believe a business of this size needs a board with substantial commercial
experience. Apologies to all
involved at First Milk but translating this means very few farmers will sit on
the main board of First Milk. 
 
On that statement Ian feels Sir Jim is bang
on. But First Milk is a business, which is currently shrinking or at best
holding its own in dirty water and it needs that commercial expertise asap. Ian
is not sure whether those on the board at the moment know they have to leave,
but for those who do realise they might be wise to move on prior to completion
of the review. 
 
The review of its governance cannot come soon enough
because if Gallacher is to stand any chance of succeeding with his turnaround
policy he needs more professionals on his board and not, with respect,
enthusiastic amateurs who have played their part in todays financial
announcement. But at the end of the day its up to the members to influence who
is in and out of the board and, to express any dissatisfaction.
 
One of the options open to Muller is discounted  (19th June 2015)
 
Earlier this week Ian suggested one of the
options open to Muller was to withdraw its Ł80m offer to buy Dairy Crests
liquid business and walk away.
 
Ian is reliably informed that the deal was
signed by both parties and will be concluded subject to Competition Authority
(CMA) approval.
 
That means there are only two options available
to Muller with one a near certainty namely that the deal is subject to an in
depth scrutiny from the CMA under phase 2. 
Quite why phase 2 has to take 6 months conclude to leaving 4,000 plus
employees in limbo is beyond comprehension but I guess the CMA simply have
rules, procedures & timelines.
 
However, for the retailer(s) or others who
have already thrown spanners in the works with the CMA its time to produce the
objections and evidence.
 
Its put up or shut up time, because if I were
Muller I would be seeking to settle for nothing less than unconditional
approval.
 
Shore Capital suggested the complainant
retailer could be ASDA, which is surely the least likely.  Lets face it ASDA source all their GB liquid
milk from one sole supplier Arla and dont appear to experience any regional
problems.  They surely have no grounds to
raise any issues with the CMA.
 
European and world view   (19th June 2015)
The general view is that GDT Auction prices
are unlikely to have stabilised or bottomed out this week.  Most, if not all, respected analysts are now
of the opinion that it will be at least 12 months before we see signs of any
substantial price increases.
 
UK, EU and world milk production is still
increasing and this is not matched by increased demand.
 
In the case of the UK May production is
estimated, by DairyCo, to be +2.5% at 1.37 billion litres compared to that
recorded in 2014 and is record.
 
Whilst the average decline at this weeks GDT
was small it has to be balanced with the fact the volume of available product
amounted to only 21,800 tonnes and in two weeks time the tonnage will increase
by 44% to 31,300 tonnes.  That will be a
real test for the market.
 
Note, the Arla Westbury SMP sold at this
weeks GDT actually sold for 95% of the current EU intervention price so it
cannot really fall any lower.
 
New Chairman at Belton Cheese    (19th June 2015)
William Neville, former senior partner at
solicitors Burges Salmon and the man considered the UK dairy industries legal guru
and Rottweiler, is the new Non-Executive Chairman at Belton Cheese, Shropshire.
 
GDT average continues to head south  but  (16th June 2015)
Today's GDT all products average fell for
the 7th consecutive time this time by the smaller margin of 1.3% to average US
$ 2409 compared to the average achieved two weeks ago.
 
The positives, other than the fact the fall
was smaller than recorded in recent months, was the fact many key products were
either close to a stand on price or saw their average price improve.
 
Also the number of registered bidders
continues to increase and today totalled 649 compared to 642 at the last
auction and similarly the number of winning bidders increased from 115 to 125
which is encouraging
 
Key
movers of interest:
Cheddar                  +
2.4% to average          $3128 tonne
Butter                                 +3.3%
to average           $2707 tonne
WMP                                  0.1%
to average             $2327 tonne
SMP                                   0.2%
to average             $1978 tonne
Westbury SMP                    2.1% to average             $1875
tonne which is the lowest recorded average
 
0.661ppl milk price reduction for Dairy Crest Formula producers  (16th
June 2015)
This is from 1st July and means the
gap between the standard Dairy Crest price and the formula price is
4.747ppl.  The adjustment is
predominantly as a result of a 20% plus fall in cream prices.
 
The resulting formula standard litre price
will be 27.957ppl.
 
0.11ppl milk price reduction for Sainsburys (SDDG)  from 1st July   (16th June 2015)
This is a quarterly review and will result in
the following standard litre prices:
 
Muller                     30.87ppl
Dairy Crest  30.81ppl
Arla                        30.75ppl
 
Bottled it!  Muller-Wiseman merger
goes to phase 2   (16th June 2015)
This was a very appropriate headline from
Shore Capitals dairy analyst Clive Black as he reported on The Competition
& Markets Authority (CMA) press release, which was bizarrely issued at
17:30 hours last Friday.
 
The Ł80 million bid by Muller to acquire the
liquid business of Dairy Crest will now move to an in depth investigation under
phase 2 unless acceptable undertakings
are offered by Muller to the CMA by this Friday, 19th.
 
Throughout the press release there is no
acknowledgement from the CMA that this deal simply has to take place because no
business can continue to lose circa Ł15 million a year as Dairy Crest did last
year in its liquid division.
 
Instead its obvious from the press release
that one or more of our big retailers has objected to the deal on the grounds
that there will be:
a realistic prospect of a substantial lessening of
competition in the supply of fresh milk to major grocery retailers with
national scope (national multiples) in certain regions in Great Britain commented the CMA in their press release.
 
In Ians opinion this points to one region
with up to two national retailers who are the most likely to have objected.
 
The region is most likely to be the South West
and the short odds are on a complaint from Sainsburys followed possibly by
Morrisons.
 
The CMA has confirmed to Ian that the identity
of objectors in phase 1 and/or the substance of their objection will not be
publically disclosed.
 
In its press release the CMA goes on to state:
 The CMA
considers that the merger may lead to higher prices in the supply of fresh milk
to national multiples and, in turn, for consumers.
 
Clive Black accurately comments that no one
seriously believes that the Big Four (supermarkets) will charge more to
customers for milk in Plymouth, Swansea and Taunton that the rest of the
country.  Using an old fashioned milk
industry term, therefore, has the CMA bottled it?
 
He is spot on they have bottled it and
completely ignored the farmer impact of the deal and have hidden behind one or
more of our big 4 retailers  wimps.
 
Speculation over what the Muller team might do next   (16th June 2015)
As Ian sees it Muller have three options:
 
1.     They could simply say lets go to phase 2 and
let it run its 6 month course to Xmas. 
They can do this in the full knowledge that the deal is almost certain
to be approved at the end of phase 2.
 
2.     Assuming the South West is the region in
question; Muller could offer to sell its Bridgwater liquid factory.  There must be more chance of Ian becoming an
Olympic synchronised swimming gold medallist than that happening.  Thats a scary thought!
 
 
3.     Muller say to hell with it, we dont need the
aggro.  We will immediately withdraw the
offer and let Dairy Crests liquid business bleed to death.
 
Option 3 looks tempting to Ian followed by
option 1, however, given the deal is right for both parties and right for the
UK dairy industry I suspect Muller will be determined that option 1 is the
right avenue to pursue.
 
Arla Tesco farmers are 6ppl apart but for how much longer?   (16th June 2015)
The difference in the milk price received by
Arla AMCO co-op members on a Tesco aligned contract and the Arla Tesco directs
is almost 6ppl and must surely be at its widest point.
 
By 1st November Tesco are sure to
reduce the price by at least the change in the cost of production if not more
which will narrow the gap by a sizeable percentage.
 
As part of a costings review Arla have
examined the 0.2ppl livestock Code of Practice enhancement paid to Arla AMCO
members who supply Tesco and the result is the true cost is 0.48ppl.  Note, this premium is not paid to the Arla
Tesco directs.
 
From 1st July the premium paid will
increase from 0.2ppl to 0.48ppl.  In
addition, a back payment of 0.6ppl to cover the top up from 1st
January 2014 to 30th June 2015 will be paid to all Arla AMCO Tesco
suppliers who are members at 31st December 2015.
 
There will be some who question why there is a
delay in paying the top up payment.  We
can only come up with one real reason and that is the delay is an attempt to
persuade any Arla AMCO Tesco farmers contemplating serving 3 months notice to
become Arla Tesco direct suppliers to not make that move.
 
In addition, by the time the 0.6ppl is paid
the gap and the situation is likely to have changed, which coupled with the
0.6ppl top up is likely to influence some AMCO members.
 
Arla 0.5ppl levy is suspended again   (16th June 2015)
Arla AMCO members will not be paying the
0.5ppl levy for the three month period starting 1st July.  The holiday from the levy was in place from
January to March then re-introduced from April to June.
 
Cheap Milk   (16th June 2015)
4 litres (7 pints) for Ł1.  Spotted in Premier Lea Village Convenience
Store, Kitts Green Road, Birmingham  Milk from Paynes Dairies.
 
Morrisons have cut the price of 4 pints to 89p
and in doing so have followed ASDA and Aldi.
 
Morrisons commented that the reduction will
not affect the price they pay their dairy suppliers.  Yeah, yeah and all in the dairy industry
believe them!
 
 
 
0.75ppl milk price
reduction for suppliers to Glanbia Cheese  from 1st
July  (5th June 2015)
This takes producers standard litre price to 23.94ppl 
 
0.5ppl milk price reduction for suppliers to Woodcocks Dairy - from July 1st (5th June 2015)
This takes producers standard litre price to
24.5ppl
 
Dairy Crest hold
milk prices for July  (5th June 2015)
Dairy Crest has joined Muller in announcing to hold farm gate milk
prices until at least August 1st.
 
Spot Prices back
down to 12ppl  Need we say anymore? (5th June 2015)
 
GDT falls for the
6th consecutive time both the number of registered and successful
bidders fell to those recorded two weeks earlier  (5th June 2015)
 
Further grim news from this weeks GDT auction with the overall average
falling 4.3% to average $2412 with virtually all products recording falls.
 
Butter was hit hardest falling 10% and its auction value has plummeted
by 32% in just three months.
 
 
Notable prices were:
Butter                     down     10%      to
average         $2619/t
WMP                      down     3.1%     to

Cheddar      up         11.3%   to
average         $3055/t
 
Caffe Nero  The
Villains or The Victims  (5th June 2015)
One of the main talking points at the excellent Cornwall Show was,
inevitably, Caffe Nero allegedly banning milk from coming from the two badger
cull areas. Its fair to say that farmers are seething about this, and so too
was I. Note the word was. The past tense. Thats until I had spoken to Nero at
length and in-depth and thought a bit more about what it has done. My views
will be diametrically opposed to most farmers, but theres a lynch mob out
there, right now. Some in the Dairy Industry refer to me as a leader (!) 
If thats the case I contest that few if any leaders would follow or condone a
lynch mob. I hope what I have to say now tempers some of the industrys
(entirely understandable) vitriol against the company.
First, yes, the
chain seems to have panicked in making its decision. But I genuinely believe
that it had received credible, malicious and very nasty threats to its staff.
And remember many (most in fact) of its public-facing staff are young and
female. 80% of its staff are aged between 18 and 30, in fact. They are wholly
untrained in dealing with nasty, malicious people hell bent on being as
unpleasant and intimidating as they can be. Why should they be trained in that?
Or put in that position? I have a daughter aged 23 and I wouldnt want her to
face such a frightening scene. Having said that she works in the office with me
and she would say thats frightening and scary.  Many farmers will have
daughters and sons of the same or similar age to those working in Nero, and who
are starting out in perhaps their first job. I am sure they share my view. Some
of the small shops in London have as few as two people working in them. 
So thats two youngish girls potentially under threat. For that reason I can
wholly empathise as to why Nero wanted to, in fact had to put their staff first
on this issue. I know the same applies to farmers too. They should not be
threatened either, but that is the nature of the people we are dealing with.
Nero were a soft
target for the food terrorists who embarked on a nasty social media campaign
which included sending at least one threatening email direct to one of its
Senior people aimed at him and his family. In addition the terrorists posted up
a map of the route of a planned austerity march on June 20th which
marked every Nero coffee store on it. Note Nero have 100 London stores.
Second, Nero has
had a thorough thumping from farmers, journalist and commentators. But Nero are
not the Villains or the enemy. The enemy are the same bast-rds that intimidate
the farmers in the cull zones. We are on the same side as Nero. As an industry
we should be standing by our customers in such times, not condemning them and
fighting among ourselves. We have to throw a protective, unified arm around
them and send out the message that the antis wont divide and rule us. Unless
we do this then it will be another company next, and then another one after
that.
Despite press
claims to the contrary having spoken to Nero on several occasions at Board
level I can confirm the Police are heavily involved and have taken the threats
very seriously. Nero have not actually refused to apologise to dairy farmers
but they simply cant at the moment under these circumstances.
Third, every hour
that passes when farmers are screaming at Nero is another hour where the antis
are laughing at our expense, and rejoicing in all the publicity they have
generated, and that we continue to generate on their behalf. They secured an
early PR victory, but we are helping to drag it out. It has to stop.
Nero doesnt have
a position for or against the badger cull which they say is a matter for the
Government to deal with. However they certainly have the utmost sympathy for
dairy farmers who are caught up in this situation. They do have a duty of care
to protect their staff and customers from the threats of violence, intimidation
and business disruption.
With hindsight
Nero could certainly have handled the situation different and better but at the
end of the day they simply sell coffee and from my conversations with them Nero
plan to continue to use British milk from British dairy farmers and have no
appetite to take a position on the badger cull.
In my opinion the
time for giving Nero a thump is over. It is now time to hold out the hand of
co-operation and to start helping it to get back to where it was, and to send a
message out that the industry will help and support other customers faced with
similar intimidation. Its Nero today and you can be sure other targets
will already be on the terrorists radar. Its time to stand united.
First Milks
Chairman Sir Jim Paice's Ł90k salary is slammed by politicians  (5th June 2015)
The Scottish Rural Affairs Committee enquiry singled out First Milks
Sir Jim Paice's salary of Ł90,000 a year for 50 days work for some robust
scrutiny.
 
MSP asked whether the payment of Ł1800 a day was fair remuneration given
the difficulties faced by the farmer members of the troubled co-op.
 
Sir Jims response was I'm not going to deny that I'm being paid very
reasonably for it, but that's not the primary objective"
 
There was also criticism of the fact the salaries of the rest of the
board are "shrouded under secrecy".
 
That's surprising because if it's true then clearly some of the members
presumably feel the salary they receive is unjustified.
 
One thing is for certain if the ongoing independent report into the governance
of First Milk is as hard hitting as it should be a number of its board will
surely be replaced this year with better qualified professional members who can
help the new CEO as opposed to what some have called enthusiastic members.
 
Arla UK TV campaign
promotes dairy farming and ownership  (5th
June 2015)
This Monday, during the Coronation Street adverts, Arla will have the
first showing of its new advert, which focuses on both Arlas range of dairy
products and the fact the co-op is owned by its farmer members.
 
The advert is eye catching to both farmers and families and follows Arla
farmer, Joe Delves, during his morning with the cows whilst the rest of the
world is waking up.
 
The best cheddar
cheese is Beltons Traditional Organic  (5th
June 2015)
Farmhouse cheesemakers Belton Cheese were crowned Best Cheddar Cheese
with its Traditional Organic Cheddar at the British Cheese Awards. Belton
Cheese went on to win 17 awards in total. 
With 177 cheesemakers and more than 1000 cheeses competing, the competition
was tough.
 
Scottish farmers
to share Ł12.2m of CAP refund  (5th
June 2015)
Around 14,600 Scottish farmers will receive a share of Ł12.2m into their
bank accounts next week, which is basically a refund of the unspent CAP
financial discipline fund for 2013 SFP payments.
 
The average farmer payout is expected to be just under Ł850 per farmer.
 
At 39p for two
litres we thought we had found Britains cheapest milk but   (5th June 2015)
Yes, last Friday Paynes Dairies supplied milk at 79p for 3 litres was
very quickly ousted for the number one spot as Britains cheapest milk.  In fact, it lasted 3 minutes at the number
one spot until pictures cam through showing 2 litres of both Country Life milk
and 2 litres of Muller Wiseman branded milk for 39p.
 
Then along came 2 litres of Goodness from Eden Milk supplied by Wells
Dairies for 35ppl.  Yes, sold at
17.5ppl.  Clear evidence that all hell
has broken out again in the Midlands with, one would assume, processors simply
battling on price to gain a shilling on milk rather than balance it into
commodities.
 
Thanks to the eagle-eyed readers who sent us the evidence of the
deals.  I hope no one can top trip this
latest deal.
 
0.84ppl (1 Euro
Cent) milk price reduction for Arla members it could have been worse  (29th May 2015)
The latest Arla member milk price reduction of 0.84ppl from 25th
May is unwelcome but could have been worse, given the continual decline in
world dairy prices.  
 
This latest reduction takes producers standard litre price to 24.99ppl
for non aligned suppliers and 25.69ppl for aligned Tesco suppliers
(www.milkprices.com)
 
1.45ppl milk price
reduction for M&S aligned producers  from
June 1st   (29th May 2015)
This takes producers standard litre price down to 32.79ppl (www.milkprices.com)
 
1.5 Euro Cents
milk price reduction for Friesland Campina suppliers  from June    (29th May 2015)
This takes producers UK equivalent standard litre price down to 21ppl (www.milkprices.com)
 
Muller to hold its
July milk price   (29th May 2015)
Unconfirmed reports and strong rumours indicate that Muller will confirm
to its suppliers very early next week that they will hold producer milk prices
for July.  This is a move which was
nowhere near the bookies favourite for a July milk price cut.
 
Congratulations to all involved in this decision.  What happens to the August farm gate milk
price and beyond is down to producers and production levels.  
 
Peak production
was 44.8million litres on 26th April  (29th May 2015)
According to DairyCo peak daily production peaked on April 26th
at 44.8m litres, up 1 million litres (+2.2%) on the 43.8m peak achieved in
2014.  Production continues to run 1
million litres a day ahead of last year post the peak production day.  During the first 13 weeks of 2015 we produced
an additional 21 million litres of milk and there lies a big problem.
 
In summary, if production continues as these levels farm gate milk
prices will be subject to further downward pressure.  Farm gate supplies cannot continue at current
levels and not affect the milk price. 
Less = more.
 
Fonterra prices
pile more pressure on New Zealand dairy farmers  (29th May 2015)
Fonterra has announced a further drop of 10 cents to NZ $4.40 per kg of
milk solids as its latest forecast payout for the 2014/15 season, which ends
this week.
 
If this becomes the final price for the year it will be close to half of
the NZ $8.40 paid out a year earlier.
 
At the same time Fonterra has announced its opening 1st June
2015/16 farm gate milk price at NZ $5.25.
 
New Zealands second largest dairy co-operative, Westland, has also
announced its opening price bracket for next season as $5.60 to $6.00 kg.
 
Dairy Crests year
end profits drop 60%   (29th May 2015)
DCs end of year financials show a 60% drop in profit before tax falling
from Ł54.2million (2014) to Ł22.1m (2015). 
The drop in profits is predominantly attributable to one off exceptional
costs totalling Ł36m and includes the closure totalling of sites and costs
associated with the sale of its liquid business to Muller Wiseman for Ł80m.
 
Dairy Crest shares closed at Ł5.13 yesterday the mid point range in
trading values seen during the last twelve months which have ranged between
Ł5.05 and Ł5.20.
 
ScotGov step
forward to help Bute & Campbeltown  (29th
May 2015)
The Scottish Government has allocated Ł465,000 of aid to help its
struggling Highlands and Islands dairy industry.  Of the money Ł65,000 will provide subsidised ferry
transport assistance for First Milk to haul milk by ferry from 13 farms
producing around 15 million litres on the Isle of Bute.  The remaining Ł400,000 has been allocated to
First Milks Campbeltown Creamery, where 32 producers supply milk to produce
Mull of Kintyre cheddar.
 
Whats the problem
with the Island of Gighas struggling milk producers?  (29th May 2015)
Whilst the Scottish Government is to be congratulated for offering
financial assistance for the transport of milk from Bute, it is jaw dropping
for the four remaining milk producers from the tiny island of Gigha to be
ignored.  Why have ScotGov excluded
Gigha?  Do they want to accelerate the
ending of milk production in Gigha?
 
There are only four remaining milk producers on Gigha and one of those
plans to exit as soon as possible.
 
GDT auction  (29th May 2015)
The next auction will be on Tuesday next, 2nd.  WMP volumes on offer will be up 15% to those
offered two weeks ago, however, the volume of NZ SMP on offer will be 14%
less.  Fingers crossed for the previous 5
consecutive auction average price drops not turning into a run of six.
 
DCD is the UKs
first DPO  (29th May 2015)
For the past 11 years Dairy Crest Direct (DCD) has represented its
English & Welsh supplying farmers.
 
Following a successful application to the RDPE Ł5 million dairy fund of
which DCD received Ł110,000 they are now the first UK government approved Dairy
Producer Organisation (DPO).
 
The move formalises the ability for DCD to negotiate milk prices and
contract terms on behalf of its 1050 farmers and their 1.5 billion litres (or
12% of GB milk output) of milk production.
 
For the Dairy Crest suppliers who are not members of DCD the situation
remains the same in so far DC can change prices on a discretionary basis.
 
Arla Chairman is
re-elected (29th May 2015)
No surprises to learn that Swedish farmer and business man Ake Hantoft
has been re-elected to continue as Chairman of Arla AMBA representing 13,500
farmer members.  Note, the Arla board has
been trimmed by three for the next term 2015-2017  a point others in GB should
take note of.
 
The two Arla board directors from GB are Jonathan Ovens and Johnnie
Russell.
 
79p for 3 litres 
Is this Britains cheapest milk?  (29th
May 2015)
3 litres of whole or semi-skimmed milk on sale at Best Buy Cash &
Carry, 31 London Street, Leicester (Tel. 0116 2765550) for only 79p
(26.3ppl).  Milk from Paynes Dairies,
Yorkshire
 
Thanks to the two eagle eyed readers who alerted us to the deal.  Who is funding the deal?  Is there cheap B quota milk swishing around
at ridiculously low prices chapping the legs from under other processors?
               
Ians Classic Mini
Adventure to New Zealand  (29th May 2015)
 
Carole (my long suffering wife) and I returned from New Zealand a month
ago, and what a fantastic experience we had.
 
During the six days we drove 2,500km and made lots of friends whom we
aim to stay in contact with.
 
We always had a trip to New Zealand on our bucket list and the
opportunity to participate in the Pork Pie Mini Run from the tip of the North
Island at Cape Reinga to the opposite tip on the South Island at Bluff was just
the push we needed.
 
Neither of us have previously done a charity challenge, but it sounded
like a great idea. It would also be a good opportunity to tease a few brass
farthings out of the weekly recipients of this free bulletin for two good
causes.
 
Our efforts and the generosity of 219 donors has, to date, raised
Ł6,600. This was split Ł5,800 to The Rainbow Trust, which supports British
families of children with life threatening illnesses, and Ł800 to The Kids Can
Charity, supporting New Zealand children. The Kids Can giving page has now
closed.
 
We self funded our trip so 100% of every donation has gone to the
relevant charity and to those it was intended. 
Nobody contributed a single penny to our adventure.
 
We exceeded our initial target and enjoyed an unforgettable and
incredible experience and brought back indescribable memories. Oh, and yes  we
saw a lot of dairy cows!
 
We also (understandably) scooped a prize as one of the furthest
travelled participants, as our fuel and airfare bill will testify to.
 
Most charity challenges result in the participants losing weight,
however, a combination of mutton and possum pies and homemade icecream killed
that for us!

Finally, in addition to thanking all of the 219 generous bulletin
readers Carole and I must thank pinpointpal for their support.
 
We have been selling their vehicle tracking devices for several months
now and they came up with the great idea to track our movements in New Zealand.  (Click on the live location map link.)
 
It was brilliant, and in addition they provided daily updates and
photographs on the website and blog.
 
So a big thank you to them, and if you are interested in knowing about the
trackers to keep tabs on your cars, or equipment (not THAT equipment [although
some wives have been known to buy one to keep track of their husbands, if you
know what I mean!]) or members of your family, call or email Lydia in the
office on (01335) 324594 or lydia@ipaquotas.co.uk who is the tracking expert.
 
Many thanks again,

GDT Auction
continues to fall  (19th
May 2015)
Global dairy commodity prices continue to decline on account of
unprecedented global production which is proving extremely difficult for some
European processors to accommodate and process. 
 
Todays auction produced more disappointing news with the average price
down a further 2.2% to average US $2472 compared to the $2515 average recorded
only two weeks ago. Note, Arla Westbury powder average was up $20 a tonne.
 
Notable movers were:
 
Cheddar down 7.1% to average $2745 
SMP down 3.6% to average $1992 
Butter down 3.2% to average $2911 per tonne 
WMP down 0.5% to average $2390 per tonne 
Arla Westbury SMP up 1% to average $1970 per tonne.
 
Unfortunately, excess
to the GDT historical data was denied as we wrote this news. More detail commentary
on todays auction results will follow tomorrow.
Put simply its getting tougher.
 
The UK has passed
its peak production day  (19th
May 2015)
Milk purchasers have confirmed that on a daily basis milk production is
declining having peaked in late April. 
Spot milk is trading at around 16ppl to 17ppl not withstanding this
weekends Bank Holiday, which will inevitably cause a blip and exert short term
pressure on spot prices.
 
0.03ppl price
decrease for DC/DCD formula contracted producers  from June 1st  (19th May 2015)
This takes producers standard litre price to 28.618ppl, which gives a
positive 5.113ppl price advantage over the Dairy Crest non-aligned standard
litre price of 23.5ppl.
 
The main contributor to the small price correction is a Ł100 tonne
decrease in cream values equivalent to 0.56ppl.
 
RPA stop producing
UK milk production figure      (19th
May 2015)
With the ending of quotas has come the news that the RPA will no longer
collate UK monthly milk production figures.
 
Tesco Tom is no
more   (19th May 2015)
Tom Hind (AKA Tesco Tom) will be leaving the retailer in a few days time
following a relatively short 20 month employment as Tescos Director of
Agriculture.
 
At the time if his appointment we suggested he could be a gamekeeper
turned poacher.  All eyes will be on
where he next turns up.  Perhaps he will
be back at the NFU!
 
Entitlement Trading Update   (8th May 2015)
The
Entitlement/Basic Area trading is not anything like as exciting as trading milk
quota but it is certainly volatile.  One
day you have 120 Entitlements and in comes a buyer for 110 and you have next to
nothing.  The above lots are all we have
available as we go to print but the situation is changing daily.  For more information contact Jacquey at the
office on 01335 324594 or email Jacquey@ipaquotas.co.uk
 
AMPE   (8th May 2015)
Using the GDT average price for butter and Arla SMP at todays exchange
rate gives a current AMPE price of only 17.4ppl.

reduction for Joseph Heler suppliers  -  from
June 1st    (8th May 2015)
 
1ppl milk price
reduction for Meadow Foods suppliers  -  from
June 1st   (8th May 2015)
This takes producers standard litre price down to 21ppl (www.milkprices.com)

More grim results from GDT   (6th May 2015
Yesterdays GDT auction saw average prices fall a further 3.5% to
average US$2515, which is half the February 2014 average price.  SMP recorded
its lowest auction average at US$2048 tonne, less than half its value 13 months
earlier.
 
The only slightly positive news from the auction was that the quantity
sold totalled 27,369 tonnes (+1773 tonnes/+7%)  compared to the quantity
sold three weeks earlier.  In addition
 an extra nine new companies successfully bought at the auction taking the total companies who purchased at this
auction to a healthy 117, which is encouraging.  In addition, cheddar
prices increased by 9.1%, which helped boost the overall average to what it
might have been.
 
Key movers were:
 
WMP                                  down
1.8% to average US$2386 tonne
SMP      
               
            down 7.5%
to average US$2048 tonne
Arla Westbury SMP             averaged US$1950 tonne (Ł1290!)
BMP
                                  down 14% to average US$1748 tonne
Butter                                 down 0.8% to average US$3005 tonne
Cheddar                              up 9.1% to average US$3012 tonne
 
Analysts are now stating there are no signs  of prices improving
and the expectation is that low prices could continue for the rest of 2015.
 However, prices are dropping very close to EU intervention levels, which
should provide a bottom in the market.
 
0.52ppl milk price
reduction for Waitrose suppliers - from May 11th  (1st
May 2015) 
This takes producers standard litre down from 33ppl to 32.48ppl (www.milkprices.com)
 
1.4ppl milk price
reduction for Arla non aligned directs - from June 1st   (1st
May 2015) 
This takes producers standard litre price to 22ppl compared to the May
Arla full members price of 25.83ppl. 
Note, the quantity of milk supplied direct on the 22ppl standard litre
price is around 40 million litres.
 
March milk price
held for United Dairy Farmers at 21.94ppl  (1st
May 2015)
Members of Northern Irelands milk co-op United Dairy Farmers will
receive a standard litre price for March deliveries of 21.94ppl
(www.milkprices.com), which means producers milk price ends the year 36%
(-12.23ppl) down in 12 months from 34.17ppl to 21.94ppl. 
 
For United Milks Kendall suppliers their March liquid standard litre
price is 24.89ppl (www.milkprices.com)
 
First Milks CEO
Mike Gallacher cuts deep  (1st May 2015)
Today Mike Gallacher having been at the helm of First Milk for six weeks
has made his first big move and cut deep with a raft of measures designed to
turnaround the fortunes of the co-operative and its members but for many the
changes are painful. 
 
a.     Around 70 jobs to be axed predominantly at the Glasgow HQ with some
departments cut in half. The expectation is that these cuts should add up to
around 0.5ppl. 
b.     Pricing based on the end destination for individual producer milk
starting June 1st.
 
This effectively means farmers will be designated to either a
cheese/manufacturing pool or a balancing pool.
 
The manufacturing pools will be close to the cheese factories at
Haverfordwest, The Lake District, Campeltown and Arran. 
Farms located outside if these catchments will be in the balancing pool
e.g. Scottish Mainland, Midlands, North of England, East Wales etc.
 
c.     Further June milk price cuts for producers A quota production (80% of
total) 
 
So lots of prices depending on the milks final destination and for those
on the balancing pool where the milk goes into Westbury its going to be even
more painful. 
 
First Milk April B
price is 16.1ppl  (1st May 2015)
This is the first month the co-op has paid out on a B price and is at
the low end of its initial forecast of 16 to 18ppl.  The expectation for June is 15 to 17ppl with
the expectation that the May B price range will be 14 to 17ppl rather than 15
to 18ppl first rumbled.
 
First Milk milk
price reductions  from June 1st    (1st
May 2015)
Todays press release mentions Ł3.3m reduction in milk prices from June
1st averaging a 0.33ppl reduction across the piste. Within the
average come the following adjustments.
 
1.2ppl milk price
reduction for First Milk balancing producers - from June 1st  (1st May 2015)
This takes producers standard litre price down to 19.3ppl and in
addition there is a 2ppl capital investment deduction to nett 17.3ppl excluding
the B milk price for the remaining 20%.
 
0.3ppl
milk price increase for First Milk Haverfordwest producers - from June 1st   (1st May 2015)
Another Fonterra
milk price cut = 16.87ppl  (1st May 2015)
Fonterra has announced its fourth forecast milk pay-out cut for this
season reducing the pay-out from NZ $4.70 per kg to NZ $4.50. This converts to
a standard UK litre at todays exchange rate to 16.87ppl. Its opening forecast
was NZ $7.00 in May 2014, which was at the start of the season, which runs from
June 1st to 31st May. In addition, there is a forecast
dividend, which once added to the milk price gives a total pay-out of 18ppl.
 
Cash flows are tightening by the month and budgets are under revision as
this latest forecast pay-out is heading towards 50% of the previous years
record pay-out and the lowest pay-out for eight years.
 
Also New Zealands second largest dairy co-op Westland has also revised
its forecast seasons milk pay-out down from NZ $5.10 to $4.90 per kg.
 
Amongst the list of reasons for the need to cut farm gate prices in New
Zealand is the allegation that there is aggressive undercutting of dairy prices
by EU processors quoting European SMP on offer at US $2,100 tonne compared to
New Zealands US $2,600. Next week all eyes will be on the GDT auction results.

 
Friesland Campina
milk price reduction of 1.25 Euro Cents  (1st
May 2015)
European giant Friesland Campina have reduced their May milk price by
1.25 Euro Cents to 32 Euro Cents KG. This is equivalent to 22.65ppl based on
the UK standard litre at todays exchange rate. 
 
In general  (1st May 2015)
Market reports and analysts predictions across the US, New Zealand and
EU are that plenty of product is around and that prices are likely to weaken
further during the next three months or more. Most major buyers are buying only
what they immediately require in the expectation that product prices will fall
further. Given the spot prices seen in the UK at 10ppl delivered in or less the
odds are firmly stacked in their favour. 
 
TV Documentary on
dairy next week  (1st May 2015)
A new behind the scenes look at how some of our favourite foods are
produced starts next week with a look at dairy farming.
 
The three part series is How Our Favourite Foods Are Made and hosted
by Greg Wallace and Cherry Healy and the dairy episode will be shown at 8pm on
Election Day Thursday next 7th May.
 
The episode will feature Arla co-operative suppliers and employees
taking a behind the scenes look at dairy farming, especially at the production
of retail milk, cheese and butter. 
 
Arla holds members
milk price for May (24th April 2015)
Arla
has announced a  stand on milk price for
May which, together with a 0.03ppl currency smoothing adjustment makes a 1st
May standard litre price of 25.83ppl for members and 26.53ppl for TSDG
suppliers.
                                   
For
Ian this is a result given the way markets have moved and the embarrassing
amount of milk UK farmers are producing with spot prices ranging between 10ppl
to 13ppl and we havent reached peak production.
 
1.1ppl milk price
reduction for Fayrefield suppliers-
from 1st May  (24th April 2015)
It
would appear a handful of Fayrefield suppliers have alerted several industry
commentators including Steven Bradley and myself to the fact price cuts from
Fayrefield go unreported.
 
That
has been corrected and Ian will be in touch with the Company requesting
notification of future price movements.
The
latest 1.1ppl cut takes their liquid standard litre price down to 21ppl (www.milkprices.com)
 
Eyebrows and
questions raised over the latest DairyCo Campaign  (24th April 2015)
A
handful of levy paying producers have contacted Ian expressing their surprise
at the latest Dairy Co Consumer Campaign Hands on.
 
Basically
DairyCo state that dairy farmers hands tell an emotive unique story. They want
farmers to photograph or video close-ups of their hands at work and to send
them to DairyCo who will use the shots at public facing events like the Milk
Race next month.
 
The
farmers who have contacted Ian question whether Consumers will appreciate the
hard working, gritty and often engrained hands of dairy farmers or will they
think its these hands which are helping produce the clean wholesale nutritious
milk I drink.
 
As
one stated we are food producers and my hands show how hard I work but to be honest
I am almost ashamed of how they look when I go out amongst non farming friends.
I dont feel my hands should be associated with milk in a bottle. Its not good
PR.
 
BIG Milk launch from
Arla (24th April 2015)
Arla
have launched new child friendly branded enriched milk called Big Milk with a
higher butterfat than standard whole milk plus added calcium, iron and
vitamins.
 
RRP
is Ł2.25 for 2 litres (Ł1.12 litres) and will be launched as part of a Ł2
million promotion.
The
milk is targeted at age under 6 children and is a UK brand. 
 
The Dairy
Council/Dairy UK responds to another anti milk publication
(24th April 2015)
A
book has been published this week which is yet another US anti dairy book and
we dont want to assist its promotion by stating its name. The book has already
been published and sold in other languages.
 
The
Dairy Council/ Dairy UK read the book and are coordinating an industry response
based on nutritional and scientific facts
.

It
was described by Judith Bryans of Dairy UK as shocking and opens with a
disclaimer followed by unbalanced opinion.
Verdict
- Save your Ł11.00 and dont waste your time researching the name of the
publication or reading the tosh.  
 
GDT auction results
fall a further 3.6%  (16th April 2015)
Last nights GDT auction
saw the recent trend of falling prices continue although not to the brutal
extent witnessed in the previous two auctions, which saw around 20% wiped of
the average price in two weeks!
 
Yesterday's auction
results saw the average all products index fall by 3.6% to average $2620 tonne.
 
Notable movers were: 
 
SMP down 7.8% to
average $2253 tonne
Butter down 6% to
average $3026 tonne
WMP down 4.3% to
average $2446 tonne
Cheddar up 2.7 % to
average $2888 tonne
 
The further fall made
the second top news story on New Zealand's National TV breakfast news this
morning with questions whether Fonterra can hold its current forecast producer
price of $4.70. Note, its record pay-out was fairly recently as high as $8.40.
 
One positive from the
auction was the fact the number or auction bidders increased by over 20% to
those participating two weeks earlier.
 
As the EU approaches
its peak production the product will be inevitably sold on a weak global
market.
 
Analysts predicted a
further fall in the auctions prices especially given the fact an additional
3,400 tonnes were sold taking the total to 25,500 tonnes
 
1.25ppl milk price increase for
members of South Caernarfon Creameries  -
from May 1st   (16th April
2015)
This takes producers manufacturing/cheese
standard litre price to 23.57ppl (www.milkprices.com)
 
0.5ppl milk price increase for United
Dairy Farmers Northern Ireland members - for February delivered milk   (16th April 2015)
This takes producers standard litre
price to 21.94ppl (www.milkprices.com)
 
1.15ppl milk price reduction for
Muller Wisemans CTDG (Co-Op stores) aligned suppliers - from 1st May (16th
April 2015) 
This takes liquid producers standard
litre price to 28.69ppl (www.milkprices.com)

    
2.25ppl milk price reduction for
Muller Wiseman formula contracted suppliers - from 1st April (16th
April 2015)
This is a tracker price, which
reflects a combination of the prices paid by a basket of competitors, liquid
and cheese, plus changes in both AMPE and MCVE.  This takes liquid
producers standard litre price to 20.70ppl (www.milkprices.com)
 
0.001ppl price increase for Dairy
Crest/DCD formula contracted suppliers - from 1st May   (16th April 2015)
Whilst this is a tiny positive
adjustment the really important figure is that producers new standard litre
price is 28.648ppl (www.milkprices.com). 
This represents a 5.43ppl premium advantage over the Dairy Crest standard litre
price.
 
First Milk former members pass go but
don't collect their Ł   (16th April 2015)
Ian has been emailed by a number of former
First Milk members who have either retired or resigned, who are clearly
aggrieved at a recent letter they have received from Chairman, Sir Jim Paice.
 
Whilst Ian has not spoken to First
Milk or been briefed on the letter it would appear that those who are entitled
to capital repayments, having finished supplying milk five years earlier, will
have the repayment they are entitled to deferred by one year and split over
three years. So anyone due capital on the 31st March 2015 will not receive it
all until 31st March 2019, if all goes to plan and for some of these producers
it appears they also believe in the tooth fairy. Perhaps First Milks new CEO
is the tooth fairy or perhaps he is a magician.
 
Numerous emails are asking Ian's
opinion whether this is legal. Ian suspects First Milk would not be so stupid
as to make such a move without having taken legal advice.  However, if
anything to the contrary comes to light please email Ian especially if any of
the real legal eagles or rottweilers have any thoughts on or off the record.
 
The basic problem is the First Milk
collection box is empty and both existing and former members all want to take
out quicker than its going in. So fingers and legs crossed for both existing
and former members that the good ship First Milk pays out to all involved
quicker going forward. 
 
GDT auction
prices were very grim and down 10.8%  (3rd April 2015)
It was April 1st and many had hoped this weeks
disastrous GDT auction results were an April Fool but sadly they weren't.

The average auction price fell 10.8% with the key product whole milk powder
down an eye watering 13.3%.  The reduction was anticipated but not to that
extent and comes on the back of a similar average price fall of 8.8% only two
weeks earlier and is the biggest fall in more than four years.

The news is grim and across the world dairy farmers realise if this trend
continues in two weeks time the likelihood is that farm gate prices for most
dairy farmers will be further cut and it will hurt.

There is no one to blame it's the market yet interestingly over here in New
Zealand there is a lot of talk about the ending of European milk quotas and the
anticipated extra production that is likely to come on stream from now on.

The feeling amongst buyers is that there is and will be plenty of product
around in the months to come.
 
Main movers were:
 
Butter
                    down   7.6% to average
             $3663
Cheddar                  down   10.5% to average
            $2787
SMP
                      down   9.9% to average
             $2467
WMP             
        down   13.3% to average
            $2538
 
What's happening in the UK and Europe?  (3rd April 2015)
 
Well the news is equally worrying.  Over the Easter period GB spot
prices always tumble but they are down at 15ppl or less now.
 
Add to that the
reports that Glanbia had by far its biggest intake of milk in one day at one of
its Southern Ireland plants and you do just start to think it's certainly time
to buckle up. The plants record one day intake was previously 5.3 m litres and
on the 1st April it was 7.4m.  Let's hope it was all milk held over into
the first non milk quota day and that normal deliveries resumed on the 2nd
April.

0.75ppl price cut from Friesland Campina from May 1st  (3rd April 2015)
Having lead the way in Europe with two consecutive producer milk price
increases, Campina have announced a milk price reduction of 0.75 Euro Cents,
which www.milkprices.com calculates to be an equivalent drop of
0.38ppl and gives an equivalent UK standard litre price of 21.95ppl for April
deliveries.

1.01ppl milk price cut for The Fresh Milk Company (AKA Lactalis ) from
May 1st  (3rd
April 2015)
This takes producers standard litre prices for May down to 22.44ppl for
the standard contract and 22.77ppl for the GDT linked contract (www.milkprices.com)

Wyke Farms defer 1ppl April milk price cut  (3rd April 2015)
Wyke announced a month ago a 1st April producer price cut of 1ppl,
which they have now postponed until May 1st. This means producers standard
litre price for April deliveries will be 24.89ppl (www.milkprices.com)
 
 
 
IANS BIG MINI ADVENTURE  PORK PIE CHARITY RUN APRIL 2015
 
Please
give generously  a Mini plea for maximum cause   (27th March 2015
 
You can also donate via text message, just text PORK91 with the amount you want to donate
(e.g. Ł5) to 70070
 
Like this bulletin? Like doing a bit for charity? Well Ian has been doing
this bulletin for 24 years and this is the first time in 24
years of writing a bulletin that he has ever asked for readers support. But he
is doing it now!
 
In one weeks time on
Good Friday Ian and a co-driver/navigator/backseat driver will be starting a
6-day classic Mini drive from the North to the South of the two islands of New
Zealand. The route is a gruelling 2,500kms in 6 days from Kaitaia to
Invercargill, following the route of the classic film Goodbye Pork Pie in a
roadworthy classic Mini.  
 
Ian and
his pal are paying all their own expenses and entry fees but theyre also
raising money for two charities - The Rainbow
Trust, which provides emotional and practical support for UK families
who have a seriously ill child with a life threatening or terminal illness, and
The KidsCan Charitable Trust in New Zealand, which
exists to support disadvantaged Kiwi kids.
 
The Rainbow Trusts vision is to supply 24/7 support to
all families who have a child with a life threatening or terminal illness with
a Rainbow Trust carer. And it is a great
injustice that one in four New Zealand children  some 260,000 - live in
poverty, going without the basics that most of us take for granted. Your donation
will enable KidsCan to continue to provide food, clothing and basic health care
in schools encouraging NZ children to reach their full potential.
 
Every contribution will go to one of the two causes and Ian hopes
readers will dig deep and support this appeal. Donations can be made via:

A very big thank you  (27th
March 2015)
To the 61 readers of
this bulletin who have donated to one or both charities a big thank you. You
have all been very generous and for the ones that are not down as anonymous I
will be in contact. Many thanks, Ian. 
 
You can

1.08ppl milk price
reduction for Tesco (TSDG) producers  (25th
March 2015)
From May 1st the Tesco aligned producers (TSDG) milk price
will reduce by 1.08ppl to a 30.43ppl (today its 31.51ppl) standard litre
price.  For the 50% plus of TSDG
producers who initially signed up to the Promar costings there is a 0.5ppl
additional payment, which takes their new standard litre price to 30.93ppl.
 
The price covers all liquid contracts viz: Arla directs, Arla AMCO,
Muller Wiseman and the 28 producers supplying milk to Parkham Farms who produce
quality mature and extra mature cheddar for Tesco.
 
There will be few, if any grumbles, from TSDG producers other than
perhaps the odd Arla AMCO member who is not really co-operatively wired up.
 
The downward adjustment reduction is attributed mainly to a reduction if
feed costs as well as pressure from increasing milk volumes from TSDG dedicated
farms.  At 30.43ppl expansion is likely
to continue.
 
0.83ppl nett milk
price increase for Arla Amba UK producers  from 30th
March    (25th March 2015)
This will be very welcome news for the 3,000 Arla GB members and it is derived
from a 1.5 Euro Cents increase for all 13,500 European members of Arla less the
currency fluctuation/smoothing adjustment.
 
It reflects both Arlas earnings from the global dairy market place as
well as the fact its main European rival Friesland Campina have increased their
producer prices for the last two consecutive months.
 
The price increase gives a new standard litre price of 25.80ppl.  Note, the increase does not apply to Arla
directs.
 
Dairy Crests sale
to Muller Wiseman is referred to the UK Competition Authorities  (25th March 2015)
Dairy Crests sale of its troubled liquids division to Muller Wiseman
for Ł80 million has been referred to the UK Competition Markets Authority (CMA)
by the European Commission, which is a positive and anticipated development.
 
There seems little doubt that the UK CMA will have to give the deal the
green light and hopefully that light will come with few, if any, conditions.
 
The sale includes Dairy Crests Severnside, Chadwell Heath and Foston
milk processing plants as well as over 70 depots and a bottling plant.
 
Very disappointing GDT results  8.8%  (20th March 2015)
Tuesdays GDT
auction was a bit of a bombshell as average prices plunged down 8.8% to average
$3136/tonne compared to that recorded two weeks ago.
 
Notable movers
were:
 
ˇ        
BMP  11.6% to average $2635
ˇ        
WMP  9.6% to average $2928
ˇ        
Butter  9.4% to average $3555
ˇ        
Cheddar  7.4% to average $3130
ˇ        
SMP  5.5% to average $2731
ˇ        
Arla Westbury SMP - $2150
 
The quantity of product
sold was down 8.3% to 20,258 tonnes compared to the 22,094 tonnes sold two
weeks ago.
 
Note, a year ago
the quantity sold was almost double at 39,008 tonnes and averaged $4563
 
Up until this
auction it had been a case of six consecutive average increases in a row
starting in December but this has certainly dampened the enthusiasm that a full
recovery is in sight.  The mood of
optimism has almost changed overnight.
 
EU production and superlevy  (20th March 2015)
In total 12 member
states face an estimated final years combined superlevy bill of between 800
million to 1 billion.
 
The Commission
have given the option for farmers to pay superlevy over a three year period to
assist cash flow.  This allows farmers to
spread levy bills and to pay in October 2015, 2016 and 2017.  The move has triggered strong rumours in a
number of countries that the affected farmers intend to use the money they had
ear-marked to be instantly deducted from their milk cheques as money to invest
in more equipment and cows with the intention of increasing production.
 
None of this is
helping to boost EU prices because the signal to buyers across the world is
that milk will be plentiful leading some analysts to doubt earlier predictions
that in quarter 3 (July 1st onwards) world prices will recover,
especially with claims that Chinese imports will be down between 50% to 60% in
the first six months of 2015.  One
analyst with Greenmark Dairy commented The only way to get supply and demand
balanced again is less milk, which will only be accomplished by lower prices.
 
Several analysts
and commentators who follow the GDT auction are already predicting further
falls on the back of buyer confidence that supplies are set to increase.
 
Looking at this
weeks official Dutch quoted dairy prices its clear that this week butter and
SMP prices are down.
 
RPA pull the plug
on 2015 compulsory online BPS Claims  (20th
March 2015)
The RPA have thrown the towel in for 2015 BPS claims to all be submitted
online. Basically the new IT will not be ready in time. 
 
In addition, the Commission have confirmed a 1 month extension of the
application deadline from the 15th May to the 15th June.
This is an option which is available to all member states who have to make an
election to the Commission for the extension. Whilst it is not a certainty it
is assumed that under the circumstances DEFRA and the RPA will request the
extension.
 
We have made several calls to the RPA today in an attempt to ascertain
the position for registering BPS entitlement transfers to check whether these
will still be online or will there be a paper version. No one at the RPA could
answer this question with the standard answer we havent a clue.
 
Meanwhile, we continue to trade English Entitlements using our
successful verbal contracts, following which we will submit each deal to the
RPA in whatever format they eventually instruct us to do so on.  (Please see above for our available English
entitlements.)
 
Fonterra wants to expand its organic milk intake  (20th March 2015)
Global dairy giant
Fonterra wants to expand its organic milk intake and has increased its farmgate
price by 45 cents to $1.50 per kg of milk solids.
 
New Zealands
organic milk production has fallen by 40% in the past 5 years and the aim is to
reverse this trend but its debatable whether a 45 cents increase will be
sufficient to reverse the tide.
 
Evidently, organic
dairy demand from China and South East Asia is rising, especially for organic
baby powders and fortified powders.

Very disappointing GDT results
 8.8%  (17th March 2015)
Todays
GDT Auction was a bit of a bombshell recording on average down 8.8% to average
$3136/tonne compared to that recorded two weeks ago.
 
Notable
movers were:
 
ˇ        
BMP  11.6% to average $2635.
ˇ        
WMP  9.6% to average $2928.
ˇ        
Butter  9.4% to average $3555.
ˇ        
Cheddar  7.4% to average $3130.
ˇ        
SMP  5.5% to average $2731.
ˇ        
Arla Westbury SMP - $2150
The quantity
of product sold was down 8.3% to 20,258 tonnes compared to the 22,094 tonnes
sold two weeks ago.
 
A year ago
the quantity sold was almost double at 39,008 tonnes and average $4563.
 
Up until
this auction it had been a case of six consecutive average increases in a row
by starting in December but this has certainly dampened the enthusiasm that a
full recovery is in sight.
          
1.42ppl milk price
cut for Joseph Heler cheese suppliers  from 1st
April  (13th March 2015)
This comes on top of the 1.75ppl cut on the 1st February,
which slipped by us unnoticed until one of our readers alerted us to both price
drops.  Total price cut this year
3.17ppl.
 
1.25ppl milk price
cut for Grahams (Scotland)  from 1st
April  (13th March 2015)
This takes producers standard litre price down to 25.25ppl.  (www.milkprices.com)
 
0.006ppl milk
price increase for Dairy Crest/DCD formula contracts  (13th March 2015)
A small but positive move which takes producers standard litre price to
28.647ppl.  It is the first increase
since July 2014 and delivers a 5.4ppl plus premium above the DC/DCD April
standard litre price.
 
Spot prices under
pressure  (13th March 2015)
Spot prices are holding up well at around 22p with the odd report of 24p
but as production increases its clear there is more supply than there is demand
and that is not be helped with an early Easter period.  The sooner any flush is over the better
because its certainly a weak spot market.
 
On the plus side EU prices for powders, butter and cheddar continue to
move up.
 
February Milk
Production  (13th March 2015)
February production weighed in at 1.077 billion litres down 21.5 million
litres (-2%) compared to that recorded in February 2014.
 
Cumulative production for the first 11 months of the year is 13.1
billion litres and by the end of the year is likely to clock up in excess of
14.3 billion litres, which will be a chart topping production year.
 
Cumulative butterfats stand at 3.99% compared to 4.01% a year ago.
 
New CEO takes the
helm at First Milk (13th March 2015)
After a six year spell Kate Allum has been replaced by Mike Gallacher as
CEO of troubled co-op First Milk with effect from 18th March.  Its taken some considerable time for head
hunters to secure her replacement but thats understandable given the
situation.
 
Its an interesting appointment, especially given Mikes non-dairy background
and there is little doubt he will be in at the deep end so far as member
expectation is concerned.
 
Kate has almost been in hibernation during the winter months and the
decision to leave her position has been a reasonably well kept secret for around
four months.  It is rumoured that she was
particularly unhappy following the Boards decision to delay member milk cheque
payments.
 
Poison threat to
baby powder  (13th March 2015)
For the past month New Zealand police have been investigating a blackmail
threat to contaminate New Zealand baby powder with 1080 (Sodium
Monofluoroacetate), which is applied by air to control possums, which are
blamed for the spread of bovine TB in New Zealand just as badgers are blamed in
GB.
 
Those licensed to use 1080 have publically stated its business as usual
with the aim of controlling and, if possible, eradicating BTB.  However, the authorities have recently
tightened up control on the distribution and use of 1080.
 
The threat came in the form of blackmail letters sent to two of New
Zealands main infant formula processors Fonterra and Federated Farmers in
November 2014.  The threat was to
contaminate baby powders unless New Zealand ends its use of the 1080 poison by
the end of this month.  Included with the
letters the criminals provided samples of baby powder, which tested positive
for a concentrated form of 1080 poison.
 
Since the threat was received 45,000 product samples have tested
negative for 1080 going back to September 2014 baby powders manufactured prior
to the blackmail letters.
 
The protest has done nothing to help improve the price of New Zealand
infant formula, especially when orders from the worlds biggest importer of New
Zealand baby powder China, plummeted overnight. 
China is now demanding certificates with every shipment guaranteeing the
consignment is 1080 free.
 
This is the third New Zealand dairy product safety/contamination scare
in as many years.
 
In 2013 there was the DCD residue contamination found in Fonterra
products followed by late 2013 the Botulism false alarm forcing a product
recall by Fonterra

Muller Wiseman to
hold producer prices for April  (3rd
March 2015)
Muller Wiseman joins Dairy Crest in holding producer milk prices for
April.  All eyes are now on what Arla
decide to do for April.
 
0.62ppl milk price
cut for Sainsbury (SDDG) suppliers  from 1st
April   (3rd March 2015) 
This is a reduction to Sainsburys quarterly re-pricing based on changes
in feed, fertiliser and feed prices.
 
The change takes the Muller Wiseman SDDG standard litre price to 30.98ppl
The change takes the Dairy Crest SDDG standard litre price to 30.92ppl.
The change takes the Arla SDDG standard litre price to 30.86ppl.
 (www.milkprices.com)
 
0.64ppl milk prices
cut for Lactalis (The Fresh Milk Company) producers  from 1st April  (3rd
March 2015)
This takes their standard litre price down to 23.02ppl on its GDT linked
contract and to 22.67ppl on its standard contract (www.milkprices.com)
 
1ppl milk price cut
for Wyke Farms producers  from 1st
April  (3rd March 2015)
This takes their standard litre price down to 23.05ppl (www.milkprices.com)
 
0.5ppl milk price
increase for United Dairy Farmers co-operative members  for January deliveries  (3rd
March 2015)
This takes their standard litre price up to 21.44ppl (www.milkprices.com)
 
AMPE & MCVE
respond positively to dairy commodity price increases  (3rd March 2015)
Both AMPE and MCVE have increased compared to one month ago reflecting
improvement in global commodity prices (see above table) and a weakening in the
value of the Euro.
 
AMPE 23.6ppl up 21% in one month from 19.5ppl
MCVE 25.9ppl up 13% in one month from 23.0ppl
 
A & B milk price
from First Milk will be the final straw for many (3rd March 2015)
First Milk have announced the opening prices for their new A & B
pricing schedule and the outcome has to be worse than any of its members could
have anticipated.
 
The April A price for 80% of producers deliveries will be:
 
 
ˇ        
20.5ppl for the balancing contract (this was
formerly known as the liquid pool)
 
ˇ        
20.87ppl for the manufacturing contract (cheese)
 
The April B price is expected to be between 16 to 18ppl, to be confirmed
in May.
 
So a rough calculation for a standard litre 1 million litre producer
taking a mid point 17ppl for the April B milk price produces the following milk
prices:
 
ˇ        
Cheese                               20.0ppl
ˇ        
Balancing                19.8ppl
 
When you deduct the 2ppl capital contribution these prices drop to 18p
cheese and 17.8ppl balancing and then some will have seasonality to factor in,
and not to mention these producers suffer delayed payments into their bank as
well.
 
The reality is very
grim for First Milk members (3rd March 2015)
With paid out prices for April milk likely to be below 18ppl the big
question is how many members can continue to milk cows as opposed to hang the
clusters up and admit defeat.
 
Members are paying a huge cost to keep First Milk in business, but this
is exerting enormous pressure on their families and cash flow. Many will not be
able to survive this latest brutal cut whilst others will be asking what will
be next from their company
In a statement it comments First Milks aspiration is to provide
consumers with great tasting nutritious food, while delivering value for every
part of its farmers milk.  That value
is certainly not going to its farmer members who must feel battered and almost
knocked out.
 
There is some good news in the form of another First Milk press release
trumpeting that it picked up the Nestle UK & Ireland supplier award for
creating shared value. Only Nestle supplier members see this shared value in
their bank accounts though.
 
Friesland Campina
(FC) increase producers milk price again (3rd March 2015)
FC has announced the second consecutive milk price increase.  The price paid to producers for March milk
will increase by 2.5 (1.8ppl) on top of the 0.93ppl increase announced for
February milk. FC state that declining milk supply in Europe, Oceania and South
America results in increasing quotations for milk powders, cheeses and
butter.  The new price will be 34 Euro
Cents at 3.47 protein, 4.41% fat.
 
GDT Auction up 1.1%
on Average (3rd
March 2015)

Italians still owe
Ł1billion in back dated super levy (3rd March 2015)
Its only days to the end of the European milk quota system and the
European Commission has announced it will take Italy to court for failing to
collect 1.34 billion (almost Ł1billion) in super levy fines from Italian
farmers.
 
The European Court of Justice will be the venue where it is hoped the
Italian farmers will eventually pay super levy for the 14 year period between
1995 to 2009 when each year Italian farmers should have paid super levy to the
Commission. The total unpaid levy due from Italy amounts to 1.752 billion
(Ł1.3 billion), however, the Commission has accepted there has been some loss
hence the current estimate they are pursuing is only around Ł1billion.
 
Please give
generously  a Mini plea for maximum cause
 
Like this bulletin? Like doing a bit for charity? Well Ian has been doing
this bulletin for 24 years and this is the first time in 24
years of writing a bulletin that he has ever asked for readers support. But he
is doing it now!
In a few weeks time he
and a co-driver / navigator / backseat driver (i.e the wife then) will be
starting a 6-day classic Mini drive from the North to the South of the two
Islands of New Zealand. The route is a gruelling 2,500kms in six days from
Kaitaia to Invercargill, following the route of the classic film Pork Pie.  
 
Ian and
his pal are paying their own expenses, and entry fees but theyre also raising
money for two charities - The Rainbow Trust,
which provides emotional and practical support for UK families
who have a seriously ill child with a life threatening or terminal illness, and
The KidsCan Charitable Trust in New Zealand, which
exists to support disadvantaged Kiwi kids.
 
The Rainbow Trusts vision is to supply 24/7 support to
all families who have a child with a life threatening or terminal illness with
a Rainbow Trust carer. And it is a great
injustice that one in four New Zealand children  some 260,000 - live in
poverty, going without the basics that most of us take for granted. Your
donation will enable KidsCan to continue to provide food, clothing and basic
health care in schools encouraging NZ children to reach their full potential.
 
 
 
Every contribution will go to one of the two causes and Ian hopes
readers will dig deep and support this appeal. Donations can be made via:

Arla to hold its March milk price   (23rd February 2015)
Arla AMBA have held their 13,500 member milk
prices for the second consecutive month. 

 
In addition the forecast 13th
payment has nudged up by 0.1ppl to 0.78ppl, which takes their standard litres
to 24.97ppl.
 
Watch the sheep follow the lead again and the
big question is who will blink first with a producer price increase?
 
Marks & Spencer to hold its producer milk price to 31st
March  (23rd
February 2015)
This is as a result of a change in its half
yearly review dates to April and October.
 
This means producers milk price has held at
34.24ppl (www.milkprices.com)
from August to April
 
Spot Prices  (23rd February 2015)
Have lifted and today were quoted at around
24ppl, ranging from 22 to 26ppl.
 
GDT auction up 10.1% for its 5th consecutive increase  (23rd February 2015)
International dairy commodity prices jumped up
a massive 10.1% to average $3366 (US) compared to the average achieved only two
weeks ago.  Markets have without doubt
passed the bottom and cheap dairy products are history.  
 
The auctions biggest influencer WMP was up
almost 14% to average $3272/tonne and remember only two weeks earlier WMP
prices were already up 19.2%.
 
There are two factors to consider when
examining the surge in prices.
 
Firstly, the quantities of product put forward
for auction are down 35% compared to those offered at the same auction in
2014.  Volumes offered have reduced by
25% or 80,000 tonnes during the last three months auctions (December to
February) compared to those sold a year ago.
 
In addition, poor farmgate milk prices in New
Zealand have resulted in a significant reduction in production due to
economics.
 
Lets hope this dramatic turn around continues
because if it does the next move will be for Fonterra to review its farmgate
milk price payout with the intention to pay more to its farmer members.
 
Whilst the world is still awash with milk it
looks like this market has well and truly turned and for those who have had raw
treatment from their milk buyer in recent months be aware they could soon be
wanting to cuddle up to you, especially those who effectively told farmers to
find another milk buyer.
 
Notable movers:
 
Cheddar                  +16.8%
            to average         $3054/tonne
WMP                                  +13.7%             to average         $3272/tonne
SMP                                   +5.7%               to average         $2744/tonne
Butter                                 +1.1%               to average         $3823/tonne
 
First Milk announces A & B milk pricing from 1st April  (23rd February 2015)
More changes from the co-op from April 1st
as follows:
 
(a)   The introduction of A & B milk pricing
(b)   Its liquid milk pool to be renamed as its
balancing pool
(c)   Plans to align more closely producers
butterfat, protein and hygiene payments to each pools end use of milk with a
view to rewarding producers accordingly.
 
Members will receive a letter in early March
setting out the pricing changes as they affect their farm and milk production.
 
First Milk members will be keen to see the
pricing mechanism in the hope the fixed price for the A volume catapults First
Milk from its permanent relegation position at the foot of all milk price
league comparison tables.  Whilst the A
volume prices for each of the two pools will be different the B volume price
paid will be identical and based on commodity returns predominantly achieved
through Westbury and spot and short term trading.
 
Kintyre and Gigha producers are hit as hard as Bute farmers  (23rd February 2015)
In our last bulletin we highlighted the near
impossible economic dairy farming conditions the 13 remaining dairy farmers on
the Scottish island of Bute face.
 
Its no better for the 32 who farm on Kintyre
and supply First Milks Campbeltown Creamery plus the 4 dairy farmers who
remain in business on the island of Gigha. 
(Note, Ian intends to visit Gigha this summer.)
 
One dairy farmer on Gigha has decided to quit
as have at least two on Kintyre, one of whom is the south end of the peninsulas
biggest producer.
 
Other farmers say they have already decided to
quit irrespective of promises to invest in the creamery because they are simply
bleeding money.
 
When asked to comment on First Milks A &
B production proposals one commented its another nail in the coffin as anyone
expanding will be stuffed on price at a time when the local factory
(Campbeltown) is crying out for more milk.
 
Sandwich maker to use 900 tonnes plus of Irish cheese   (23rd February 2015)
US based Greencore has created 400 jobs with a
new factory, which is anticipated will use in excess of 900 tonnes of Glanbia
Irish cheddar annually, starting within a month.

1.5ppl (2 Euro Cents) organic milk price increase from Arla  from 2nd March (10th February 2015)   
Organic dairy products appear to be in demand
across the globe and Arla have decided that their business requires more organic
milk from its members in the years to come as sales head north we believe this
is the first UK milk price rise of the year..
 
1.75ppl milk price cut for Muller Wiseman suppliers  from 5th March (10th February
2015)   
This takes their standard litre price to
24.15ppl
 
The press release centred on the need to
reduce the price to ensure MW are competitive against its competitors
including farmer owned co-operatives meaning Arla.  There was also the usual emphasis on the fact
the MW milk price is a clean price not further eroded by deductions or
penalties of the kind imposed by other purchases including farmer owned
co-ops.
 
It is worth noting that Arla AMCO members are
on a three month payment holiday from the 0.5ppl member levy as well as the fact
the Arla Fat Tax reduced to 0.01ppl from January 1st.
 
In addition to these points it is a fact if MW
senior staff had had their own way the price drop would have been an eye
watering 2ppl.  Its difficult to
understand why MW are now price followers as opposed to price setters but they
certainly are.
 
1.4ppl milk price cut for Meadow Foods suppliers  from 1st March (10th February
2015)   
This takes their standard litre price to 22ppl
for a Chester based supplier and 22.04ppl for a Lake District supplier
 
1.5ppl milk price cut for South Caernarfon Creameries members  from 1st February (10th
February 2015)   
This takes their standard litre price to
21.75ppl (www.milkprices.com)
 
1ppl milk price cut for Blackmore Vale suppliers  from 1st March (10th February
2015)   
This takes their standard litre price to
26.01ppl (www.milkprices.com)
 
0.384ppl milk price reduction for Dairy Crest formula contracts  from March 1st   (10th February 2015)   
This takes their standard litre price to
28.64ppl (www.milkprices.com)
The formula contracts premium over the standard Dairy Crest price is excess of
5ppl. 
 
Friesland Campina (FC) increase its milk price for February  (10th February 2015)   
One swallow does make a summer but the news
that FC have increased suppliers milk price by 1.25 Euro Cents (0.93ppl) will
certainly be on Arlas radar when they announce their March member price during
the week of 23rd February.
 
Average 2014 farmgate milk price 31.55ppl  (10th February 2015)   
This was almost identical to the 2013 average.
 
Lactalis head for the court room   (10th February 2015)   
Lactalis appear to be in the news for all the
wrong reasons at the moment both in GB and its mother land, France.  Reports in the French press confirm 500
Lactalis suppliers in Normandy are taking the milk processor to court over the
price they were paid for milk in 2014.
 
The action is supported by the French dairy
trade body FNPL, which calculates the average impact is valued at Ł6000 per
farm.
 
The case revolves around Lactalis contractual
position, which the farmers claim is not transparent and effectively allow
Lactalis to determine the price they pay producers.  That sounds familiar!
 
The 500 are pioneers and if successful its
expected that Lactalis will have an avalanche of claims and similar action to
defend.
 
The global position  (10th February 2015)   
Fonterra have revised their total years milk
intake down by 3.3% (700 million) compared to last season due to a combination
of the drought fears in New Zealand and a significant pull back in production
by producers who cannot justify feeding concentrates at current prices.
 
Milk production is now running at 6% plus less
than last year on a monthly basis.
 
Consequently Fonterra has cut its next six
months WMP entries to its GDT auction by 25,000 tonnes equivalent to a 15% drop
to only 136,000 tonnes.
 
Global prices across New Zealand, the EU and
USA are moving up leading most, if not all, industry pundits to state that the
global market has done a U-turn having bottomed out in December.
 
If Russia is persuaded to completely lift its
EU dairy product ban, as opposed to its recent request for a partial lifting,
things could change very quickly as those capable of selling into a rising
market stand shoulder to shoulder.
 
OMSCO doubles its product sales to the USA  (10th February 2015)   
OMSCO has secured a deal which doubles the
amount of dairy products they export to the USA.
 
Currently OMSCO handle two thirds of the UKs
organic milk production amounting to around 250 million litres out of which 7%
(17 million litres plus) goes into products for the US deal which is expected
to be worth in excess of Ł25 million in the coming year.
 
Bute dairy farmers are the hardest hit in the UK  (10th February 2015)
Bute is a beautiful place unless you are one
of the 13 remaining dairy farmers supplying the islands only milk buyer, First
Milk.  In less than 12 months their milk
price has collapsed from a respectable 32ppl to under 20ppl and with all
inputs, other than grass, having to be shipped in from the mainland the outlook
is very grim.
 
Osama Bin Laden masked employee was unfairly sacked  (10th February 2015)   
An industrial tribunal has decided that an
employee at Crediton Dairy was unfairly dismissed for wearing a rubber Osama
Bin Laden mask and posting a selfie on his Facebook page, which clearly showed
part of the old Milk Link logo.

say up to 1 month.
 
The global dairy recovery
has landed with Westbury powder +18%   (3rd
February 2015)
Global
prices went down with a bang and it certainly looks like they could be bouncing
up as fast, if not faster, than they crashed down.
 
Todays
GDT auction saw average prices up for the fourth consecutive auction with the
average price up a whopping 9.4% in 2 weeks to average $3042.  The last time an average was seen above this
level was in July 2014.
 
Notable
movers:
 
WMP
                                 up a
staggering  19.2% to average           $2874/tonne
SMP                                   up                     6.7% to average             $2598/tonne
Butter                                 up                     6.1% to average             $3783/tonne
Cheddar                  down                 11.1% to average           $2636/tonne
Arla Westbury SMP up                     17.8% to average           $2520/tonne      
 
It
took three months from the GDT auction first falling in late January 2014
before Arla and Paynes Dairies were the Dambusters having implemented price
cuts from 1st May causing an avalanche of cuts within days.  How long before these tow and/or First Milk
lead the charge upwards?

Dairy Crest hold milk
prices to July   (3rd February 2015)
Having
announced the 1.5ppl cut (see above) Dairy Crest have taken a massive lead as
the first of the big processors to commit to holding producer milk prices until
at least July 1st.
Unfortunately
the headline in one online food bulletin was Dairy Crest avoids milk price
cut followed by Dairy processors have halted milk price cuts for the time
being as the market struggles to right itself - Hardly the whole truth with a
1.5ppl drop. 
 
This
takes producers well past the spring flush and for its liquid producers it
could mean their next price move will be a notification from Muller Wiseman
assuming the deal between the two is approved by the competition authorities.
 
Its
good news for producers and is a stabilizing sign.  There is now more than a glimmer of light
that global and EU prices have bottomed out. 
It could be that DC has read the tea leaves and that any price movement
for July is more likely to be up rather than down.
 
First Milk to hold members

members by cutting their March milk price and this has now been confirmed.

Dairy UK and DairyCo to
sponsor The Milk Race   (3rd February 2015)
Both
Dairy UK and DairyCo will jointly sponsor the third return of the legendary
Milk Race, which takes place in Nottingham in May.
 
Chairman
of The Dairy Council Sandy Wilkie commented This is a wonderful opportunity
for the industry to highlight the fact that dairy foods are naturally nutrient
rich and the nutrients they provide are important for all age groups.
 
The
Milk Race ran between 1958 and 1993 as a regular annual event before it was
pulled.
 
The Fresh Milk Company (AKA
Lactalis) corner its suppliers   (3rd
February 2015)
In
a letter to producers from MD Mark Taylor dated 30th January The Fresh Milk
Company (FMC) shocked producers.
 
First
up was a table topping, whopping 2ppl price cut from March 1st which was billed
as a 2ppl discretionary cut to the current basket formula.  One producer emailed Ian to say The FMC
definition of discretionary was do what the hell we want.
 
To
rub salt in the wound the letter went on to confirm the reduction was out with
the spirit of the current agreement.
The
FMCs (Lactalis) approach to producers has certainly come as a surprise to
producers and will no doubt have the UKs independent milk pricing guru Stephen
Bradley (www.milkprices.com)
scratching his head as the person who calculates the FMC producers basket milk
price which is now a complicated calculation to the detriment of the producers.

 
If
that wasnt enough they intend to introduce a change to milk pricing in less
that two months by April but no details are available.  All of these moves with the intention of
securing long term milk supply at sustainable milk price for both farmer and
processor.
 
The
letter has certainly left a nasty taste with some producers who hopefully have
good memories.  One line in Ians next
Dairy Farmer Article (due out next week) says it all Remember what happens in
this crisis and how your milk purchaser treats you         
 
First Milk Vice Chairmans
evidence to be investigated   (3rd February 2015)
First
Milks vice chairman Nigel Evans gave evidence at last Wednesdays Scottish
Parliament Dairy Inquiry and the thud of MSPs jaws hitting the floor was
deafening when he claimed that First Milks member payment over the last three
years compared to the payout relative to its competitor milk processors would
be a lot better.
 
The full transcript
of the relevant part reads as follows:
       Nigel
Evans: 
The operative words that you just used are at the moment. When we look
at prices over periods of time, we see a lot more commonality of pricing. The
truth is that, because of product mix and the different markets that companies
work in, there will always be differentials in pricing. Taking as an example
the skimmed-milk powder pricing that we have talked about, it is trading at a
price equivalent to 14p a litre, but 12 months ago it was trading at a price
that was nearer 40p a litre. That kind of situation has a substantial impact on
the pricing of different elements of the market. 
Graeme Dey (MSP): 
So if we were to look back over the past three years and analyse the
price that was being paid by the private companies as set against the
co-operatives price, are you telling me that the co-operative would be
performing better in how it responded to its members or worse? 
Nigel
Evans: 
Do you mean in terms of our price relative to that of our competitors? 
Graeme Dey
(MSP): 
Yes. 
Nigel
Evans: 
We would be performing a lot better. 
Fortunately MSP Michael Russell concluded by
stating we should get that analysis.
It appears to be an outrageous claim however
to prove whether the evidence by Evans can be backed up by the facts requires
one call or email to Stephen Bradley AKA www.milkprices.com 
Ian has already emailed the convener
suggesting they immediately contact Stephen for that independent analysis and
make their findings public.
The smart money is on the facts simply
proving that all that has happened is that the gap between First Milk and its
competitors has widened.
Scottish Parliament
tackle evasive retailers head on  (3rd February 2015)
This week the inquiry will hear evidence from
retailers and the Grocer Code Adjudicator Christine Tacon.
Tesco, Sainsburys, Lidl and Marks &
Spencer have each received a special invitation from Rob Gibson MSP who is
the convener of the inquiry.
Basically all four retailers declined to accept
the Parliaments first invitation to attend. 
This second invitation is worded slightly differently and directed to
the CEO.
It reads Should you decline this request,
the committee will set aside a seat for you at one of those meetings to
indicate that Tesco/M&S/Lidl/Sainsburys was invited but declined the
invitation and we will also then consider compelling evidence.   Ouch!
If you would like to view the letters or the
evidence click on http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/parliamentarybusiness/CurrentCommittees/85896.aspx
 
The expectation is that Tesco Tom and his mates will accept this latest
invitation and appear this week.  
 
No mention of ASDA so we assume they have already agreed to attend to
give evidence as have Morrisons.  
 
First Milks Accounts   (3rd
February 2015)
These
are still to be scrutinized but here are a few headlines:
(a)  
Only 122 members out of up to 1200 in total
were either present or represented at the AGM. 
That was a result for the First Milk Board and management to have only
around 10% present in body or on paper.
(b)  
Almost 20% of First Milks intake goes into
Westbury yet they still insist on calling it a liquid contract
(c)  
In the first 6 months of the current financial
year the co-op lost on average Ł2m each month (Ł12.1 million) to the end of
September having paid out more money to members than they could afford.  Was this the Senior Management who sanctioned
the member payouts and failed to cut the price to match receipts or was it the
Farmer Board who refused to sanction the Senior Managements price cuts?
(d)  
Adams paid Ł3milliion for First Milks cheese
customer base.  Pre-tax profit was up
from Ł0.8million to Ł3.5million but if you deduct the Ł3.0m from Adams its
down to Ł0.5m.

Arla Amba stand on
price for February  (23rd January 2015)
Arla have confirmed this morning that its 13,500 members will receive a
stand on milk price for February as received in January.
 
The gradual improvement in GDT auction results (see below) is a factor
which has played a part in Arlas global forecasts.  For its 3,000 British members there is a
small bonus in the slight increase of 0.06ppl in the 13th payment
forecast which takes the standard litre price to 24.87ppl (www.milkprices.com).

GDT average up 3.8%  (23rd January 2015)
The GDT auction average has increased for the
third consecutive auction with WMP up 3.8%, the highest WMP average since
November 4th and the overall auction average up 1%.

Futures markets are also heading North.  One New Zealand analyst commented This now
appears to indicate that the market recovery that many have been predicting
since last year is now in flux.  Fingers
crossed this is the start of a long term upward trend.
 
Arla to sell
lactose on the GDT auction  (23rd January 2015)
Arla is to sell a significant volume of food grade lactose at future
auctions starting on April 15th. 
Lactose is used in confectionary and food manufacturing including baking
preparations as well as in pharmaceutical. 

 
The Arla lactose will come from its impressive Jutland Denmark site and
whey from Arlas Lockerbie and Llandyrnog plants go to the Danish site.
 
GDT now has in excess of 650 registered auction buyers from 90 countries
across the world who last year bought 900,000 tonnes of product through the
auction.  
 
Top marks to
Sainsburys  (23rd January 2015)
Full marks to Sainsburys for taking out significant adverts in the The
Express, Star, Mail, Times and Telegraph this week.  The advert was under the strap line At
Sainsburys we support our British fresh milk farmers, does your supermarket?
 
 

The advert concluded with:
 
We believe the farmers who produce our milk
should also make a living.
 
Its a very clear message from Sainsburys
where they firmly nail their colours to the mast in support of British dairy
farmers who supply Sainsburys through their dedicated liquid milk.  However, its still a retailer and discounter
scrum on cheese where only Tesco pay a premium to a large group of dedicated
farmers on mature cheddar.
 
Its a pity Morrisons PR machine does not
operate in the same way and indeed that of some other retailers and discounters
who appear to have an insatiable appetite to drive down prices to consumers,
processors and dairy farmers.
 
Morrisons switch milk from Dairy Crest to Arla Aylesbury (23rd January 2015)
Whilst Dairy Crest have retained some of
Morrisons liquid milk business for the next three years the outcome of the
recent tender process is that they have lost 70 million litres to Arla.  Have Morrisons placed 70 million litres of
extra business at the expense of Dairy Crest based on price, service, were they
drawn to the most modern state of the art liquid milk processing facility in
the world?  AKA  Aylesbury or was it
because Morrisons wanted to be seen to support a co-op where the money is
shared evenly amongst the members?
 
At the end of the day the loss of Dairy Crest
volume is likely to affect Muller Wiseman more than DC assuming the pending
liquids deal is approved by our completion authorities.
 
Morrisons dedicated liquid milk supply group  (23rd January 2015)
The phones were red hot on Wednesday with
numerous media keen to get an industry response to the news that Morrisons is
to start recruiting farmers for its first dedicated milk pool.  The story originated from Farmers Weekly but
it appears to have either been a red herring or a complete misunderstanding.
 
Neither Dairy Crest Direct or Arla AMCO have
had discussions with Morrisons over setting up a dedicated group.
 
Things progress at snails pace with Morrisons
when it comes to its intentions with dairy. 
For example, it has been running a small pilot cheese producer group
with First Milk in South Wales since July 2013. 
They gained some positive PR 18 months ago at the launch with claims
that the
retailer hopes to expand the project to supply all of its cheddar through this
process should the trail prove successful.  But
all is eerily silent.
 
First Milks CEO Grocer article seeks to reassure customers  (23rd January 2015)
Kate Allum, CEO of First Milk, whom many
believed was in public hibernation, commented in an article in last weeks
Grocer that she was surprised by the fact we received more coverage
than any other dairy industry story I can recall.  We were not talking about an acquisition or
the launch of a new product.
 
No Kate, the media interest was because First
Milk do not have enough money in the bank to pay your 1,000 plus farmers their
two weeks worth of milk on the 12th and 26th January and
thats the position going forward.  Its
never happened before so it shouldnt have come as a shock as to how big the
story was.
 
Kate then went on to comment:
 
This move significantly
improves our cashflow, which was negatively affected by falling dairy market
prices throughout 2014
 
This could be re-written as follows:
 
This move negatively affects our members
cashflow at a time when they are struggling to cope with one of the worst milk
prices in Great Britain of close to 20ppl. 
They are the hard working families who are picking up the bill for
falling dairy market prices and our failure to add value to the milk cheques we
have traditionally paid them on the 18th of each month, which will
now be paid on the 26th with the remainder on the 12th of
the month.
 
Whilst Kates commentary flags up the fact
First Milk customers understand the actions we
have taken are positive steps most First Milk members are extremely
worried and are by no means convinced the move is positive so far as their
short and long term bank balances are concerned.  However, their prayer mats are pointed
towards Glasgow, China, Ireland and anywhere they see hope!
 
Lets hope the farmer meetings and next
weeks First Milk AGM inject some confidence in members, especially when the
accounts are released and presented and it declares its future strategy to
improve returns to members.

First Milk
Director Willie Campbell will want to forget Monday (16th January 2015)
At Mondays 25th Semex Conference it wasnt many minutes
before opening speaker NFU President Myrig Raymond mentioned the plight of more
than 1,000 First Milk producers.  
 
David Handley followed up with what Chairman John Allen of Kite
described as a powerful and emotional speech on the subject of First Milk,
Handley said that First Milks payment deferral move was a disgrace.
 
During question time, up popped First Milk board member Willie Campbell
and a loud clunk of press and delegates jaws could be heard when Campbell
declared I am proud of what we (First Milk) have done.
 
An unfortunate choice of words and within minutes Sky News and an
avalanche of media were clamouring to interview Campbell and challenge him on
his jaw dropping statement.
 
Below is a cartoon and report, which Scottish Farmer produced which
accurately summaries events:
 
 

 
Previously that morning BBC TV featured an on farm interview with Willie
Campbell on its main national news.
 
That didnt go well as viewers were drawn to Campbells scruffy cap, which
was described as older than him and resembling the sort of cap a pantomime
Eddie Grundy would wear.  It was
certainly a poor advert for a modern professional dairy farmer who is also a
board member making financial decisions on behalf of 1,000 plus co-op members.
 
The decision was quickly taken that Campbell was no longer suitable to
present to the media and all interviews were pulled.  With hindsight First Milk should have had
either Jim Paice or Nigel Evans present at the Conference to address all questions.
 
All in all First Milk had a very bad day at the office on Monday and it
can only get better.
 
First Milk what
next?? (16th January 2015)
First Milk have two remaining member meetings taking place next
week.  Next will arrive its overdue
financial accounts for the year ended March 2014 followed by its AGM on the 30th
January.
 
In addition, there are rumblings of a possible legal challenge by a
small group of First Milk Nestle producers on grounds of discrimination.  This could be a very hot potato to handle.
 
There are also questions being asked by qualified accountants as to
whether the co-op passes the test of trading as a going concern.
 
But whilst all of these points are bouncing about no one appears to have
addressed the real question.
 
What radical changes are First Milk going to make to turn the ship
around?  They cant expect members to
plug the holes and bridge the shortfall as they have recently with their
Ł22million snatch and grab because that is passing the pain to its members who
are already under extreme pressure. 
Their banks and suppliers may be sympathetic but they will be looking
100 yards down the road to see what dramatic business turnaround changes First
Milk are making.  So what are First Milk
going to do different other than claim they need to add value to a third of
their milk?

(1)    UK Retail  prices
Asda have cut their price
for four pints of own-label milk to 89p under a rollback promotion. They are the
first of the big four supermarkets to go as low as this on a price point,
although Aldi cut their price of four pints from 95p to 89p in a November
promotion.
(2)  
Dairy Crest Increases cost of  pinta on milk&more
 
As Dairy Crest announces 29th December farm
gate price cuts for February (-7.85p since the summer) it has also increased
the price it now charges for a pint of milk delivered to the doorstep from
79p/pint to 81p/pint - from 28th December - sent through from a milk&more
consumer aghast at what is happening to farm gate prices....
 
Comment  (9th January 2015)
Will doorstep consumers continue to support
Dairy Crests Milk&More when the differentials become even more astronomic?
ASDA 4pints at 89p, or milk&more doorstep 4pints at Ł3.24...??

First Milk defer December
onwards milk payments  (8th January 2015)
First Milk have informed producer members that their December milk
payments, which were scheduled to hit producers bank accounts on  the 12th
and 26th January will be deferred by 14 days and paid in two stages
on the 26th January and 10th February.
 
This deferral will continue throughout 2015 until First Milk's Board
decide to vary it.
 
First Milk cancel 1.1ppl of its 1st
February milk cuts  (8th January 2015)
Less than a week after First Milk announced its 1st February
price cuts of 2.43ppl for cheese and 1.6ppl liquid it has announced that 1.1ppl
of both cuts will not be implemented and will be cancelled. The net result is
that from February 1st members on the cheese contract will have a
1.33ppl cut and those on the liquid contact will have a 0.5ppl cut.
 
BUT (and it's a
HUGE but):
 
First Milk to increase member capital contributions  (8th January 2015)
Instead of the price cut it is to increase member capital contributions
from the current 0.5ppl to 2ppl, back dated to milk supplied from 1st
December 2014 and forward dated to 31st August 2015 (9
months). Twinned with this is an increase in the member capital investment
target from the current 5p to 7ppl.
 
Combining the 1.1ppl price cut reversal with the 2ppl capital
contribution will give a net additional cost to First Milk members of 0.4ppl.
(2ppl  1.1ppl reversed cut less 0.5ppl
current capital contribution)
 
In Summary  (8th
January 2015)
This is unwelcome news for struggling First Milk members and clearly the
co-op has an immediate cash flow crisis, and to cut to the chase it cannot pay
for members' milk as planned.  For its
members they have a simple choice to stay with First Milk or quit milk, because
finding an alternative milk purchaser and joining the 230 to 300 plus who have
no milk buyer from 1st April is not a sensible option.
                             
There are, however, some positives Ian can see for members to consider:
 
(a)  If your ship is heading
for rocks do you wait until it hits those rocks or take action to steer a
different course? First Milks board has at least taken action and if it
didnt the business simply would have run out of cash, and soon. Some
action is much better than no action.
 
(b)  Whilst its a
rolling 14 day payment deferral it could have been worse. It could for instance
have skipped a month and missed one milk cheque, or even worse closed the doors
and sunk the ship in the spring.
 
(c)  Some thought has
certainly gone into ensuring all First Milk members share the pain
proportionally. The 1.1ppl price cut reversal does not affect its Nestle
and Tesco aligned producers, who are immune from the cuts, but by reversing the
price cut by 1.1ppl and taking the extra 0.4ppl in capital contributions all
pay pro rata, including its Nestle and Tesco farmers. This is surely a basic
principle of how a co op works.
 
The plan is that the combined package will put First Milks finances and
business into a stronger position and will inject a much needed Ł20 million
into the business.
 
Its not an easy decision to take and time will tell whether the plan
works to ensure both First Milks members and the company survive and prosper.
 
Lets hope these moves stabilise the business and help rebuild
its cash flow.
 
Its delayed AGM on the 30th January is likely to be well
attended.
 
GDT auction prices
up 3.6%  (8th January 2015)
Its nothing to trumpet about but perhaps there could be a small glimmer
of light at the end of a very long and dark world dairy tunnel.  However, note that the volume of product on
offer was down 27% (12,700 tonnes).  So
almost a 30% drop in the quantity on offer v only a 3.6% uplift is sobering.
 
The average price at this weeks auction rose 3.6% compared to the
results achieved three weeks earlier (December 16th).
 
Key movers of interest were:
 
Butter             
up        13.2%  to average $3558 tonne
(Ł2338)
Cheddar         
up        3.2%    to average
$3090 tonne (Ł2030)
SMP               
up        2.8%    to average
$2386 tonne (Ł1568)
WMP              
up        1.6%    to average
$2307 tonne (Ł1515)
 
Arla Westbury SMP    down   7.7%   
to average $2045 tonne (Ł1345)
 
Note, a significant gap has opened up between Arla Westbury SMP at
Ł1345/tonne and New Zealand SMP at Ł1625/tonne.  A difference of
Ł280/tonne (or 21%)
 
The reason for the difference according to one seasoned independent wise
analyst is a combination of weak currency and high stocks of SMP in
Europe.  EU SMP production for 2014 to
the end of October is up 24.5% hence the high stocks and weak prices.
 
Inserting the GDT average for EU butter @ Ł2150 and Arla SMP @ Ł1345
into the 2014 AMPE formula gives an AMPE of 18.4ppl, which does not allow for
the cost of transporting the milk from farm to processing factory.  Taking
farmgate transport costs into account will give an equivalent farmgate AMPE of
between 16.4 to 16.9ppl.  This is based
on an ex farm collection costs of between 1.5 to 2ppl however if the milk has
to then be transhipped to Westbury deduct a further 2ppl. 
 
Inserting the New Zealand GDT average for butter at a price of Ł2338 and
the New Zealand SMP average at Ł1625 gives an AMPE of 22ppl. So world butter
and SMP prices are ahead of EU prices, which to some extent is a positive.

Editor is new AHDB CEO   (8th January 2015)
Jane King, who left her position as editor of Farmers Weekly at the end of
last year, is to head up the AHDB.
 
So with a new chairman and new CEO ,a
few more changes and surgery the industry could soon see a more ambitious and
courageous AHDB and its sector boards and oh how that is
long overdue.
 
New chairman Peter Kendall commented to The Farmers Guardian
 
Her communication skills and experience of both
repositioning and leading a well-known agricultural service brand through a
period of change  means she will be able to lead AHDB through an important
period as it works towards becoming a centre of excellence for the UK
industry.
 
As one communications top cat commented to Ian via email In appointing
Jane AHDB are sending a clear message that they want to communicate better.
 
With Jane at the helm they are likely to get there and she will be very
alert to the fact she will have to crack some eggs to make her communication
omelettes.

Muller Wiseman (MW) hold producer prices for February  (7th January 2015)
Amidst an avalanche of further new year milk producer price cuts, Muller
Wiseman have confirmed they will not be cutting producer prices before 1st
March at the earliest.
 
The stand on standard litre price is 25.9ppl.
 
MWs press release contains a couple of interesting quotes:
 
Carl
Ravenhall, Managing Director of Müller Wiseman Dairies said: 
"In
an extremely challenging environment, Müller UK & Ireland Group is working
hard to add value to milk produced by British dairy farmers.
We
recognise that this is a tough time for dairy farmers and we are doing
everything we can to maintain a leading milk price, whilst
retaining our ability to compete, particularly against processors and farmer
owned co-operatives who reduce their milk prices with little notice.
 
MW are acknowledging the fact  they operate in what is a British added
value market, not withstanding the fact cream and butter returns have impacted
on both processor and producer returns.  Compare this declaration  to
some of the other GB  milk purchasers statements where they clearly
  paint  a picture that they  operate in a global market
pointing the finger exclusively at weak European and world commodity prices as
well as poor GDT auction results as justification for their price drops.
 
This leads on to Ravenhalls choice words in his next line, highlighted in red by me.
 
Its his reference to those who reduce their prices with little, if any,
notice.  Clearly MW are in competition with these processors who quickly
bank any farmgate price reductions and could then mischievously use such gains
to their advantage in this falling market with predatory pricing. However, on
the flip side when prices take a turn North and go up the likes of MW who are
code compliant should, theoretically, be paying out increases a month later
than those who give no notice. 
 
Ian is aware of lots of scams and interesting moves milk purchaser
moves. These include processors (plural) who have ended a number of producer
contracts who are buying extra milk on the spot market (short term gain) as
well as a number of milk buyers who are paying a farmgate price based on
commodity values who then have the nerve to  trumpet how strong their
brands are both locally, nationally  and abroad.
 
It sounds like these milk buyers are simply dropping the milk price
simply  because they can based on global commodity prices then proceed to
sell into a British added value market with their strong  brands.
 
Its a win win and resembles having your cake and eating it.

producer milk prices.

Its certainly time
to get the prayer mats out and point them towards either Beijing or Mother
Nature.  Until our prayers are answered
the possibility of intervention buying increases by the day.

circa 23.7ppl (30.25 Euro Cents)   (5th January 2015)
This represents a
0.50 Euro Cents drop on its December price.
 
This is further bad
news given the fact that Arla tend to follow what FC do.
