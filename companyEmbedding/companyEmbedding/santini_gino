Product DescriptionOP2930. LOHENGRIN (in Italian), w.Santini Cond. San Carlo Opera Ensemble, Napoli;  Gino Penno, Renata Tebaldi, Giangiacomo Guelfi, Giulio Neri, Elena Nicolai, etc.  (Italy) 3-Hardy 6010, Live Performance, 26 Dec., 1954.  -  8018783601026
CRITIC REVIEWS:�In the early 1950s, Gino Penno became known throughout Italy as a highly competent heldentenor singing Siegfried at the Verona Arena and Lohengrin in Rome.  He also partnered Maria Callas in Norma, Macbeth, Il Trovatore, and Medea, in various theatres in ItalyIn 1951, his career took an international turn. He appeared at the Paris Op�ra, the Liceo in Barcelona, the Monte Carlo Opera, the Metropolitan Opera in New York, and the Royal Opera House in London.He was very highly thought of both for his musicianship and his reportedly enormous voice, of magnificent quality.I heard Tebaldi many times, as a standee at the old Metropolitan Opera House from the mid-1950s through the early 1960s, and I never stopped marveling at the sheer beauty of the voice, her ability to project a pianissimo throughout the auditorium so that even though the note was extraordinarily soft, it sounded as if she were standing right next to you.  The plushness of tone was probably the most unique feature of her singing, and along with that an innate sense of the appropriate shape of the phrase she was singing.  She was not a subtle actress, never inflecting every phrase with subtexts of meaning the way Callas could, but nor was she a disengaged singer just pouring out lovely sounds.  Her acting, both physical and vocal, was sincere and convincing, and at times very powerful.  Her Butterfly broke your heart every time, through the moving way she shaped the ebb and flow of the music.  There was no way you could see her as a 15 year old geisha, but by the wedding scene of the first act you were a complete believer.Above all, there was that voice.  It was immediately recognizable, distinctive, unlike any other.  If you tuned in to a radio broadcast without hearing an announcement, two notes would be enough to identify the richly colored, luxurious sonority of the Tebaldi sound, a sound that caressed the ear and at the same time enveloped you.  For many of us it was the sound that defined what an Italian soprano should be.�- Henry Fogel, FANFARE�Giulio Neri was a leading Italian bass in the post-WW II period.  He had a very powerful, penetrating, but utterly secure voice�. Neri never made it to these shores;  I would have walked miles to hear him.�- Kurt Moses, AMERICAN RECORD GUIDE, May/June, 2004�Giangiacomo Guelfi [not to be confused with Carlo Guelfi, a younger baritone] studied at the Centro Lirico in Florence, as well as with legendary Italian baritone Titta Ruffo, and made his opera d�but in the title role of Verdi's RIGOLETTO in 1950, an exceptionally young age for such a work.  He won the Spoleto Experimental Theater Prize and made his La Scala d�but in 1952 as The Visitor in Castro's PROSERPINA Y EL EXTRANJERO.  He made his London d�but two years later at Drury Lane as G�rard in Giordano's ANDREA CH�NIER.  Though he drew considerable acclaim in a 1957 performance of Verdi's I DUE FOSCARI in Venice, and he was considered a rising star during the late '50s and early '60s, it was not until his 1964 performance of Verdi's MACBETH at La Scala that he was acknowledged as a full-fledged star.  He made his Metropolitan d�but in 1970 as Scarpia.  He was particularly admired during his prime for his powerful voice, but like many possessors of such voices, occasionally indulged in bellowing and, toward the end of his career, relied excessively on extra-musical vocal effects.�- Anne Feeney, allmusic.com

About Intercept


 Intercept is a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of novel therapeutics to treat chronic underserved liver diseases. The Company's lead product candidate, obeticholic acid (OCA), is an agonist of the farnesoid X receptor (FXR). OCA is being developed for a variety of chronic liver diseases, including primary biliary cirrhosis, recently renamed primary biliary cholangitis (PBC), nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) and biliary atresia. The FDA has granted OCA breakthrough therapy designation for the treatment of NASH with liver fibrosis and granted OCA fast track designation for the treatment of patients with PBC. OCA has also received orphan drug designation in both the United States and Europe for the treatment of PBC and PSC. Intercept owns worldwide rights to OCA outside of Japan, China and Korea, where it has out-licensed the product candidate to Sumitomo Dainippon Pharma. Intercept's pipeline of product candidates includes other novel bile acid analogs such as INT-767, which is in clinical development. For more information about Intercept, please visit the Company's website at: www.interceptpharma.com.

Safe Harbor Statements

This press release contains "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including, but not limited to, statements regarding the anticipated commercialization of OCA in PBC, the continued development of OCA and Intercept's other product candidates, and our strategic directives under the caption "About Intercept."

Former Eli Lilly and Company Senior Executive Brings Extensive Line Management, Strategic Planning, Product and Transaction Expertise

Mr. Santini most recently served as senior vice president of corporate strategy and business development at Eli Lilly and Company, where he led corporate strategy and long-range planning, M&A, new product licensing, innovative financing of internal development projects and the expansion of Lilly Ventures in the U.S. and China.
“It is an honor to welcome Gino to our board of directors,” said Alexey Margolin, Ph.D., co- founder, president and CEO of Allena Pharmaceuticals. “The team that founded Allena has worked with Gino in the past and we know that his strategic insights and proven expertise will be of significant value to Allena as we work to accelerate the development of our non-systemic protein therapeutics.”

Mid-week Clothing Roundup: new threads from Santini, Rapha Women & Cafe du Cycliste

			By Graham Rothermel - Posted on May 17, 2017 by Graham Rothermel - 5:33 pm		




With good weather, lots of new clothing and complete cycling kits keep dropping in front of us as a new season of roads rapidly approaches. With the Giro d’Italia in full swing as well as the Tour of California, summer is just around the corner. Slide on past the break to see all the expanded new offerings for women from Rapha and Café du Cycliste’s jailhouse kit, plus another limited edition Giro commemorative kit from Santini….
Rapha Women & Souplesse
  
Rapha just announced several strategic updates across their women’s line ahead of the summer season. Key updates include a totally reworked $160 Classic Vest II featuring elastic mesh side panels for improved fit & ventilation, as well as stretchy front and rear panels with reflective elements added to the back. The $175 Souplesse & $175 Souplesse Lightweight jerseys and $265 bibs also receive version 2.0 or rather II designations with updated fabrics and cuts, aiding in both better breathability and support. Rapha has also released an understated version of the $185 Souplesse Aero jersey in non-team regalia, and a new $125 Flyweight jersey on the way. It’s pretty much incremental performance updates all around borne out of the Canyon//SRAM team development, plus a general filling out of the women’s line-up. Almost all of the new kit is available now online and in Rapha stores worldwide.

Santini Gino Bartali

Santini have unveiled another special edition kit at this year’s 100th Giro. This one looks to honor Gino Bartali, coinciding with the 11th Giro stage being dedicated to Gino as well. The kits have a blue and yellow theme to inspired by the 3 Giro wins and 7 King of the Mountains jerseys he amassed over his career. Also paying homage to his achievements off the bike, Santini used envelopes as the mountain graphics to call out Bartali’s efforts during WW2 delivering letters to partisan fighters in the resistance.
  
The limited edition Gino offerings include jerseys, bibs, caps, socks and gloves to completely deck yourself out for a Gino Giro. The kit features a race cut fit standard road kit tech – grippers on the sleeves, bib cuffs and jersey hem, as well as the high-tech fabrics found throughout the Santini line. Pricing ranges from 13€ for the caps up to 109€ for the bibs.

Café du Cycliste

Café du Cycliste recently released a warm weather line-up by way of a Spring/Summer 2017 Look Book with updated designs across the range. They’ve also debuted some new lightweight $288 Mathilde Audax bibshorts. Wanting to shave weight as well as enhance the comfort, they are made from fewer panels  to eliminate seams, with each leg uniquely cut from a single piece of fabric.

Continuing their stylish-yet-functional theme, Café du Cycliste are showcasing many new understated designs. This jailhouse striped $150 Francine jersey is one of many to relying on basic color palettes, but strong patterning to speak for themselves. They’ve got some more low-key stripes too, plus a bunch of snazzy new sock offerings that get similarly updated to match.

Nice touch with the Bartali letters.  His wartime story is amazing, I recommend the book written about it and his cycling career highly (Road To Valour).

Cycling has definitely jumped the shark when prison attire becomes the fashion du jour…

Bib Tight Guide
Take a closer look at a few of our favorite tights for riding in winter conditions.


Men
Women



Giordana | Assos | Castelli | Pearl Izumi | Garneau | Maloja


















Giordana AV Bib Tight
Giordana’s flagship tight offering is built for riding hard in truly unpleasant winter conditions, courtesy of a slim race cut and highly weather resistant fleece-backed SuperRoubiax fabric. The Cirro S chamois and wicking materials ensure comfort when you’re on the rivet, while a full complement of reflective hits keeps you visible to drivers at dawn and dusk.

Assos LL.habuTight_s7
When only the best will do Assos is the obvious choice, and the exemplary Habu bib tights fit that description perfectly. They start with an _s7 level feature package that includes a phenomenal race fit and Assos’s unsurpassed _s7 chamois, and are augmented with a windproof BlasenSchutz front panel to deliver maximum comfort across a wide range of winter conditions.
Shop Assos LL.habuTight_s7






















Castelli Meno 2 Bib Tight
As the sequel to the beloved Meno bib, Castelli’s Meno 2 brings warmth and wind protection for milder conditions along with an impressive feature package—at a surprisingly palatable price. The wind-resistant Thermoflex Core2 front panel shrugs off cool gusts while managing moisture extremely well, making these a training staple for above-freezing temperatures. 
Shop Castelli Meno 2 Bib Tight




















Pearl Izumi P.R.O. Pursuit Cycling Bib Tight
The race-cut P.R.O. Pursuit bib tights benefit from Pearl Izumi’s extensive experience building cycling clothing for challenging conditions. The windproof triple layer softshell material is suitable for cold winter weather, while the raw bib strap edges and pursuit 1:1 chamois all but guarantee rider comfort as the miles add up.
Shop Pearl Izumi P.R.O. Pursuit Cycling Bib Tight




















Louis Garneau Mondo Evo Thermal Bib Tight
Louis Garneau’s home, Quebec, has frightfully cold winters; it’s therefore not surprising that the Mondo Evo bib tights are among the finest race-grade bibs for truly frigid conditions. The heavy windproof fabrics, working in conjunction with HeatMaxx insulation in the abdomen, make these a favorite for riding in sub-freezing weather.
Shop Louis Garneau Mondo Evo Thermal Bib Tight






















Maloja HosfordM Bib Tight
In case you’re not familiar with Maloja, the German brand tends to do things a bit differently. Despite an admittedly non-standard approach, those needing a true deep-winter bib would be wise to consider the the HosfordM bib tights. Built with Lycra WindBlock three-layer fabric and featuring a race-worthy fit, these tights stand out in a crowd in the best possible way.

Giordana Sosta Tight
For rides driven by enjoyment as much as training, Giordana’s Sosta tights are an easy pick. Designed to be a bit warmer than most race tights, these coffee-ride staples feature Roubaix fabric and a Cirro SW women’s-specific chamois help handle training rides with ease. They’re also incredibly comfortable thanks to a yoga-style waistband, and are presentable-looking off the bike.

Assos HL.tiburuTight_s7
Arguably the finest all-around women’s tight available, the HL.tiburuTights_s7 are based on Assos’s unrivaled _s7 technology package. They offer the signature “click” fit, as well as the esteemed Lady_s7 chamois wrought from a combination of RX Medium and RX Light materials to maximize your comfort in above-freezing temperatures.
Shop Assos HL.tiburuTight_s7


















Castelli Meno Wind Tight
In spite of the modest asking price, Castelli’s Meno wind tights offer impressive weather protection for milder conditions. The secret is AirFlex Thermal fabric—a windproof material that is unique in its stretchiness, allowing a close to skin fit that shrugs off cold gusts. Factor in the Kiss Air chamois and supportive waistband and it becomes obvious why the Meno has become a firm favorite.
Shop Castelli Meno Wind Tight
























Louis Garneau Course Elite 2 Bib Tights
If truly cold conditions are part of your winter riding routine, look no further than the Course Elite 2 bib tights. Louis Garneau’s Quebec headquarters provided a bitterly cold proving ground for these windproof, highly insulated race bibs. And then there’s the bib strap, which detaches at the front to enable high-speed pit stops—an essential feature for long winter training rides.
Shop Louis Garneau Course Elite 2 Bib Tight




















Pearl Izumi Elite Thermal Cycling Tight
The Elite Thermal tights showcase Pearl Izumi’s mastery of winter clothing despite their modest asking price. The Elite Thermal fleece backed fabric offers outstanding moisture management and a substantial degree of warmth. These versatile winter tights get even better with the Elite 3D chamois, and they’re rounded off by reflective hits to make you more visible on the road.
Shop Pearl Izumi Elite Thermal Cycling Tight




















Sugoi Evolution MidZero Tight
If your list of requirements includes warmth, versatility, and staying visible on the road, the Evolution MidZero tights should be on your radar. The MidZero insulated material features a brushed fleece lining that will keep you comfortable in temperatures approaching freezing, while the large Zap reflective panels at the lower leg ensure that you’ll be seen by passing motorists.

About Gifting

We've all been there before: Someone you love asks what you really want for your birthday or the holidays, but you know better than to attempt conversation about Campagnolo or Assos or POC with them. Instead, make everyone's life less stressful by suggesting a Competitive Cyclist Gift Card. They're available in incremental amounts between $25 - $3,000 they never expire, and you can use them to purchase anything we offer.
Gift Cards are emailed to the recipient within 24 hours of purchase. No special offers or promotions may be applied to the purchase of a Gift Card.
