	The Global Maritime Investment Group seeks attractive investment opportunities diversified by vessel type and charter agreement.







		Investment Overview

		Although a new asset class for institutional investors, the maritime industry is responsible for transporting over 90% of trade worldwide making it a key driver of global growth. Given the fundamentals of the industry, shipping will continue to be a major factor in trade and a vital component of global supply chains.


		A maritime investment strategy offers investors a unique means of accessing:


Income: Potential for stable yield through long-term charters with high quality counterparties
			 

Diversification: Revenue drivers uncorrelated with traditional financial asset classes
			 

Global exposure: Ships carry a wide range of cargo with independent demand drivers sourced from a variety of industries and localized market factors
			 

Strategy flexibility: A cyclical industry creates the opportunity for a variety of strategies with attractive entry points across sectors
			 






				Investment Approach

		Our tested investment thesis is predicated upon the following:



Attractive entry point: Depressed charter rates and ship valuations coupled with a global dependence on shipping
				 

Long-term demand drivers: Increased population and urbanization in the emerging markets will continue to drive infrastructure development which is reliant on the delivery of commodities facilitated by global shipping lanes
				 

Diversified investment strategy: A strategic approach to investing across the risk/return spectrum in order to capitalize on historically low asset valuations and the potential for longer-term steady income in an otherwise low-yielding environment
				 








Risks Associated with Investments in Maritime Assets Generally: An investment in the Strategy is subject to certain risks associated with the ownership of maritime assets and the maritime industry in general, including: the burdens of ownership of maritime-related assets; local, national and international economic conditions; the supply and demand for assets; the financial condition of operators, buyers and sellers of assets; changes in interest rates and the availability of credit which may render the sale or refinancing of assets difficult or impracticable; changes in environmental laws and regulations, planning laws and other governmental rules and fiscal and monetary policies; environmental claims arising in respect of assets acquired with undisclosed or unknown defects or problems resulting in environmental liabilities or as to which inadequate reserves have been established; changes in tax rates; changes in energy prices; negative developments in the economy that depress commercial transportation activity; uninsured casualties; force majeure acts, terrorist and piracy events, under-insured or uninsurable losses; and other factors which are beyond the reasonable control of the Strategy and the Investment Adviser. In addition, as recent experience has demonstrated, maritime assets are subject to long-term cyclical trends that give rise to significant volatility in values.






KEY BENEFITS



		Unique investment opportunity

		Long-term drivers of investment returns

		Diverse sources of attractive deal opportunities

		Growing, well-positioned platform of vessels

		Established, well respected team

PRESS RELEASE
NEW YORK, June 22, 2017 /PRNewswire/ — J.P. Morgan Asset Management today announced the closing of its Global Maritime Investment Fund II with $480 million in capital commitments from a broad range of international institutional investors, including pension plans, insurance companies, and endowment and health care entities.
The Fund, which surpassed its $400 million targeted capital raise, is one of the largest dedicated shipping funds. It seeks to invest, through a closed-end structure, in modern vessels operating in shipping sub-sectors that are experiencing substantial distress, with values trading near historical lows. The Fund has already invested $312 million or 65% of total capital through the acquisition of 14 assets.
One of J.P. Morgan Asset Management’s first 14 investments for the Fund. The firm has already invested 65% of the $480 million raised.
The distressed shipping opportunity is a small part of a broader transportation capital requirement, which has intensified following the departure of traditional funding sources such as banks. “With an estimated $4.5 trillion-plus in capital required to finance global transportation assets over the next 10 years, this is a large-scale and wide-ranging investment opportunity,” said Anton Pil, Managing Partner of J.P. Morgan Global Alternatives, “Institutional investors, seeking uncorrelated and high relative value returns, have discovered this growing, sustainable opportunity to own and lease tangible assets that form the foundation of our interdependent global economy.” 





“In the shipping space, investors have the potential to capitalize on an historic opportunity to acquire quality assets at very favorable prices,” continued Andy Dacy, Head of Global Transportation, J.P. Morgan Global Alternatives. “Our established and dedicated transportation investment team with an extensive industry network has been able to acquire vessels at distressed purchase prices, achieving opportunistic-level returns.”
With $1.26 billion in institutional client capital dedicated to the transportation industry, J.P. Morgan Asset Management is a leader in this sector globally.
