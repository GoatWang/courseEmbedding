First Trust Senior Floating Rate 2022 Target Term Fund Declares its 
      Monthly Common Share Distribution of $0.0417 Per Share for June






May 22, 2017 04:44 PM Eastern Daylight Time



WHEATON, Ill.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--First Trust Senior Floating Rate 2022 Target Term Fund (the "Fund") 
      (NYSE: FIV) has declared the Fund’s regularly scheduled monthly common 
      share distribution in the amount of $0.0417 per share payable on June 
      15, 2017, to shareholders of record as of June 5, 2017. The ex-dividend 
      date is expected to be June 1, 2017. The monthly distribution 
      information for the Fund appears below.
    




First Trust Senior Floating Rate 2022 Target 
            Term Fund (FIV):





          Distribution per share:
        

           
        

          $0.0417
        



          Distribution Rate based on the May 19, 2017 NAV of $9.85:
        



          5.08%
        



          Distribution Rate based on the May 19, 2017 closing market price of 
          $9.93:
        



          5.04%
        







           
        



      The majority, and possibly all, of this distribution will be paid out of 
      net investment income earned by the Fund. A portion of this distribution 
      may come from net short-term realized capital gains or return of 
      capital. The final determination of the source and tax status of all 
      distributions paid in 2017 will be made after the end of 2017 and will 
      be provided on Form 1099-DIV.
    

      The Fund is a diversified, closed-end management investment company. The 
      Fund's investment objectives are to seek a high level of current income 
      and to return $9.85 per common share of beneficial interest ("Common 
      Share") of the Fund (the original net asset value ("Original NAV") per 
      Common Share before deducting offering costs of $0.02 per Common Share) 
      to the holders of Common Shares on or about February 1, 2022 (the 
      "Termination Date"). The Fund will attempt to strike a balance between 
      the two objectives, seeking to provide as high a level of current income 
      as is consistent with the Fund's overall credit performance, on the one 
      hand, and its objective of returning the Original NAV on or about the 
      Termination Date on the other. However, as the Fund approaches the 
      Termination Date, its monthly distributions are likely to decline, and 
      there are can be no assurance that the Fund will achieve either of its 
      investment objectives or that the Fund's investment strategies will be 
      successful. Under normal market conditions, the Fund will seek to 
      achieve its investment objectives by investing at least 80% of its 
      Managed Assets in senior, secured floating-rate loans ("Senior Loans") 
      of any maturity. Senior Loans are made to U.S. and non-U.S. 
      corporations, partnerships and other business entities which operate in 
      various industries and geographical regions. Senior Loans are typically 
      rated below investment grade. As it nears the Termination Date, the Fund 
      may invest in higher credit quality instruments with maturities 
      extending beyond the Termination Date to seek to improve the liquidity 
      of its portfolio and reduce investment risk. Investing in higher credit 
      quality instruments may reduce the amount available for distribution to 
      Common Shareholders.
    

      First Trust Advisors L.P., the Fund's investment advisor, along with its 
      affiliate, First Trust Portfolios L.P., are privately-held companies 
      which provide a variety of investment services, including asset 
      management and financial advisory services, with collective assets under 
      management or supervision of approximately $105 billion as of April 30, 
      2017 through unit investment trusts, exchange-traded funds, closed-end 
      funds, mutual funds and separate managed accounts.
    

      Past performance is no assurance of future results. Investment return 
      and market value of an investment in the Fund will fluctuate. Shares, 
      when sold, may be worth more or less than their original cost.
    

      Principal Risk Factors: The Fund will typically invest in senior loans 
      rated below investment grade, which are commonly referred to as "junk" 
      or "high yield" securities and considered speculative because of the 
      credit risk of their issuers. Such issuers are more likely than 
      investment grade issuers to default on their payments of interest and 
      principal owed to the Fund, and such defaults could reduce the Fund's 
      NAV and income distributions. An economic downturn would generally lead 
      to a higher non-payment rate, and a senior loan may lose significant 
      market value before a default occurs. Moreover, any specific collateral 
      used to secure a senior loan may decline in value or become illiquid, 
      which would adversely affect the senior loan's value.
    

      Senior Loans are structured as floating rate instruments in which the 
      interest rate payable on the obligation fluctuates with interest rate 
      changes. As a result, the yield on Senior Loans will generally decline 
      in a falling interest rate environment, causing the Fund to experience a 
      reduction in the income it receives from a Senior Loan. In addition, the 
      market value of Senior Loans may fall in a declining interest rate 
      environment and may also fall in a rising interest rate environment if 
      there is a lag between the rise in interest rates and the reset. Many 
      Senior Loans have a minimum base rate, or floor (typically, a "LIBOR 
      floor"), which will be used if the actual base rate is below the minimum 
      base rate. To the extent the Fund invests in such Senior Loans, the Fund 
      may not benefit from higher coupon payments during periods of increasing 
      interest rates as it otherwise would from investments in Senior Loans 
      without any floors until rates rise to levels above the LIBOR floors. As 
      a result, the Fund may lose some of the benefits of incurring leverage. 
      Specifically, if the Fund's Borrowings have floating dividend or 
      interest rates, its costs of leverage will increase as rates increase. 
      In this situation, the Fund will experience increased financing costs 
      without the benefit of receiving higher income. This in turn may result 
      in the potential for a decrease in the level of income available for 
      dividends or distributions to be made by the Fund.
    

      The Fund's limited term may cause it to invest in lower-yielding 
      securities or hold the proceeds of securities sold near the end of its 
      term in cash or cash equivalents, which may adversely affect the 
      performance of the Fund or the Fund's ability to maintain its dividend.
    

      A second lien loan may have a claim on the same collateral pool as the 
      first lien or it may be secured by a separate set of assets. Second lien 
      loans are typically secured by a second priority security interest or 
      lien on specified collateral securing the Borrower's obligation under 
      the interest. Because second lien loans are second to first lien loans, 
      they present a greater degree of investment risk. Specifically, these 
      loans are subject to the additional risk that the cash flow of the 
      Borrower and property securing the loan may be insufficient to meet 
      scheduled payments after giving effect to those loans with a higher 
      priority. In addition, loans that have a lower than first lien priority 
      on collateral of the Borrower generally have greater price volatility 
      than those loans with a higher priority and may be less liquid. However, 
      second lien loans often pay interest at higher rates than first lien 
      loans reflecting such additional risks.
    

      Because the assets of the Fund will be liquidated in connection with its 
      termination, the Fund may be required to sell portfolio securities when 
      it otherwise would not, including at times when market conditions are 
      not favorable, or at a time when a particular security is in default or 
      bankruptcy, or otherwise in severe distress, which may cause the Fund to 
      lose money. Although the Fund has an investment objective of returning 
      Original NAV to Common Shareholders on or about the Termination Date, 
      the Fund may not be successful in achieving this objective. The return 
      of Original NAV is not an express or implied guarantee obligation of the 
      Fund. There can be no assurance that the Fund will be able to return 
      Original NAV to Common Shareholders, and such return is not backed or 
      otherwise guaranteed by the Advisor or any other entity. The risks of 
      investing in the Fund are spelled out in the prospectus, shareholder 
      reports and other regulatory filings.

  First Trust Advisors L.P., the Fund's investment advisor, along with its affiliate, First Trust Portfolios L.P., are privately-held companies which provide a variety of investment services, including asset management and financial advisory services, with collective assets under management or supervision of approximately $107 billion as of May 31, 2017 through unit investment trusts, exchange-traded funds, closed-end funds, mutual funds and separate managed accounts.   Past performance is no assurance of future results. Investment return and market value of an investment in the Fund will fluctuate. Shares, when sold, may be worth more or less than their original cost.  Principal Risk Factors: The Fund will typically invest in senior loans rated below investment grade, which are commonly referred to as "junk" or "high yield" securities and considered speculative because of the credit risk of their issuers. Such issuers are more likely than investment grade issuers to default on their payments of interest and principal owed to the Fund, and such defaults could reduce the Fund's NAV and income distributions. An economic downturn would generally lead to a higher non-payment rate, and a senior loan may lose significant market value before a default occurs. Moreover, any specific collateral used to secure a senior loan may decline in value or become illiquid, which would adversely affect the senior loan's value.  Senior Loans are structured as floating rate instruments in which the interest rate payable on the obligation fluctuates with interest rate changes. As a result, the yield on Senior Loans will generally decline in a falling interest rate environment, causing the Fund to experience a reduction in the income it receives from a Senior Loan. In addition, the market value of Senior Loans may fall in a declining interest rate environment and may also fall in a rising interest rate environment if there is a lag between the rise in interest rates and the reset. Many Senior Loans have a minimum base rate, or floor (typically, a "LIBOR floor"), which will be used if the actual base rate is below the minimum base rate. To the extent the Fund invests in such Senior Loans, the Fund may not benefit from higher coupon payments during periods of increasing interest rates as it otherwise would from investments in Senior Loans without any floors until rates rise to levels above the LIBOR floors. As a result, the Fund may lose some of the benefits of incurring leverage. Specifically, if the Fund's Borrowings have floating dividend or interest rates, its costs of leverage will increase as rates increase. In this situation, the Fund will experience increased financing costs without the benefit of receiving higher income. This in turn may result in the potential for a decrease in the level of income available for dividends or distributions to be made by the Fund.

First Trust Senior Floating Rate 2022 Target Term Fund (FIV)








Investment Objective/Strategy - First Trust Senior Floating Rate 2022 Target Term Fund (the "Fund") is a diversified, closed-end management investment company. The Fund's investment objectives are to seek a high level of current income and to return $9.85 per common share of beneficial interest ("Common Share") of the Fund (the original net asset value ("Original NAV") per Common Share before deducting offering costs of $0.02 per Common Share) to the holders of Common Shares on or about February 1, 2022 (the "Termination Date"). The Fund will attempt to strike a balance between the two objectives, seeking to provide as high a level of current income as is consistent with the Fund's overall credit performance, on the one hand, and its objective of returning the Original NAV on or about the Termination Date on the other. However, as the Fund approaches the Termination Date, its monthly distributions are likely to decline, and there are can be no assurance that the Fund will achieve either of its investment objectives or that the Fund's investment strategies will be successful. Under normal market conditions, the Fund will seek to achieve its investment objectives by investing at least 80% of its Managed Assets in senior, secured floating-rate loans ("Senior Loans") of any maturity. Senior Loans are made to U.S. and non-U.S. corporations, partnerships and other business entities which operate in various industries and geographical regions. Senior Loans are typically rated below investment grade. As it nears the Termination Date, the Fund may invest in higher credit quality instruments with maturities extending beyond the Termination Date to seek to improve the liquidity of its portfolio and reduce investment risk. Investing in higher credit quality instruments may reduce the amount available for distribution to Common Shareholders.


        There can be no assurance that the Fund's investment objectives will be achieved.

                The ratings are by Standard & Poor's except where otherwise indicated. A credit rating is an assessment provided by a nationally recognized statistical rating organization (NRSRO) of the creditworthiness of an issuer with respect to debt obligations except for those debt obligations that are only privately rated. Ratings are measured on a scale that generally ranges from AAA (highest) to D (lowest). Investment grade is defined as those issuers that have a long-term credit rating of BBB- or higher. "NR" indicates no rating. The credit ratings shown relate to the creditworthiness of the issuers of the underlying securities in the Fund, and not to the Fund or its shares. Credit ratings are subject to change.

Footnotes


1
The NAV represents the fund's net assets (assets less liabilities) divided by the fund's common shares outstanding.


2
Fund shares are purchased and sold on an exchange at their share price rather than net asset value (NAV), which may cause the shares to trade at a price greater than NAV (premium) or less than NAV (discount).


3
Most recent distribution paid or declared to today's date. Subject to change in the future. There is no guarantee that the fund will declare dividends.


4
Distribution rates are calculated by annualizing the most recent distribution paid or declared through today's date and then dividing by the most recent market price. The distribution consists of the sum of net investment income, net realized short-term capital gains, net realized long-term capital gains, and return of capital.  Distribution rates may vary. Any distribution adjustment will not be reflected until after the declaration date for the next distribution.  See the fund's 19a-1 Notices, if any, located under the "News & Literature" section of the website for estimates of distribution sources. Final determination of the source and tax status of all distributions paid in the current year will be made after year-end.


5
A measure of a bond's sensitivity to interest rate changes that reflects the change in a bond's price given a change in yield.  It accounts for the likelihood of changes in the timing of cash flows in response to interest rate movements.


6
The annualized return that would be earned on a debt security if held to maturity, weighted by the value of each debt security in the fund's portfolio.  The calculation does not include the effect of fund fees and expenses.


7
A short-term funding rate estimated by banks in London that they would be charged if borrowing from other banks assuming a three month maturity.


8
Total return is the combination of reinvested dividend income and reinvested capital gains distributions, at prices obtained by the Dividend Reinvestment Plan, if any, and changes in the NAV and Share Price.  The NAV total return takes into account the fund's total annual expenses and does not reflect sales load.  Past performance is not indicative of future results.


9
Leverage is a technique where a closed-end fund's manager borrows assets at one rate and invests the proceeds from the borrowed assets at another rate, seeking to increase yield and total return. Use of leverage can result in additional risk and cost, and can magnify the effect of any losses.


10
Market value information used in calculating the percentages is based upon trade date plus one recording of transactions, which can differ from regulatory financial reports (Forms N-CSR and N-Q) that are based on trade date recording of security transactions. Holdings are subject to change.













Risk Considerations


    Investment return and market value of an investment in the fund will fluctuate. Shares, when sold, may be worth more or less than their original cost. 


The fund will typically invest in senior loans rated below investment grade, which are commonly referred to as "junk" or "high yield" securities and considered speculative because of the credit risk of their issuers. Such issuers are more likely than investment grade issuers to default on their payments of interest and principal owed to the fund, and such defaults could reduce the fund's NAV and income distributions. An economic downturn would generally lead to a higher non-payment rate, and a senior loan may lose significant market value before a default occurs. Moreover, any specific collateral used to secure a senior loan may decline in value or become illiquid, which would adversely affect the senior loan's value.
Senior Loans are structured as floating rate instruments in which the interest rate payable on the obligation fluctuates with interest rate changes. As a result, the yield on Senior Loans will generally decline in a falling interest rate environment, causing the fund to experience a reduction in the income it receives from a Senior Loan. In addition, the market value of Senior Loans may fall in a declining interest rate environment and may also fall in a rising interest rate environment if there is a lag between the rise in interest rates and the reset. Many Senior Loans have a minimum base rate, or floor (typically, a "LIBOR floor"), which will be used if the actual base rate is below the minimum base rate. To the extent the fund invests in such Senior Loans, the fund may not benefit from higher coupon payments during periods of increasing interest rates as it otherwise would from investments in Senior Loans without any floors until rates rise to levels above the LIBOR floors. As a result, the fund may lose some of the benefits of incurring leverage. Specifically, if the fund's Borrowings have floating dividend or interest rates, its costs of leverage will increase as rates increase. In this situation, the fund will experience increased financing costs without the benefit of receiving higher income. This in turn may result in the potential for a decrease in the level of income available for dividends or distributions to be made by the fund.
The fund's limited term may cause it to invest in lower-yielding securities or hold the proceeds of securities sold near the end of its term in cash or cash equivalents, which may adversely affect the performance of the fund or the fund's ability to maintain its dividend.
A second lien loan may have a claim on the same collateral pool as the first lien 
    or it may be secured by a separate set of assets. Second lien loans are typically 
    secured by a second priority security interest or lien on specified collateral securing the 
    Borrower's obligation under the interest and present a greater degree of investment risk. These loans 
    are also subject to the risk that Borrower cash flow  and property 
    securing the loan may be insufficient to meet scheduled payments after giving effect 
    to those loans with a higher priority. These loans also have greater price volatility than 
    those loans with a higher priority and may be less liquid. However, second lien loans often pay interest at higher rates than first lien loans reflecting such additional risks.
Because the assets of the fund will be liquidated in connection with its termination, the fund may be required to sell portfolio securities when it otherwise would not, including at times when market conditions are not favorable, or at a time when a particular security is in default or bankruptcy, or otherwise in severe distress, which may cause the fund to lose money. Although the fund has an investment objective of returning Original NAV to Common Shareholders on or about the Termination Date, the fund may not be successful in achieving this objective. The return of Original NAV is not an express or implied guarantee obligation of the fund. There can be no assurance that the fund will be able to return Original NAV to Common Shareholders, and such return is not backed or otherwise guaranteed by the Advisor or any other entity.

The ex-dividend date is expected to be July 3, 2017. The monthly distribution information for the Fund appears below.   First Trust Senior Floating Rate 2022 Target Term Fund (FIV):            Distribution per share:     $0.0417     Distribution Rate based on the June 19, 2017 NAV of $9.83:     5.09%     Distribution Rate based on the June 19, 2017 closing market price of $10.00:     5.00%  The majority, and possibly all, of this distribution will be paid out of net investment income earned by the Fund. A portion of this distribution may come from net short-term realized capital gains or return of capital. The final determination of the source and tax status of all distributions paid in 2017 will be made after the end of 2017 and will be provided on Form 1099-DIV.The Fund is a diversified, closed-end management investment company. The Fund's investment objectives are to seek a high level of current income and to return $9.85 per common share of beneficial interest ("Common Share") of the Fund (the original net asset value ("Original NAV") per Common Share before deducting offering costs of $0.02 per Common Share) to the holders of Common Shares on or about February 1, 2022 (the "Termination Date"). The Fund will attempt to strike a balance between the two objectives, seeking to provide as high a level of current income as is consistent with the Fund's overall credit performance, on the one hand, and its objective of returning the Original NAV on or about the Termination Date on the other. However, as the Fund approaches the Termination Date, its monthly distributions are likely to decline, and there are can be no assurance that the Fund will achieve either of its investment objectives or that the Fund's investment strategies will be successful. Under normal market conditions, the Fund will seek to achieve its investment objectives by investing at least 80% of its Managed Assets in senior, secured floating-rate loans ("Senior Loans") of any maturity. Senior Loans are made to U.S. and non-U.S. corporations, partnerships and other business entities which operate in various industries and geographical regions. Senior Loans are typically rated below investment grade. As it nears the Termination Date, the Fund may invest in higher credit quality instruments with maturities extending beyond the Termination Date to seek to improve the liquidity of its portfolio and reduce investment risk. Investing in higher credit quality instruments may reduce the amount available for distribution to Common Shareholders.First Trust Advisors L.P., the Fund's investment advisor, along with its affiliate, First Trust Portfolios L.P., are privately-held companies which provide a variety of investment services, including asset management and financial advisory services, with collective assets under management or supervision of approximately $107 billion as of May 31, 2017 through unit investment trusts, exchange-traded funds, closed-end funds, mutual funds and separate managed accounts.Past performance is no assurance of future results. Investment return and market value of an investment in the Fund will fluctuate. Shares, when sold, may be worth more or less than their original cost.Principal Risk Factors: The Fund will typically invest in senior loans rated below investment grade, which are commonly referred to as "junk" or "high yield" securities and considered speculative because of the credit risk of their issuers. Such issuers are more likely than investment grade issuers to default on their payments of interest and principal owed to the Fund, and such defaults could reduce the Fund's NAV and income distributions. An economic downturn would generally lead to a higher non-payment rate, and a senior loan may lose significant market value before a default occurs. Moreover, any specific collateral used to secure a senior loan may decline in value or become illiquid, which would adversely affect the senior loan's value.Senior Loans are structured as floating rate instruments in which the interest rate payable on the obligation fluctuates with interest rate changes. As a result, the yield on Senior Loans will generally decline in a falling interest rate environment, causing the Fund to experience a reduction in the income it receives from a Senior Loan. In addition, the market value of Senior Loans may fall in a declining interest rate environment and may also fall in a rising interest rate environment if there is a lag between the rise in interest rates and the reset. Many Senior Loans have a minimum base rate, or floor (typically, a "LIBOR floor"), which will be used if the actual base rate is below the minimum base rate. To the extent the Fund invests in such Senior Loans, the Fund may not benefit from higher coupon payments during periods of increasing interest rates as it otherwise would from investments in Senior Loans without any floors until rates rise to levels above the LIBOR floors. As a result, the Fund may lose some of the benefits of incurring leverage. Specifically, if the Fund's Borrowings have floating dividend or interest rates, its costs of leverage will increase as rates increase. In this situation, the Fund will experience increased financing costs without the benefit of receiving higher income. This in turn may result in the potential for a decrease in the level of income available for dividends or distributions to be made by the Fund.Read MoreThe Fund's limited term may cause it to invest in lower-yielding securities or hold the proceeds of securities sold near the end of its term in cash or cash equivalents, which may adversely affect the performance of the Fund or the Fund's ability to maintain its dividend.A second lien loan may have a claim on the same collateral pool as the first lien or it may be secured by a separate set of assets. Second lien loans are typically secured by a second priority security interest or lien on specified collateral securing the Borrower's obligation under the interest. Because second lien loans are second to first lien loans, they present a greater degree of investment risk. Specifically, these loans are subject to the additional risk that the cash flow of the Borrower and property securing the loan may be insufficient to meet scheduled payments after giving effect to those loans with a higher priority. In addition, loans that have a lower than first lien priority on collateral of the Borrower generally have greater price volatility than those loans with a higher priority and may be less liquid. However, second lien loans often pay interest at higher rates than first lien loans reflecting such additional risks.Because the assets of the Fund will be liquidated in connection with its termination, the Fund may be required to sell portfolio securities when it otherwise would not, including at times when market conditions are not favorable, or at a time when a particular security is in default or bankruptcy, or otherwise in severe distress, which may cause the Fund to lose money. Although the Fund has an investment objective of returning Original NAV to Common Shareholders on or about the Termination Date, the Fund may not be successful in achieving this objective. The return of Original NAV is not an express or implied guarantee obligation of the Fund. There can be no assurance that the Fund will be able to return Original NAV to Common Shareholders, and such return is not backed or otherwise guaranteed by the Advisor or any other entity. The risks of investing in the Fund are spelled out in the prospectus, shareholder reports and other regulatory filings.The Fund’s daily closing New York Stock Exchange price and net asset value per share as well as other information can be found at www.ftportfolios.com or by calling 1-800-988-5891.View source version on businesswire.com: http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20170620006540/en/ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextThe real reason overseas manufacturing is coming to AmericaYahoo FinanceThis Will Be In Everyone's Household By 2020Banyan HillSponsoredWisconsin governor defends $3 billion deal for Foxconn plantReutersMattress Startup Purple Agrees to $1.1B Merger With Publicly-Traded Investment Shell CompanyForbesUS Treasurys lower as bond investors digest Fed decision and auction resultsCNBCEngineer Finds Pattern; Makes Millions in StocksMoney MorningSponsoredAnthony Scaramucci’s Hollywood Ties: Investments Include Movie ‘Crazy for the Boys’VarietyThe 'two pizza rule' is a secret to productive meetings that helped Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos become one of the world's richest menBusiness InsiderTODAY'S CHARTS: Don't get blindsided by Tesla's shiny new Model 3Yahoo FinanceZuckerberg Wife's Ambitious Secret Finally ExposedUNewz.MeSponsoredTax cuts just got more likelyYahoo FinanceSBUX Unicorn Frap wasn’t magical enough to save earningsYahoo Finance VideoHow a one-of-a-kind business has kept 5,000 kitchens out of landfillsYahoo FinanceDiscover it: 4.8 out of 5 avg. by 24K+ customersDiscover CardSponsoredTrump’s unwitting legacy could be universal health coverageYahoo Finance9 ways to break free from your credit card debtYahoo Finance‘What Happened’: Hillary’s new book isn’t out yet, but Twitter is already making fun of the titlee-nuf-z-nuf: What happened?
