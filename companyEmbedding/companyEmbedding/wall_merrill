Product TypeCasement WindowCasement WindowCasement windows operate by moving away as in-swinging or out-swinging casement vents.  Casement windows operate about a vertical axis and can project toward the interior or the exterior of the frame. This window type uses compression-seal weatherstripping and is offered with adjoining fixed windows.  Graham’s casement windows are architectural grade products with superior performance and durability.  With countless configuration possibilities, glazing options and accessories, these windows are some of the most versatile that we provide.Curtain WallCurtain WallGraham Architectural Products curtain wall is a, custom-engineered, aluminum-framed wall, carrying in-fills of glass, metal panels, louvers, or thin stone such as granite or marble. The framing is attached to the building structure – typically anchored to the edge of the floor slab with some type of anchoring system (there are all different types, none of which carry the floor or roof loads of the building). The wind and gravity loads of the curtain wall are transferred to the building structure, typically at the floor line. DoorsDoorsDesigned to complement our engineering and fabrication capabilities in curtain wall, sunshades and fixed windows, Graham Architectural Products offers a versatile and comprehensive storefront and framing system from single door applications, to large-scale projects requiring multiple points of entry.Dual Action WindowDual Action WindowDual action windows, also referred to as tilt-turn windows, consist of a ventilator that tilts into the room from the top for ventilation and also swings in from the side to allow for easy cleaning of the outside surface. Fixed WindowFixed WindowFixed windows, as the name implies, do not have operable sashes or vents.  The glazing is installed directly into the main frame members.  Because there are no operable parts, these windows do incredibly well for air and water performance.  Our fixed window series are designed to complement our operable window lines or be used separately for areas not requiring ventilation. Horizontal Sliding WindowHorizontal Sliding WindowHorizontal sliding windows or “sliders” consist of one or more horizontal sashes in a master frame.  The operable sash glides on rollers for easy operation and low operating forces.  A single sash or all sashes can operate dependent on needs and preference.  These “by-pass” sashes allow cleaning from the interior without sash removal.  Graham Architectural Products offers multiple configurations and hardware options.  Each model can be used in conjunction with a fixed window series or other operating window types.Hung WindowHung WindowHung windows operate vertically where the weight of the sash is counterbalanced by a balance system mounted within the window frame.  A double hung window can operate both the upper and lower sash, while on a single hung, only the lower sash can open.  Some of our hung windows permit the sash to be tilted inward for cleaning purposes.  Graham also offerd dual or “split sash” with blinds; a pulley balance system where both sashes operate simultaneously; and we are one of the few manufacturers capable of providing true triple hung windows where all sashes can operate.Projected WindowProjected WindowProjected windows operate by moving away, or “projecting” from the plane of the window frame, as awning or hopper vents. Projected windows open and close horizontally and can also project toward the interior or exterior of the frame.  This window type uses compression-seal weatherstripping and is offered with adjoining fixed windows.  Graham’s projected windows are architectural grade products with superior performance and durability.  With countless configuration possibilities, glazing options and accessories, these windows represent a range of possibilities.Security & Vandal ScreensSecurity & Vandal ScreensSecurity and Vandal screens provide the added protection needed to help protect windows from break-ins and vandalism.  The seamless look of Graham Vandal and Security screens eliminates the need for unsightly add-on security screens that detract from the overall look of the building.Window AccessoriesWindow AccessoriesGraham Architectural Products’ design tools include hundreds of special interior trim, exterior panning shapes, and installation accessories, all developed for a variety of specific applications. Graham’s stock profiles make it possible to replicate virtually any existing window with thermally improved Graham architectural windows that save money. Other design options can provide curved window designs for that truly monumental look. TDL, internal muntin and applied muntin designs complement our windows.Window WallWindow WallA window wall is a factory-glazed window (and sometimes door) unit that is installed between the floor slabs of multi-story buildings. When the floor slabs edges are covered on the exterior with aluminum slab covers, the resulting appearance is that of curtain wall. A curtain wall is on the outside of the structure whereas a window wall sits between the floor slabs at the outer edge. In other words, it is a curtain wall but broken at every floor slab. Commercial high-rise office buildings typically use curtain wall while residential high-rise towers are starting to use window wall.Window Frame Depth2.25"2.75"3.0"3.25"3.375"3.5"3.75"4.0"4.5"5.0"6.0"ApplicationsAcousticalCommercialEducationEnergy PerformanceGovernment and MunicipalHealthcareHistoric ReplicationHuman ImpactHurricane ResistantResidential High-RiseSecurity and Blast ResistantSteel Replica WindowsU-Value0.21-0.250.26-0.300.31-0.350.36-0.400.41-0.450.46-0.500.51 & HigherCurtain Wall Product TypeIntegral BlindsPressure Wall - CapturedPressure Wall - SSGPunched Opening FixedStore Front & DoorsSunshades & Light ShelvesUnitized - CapturedUnitized - SSGZero Sight-line Vent

Sell on Houzz - Learn MoreFloodlights and security lights work well to deter unwanted nighttime visitors and provide a sense of security, while garden lights can illuminate a safe walkway through your backyard. Patio lights and deck lighting can brighten up outdoor living areas at night, allowing you to enjoy the outdoors past sunset. If you’d like your lights to serve a purely decorative purpose, fairy lights and outdoor string lights can lend an almost magical ambience to any garden. While searching for your outdoor light fixtures, consider what type of bulb you prefer. Solar lights are an ecofriendly option that will help reduce the cost of keeping your outdoor area lit up. Outdoor LED lighting may be more expensive up front than other options, but in the long run it will go easier on your wallet than halogen bulbs. LED lights have a long life span and provide quality lighting that is energy efficient. Halogen bulbs, on the other hand, are cheaper up front and can be used with a timer. While they also provide great lighting quality, the cost of wiring and maintenance may run up your bills in the long run. Whatever options you settle on, you’re sure to find a wide selection of delightful and functional landscape lighting right here on Houzz.

Sell on Houzz - Learn MoreKeep size in mind; you don’t want your lighting to be overpowered by your front door or architectural elements in your garden. Choose fixtures that are at least 25 percent as tall as your door to ensure they’ll provide ample lighting and be a strong design element. When selecting your outside wall lights, don’t forget to take into consideration how easy it will be to replace bulbs once they’ve burned out. Some designs require you to dismantle the light to access the bulb inside, which can be an ordeal. Once you’ve chosen your exterior wall lights, make sure to install them according to the included instructions. As a general rule, the ideal height for each outdoor wall light is around eye level, or 66 inches above the floor. You’ll find dozens of ways to upgrade your entryway with our selection of  outdoor wall lights here on Houzz.

A unique, more personal approach to investing: One that puts the interests of our clients first. 
 


We take a more personal approach to investing.
One focused on what's really important—your future.









Our purpose is to help you reach your goals at each stage of life
John Thiel














Why a Merrill Lynch Advisor?

Creating a financial strategy that reflects your personality. Getting to know you is your financial advisor's primary goal.



An approach built around your life's priorities. It's time for a financial strategy that puts your needs and priorities front and center.



Adapting the approach as life changes and goals are reached. It starts by being open and transparent about what we do. We'll explain the services you'll get, outcomes you may face and, just as importantly, what you'll pay. As things change, we'll be there to help you navigate with our industry leading insights.

Why don't we show the price?

					Like many retailers, LightingDirect.com can choose to set its own prices independently. And even though manufacturers require LightingDirect.com and other retailers to display a product's "minimum advertised price" (or MAP), the retailer can choose to sell for less than that. But the price must be conveyed in other ways, and each individual manufacturer's MAP policy determines where the price can be seen.
				

					To see the price for this product at LightingDirect.com, you'll need to place it in your shopping cart, and maybe even proceed to final checkout. If you're not ready to buy the product, simply remove it from the cart.
				

					LightingDirect.com apologizes for any inconvenience. We'd just like to offer you the chance to save extra money while we adhere to manufacturers' MAP policies. LightingDirect.com is also working to educate manufacturers on how their policies impact customers and their buying behavior.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
