Dr Berman is a fantastic diagnostician, very well informed and wonderful with children.  Believe it or not this is very hard to find.  Our son is now 7 and after years of being told nothing was wrong by DR's - but pre-school and sitters had numerous challenges - we knew we needed a more specific diagnosis.  

Dr Berman did a full assessment and now we have a path forward, have had lots of support in how to work with the school productively to get his IEP in place and get him the services to support him.  We keep records and go back once a year now and again, wonderful.  Having a child with learning issues, some obvious and others not as much, it is amazing to have an advocate on your team.  Also, he is very well respected and knows throughout the schools out in Contra Costa so it helps as he has relationships with them and sometimes can directly discuss to refine your childs program.  

It does take a team to raise a confident and supported child, especially with sensory or other learning issues and Dr Berman is a key member to have.  And he is very funny and so sweet with kids - it is very much appreciated.







I'm a behavior & education consultant and have been in practice in the Bay Area for 15 years. Dr. Berman and I have crossed paths many times. I also have had interactions with him as a part of an evidence-based education group I am a member of.
Anyhow, he's brilliant. There should be no hesitation to refer or use him. He is, quite simply, the best. 
I can't believe some of these reviews: One isn't even for his practice but a plastic surgeon/medi spa. The review by a former patient is compelling. However, I would remind folks that (a) diagnoses' often change from 6yo to a young adult. Also, I might suggest to that young man that whatever Brad wrote in that 12 year old report could have been the catalyst to get him the support he needed to grow into a functioning adult. Duh...







I can't think of anyone better than Dr. Berman.  You've seen the other two reviews; I can only confirm them.  He is one of the most caring, thorough, well-informed, experienced doctors I know.  If you have a child with any sort of learning or behavioral disability--Brad is the one to see.  Period.







We took our son to Dr Berman in desperation after being told he had a huge range of mysterious problems from autism to sensory processing disorder, and him essentially flunking out of pre-school!  Extensive testing from the school district only confirmed him as being 12th percentile for speech, but provided no diagnosis, answers, or treatment.  DR BERMAN IS AMAZING!  After just two appointments he showed that our son has nothing wrong other than delayed speech, he set him up with an great speech pathology group, and he established that our son actually tests a year AHEAD not a year behind as we had been told.  Just two months later now our son is THRIVING and speaking more every day.  We are so grateful to Dr Berman, we feel like our son was spared a lifetime of being put in the wrong box.  HE IS WORTH EVERY PENNY!!!!!!!!!!!







If you have a neat kid and need a world-class behavioural pediatrician, look no further.  He doesn't take insurance, so any paperwork is up to me.  You also get more than the office appointment.  Brad has made himself available for phone consultations.  He is also a great source of information for related information such as other professional assistance and possible school choices.

Dr Berman is a fantastic diagnostician, very well informed and wonderful with children.  Believe it or not this is very hard to find.  Our son is now 7 and after years of being told nothing was wrong by DR's - but pre-school and sitters had numerous challenges - we knew we needed a more specific diagnosis.  

Dr Berman did a full assessment and now we have a path forward, have had lots of support in how to work with the school productively to get his IEP in place and get him the services to support him.  We keep records and go back once a year now and again, wonderful.  Having a child with learning issues, some obvious and others not as much, it is amazing to have an advocate on your team.  Also, he is very well respected and knows throughout the schools out in Contra Costa so it helps as he has relationships with them and sometimes can directly discuss to refine your childs program.  

It does take a team to raise a confident and supported child, especially with sensory or other learning issues and Dr Berman is a key member to have.  And he is very funny and so sweet with kids - it is very much appreciated.







I'm a behavior & education consultant and have been in practice in the Bay Area for 15 years. Dr. Berman and I have crossed paths many times. I also have had interactions with him as a part of an evidence-based education group I am a member of.
Anyhow, he's brilliant. There should be no hesitation to refer or use him. He is, quite simply, the best. 
I can't believe some of these reviews: One isn't even for his practice but a plastic surgeon/medi spa. The review by a former patient is compelling. However, I would remind folks that (a) diagnoses' often change from 6yo to a young adult. Also, I might suggest to that young man that whatever Brad wrote in that 12 year old report could have been the catalyst to get him the support he needed to grow into a functioning adult. Duh...







I can't think of anyone better than Dr. Berman.  You've seen the other two reviews; I can only confirm them.  He is one of the most caring, thorough, well-informed, experienced doctors I know.  If you have a child with any sort of learning or behavioral disability--Brad is the one to see.  Period.







We took our son to Dr Berman in desperation after being told he had a huge range of mysterious problems from autism to sensory processing disorder, and him essentially flunking out of pre-school!  Extensive testing from the school district only confirmed him as being 12th percentile for speech, but provided no diagnosis, answers, or treatment.  DR BERMAN IS AMAZING!  After just two appointments he showed that our son has nothing wrong other than delayed speech, he set him up with an great speech pathology group, and he established that our son actually tests a year AHEAD not a year behind as we had been told.  Just two months later now our son is THRIVING and speaking more every day.  We are so grateful to Dr Berman, we feel like our son was spared a lifetime of being put in the wrong box.  HE IS WORTH EVERY PENNY!!!!!!!!!!!







If you have a neat kid and need a world-class behavioural pediatrician, look no further.  He doesn't take insurance, so any paperwork is up to me.  You also get more than the office appointment.  Brad has made himself available for phone consultations.  He is also a great source of information for related information such as other professional assistance and possible school choices.

Dr Berman is a fantastic diagnostician, very well informed and wonderful with children.  Believe it or not this is very hard to find.  Our son is now 7 and after years of being told nothing was wrong by DR's - but pre-school and sitters had numerous challenges - we knew we needed a more specific diagnosis.  Dr Berman did a full assessment and now we have a path forward, have had lots of support in how to work with the school productively to get his IEP in place and get him the services to support him.  We keep records and go back once a year now and again, wonderful.  Having a child with learning issues, some obvious and others not as much, it is amazing to have an advocate on your team.  Also, he is very well respected and knows throughout the schools out in Contra Costa so it helps as he has relationships with them and sometimes can directly discuss to refine your childs program.  It does take a team to raise a confident and supported child, especially with sensory or other learning issues and Dr Berman is a key member to have.  And he is very funny and so sweet with kids - it is very much appreciated.

I'm a behavior & education consultant and have been in practice in the Bay Area for 15 years. Dr. Berman and I have crossed paths many times. I also have had interactions with him as a part of an evidence-based education group I am a member of.Anyhow, he's brilliant. There should be no hesitation to refer or use him. He is, quite simply, the best. I can't believe some of these reviews: One isn't even for his practice but a plastic surgeon/medi spa. The review by a former patient is compelling. However, I would remind folks that (a) diagnoses' often change from 6yo to a young adult. Also, I might suggest to that young man that whatever Brad wrote in that 12 year old report could have been the catalyst to get him the support he needed to grow into a functioning adult. Duh...

I can't think of anyone better than Dr. Berman.  You've seen the other two reviews; I can only confirm them.  He is one of the most caring, thorough, well-informed, experienced doctors I know.  If you have a child with any sort of learning or behavioral disability--Brad is the one to see.  Period.

We took our son to Dr Berman in desperation after being told he had a huge range of mysterious problems from autism to sensory processing disorder, and him essentially flunking out of pre-school!  Extensive testing from the school district only confirmed him as being 12th percentile for speech, but provided no diagnosis, answers, or treatment.  DR BERMAN IS AMAZING!  After just two appointments he showed that our son has nothing wrong other than delayed speech, he set him up with an great speech pathology group, and he established that our son actually tests a year AHEAD not a year behind as we had been told.  Just two months later now our son is THRIVING and speaking more every day.  We are so grateful to Dr Berman, we feel like our son was spared a lifetime of being put in the wrong box.  HE IS WORTH EVERY PENNY!!!!!!!!!!!

If you have a neat kid and need a world-class behavioural pediatrician, look no further.  He doesn't take insurance, so any paperwork is up to me.  You also get more than the office appointment.  Brad has made himself available for phone consultations.  He is also a great source of information for related information such as other professional assistance and possible school choices.
