Duties. Executive is engaged by the Company in an executive capacity as its executive vice president of corporate development. Executive shall report to the Chief Executive Officer regarding the performance of her duties and shall be subject to the direction and control of the Board of Directors of the Company (sometimes referred to herein as the "Board") and the Chief Executive Officer.

Covenants Against Competition and Solicitation. Executive acknowledges that the services she is to render to the Company are of a special and unusual character, with a unique value to the Company, the loss of which cannot adequately be compensated by damages or an action at law. In view of the unique value to the Company of the services of Executive for which the Company has contracted hereunder, because of the confidential information to be obtained by, or disclosed to, Executive as hereinabove set forth, and as a material inducement to the Company to enter into this Agreement and to pay to Executive the compensation stated in Section 5, as well as any additional benefits stated herein, and other good and valuable consideration, Executive                                           3      4  covenants and agrees that throughout the period Executive remains employed hereunder and for one year thereafter, Executive shall not, directly or indirectly, anywhere in the United States of America (i) render any services, as an agent, independent contractor, consultant or otherwise, or become employed or compensated by, any other corporation, person or entity engaged in the business of selling or providing life, accident or health insurance products or services; (ii) render any services, as an agent, independent contractor, consultant or otherwise, or become employed or compensated by, any other corporation, person or entity engaged in the business of selling or providing any lending or other financial products or services that are competitive with the lending or other financial products or services sold or provided by the Company or its subsidiaries, (iii) in any manner compete with the Company or any of its subsidiaries; (iv) solicit or attempt to convert to other insurance carriers, finance companies or other corporations, persons or other entities providing these same or similar products or services provided by the Company and its subsidiaries, any customers or policyholders of the Company, or any of its subsidiaries; or (v) solicit for employment or employ any employee of the Company or any of its subsidiaries. The covenants of Executive in this Section 9 shall be void and unenforceable in the event of a Control Termination of this Agreement as defined in Section 10 below. Should any particular covenant or provision of this Section 9 be held unreasonable or contrary to public policy for any reason, including, without limitation, the time period, geographical area, or scope of activity covered by any restrictive covenant or provision, the Company and Executive acknowledge and agree that such covenant or provision shall automatically be deemed modified such that the contested covenant or provision shall have the closest effect permitted by applicable law to the original form and shall be given effect and enforced as so modified to whatever extent would be reasonable and enforceable under applicable law.            10. Termination.               (a) Either the Company or Executive may terminate this Agreement at          any time for any reason upon written notice to the other.
