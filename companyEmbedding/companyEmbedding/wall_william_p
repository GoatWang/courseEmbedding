     WALL William P 1908-1974  I photographed this gravestone in the Blue Bonnet Hills Cemetery, Tarrant Co., Texas.    Feel free to use this picture for your personal records.  This is one of the 229,522 cemetery photos free at http://teafor2.com  . If you know more about this person please reply here, instead of contacting me because this is most likely not my family.

Before you Hire

Here are some rules, regulations, and laws governing general contractors
in Virginia:













Does Wall William P T/A carry a valid contracting license?



In Virginia all remodeling and construction work with a cost of $1000 and up, requires a licensed contractor. There are three classes of license for contractors, from A to C. These are based on the size and scope of projects. 
Wall William P T/A currently holds license 2705010401 (Electrical), which was Active when we last checked. 











How important is contractor licensing in Virginia?



All applicants for A and B contractor licenses are required to complete a pre-license education course that has been approved by the Virginia Department of Professional and Occupational Regulation's Board for Contractors. Additionally contractors must prove at least 2 years of work experience in their specific trade. 











Your liability risk when hiring Wall William P T/A



Licensed contractors in the state of Virginia are not required to carry general liabilty or workers' compensation insurance. It is always a good idea to only hire contractors that have current general liabilty and workers' compensation policies. Request copies of the insurance certifcates for each.











Financial recourse when hiring Wall William P T/A



Virginia does offer support to homeowners for construction projects gone wrong. The Virginia Contractor Transaction Recovery Act provides relief to eligible consumers who have incurred losses through the improper or dishonest conduct of a licensed residential contractor. The Recovery Fund is supported entirely by assessments paid by licensed contractors, not by any tax revenues. Filing a claim does not guarantee payment.











How is the BuildZoom score calculated?



The BuildZoom score is based on a number of factors including the contractor's license status, insurance status, verified work history, standing with local consumer interest groups, verified reviews from other BuildZoom users and self-reported feedback from the contractor.











Why you should hire through BuildZoom



When it comes to major construction work or even minor alterations to your home, hiring the wrong contractor could result in incomplete or defective work. You may even find yourself dealing with huge liability claims. BuildZoom does the homework for you and helps you hire the right contractor.











You should get several bids before hiring a contractor



Before hiring a contractor in Virginia,be sure to get at least 3 detailed bids.Quality contractors will take the time to explain their budget proposal,and help guide you through the estimate process.Be wary of an abnormally low bid,they are not worth the risk.These underpriced projects often do not end well for the homeowner,choose a contractor you trust and can clearly communicate with.BuildZoom has made the bid collection process extremely simple (and free).Just click here to get started.

STAAR Surgical Co.

                    STAAR Surgical Company is at the vanguard of minimally invasive ophthalmic vision enhancement and technology. We believe in the importance of improving the efficiency, convenience, and comfort of corrective eye surgery for both medical professionals and patients. It is for this reason that we continually evaluate our existing products to ensure that we are providing the latest cataract, refractive error, and glaucoma treatments. From our patented COLLAMER lenses to Cruise Control, our unique new high vacuum surgery system, STAAR Surgical Company is responsible for some of the most revolutionary developments in ophthalmology.

Regarded as a technology leader in the surgical eye correction industry, STAAR Surgical Company was founded in 1982 when the intraocular lens (IOL) was still in its relative infancy. Although still an integral part of the company's portfolio, STAAR Surgical Company's product lines have expanded beyond cataract correction solutions to include lenses and medical devices for refractive and glaucoma surgery.

STAAR Surgical Company has revolutionized the industry with its development and use of Collamer. This unique lens material is used in the Afinity™ line of intraocular lenses (IOLs), the Visian ICL, and the Visian TICL*. Each Collamer lens produced by STAAR Surgical Company is made from a material that not only is durable, but also replicates features of the eye's natural lens, creating high quality of vision and optimal biocompatibility.

STAAR Surgical Company has developed into a global surgical eye correction technology leader. To foster ongoing growth, we emphasize creativity, research, and development. Using these tools, STAAR Surgical Company plans to continue making advancements in technology, marketing, and financial strength
