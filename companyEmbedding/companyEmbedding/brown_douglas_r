Induction heat treatment of an annular workpiece



Patent number:  9693397
                                            

Abstract:  Apparatus is provided for inductively heat treating a circular surface of annular workpieces where at least one inductor pair is used to perform a scan induction heat treatment of the circular surface. Controlled movement of the inductors and application of quenchant is provided particularly at the initial and final heat treatment locations on the circular surface to enhance metallurgical uniformity of the annular workpiece at these locations. In combination with controlled movement of the inductors, a simultaneous power-frequency control scheme can be applied to the inductors during the heat treatment process with the apparatus.

Application of electric induction energy for manufacture of irregularly shaped shafts with cylindrical components including non-unitarily forged crankshafts and camshafts



Patent number:  8247749
                                            

Abstract:  Large, non-unitarily forged shaft workpieces such as a crankshaft have successive shaft features inductively heated and forged without cool down between each sectional forging process. The temperature profile along the axial length of the next section of the shaft workpiece to be inductively heated and forged is measured prior to heating, and the induced heat energy along the axial length of the next section is dynamically adjusted responsive to the measured temperature profile to achieve a required pre-forge temperature distribution along the axial length of the next section prior to forging.

Induction heat treatment of complex-shaped workpieces



Patent number:  8222576
                                            

Abstract:  Apparatus and method are provided for induction heating of one or more components of a complex-shaped workpiece. The component is positioned within an opening formed by opposing pairs of arcuate coil structures formed in opposing inductor segments. One inductor segment is formed from electrically isolated inner and outer active inductor segments connected to one or more power supplies, while the other inductor segment is formed from electrically isolated inner and outer passive inductor segments that are magnetically coupled with respective inner and outer active inductor segments. Changing the output electrical parameters of the one or more power supplies controls the induction hardening along the transverse width of the workpiece with optional flux concentrators between opposing pairs of arcuate coil structures.
