Having long been obsessed with categories that have limited to no innovation, Amy looks for what she doesn't see to deliver superior service. This passion is what ignited the spark for Madison Reed. Fast forward to today, and the permanent hair color line boasts 27 pre-mixed multi-tonal shades that are salon quality with a formula that delivers unparalleled depth and shine (it's also ammonia- and resorcinol-free). The fade-resistant color is sent in a complete in-home coloring kit and delivered to your door. You can also book a stylist who will be sent to you to make color selection and teach you how to apply the color – in select locations so far, but we’re growing.

View Site   Madison Reed  Total Commitment $10,000,000  Major Investors Norwest Venture Partners, True Ventures, Comcast Ventures  Madison Reed, the next revolution in "in-home" hair color, was born from an aha moment in 2013 by CEO and Co-Founder Amy Errett, a leading entrepreneur, senior executive and venture capitalist, who realized we no longer needed to be held hostage to the tedious routine and expense of going to the salon for professional grade hair color. Having long been obsessed with categories that have limited to no innovation, Amy looks for what she doesn't see to deliver superior service. This passion is what ignited the spark for Madison Reed. Fast forward to today, and the permanent hair color line boasts 27 pre-mixed multi-tonal shades that are salon quality with a formula that delivers unparalleled depth and shine (it's also ammonia- and resorcinol-free). The fade-resistant color is sent in a complete in-home coloring kit and delivered to your door. You can also book a stylist who will be sent to you to make color selection and teach you how to apply the color – in select locations so far, but we’re growing.

Investment Approach

The portfolio managers invest in stocks, bonds, hybrid securities and other financial instruments seeking capital appreciation and a stream of income while attempting to provide downside mitigation. The High-Grade Fixed Income Strategy seeks to provide competitive returns with low to moderate volatility from diversified sources throughout the U.S. fixed income market. The Opportunistic Strategy seeks to invest in securities with asymmetric payoff profiles, diversifying characteristics and those that fulfill the Fund’s investment mandate. These securities may include equity hybrids, convertible bonds, corporate bonds, asset-backed securities, derivatives, cash, structured products and other instruments.



Risk Management

Our team limits exposure to individual companies, industries and sectors, seeking to limit volatility through company quality and diversification.


Risk Management Overview



We conduct rigorous fundamental research to identify individual companies with asymmetrical risk/return opportunities.


Risk Management Overview



At the portfolio level, our experienced investment personnel closely monitor the strategy's positioning, and the active risk resulting from our security selection process and sector allocations. We evaluate factor and style exposure, as well as the ownership and liquidity profile of each security in the portfolio.


Risk Management Overview



Our team proactively manages risk by constructing diversified portfolios across sectors, industry groups and securities. We manage, monitor and limit sector weights relative to specified benchmarks and security position sizes within each portfolio.


Risk Management Overview



Our team closely monitors position size and sector weights; we have limits on active security weights against the benchmark for each strategy we manage.


Risk Management Overview



Risk is managed at the portfolio, strategy and security levels to identify diversified sources of alpha. We mainly focus on currency, interest rates and credit. Positions are sized and monitored according to established limits.


Risk Management Overview



We focus primarily on senior loans in an effort to maintain product integrity and limit duration risk.


Risk Management Overview



The team manages risk at both a strategy and individual security level to help ensure that, when combined, they act as the ballast in an investor’s overall portfolio.


Risk Management Overview



Risk is managed at the portfolio, strategy and security levels to identify diversified sources of alpha. We seek to identify primary and secondary risks of each investment. Diversification of sectors can potentially reduce volatility.


Risk Management Overview



The team manages risk by administering duration limits, limiting portfolio weighted average maturity and conducting thorough credit analysis on individual securities.


Risk Management Overview



The Rochester team has created diverse portfolios designed to mitigate the types of risks that municipal bond investors may encounter.


Risk Management Overview



The Commodities team manages risk on multiple levels, including individual commodity sector levels and overall fund level.


Risk Management Overview



The Real Estate team monitors and manages risk at the security, sector and strategy levels.


Risk Management Overview



The Global Multi-Asset Group monitors and manages risk on an ongoing basis, both at the asset class and portfolio levels.


Risk Management Overview



We emphasize capital preservation by avoiding companies that may cut distributions. We seek to build diversified portfolios comprised of energy and energy related companies with attractive risk-adjusted total return potential.


Risk Management Overview



The Alternative Strategies team evaluates risk on multiple levels, applying numerous risk analysis methods on an ongoing basis in addition to assessing risk impacts of a position prior to making investment decisions.


Risk Management Overview



Risk is monitored by quantitative risk system and managed at many levels – stock, sector, country, and style factors. We seek to diversify the portfolio across the global listed infrastructure market and adhere to an established risk framework, including constraints imposed by position limits versus a benchmark.


Risk Management Overview



We monitor and manage both security and sector weights to the underlying index to ensure that the portfolio is properly tracking its benchmark. Also, partnering with well-known index providers ensures that we hold only high quality securities that pass very stringent profitability and liquidity screens.


Risk Management Overview




Risk Management


Alternative Strategies Team Risk Management

The Alternative Strategies team manages risk on multiple levels, including the individual securities level, strategy level (in the case of multi-strategy funds), and overall fund level, utilizing varying types of stress tests and scenarios analyses.  In addition, a team of risk management experts continuously monitor the portfolios and conduct frequent reviews with portfolio management personnel.
Enterprise Risk Management

Risk Management is an independent control function at OppenheimerFunds responsible for multiple areas of risk including investment risk, counterparty risk, enterprise risk and performance attribution.  The team is headed by the firm's Chief Risk Officer, who reports directly to the CEO.  This structure ensures that the entire Risk Management team is independent from the investment process, allowing us to avoid conflicts of interest and providing a valuable second set of eyes on both investment and enterprise-wide risks.
Core Responsibilities of Risk Management Team

Performs comprehensive portfolio reviews with all investment teams
Monitors individual security holdings across the entire firm
Works with investment teams to set specific maximums for the active weights of securities and sectors, as well as for predicted tracking error and other risk metrics
Independently monitors specified team risk metrics

The aim of our Risk Management team is to enable the portfolio managers to make informed decisions on the risk/reward tradeoffs at play in their respective portfolios.
We believe that risk management is not only a responsibility of the firm, but a critical component of our success.

Alternative asset classes may be volatile and are subject to liquidity risk. Fixed income investing entails credit and interest rate risks.

×











1. 
The Fund's investment objective changed from "seeks as much current income as is compatible with prudent investment" to "seeks total return"  on 12/28/12.  


2. 
Effective 11/1/13, the Fund will increase its investment limit on below investment grade securities from 25% to 40%, and the Fund will increase its investment limit on illiquid securities from 10% to 15%.  Please see the Fund's prospectus and prospectus supplement for further information.


3. 
Special Risks: Fixed income investing entails credit and interest rate risks. When interest rates rise, bond prices generally fall, and the Fund’s share prices can fall. Below-investment-grade (“high yield” or "junk") bonds are more at risk of default and are subject to liquidity risk.   Value investing involves the risk that undervalued securities may not appreciate as anticipated.  Mortgage-backed securities are subject to prepayment risk.  Derivative instruments entail higher volatility and risk of loss compared to traditional stock or bond investments. Asset-backed securities are subject to prepayment risk.   Foreign investments may be volatile and involve additional expenses and special risks, including currency fluctuations, foreign taxes, regulatory and geopolitical risks.  Emerging and developing market investments may be especially volatile. The Fund may also invest through a wholly-owned Cayman Islands subsidiary, which involves the risk that changes to the laws of the Cayman Islands could negatively affect the Fund.  Diversification does not guarantee profit or protect against loss.


4. 
The Manager has contractually agreed to waive expenses in an amount equal to the management fee it receives from its Subsidiary for so long as the Fund invests in the Subsidiary.  This waiver may not be terminated without the prior approval of the Fund's Board of Trustees.


5. 
The net expense ratio (where applicable) also takes into account contractual fee waivers and/or expense reimbursements without which performance would have been less.  These undertakings may not be amended or withdrawn for one year from the date of the current prospectus, unless approved by the Board.


6. 
Access index definitions.


7. 
Standardized yield for each share class is based on an SEC standardized formula designed to approximate a Fund's annualized hypothetical current income from securities less expenses for the 30-day period ending and including the most recent month-end or quarter-end and either that date's maximum offering price (Class A shares) or net asset value (for other share classes).  The month-end figure is typically calculated on the fifth business day of the next month. The result is compounded semiannually and annualized.  Falling share prices artificially increase yields.


8. 
Holdings are subject to change, and are dollar weighted based on total net assets. Negative weightings may result from the use of leverage. Leverage involves the use of various financial instruments or borrowed capital in an attempt to increase investment return. Leverage risks include potential for higher volatility, greater decline of the fund's net asset value and fluctuations of dividends and distributions paid by the fund.

The performance data quoted represents past performance, which does not guarantee future results.  The investment return and principal value of an investment in the Fund will fluctuate so that an investor's shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than the original cost.  Current performance and expense ratios may be lower or higher than the data quoted.  Fund returns include changes in share price, reinvested distributions, and a 5.75% maximum sales charge where indicated.  Returns do not consider capital gains or income taxes on an individual's investment.
↩


B. 
There is no guarantee of the payment of any dividend or other distributions at any level.
↩


C. 
"Year to Date" returns are cumulative, not annualized, and do not reflect sales charges (if sales charges are applicable to the Fund).  These returns would be lower if sales charges were taken into consideration.  Short-term returns may not be indicative of longer-term performance, which should also be considered when making investment decisions.
↩


D. 
Daily net asset value and dollar change of the fund is as of the previous business day's closing. Fund net asset values are updated at approximately 7:00pm ET daily.
↩


E. 
OppenheimerFunds' equity style box is based on the portfolio's overall targeted capitalization range and relative valuation as determined by OFI.
