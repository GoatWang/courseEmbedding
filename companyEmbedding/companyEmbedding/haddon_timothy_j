 Educational Background



Bachelor of Science in Mining Engineering 


Colorado School of Mines

                  Colorado School of Mines is a public research university devoted to engineering and applied science. It has the highest admissions standards of any public university in Colorado and among the highest of any public university in the U.S.

Mines has distinguished itself by developing a curriculum and research program geared towards responsible stewardship of the earth and its resources. In addition to strong education and research programs in traditional fields of science and engineering, Mines is one of a very few institutions in the world having broad expertise in resource exploration, extraction, production and utilization. As such, Mines occupies a unique position among the world's institutions of higher education.

Since its founding in 1874, the translation of the school's mission into educational programs has been influenced by the needs of society. Those needs are now focused more clearly than ever before. The world faces a crisis in balancing resource availability with environmental protection and Mines and its programs are central to the solution.

Mines offers all the advantages of a world-class research institution with a size that allows for personal attention.

			Mr. Haddon joined our Board in May 2007, and became our Chair in October 2013. He had previously served as our Lead Director since December 2007. Mr. Haddon is currently the President, Chief Executive Officer, a director and 50% owner of International Natural Resource Management Co., a private company which has invested in and provided consulting services to the mining industry. He has held those positions since 2002. From August 2014 to June 2015, he served on the board of directors of Midway Gold Corp., a mining company listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange (the "TSX") and the NYSE MKT LLC. He served as a director of Alacer Gold Corp. (previously named Anatolia Minerals Development Limited), a gold mining company listed on the Toronto and Australian Stock Exchanges, from September 1998 to September 2013 and served as its Chairman from May 2003 to February 2011 and again from August 2011 to September 2013. From April 2010 to December 2013, Mr. Haddon served as a director of International Tower Hill Mines Ltd., a mining company listed on the TSX, and from May 2009 to December 2013, he served on the advisory board of Pala Investments AG, a fund focused on investments associated with the mining industry. He has served as a director of publicly traded companies since 1989, and has held the position of CEO at multiple mining companies including Amax Gold Inc., where he served as the 
President and Chief Executive Officer from 1989 to 1993. Mr. Haddon serves on the Board of Trustees of the Colorado School of Mines, where he obtained a Bachelor of Science in Mining Engineering.
We believe Mr. Haddon's qualifications to sit on our Board of Directors include his CEO experience, his extensive experience as a public company director, his educational training as a mining engineer, and his more than 40 years of experience working in the mining industry with numerous public mining, development and exploration companies.
