Clayton Holdings Names Paul Bossidy CEO




      Long-Time Top GE Executive Brings Operating and Investment Experience
    





October 21, 2008 08:30 AM Eastern Daylight Time



SHELTON, Conn.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Clayton Holdings, Inc. announced today that it has named Paul T. Bossidy 
      its new Chief Executive Officer, effective immediately. Clayton is a 
      leading provider of asset management and infrastructure to the mortgage 
      investment industry.
    

      Mr. Bossidy, 48, joins Clayton having spent a long and successful career 
      with General Electric Company, where he served as President and Chief 
      Executive Officer at numerous GE divisions including: GE Capital 
      Solutions; GE Commercial Equipment Financing; GE Vendor Financial 
      Services; and GE Lighting North America. More recently, Mr. Bossidy was 
      a Senior Operating Executive at the private equity firm Cerberus Capital 
      Management, L.P. Prior to that, he had been with Prudential Investment 
      Corporation and Coopers & Lybrand LLP.
    

      This past July, an investment fund managed by Greenfield Partners, LLC, 
      a Norwalk-based private equity firm specializing in real estate, 
      acquired Clayton Holdings.
    

      Eugene A. Gorab, President and Chief Executive Officer at Greenfield 
      Partners, said: "We are pleased and flattered that Paul Bossidy has 
      joined Clayton as its new CEO. Paul is a highly respected industry 
      leader with a combination of unmatched operating and investment 
      experience that will be critically important as Clayton provides 
      valuable services to the troubled mortgage industry and as we build for 
      Clayton’s future.”


      Mr. Bossidy said, “This is an exciting time to 
      be joining Clayton. The company possesses an unusually talented group of 
      professionals whose skills are vital to the demands of our strong and 
      loyal client base. Moreover, despite the challenges facing the real 
      estate industry today, we are taking maximum advantage of the 
      opportunities that presently exist and, equally important, positioning 
      ourselves to deploy our capabilities in innovative and creative ways 
      that will benefit our customers and investors as we look confidently to 
      the future.”


      Mr. Bossidy replaces Frank P. Filipps who left the company in July to 
      pursue other interests.
