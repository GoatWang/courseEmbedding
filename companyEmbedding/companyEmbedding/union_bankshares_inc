RICHMOND, Va., May  22, 2017  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Union Bankshares Corporation (NASDAQ:UBSH) or ("Union") and Xenith Bankshares, Inc. (NASDAQ:XBKS) or ("Xenith") jointly announced today that they have entered into a definitive merger agreement for Union to acquire Xenith in an all-stock transaction.  Combining the two organizations will create the preeminent community banking franchise in Virginia and expand Union's retail footprint into North Carolina and Maryland. 























Based on financial data as of March 31, 2017, the combined company would have total assets of $11.9 billion, total deposits of $9.2 billion and gross loans of $8.9 billion.  This transaction strengthens Union's presence in Virginia's second most populous market, Hampton Roads / Virginia Beach, and adds to its Richmond and Northern Virginia footprints.  After systems integration, on a pro forma basis, Union will have the fourth largest branch network in Virginia and will remain the only community bank with a statewide footprint across the Commonwealth.
"We are excited about the opportunity to bring our companies together to enhance our product and customer service capabilities," said Raymond D. Smoot, Jr., Chairman of Union Bankshares Corporation's Board of Directors.  "We believe that our two companies are stronger together and the combination gives Union a unique franchise to create long term shareholder value."
"We expect that our combined statewide footprint will bring additional convenience to our customers and position us as a strong competitor against large regional institutions and smaller community banks alike - making us the preeminent community bank in Virginia," said John C. Asbury, President and Chief Executive Officer of Union.  "The combination with Xenith delivers on our stated priorities for this year as well as our acquisition goals enabling Union to efficiently cross the $10 billion asset threshold.  Xenith brings extensive commercial and industrial lending expertise as they were built as a C&I platform focusing on Richmond and Northern Virginia and subsequently added an extensive branch network through the combination with the Bank of Hampton Roads. Deepening our presence in Hampton Roads and adding to our Richmond and Northern Virginia network were priorities for Union and we're also able to gain retail entry points in North Carolina and Maryland.  With a more diverse loan portfolio, lower loan to deposit ratio and efficiencies gained, I believe the combined franchise will be able to generate sustainable top-tier financial performance for our shareholders."
"This transaction delivers on Xenith's original vision to be an integral part of creating the preeminent commercial bank headquartered in the Commonwealth of Virginia," said T. Gaylon Layfield, III, Chief Executive Officer for Xenith. "With a statewide presence, strong pro forma capital ratios, enhanced retail delivery system and focused commercial banking capabilities, the combined company will be positioned to deliver value to our customers.  Both banks are committed to attracting the best talent available and building a culture that encourages and enables that talent to better serve our customers and to be effective in setting the combined company apart from the competition.  I look forward to working with our new teammates to deliver on this exciting vision."
Following the closing of the merger Asbury will continue as President and CEO of the combined organization, and Layfield will serve for a transitional period as Executive Vice Chairman of Union Bank & Trust working to ensure a successful integration and enhancing the commercial banking strategy.  Following the closing of the merger, the Union Board of Directors will expand to 20 members, and will be composed of 18 members from the current Union Board and two members from the Xenith Board.  Smoot will continue to serve as Chairman of the Board of combined company. 
Under the terms of the merger agreement, each outstanding share of Xenith common stock will be converted into the right to receive 0.9354 shares of Union common stock.  This implies a deal value per share of $29.67 per share of Xenith common stock or approximately $701.2 million in the aggregate based on Union's closing stock price of $31.72 on May 19, 2017.  Shareholders owning more than 4.9% of Xenith common stock will, after the closing of the merger, be subject to a restriction on the sale of their Union shares for 60 days.
In consideration of the merger, extensive due diligence was performed by both companies over a six-week period.  The merger agreement has been approved by the board of directors of each company.  The companies expect to complete the transaction in early January 2018, subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions, including regulatory and shareholder approvals.
Keefe, Bruyette and Woods, Inc. is acting as the financial advisor to Union and Troutman Sanders LLP is acting as its legal advisor in the transaction. Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P. is acting as financial advisor to Xenith and Hunton & Williams LLP is acting as its legal advisor in the transaction.

Forward-Looking StatementsCertain statements in this press release may constitute "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements are statements that include projections, predictions, expectations, or beliefs about future events or results or otherwise are not statements of historical fact, are based on certain assumptions as of the time they are made, and are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties, some of which cannot be predicted or quantified. Such statements are often characterized by the use of qualified words (and their derivatives) such as "expect," "believe," "estimate," "plan," "project," "anticipate," "intend," "will," "may," "view," "opportunity," "potential," or words of similar meaning or other statements concerning opinions or judgment of Union or Xenith or their management about future events. Such statements include statements as to the anticipated benefits of the merger, including future financial and operating results, cost savings and enhanced revenues as well as other statements regarding the merger. Although each of Union and Xenith believes that its expectations with respect to forward-looking statements are based upon reasonable assumptions within the bounds of its existing knowledge of its business and operations, there can be no assurance that actual results, performance, or achievements of Union or Xenith will not differ materially from any projected future results, performance, or achievements expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. Actual future results and trends may differ materially from historical results or those anticipated depending on a variety of factors, including but not limited to: (1) the businesses of Union and Xenith may not be integrated successfully or such integration may be more difficult, time-consuming or costly than expected; (2) expected revenue synergies and cost savings from the merger may not be fully realized or realized within the expected time frame; (3) revenues following the merger may be lower than expected; (4) customer and employee relationships and business operations may be disrupted by the merger; (5) the ability to obtain required regulatory and shareholder approvals, and the ability to complete the merger on the expected timeframe may be more difficult, time-consuming or costly than expected; (6) changes in interest rates, general economic conditions, tax rates, legislative/regulatory changes, monetary and fiscal policies of the U.S. government, including policies of the U.S. Treasury and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System; the quality and composition of the loan and securities portfolios; demand for loan products; deposit flows; competition; demand for financial services in the companies' respective market areas; their implementation of new technologies; their ability to develop and maintain secure and reliable electronic systems; and accounting principles, policies, and guidelines, and (7) other risk factors detailed from time to time in filings made by Union or Xenith with the SEC. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made and Union and Xenith undertake no obligation to update or clarify these forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.

The Exchange Traded Funds prospectus contains its investment objectives, risks, charges, expenses and other important information you should read and consider carefully prior to making an investment decision.
        Please review the current prospectus, available from the Prospectus link on www.motifinvesting.com, by phone at 1-855-586-6843, or in writing at Motif Investing, Inc., P.O. Box 3548, Rancho Cordova, CA  95741.
ETFs have unique features that you should be aware of, which can include distribution of any gains, risks related to securities within the portfolio, and tax consequences. The data quoted herein represents past performance and is not indicative of future results. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate so that your investment, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original value. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance data provided.  Please review the prospectus or other research tools provided on this site for more recent information. Contact Motif Investing at 1-855-586-6843 to obtain the most recent month-end performance data.
The 30-Day SEC Yield reflects the dividends and interest earned during the past 30 days after the deduction of the ETF’s expenses.  The 30-day SEC Yield is an annual percentage rate based on the ETF's share price and is calculated by dividing the net investment income per share for the 30 days ended on the date of calculation by that day’s maximum share price.  The Distribution Yield is the trailing 12-Month End Yield derived by adding the trailing 12-month's income distributions and dividing the total by the last month's ending share price. Income refers to interest payments from fixed-income ETFs and dividend payments from stock-based ETFs.
The ETF prospectus is provided by DFS (http://www.rrdonnelley.com/financial-services/). The use of this prospectus is restricted solely to the website of Motif Investing and may not be redistributed, copied or otherwise made available without the express written consent of DFS. Donnelley Financial, LLC. d/b/a EDGAR Online and the information providers herein make no claims concerning the validity of the information provided hereby and will not be held liable for any use of this information. The information provided herein may be displayed and printed for your internal use only and may not reproduced, retransmitted, distributed, disseminated, sold, published, broadcast or circulated to anyone without the express written consent of Donnelley Financial, LLC. d/b/a EDGAR Online.


Fixed income investments are subject to various unique risks, including changes in credit quality, market valuations, liquidity, prepayments, early redemption,
    corporate events, tax ramifications, and other factors. Fixed income securities are subject to increased loss of principal during periods of rising interest rates.


The 1-Year Return/Return Since Inception indicates the performance of this particular motif over the last 12 months or, if the motif was created within the past 12 months, since the date the motif was created. See how we calculate returns.


The Motif Index level represents the performance of a benchmark motif (a motif in our catalog) over time. It is set at 
1000 on the date of inception of the motif. For example, a Motif Index of 1100 represents a 10% return since inception. Similarly, the change in the Index over a 
specified period represents the period return on the portfolio holding the same share weights as the benchmark motif.
The Motif Index is a measure created and maintained by the firm, which has the discretion to change the holdings that comprise the index and to make alterations to a particular Motif Index.


Popularity shows you how much interest a motif is attracting, compared to other motifs. We base this score on a proprietary formula that uses factors like how many people are viewing the motif, and how much conversation about it is happening in the community, in a range from Low-to-High.
The Volatility measurement for a Motif represents the annualized standard deviation of daily returns on a portfolio holding the same share weights as the Motif, and is measured in a range from Low to High. Since the standard deviation of returns are commonly used as a measure of portfolio risk, a Volatility measurement that is High is indicative of the fact that holding the motif in the past subjected the holder to larger fluctuations or higher risk.
The Valuation metric represents the present valuation of the stocks in the motif relative to the broader equity market. The Valuation metric is calculated as the composite Price-to-Earnings ratio for the stocks in the motif weighted by their respective share weights in a range from Low to High.


Standard pricing: $9.95 total commission per motif transaction. Other fees may apply. For details on fees and commissions, please   
    click here.

        Performance returns indicate the performance of a particular security over that stated period of time as of the date provided. Performance is quoted for informational purposes only, however, there is no guarantee those returns will continue. See how we calculate returns.
    

        Performance returns, including 1-month Return/Return Since Inception/1-year returns indicates the performance of this particular motif over that stated period of time as of the date provided. Performance is quoted for informational purposes only, however, there is no guarantee those returns will continue. See how we calculate returns.
    
System response time and account access times may vary due to a variety of factors, including trading volumes, market conditions, system performance, and other factors.
Time shown in Eastern Time unless otherwise specified.


The data contained herein from third party providers is obtained from what are considered reliable sources. However, it's accuracy, completeness, or reliability cannot be guaranteed. 


Investing in securities involves risks, you should be aware of prior to making an investment decision, including the possible loss of principal. An investment in individual stocks, or a collection of stocks
    focused on a particular theme or idea, such as a motif, may be subject to increased risk of price fluctuation over more diversified holdings due to adverse developments which can affect a particular industry or sector.
    Investments in ETFs can include those with a narrow or targeted investment strategy and can be subject to similar sector risks than more broadly diversified investments.
    Motif makes no representation regarding the suitability of a particular investment or investment strategy.  You are responsible for all investment decisions you make including understanding the risks involved with your
    investment strategy.   


Please refer to your personal Motif Social Network privacy settings to verify they are current according to your personal requirements. You are responsible
     for establishing your privacy settings according to your unique needs and ensuring they remain current, accurate, and based on your individual and self-directed
     instructions. You should refer to the Terms of Use for further information regarding your authorized use of the Motif Social Network, available on the Support

International investments involve additional risks you should be aware of, which include differences in financial accounting standards,
    currency fluctuations, political instability, foreign taxes and regulations, news that can trigger volatile conditions, and the potential 
    for illiquid markets. Small cap companies in these markets may react with greater volatility in reaction to activities in those markets.

Union Bankshares Corporation Announces Agreement to Acquire Xenith Bankshares, Inc.




















May 22, 2017 08:00 ET

 | Source: Union Bankshares Corporation






RICHMOND, Va., May  22, 2017  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Union Bankshares Corporation (NASDAQ:UBSH) or (“Union”) and Xenith Bankshares, Inc. (NASDAQ:XBKS) or (“Xenith”) jointly announced today that they have entered into a definitive merger agreement for Union to acquire Xenith in an all-stock transaction.  Combining the two organizations will create the preeminent community banking franchise in Virginia and expand Union’s retail footprint into North Carolina and Maryland.  Based on financial data as of March 31, 2017, the combined company would have total assets of $11.9 billion, total deposits of $9.2 billion and gross loans of $8.9 billion.  This transaction strengthens Union’s presence in Virginia’s second most populous market, Hampton Roads / Virginia Beach, and adds to its Richmond and Northern Virginia footprints.  After systems integration, on a pro forma basis, Union will have the fourth largest branch network in Virginia and will remain the only community bank with a statewide footprint across the Commonwealth. “We are excited about the opportunity to bring our companies together to enhance our product and customer service capabilities,” said Raymond D. Smoot, Jr., Chairman of Union Bankshares Corporation’s Board of Directors.  “We believe that our two companies are stronger together and the combination gives Union a unique franchise to create long term shareholder value.” “We expect that our combined statewide footprint will bring additional convenience to our customers and position us as a strong competitor against large regional institutions and smaller community banks alike – making us the preeminent community bank in Virginia,” said John C. Asbury, President and Chief Executive Officer of Union.  “The combination with Xenith delivers on our stated priorities for this year as well as our acquisition goals enabling Union to efficiently cross the $10 billion asset threshold.  Xenith brings extensive commercial and industrial lending expertise as they were built as a C&I platform focusing on Richmond and Northern Virginia and subsequently added an extensive branch network through the combination with the Bank of Hampton Roads. Deepening our presence in Hampton Roads and adding to our Richmond and Northern Virginia network were priorities for Union and we’re also able to gain retail entry points in North Carolina and Maryland.  With a more diverse loan portfolio, lower loan to deposit ratio and efficiencies gained, I believe the combined franchise will be able to generate sustainable top-tier financial performance for our shareholders.” “This transaction delivers on Xenith’s original vision to be an integral part of creating the preeminent commercial bank headquartered in the Commonwealth of Virginia,” said T. Gaylon Layfield, III, Chief Executive Officer for Xenith. “With a statewide presence, strong pro forma capital ratios, enhanced retail delivery system and focused commercial banking capabilities, the combined company will be positioned to deliver value to our customers.  Both banks are committed to attracting the best talent available and building a culture that encourages and enables that talent to better serve our customers and to be effective in setting the combined company apart from the competition.  I look forward to working with our new teammates to deliver on this exciting vision.” Following the closing of the merger Asbury will continue as President and CEO of the combined organization, and Layfield will serve for a transitional period as Executive Vice Chairman of Union Bank & Trust working to ensure a successful integration and enhancing the commercial banking strategy.  Following the closing of the merger, the Union Board of Directors will expand to 20 members, and will be composed of 18 members from the current Union Board and two members from the Xenith Board.  Smoot will continue to serve as Chairman of the Board of combined company.  Under the terms of the merger agreement, each outstanding share of Xenith common stock will be converted into the right to receive 0.9354 shares of Union common stock.  This implies a deal value per share of $29.67 per share of Xenith common stock or approximately $701.2 million in the aggregate based on Union’s closing stock price of $31.72 on May 19, 2017.  Shareholders owning more than 4.9% of Xenith common stock will, after the closing of the merger, be subject to a restriction on the sale of their Union shares for 60 days. In consideration of the merger, extensive due diligence was performed by both companies over a six-week period.  The merger agreement has been approved by the board of directors of each company.  The companies expect to complete the transaction in early January 2018, subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions, including regulatory and shareholder approvals. Keefe, Bruyette and Woods, Inc. is acting as the financial advisor to Union and Troutman Sanders LLP is acting as its legal advisor in the transaction. Sandler O’Neill + Partners, L.P. is acting as financial advisor to Xenith and Hunton & Williams LLP is acting as its legal advisor in the transaction.

Forward-Looking StatementsCertain statements in this press release may constitute “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements are statements that include projections, predictions, expectations, or beliefs about future events or results or otherwise are not statements of historical fact, are based on certain assumptions as of the time they are made, and are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties, some of which cannot be predicted or quantified. Such statements are often characterized by the use of qualified words (and their derivatives) such as “expect,” “believe,” “estimate,” “plan,” “project,” “anticipate,” “intend,” “will,” “may,” “view,” “opportunity,” “potential,” or words of similar meaning or other statements concerning opinions or judgment of Union or Xenith or their management about future events. Such statements include statements as to the anticipated benefits of the merger, including future financial and operating results, cost savings and enhanced revenues as well as other statements regarding the merger. Although each of Union and Xenith believes that its expectations with respect to forward-looking statements are based upon reasonable assumptions within the bounds of its existing knowledge of its business and operations, there can be no assurance that actual results, performance, or achievements of Union or Xenith will not differ materially from any projected future results, performance, or achievements expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. Actual future results and trends may differ materially from historical results or those anticipated depending on a variety of factors, including but not limited to: (1) the businesses of Union and Xenith may not be integrated successfully or such integration may be more difficult, time-consuming or costly than expected; (2) expected revenue synergies and cost savings from the merger may not be fully realized or realized within the expected time frame; (3) revenues following the merger may be lower than expected; (4) customer and employee relationships and business operations may be disrupted by the merger; (5) the ability to obtain required regulatory and shareholder approvals, and the ability to complete the merger on the expected timeframe may be more difficult, time-consuming or costly than expected; (6) changes in interest rates, general economic conditions, tax rates, legislative/regulatory changes, monetary and fiscal policies of the U.S. government, including policies of the U.S. Treasury and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System; the quality and composition of the loan and securities portfolios; demand for loan products; deposit flows; competition; demand for financial services in the companies’ respective market areas; their implementation of new technologies; their ability to develop and maintain secure and reliable electronic systems; and accounting principles, policies, and guidelines, and (7) other risk factors detailed from time to time in filings made by Union or Xenith with the SEC. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made and Union and Xenith undertake no obligation to update or clarify these forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.Contacts:
