	FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS



	 


	This quarterly report on Form 10-Q contains
	forward-looking statements regarding our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. Words such as “expects,”
	“anticipates,” “intends,” “plans,” “believes,” “seeks,” “estimates”
	and similar expressions or variations of such words are intended to identify forward-looking statements, but are not deemed to
	represent an all-inclusive means of identifying forward-looking statements as denoted in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q. Additionally,
	statements concerning future matters are forward-looking statements.


	 


	Although forward-looking statements in this
	quarterly report on Form 10-Q reflect the good faith judgment of our management, such statements can only be based on facts and
	factors currently known by us. Consequently, forward-looking statements are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties and actual
	results and outcomes may differ materially from the results and outcomes discussed in or anticipated by the forward-looking statements.
	Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences in results and outcomes include, without limitation, those specifically
	addressed in “Risk Factors” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results
	of Operations” in our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015, in “Management’s
	Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q and in other
	reports that we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). You are urged not to place undue reliance
	on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this quarterly report on Form 10-Q.


	 


	We file reports with the SEC. The SEC maintains
	a website (www.sec.gov) that contains reports, proxy and information statements, and other information regarding issuers that file
	electronically with the SEC, including us. You can also read and copy any materials we file with, or furnish to, the SEC at the
	SEC’s Public Reference Room at 100 F Street, NE, Washington, DC 20549. You can obtain additional information about the operation
	of the Public Reference Room by calling the SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330.


	 


	We undertake no obligation to revise or update
	any forward-looking statements in order to reflect any event or circumstance that may arise after the date of this quarterly report
	on Form 10-Q, except as required by law. Readers are urged to carefully review and consider the various disclosures made throughout
	the entirety of this quarterly report, which are designed to advise interested parties of the risks and factors that may affect
	our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.

	PETROGRESS, INC.






	NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS




	 




	Note 1 -

	Organization




	 


	Petrogress, Inc. (the “Company”
	or “Petrogress”) was originally formed in the State of Florida under the name 800 Commerce, Inc. (“800 Commerce”)
	on February 10, 2010. The Company was founded for the purpose of marketing credit card processing services on behalf of merchant
	payment processing service providers.


	 


	On February 29, 2016, 800 Commerce entered
	into a Securities Exchange Agreement (the “SEA”) with an unrelated third party, Petrogres Co. Limited (“Petrogres”),
	a Marshall Islands corporation, and its sole shareholder. The Company acquired 100% of Petrogres and its affiliated companies.
	As consideration for the acquisition of Petrogres, the Company issued 136,000,000 shares of its common stock, in restricted form,
	representing 85% of the issued and outstanding shares of the Company’s common stock at closing of the transaction. The SEA
	has been accounted for as a reverse acquisition and recapitalization of the Company whereby Petrogres is deemed to be the accounting
	acquirer (legal acquiree) and the Company to be the accounting acquiree (legal acquirer).  The accompanying consolidated
	financial statements are in substance those of Petrogres and its subsidiaries, with the assets and liabilities, and revenues and
	expenses, of the Company being included effective from the date of stock exchange transaction.  The Company is deemed
	to be a continuation of the business of Petrogres and its subsidiaries.  Accordingly, the financial position, results
	of operations, and cash flows of the Petrogres (accounting acquirer) for all periods presented as if the recapitalization had occurred
	at the beginning of the earliest period presented and the operations of the accounting acquiree from the date of stock exchange
	transaction.


	 


	As part of the transaction, the sole shareholder
	and CEO of Petrogres, Christos Traios, was appointed to the Board of Directors and B. Michael Friedman resigned as an officer and
	director. In addition, the Company’s Board of Directors (the “Board”) approved an amendment to the Company’s
	Articles of Incorporation, increasing the authorized capital to 490,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.001 and 10,000,000
	shares of preferred stock, par value $0.001.


	 


	On March 9, 2016, the Company’s Board
	approved an amendment to the Company’s Articles of Incorporation to change the name of the Corporation to Petrogress, Inc.


	 


	Petrogres and its’ subsidiaries business
	operations includes purchasing, at the scene of mining and extraction, crude oil product to be loaded onto company ships for transport
	of product either directly to customers or to independent processing refineries, with the company acting internationally as it
	has been in business for seven (7) years.

	Note 2 -

	Summary of Significant Accounting
	Policies




	 




	Basis of Presentation




	 


	These interim condensed consolidated financial
	statements have been prepared on the same basis as the annual financial statements and in the opinion of management, reflect all
	adjustments, which include only normal recurring adjustments, necessary to present fairly the Company's financial position, results
	of operations and cash flows for the periods shown. The results of operations for such periods are not necessarily indicative
	of the results expected for a full year or for any future period.


	  




	Emerging Growth Company




	 


	We qualify as an “emerging
	growth company” under the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the “JOBS Act”). Section 107 of the JOBS
	Act provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B)
	of the Securities Act of 1933 as amended (the “Securities Act”) for complying with new or revised accounting standards.
	As an emerging growth company, we can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise
	apply to private companies. We have elected to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period.


	 




	Cash and Cash Equivalents




	 


	The Company considers all highly liquid investments
	with an original term of three months or less to be cash equivalents.






	 






	Accounts Receivable




	 


	The Company and its
	affiliates are engaged primarily in the purchase, transport and processing of oil and petroleum products. The Company
	performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers' financial condition and, generally, requires no collateral from its
	customers. Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of
	temporary cash investments and trade accounts receivables. The Company places its temporary cash investments with financial
	institutions and limits the amount of credit exposure to any one financial institution. Concentrations of credit risk with
	respect to trade receivables are limited due to the short payment terms dictated by the industry and operating environment.
	See Note 4 for concentrations of credit risk as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.




	 












	 



	6



	 







	 






	Inventory




	 


	The Company's inventory, which
	consists primarily of crude oil purchases on the vessel in transport, is valued at the lower of cost or market using the mark-to-market
	method of valuation.




	 






	Marketable Securities




	 


	The Company classifies its marketable securities
	as available-for-sale securities, which are carried at their fair value based on the quoted market prices of the securities with
	unrealized gains and losses, net of deferred income taxes, reported as accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), a separate
	component of stockholders’ equity. Realized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities are included in net earnings
	in the period earned or incurred.


	 






	Property and Equipment






	 




	Fixed assets consisted of the following as of September
	30, 2016 and December 31, 2015:


	 




	 


	 


	2016

	Less: accumulated depreciation


	 


	 


	(3,999,073


	)


	 


	 


	(3,491,000


	)

	6,144,000


	 





	 


	Property and equipment are stated at cost,
	and depreciation is provided by use of straight-line methods over the estimated useful lives of the assets. The estimated useful
	lives of property and equipment are as follows:


	 




	Vessels


	15 years




	Office equipment and furniture


	10 years




	Computer hardware


	5 years




	 


	Depreciation expense of $170,882 and $165,875
	was recorded for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Depreciation expense of $505,759 and $497,625
	was recorded for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.


	 










	 



	7



	 







	 






	Revenue Recognition




	 


	The Company recognizes revenues after product
	is delivered to contracted customer. Product in transit at the end of an accounting period is recorded at an estimated value which
	is adjusted upon load certification. The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board
	(“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 605, Revenue Recognition. ASC 605 requires that the
	following four basic criteria are met (1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, (2) delivery of products and services has
	occurred, (3) the fee is fixed or determinable and (4) collectability is reasonably assured. The Company recognizes revenue during
	the month in which commissions are earned.




	 










	Fair Value of Financial Instruments




	 


	Fair value measurements are determined under
	a three-level hierarchy for fair value measurements that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value,
	distinguishing between market participant assumptions developed based on market data obtained from sources independent of the reporting
	entity (“observable inputs”) and the reporting entity’s own assumptions about market participant assumptions
	developed based on the best information available in the circumstances (“unobservable inputs”). Fair value is the price
	that would be received to sell an asset or would be paid to transfer a liability (i.e., the “exit price”) in an orderly
	transaction between market participants at the measurement date. In determining fair value, the Company primarily uses prices and
	other relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets (“market approach”).
	The Company also considers the impact of a significant decrease in volume and level of activity for an asset or liability when
	compared with normal activity to identify transactions that are not orderly.


	 


	The highest priority is given to unadjusted
	quoted prices in active markets for identical assets (Level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level
	3 measurements). Securities are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair
	value measurement.


	 


	The three hierarchy levels are defined
	as follows:


	 


	Level 1 - Quoted prices
	in active markets that is unadjusted and accessible at the measurement date for identical, unrestricted assets or liabilities;


	 


	Level 2 - Quoted prices
	for identical assets and liabilities in markets that are not active, quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active
	markets or financial instruments for which significant inputs are observable, either directly or indirectly;


	 


	Level 3 - Prices or
	valuations that require inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable.


	 


	Credit risk adjustments are applied to reflect
	the Company’s own credit risk when valuing all liabilities measured at fair value. The methodology is consistent with that
	applied in developing counterparty credit risk adjustments, but incorporates the Company’s own credit risk as observed in
	the credit default swap market.


	 








	 



	8



	 







	 




	The Company's financial instruments consist
	primarily of cash, accounts receivable, inventory, marketable securities, accounts payable and accrued expenses and convertible
	debt. The carrying amount of the Company’s accounts payable approximate fair value to their short term. Marketable securities
	are adjusted to fair value each balance sheet date, based on quoted prices; which are considered level 1 inputs (see Note 6). The
	Company’s derivative liability is valued using the level 3 inputs (see Note 7). The estimated fair value is not necessarily
	indicative of the amounts the Company would realize in a current market exchange or from future earnings or cash flows.


	 


	The following table represents the Company’s
	financial instruments that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of September 30, 2016 for each fair value hierarchy
	level:

	The carrying amount of the Company’s
	accounts payable approximate fair value to their short term.


	 




	Earnings (Loss) Per Share




	 


	The Company reports earnings (loss) per share
	in accordance with ASC 260, "Earnings per Share." Basic earnings (loss) per share is computed by dividing net income
	(loss), after deducting preferred stock dividends accumulated during the period, by the weighted-average number of shares of common
	stock outstanding during each period. Diluted earnings per share is computed by dividing income by the weighted-average number
	of shares of common stock, common stock equivalents and other potentially dilutive securities outstanding during the period. Potentially
	dilutive securities for the periods ended September 30, 2016 includes the Company’s outstanding convertible debt that is
	convertible into approximately 3,457,551 shares of common stock.








	 






	Accounting for Stock-based Compensation 




	 


	The Company accounts for stock awards issued
	to non-employees in accordance with ASC 505-50, Equity-Based Payments to Non-Employees. The measurement date is the earlier of
	(1) the date at which a commitment for performance by the counterparty to earn the equity instruments is reached, or (2) the date
	at which the counterparty's performance is complete. Stock awards granted to non-employees are valued at their respective measurement
	dates based on the trading price of the Company’s common stock and recognized as expense during the period in which services
	are provided.


	 




	Use of Estimates




	 


	The preparation of financial statements in
	conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities
	and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues
	and expenses during the reported period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.


	 












	 



	9



	 







	 






	Income Taxes




	 


	The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance
	with ASC 740-10, Income Taxes. The Company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities to reflect the estimated future tax effects,
	calculated at the tax rate expected to be in effect at the time of realization. The Company records a valuation allowance related
	to a deferred tax asset when it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. Deferred
	tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of the changes in tax laws and rates of the date of enactment.


	 


	ASC 740-10 prescribes a recognition threshold
	that a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements and provides guidance on recognition,
	measurement, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition issues. The Company
	classifies interest and penalties as a component of interest and other expenses. To date, the Company has not been assessed, nor
	has the Company paid, any interest or penalties.


	 


	The Company measures and records uncertain
	tax positions by establishing a threshold for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected
	to be taken in a tax return. Only tax positions meeting the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold at the effective date may
	be recognized or continue to be recognized. The Company’s tax years subsequent to 2010 remain subject to examination by federal
	and state tax jurisdictions.


	 




	Comprehensive Income




	 


	The Company has adopted ASC Topic 220, "Comprehensive
	Income." This statement establishes standards for reporting comprehensive income and its components in a financial statement.
	Comprehensive income as defined includes all changes in equity (net assets) during a period from non-owner sources. Items included
	in the Company’s comprehensive loss consist of unrealized losses on available-for-sale securities.


	 



	Note 3 -

	Recent Accounting Pronouncements




	 


	Accounting standards that have been issued
	or proposed by the FASB or other standards-setting bodies that do not require adoption until a future date are not expected to
	have a material impact on the financial statements upon adoption.

	Note 5 -

	Convertible Notes Payable





	 



	Effective with the SEA, Petrogres assumed and
	acquired two convertible promissory notes that were issued to Mammoth Corporation (“Mammoth”). Mammoth Note 1 had a
	balance of $31,339 and Mammoth Note 2 had a balance of $38,280. Mammoth Note 1 and Mammoth Note 2 are referred to as the Mammoth
	Notes. The Mammoth Notes became due on September 9, 2016.


	 


	The Company determined that the conversion
	feature of the Mammoth Notes represent an embedded derivative since the Notes are convertible into a variable number of shares
	upon conversion. Accordingly, the Mammoth Notes were not considered to be conventional debt under EITF 00-19 and the embedded conversion
	feature was bifurcated from the debt host and accounted for as a derivative liability. Accordingly, the fair value of these derivative
	instruments being recorded as a liability on the consolidated balance sheet with the corresponding amount recorded as a discount
	to each Note. Such discount is being amortized from the date of issuance to the maturity dates of the Notes. The change in the
	fair value of the liability for derivative contracts are recorded in other income or expenses in the consolidated statements of
	operations at the end of each quarter, with the offset to the derivative liability on the balance sheet. The embedded feature included
	in the Mammoth Notes resulted in a debt discount of $48,975 on the date the Mammoth Notes were assumed and a derivative liability
	of $300,321.


	 


	A summary of the derivative liability balance
	of the Mammoth Notes as of September 30, 2016 is as follows:

	Note 8 -

	Income Taxes




	 


	Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects
	of operating loss and tax credit carry forwards and temporary differences between carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for
	financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets,
	management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.
	The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in
	which temporary differences representing net future deductible amounts become deductible. Due to the uncertainty of the Company’s
	ability to realize the benefit of the deferred tax assets, the deferred tax assets are fully offset by a valuation allowance at
	September 30, 2016.

	Operating Expenses



	 


	Total operating expenses for the three months
	ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were $1,452,756 and $1,262,966, respectively, an increase of $189,790, or approximately 15%.
	The increase in operating expenses is primarily due to increased administrative, US travel, legal and accounting expenses of in
	the aggregate of approximately $278,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016, as a result of the merger transaction. This
	increase was offset by lower fleet operating expenses due to the decrease in shipment of barrels from approximately 371,400
	in the 2015 period to 217,600 in the 2016 period.


	 


	Total operating expenses for the nine months
	ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were $3,878,235 and $3,433,956, respectively, an increase of $444,279, or approximately 12.9%.
	The increase in operating expenses is primarily due to increased administrative, US travel, legal and accounting expenses of in
	the aggregate of approximately $390,000 as a result of the merger transaction.


	 



	Net Income (loss)



	 


	Net loss for the three months ended September
	30, 2016 was $252,002 compared to $198,182 for the three months ended September 30, 2015 as a result of the increase in operating
	expenses being greater than the increase in gross profit the Company generated. Net income for the nine month periods ended September
	30, 2016 and 2015 was $577,385 and $775,350, respectively, as a result of the items discussed above.

	Liquidity and Capital Resources




	 


	Liquidity is the ability of a company to generate
	funds to support its current and future operations, satisfy its obligations, and otherwise operate on an ongoing basis. Our net
	income has been sufficient to meet our working capital requirements for the level of business we are currently experiencing.


	 


	Cash provided by operating activities was $515,567
	for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to cash used in operations of $196,321 for the nine months ended September
	30, 2015. The 2016 activity was a result of net income of $577,385, depreciation expense of $505,759, decreases of $149,514 in
	the fair value of derivative liabilities and net changes in assets and liabilities of $467,554. The 2015 activity was a result
	of net income of $775,350 and depreciation and amortization of $497,625 reduced by changes in assets and liabilities of $1,469,296.


	 


	Prior to the execution of the SEA (February
	29, 2016), the Company paid a dividend to the sole shareholder (at the time of the payment) of $1,800,000.


	 


	For the nine months ended September 30, 2016,
	cash and cash equivalents decreased by $1,742,588 compared to a decrease of $196,321 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.
	Ending cash and cash equivalents at September 30, 2016 was $139,717 compared to $330,335 at September 30, 2015.


	 


	We are not aware of any known trends or any
	known demands, commitments or events that will result in our liquidity increasing or decreasing in any material way. We are not
	aware of any matters that would have an impact on future operations.


	 


	Our liquidity may be negatively impacted by
	the significant costs associated with our public company reporting requirements, costs associated with newly applicable corporate
	governance requirements, including requirements under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and other rules implemented by the Securities
	and Exchange Commission. We expect all of these applicable rules and regulations to significantly increase our legal and financial
	compliance costs and to make some activities more time consuming and costly.

	Critical Accounting Policies



	 


	The preparation of financial statements
	in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“US GAAP”) requires our
	management to make assumptions, estimates, and judgments that affect the amounts reported, including the notes thereto, and related
	disclosures of commitments and contingencies, if any. We have identified certain accounting policies that are significant to the
	preparation of our financial statements. These accounting policies are important for an understanding of our financial condition
	and results of operations. Critical accounting policies are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition
	and results of operations and require management’s difficult, subjective, or complex judgment, often as a result of the
	need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods. Certain
	accounting estimates are particularly sensitive because of their significance to financial statements and because of the possibility
	that future events affecting the estimate may differ significantly from management’s current judgments. We believe the following
	critical accounting policies involve the most significant estimates and judgments used in the preparation of our financial
	statements.


	 




	Basis of Presentation




	 


	These interim condensed consolidated financial
	statements have been prepared on the same basis as the annual financial statements and in the opinion of management, reflect all
	adjustments, which include only normal recurring adjustments, necessary to present fairly the Company's financial position, results
	of operations and cash flows for the periods shown. The results of operations for such periods are not necessarily indicative of
	the results expected for a full year or for any future period. The financial statements included herein include the financial position
	and results of operations of the following affiliated entities (all incorporated in the Republic of the Marshall Islands):


	 


	Petrogres Co Ltd.


	Petronav LLC


	Shiba Ship Management Ltd.


	Danae Marine Ltd.


	Invictus Marine S. A.


	Entus Marine Ltd.


	 


	All intercompany balances and transactions
	have been eliminated in consolidation. The entities are affiliated through common ownership and control.


	 




	Cash and Cash Equivalents




	 


	The Company considers all highly liquid investments
	with an original term of three months or less to be cash equivalents.

	Accounts Receivable




	 


	The Company and its
	affiliates are engaged primarily in the purchase, transport and processing petroleum products. The Company performs ongoing
	credit evaluations of its customers' financial condition and, generally, requires no collateral from its customers. Financial
	instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of temporary cash
	investments and trade accounts receivables. The Company places its temporary cash investments with financial institutions and
	limits the amount of credit exposure to any one financial institution. Concentrations of credit risk with respect to trade
	receivables are limited due to the short payment terms dictated by the industry and operating environment. As of September
	30, 2016, three customers accounted for $1,849,690, or 73% of accounts receivable.




	 






	Inventory




	 


	The Company's inventory, which
	consists primarily of crude oil purchases on the vessel in transport, is valued at the lower of cost or market using the mark-to-market
	method of valuation.

	lives of property and equipment are as follows:


	 




	Vessels


	15 years




	Office equipment and furniture


	10 years




	Computer hardware


	5 years




	 


	Depreciation expense of $505,759 and $497,625
	was recorded for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

	Revenue Recognition




	 


	The Company recognizes revenues when product
	is delivered to contracted customers. Product in transit at the end of an accounting period is recorded at an estimated value which
	is adjusted upon load certification. The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board
	(“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 605, Revenue Recognition. ASC 605 requires that the
	following four basic criteria are met (1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, (2) delivery of products and services has
	occurred, (3) the fee is fixed or determinable and (4) collectability is reasonably assured.




	 






	Fair Value of Financial Instruments




	 


	Fair value measurements are determined under
	a three-level hierarchy for fair value measurements that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value,
	distinguishing between market participant assumptions developed based on market data obtained from sources independent of the reporting
	entity (“observable inputs”) and the reporting entity’s own assumptions about market participant assumptions
	developed based on the best information available in the circumstances (“unobservable inputs”). Fair value is the price
	that would be received to sell an asset or would be paid to transfer a liability (i.e., the “exit price”) in an orderly
	transaction between market participants at the measurement date. In determining fair value, the Company primarily uses prices and
	other relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets (“market approach”).
	The Company also considers the impact of a significant decrease in volume and level of activity for an asset or liability when
	compared with normal activity to identify transactions that are not orderly.


	 


	The highest priority is given to unadjusted
	quoted prices in active markets for identical assets (Level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level
	3 measurements). Securities are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair
	value measurement.


	 


	The three hierarchy levels are defined
	as follows:


	 


	Level 1 - Quoted prices
	in active markets that is unadjusted and accessible at the measurement date for identical, unrestricted assets or liabilities;


	 


	Level 2 - Quoted prices
	for identical assets and liabilities in markets that are not active, quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active
	markets or financial instruments for which significant inputs are observable, either directly or indirectly;


	 


	Level 3 - Prices or
	valuations that require inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable.


	 


	Credit risk adjustments are applied to reflect
	the Company’s own credit risk when valuing all liabilities measured at fair value. The methodology is consistent with that
	applied in developing counterparty credit risk adjustments, but incorporates the Company’s own credit risk as observed in
	the credit default swap market.


	 


	The Company's financial instruments consist
	primarily of cash, accounts receivable, inventory, marketable securities, accounts payable and accrued expenses and convertible
	debt. The carrying amount of the Company’s accounts payable approximate fair value to their short term. Marketable securities
	are adjusted to fair value each balance sheet date, based on quoted prices; which are considered level 1 inputs (see Note 6). As
	of September 30, 2016 the Company’s marketable securities were $1,860. The Company’s derivative liability is valued
	using the level 3 inputs (see Note 7). The estimated fair value is not necessarily indicative of the amounts the Company would
	realize in a current market exchange or from future earnings or cash flows.


	 


	The following table represents the Company’s
	financial instruments that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of September 30, 2016 for each fair value hierarchy
	level:

	Earnings Per Share




	 


	The Company reports earnings per share in accordance
	with ASC 260, "Earnings per Share." Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing net income, after deducting preferred
	stock dividends accumulated during the period, by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during each
	period. Diluted earnings per share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock,
	common stock equivalents and other potentially dilutive securities outstanding during the period. Potentially dilutive securities
	for the periods ended September 30, 2016 includes the Company’s outstanding convertible debt that is convertible into approximately
	3,457,551 shares of common stock.


	 




	Income Taxes




	 


	The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance
	with ASC 740-10, Income Taxes. The Company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities to reflect the estimated future tax effects,
	calculated at the tax rate expected to be in effect at the time of realization. The Company records a valuation allowance related
	to a deferred tax asset when it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. Deferred
	tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of the changes in tax laws and rates of the date of enactment.


	 


	ASC 740-10 prescribes a recognition threshold
	that a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements and provides guidance on recognition,
	measurement, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition issues. The Company
	classifies interest and penalties as a component of interest and other expenses. To date, the Company has not been assessed, nor
	has the Company paid, any interest or penalties.


	 


	The Company measures and records uncertain
	tax positions by establishing a threshold for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected
	to be taken in a tax return. Only tax positions meeting the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold at the effective date may
	be recognized or continue to be recognized. The Company’s tax years subsequent to 2010 remain subject to examination by federal
	and state tax jurisdictions.



	 




	Use of Estimates



	 


	The preparation of financial statements in
	conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities,
	the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the period. Actual
	results could differ from those estimates. Significant matters requiring the use of estimates and assumptions include, but may
	not be limited to, accounts receivable allowances and evaluation of impairment of long lived assets and intangible assets. Management
	believes that its estimates and assumptions are reasonable, based on information that is available at the time they are made.



	 




	Depreciation




	 



	The Company’s vessels and other assets
	are depreciated using primarily the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives.

	Item 4. Controls and Procedures



	 




	Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and
	Procedures




	We maintain disclosure controls and procedures
	(as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”))
	that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our filings under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed,
	summarized and reported within the periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC. This information is accumulated to allow
	our management to make timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Our President, who serves as our principal executive officer
	and principal financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period
	covered by this report and he determined that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of September 30, 2016
	due to a control deficiency. During the period we did not have additional personnel to allow segregation of duties to ensure the
	completeness or accuracy of our information. Due to the size and operations of the Company, we are unable to remediate this deficiency
	until we acquire or merge with another company.


	 




	Changes in Internal Control over Financial
	Reporting




	There were no changes in the Company’s
	internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by paragraph (d) of Rule 13a-15
	or 15d-15 of the Exchange Act that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2016 that have materially affected, or are reasonably
	likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.

	1. I
	have reviewed this Form 10-Q of Petrogress, Inc..;




	 




	2. Based
	on my knowledge, this report does not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary
	to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances under which such statements were made, not misleading with respect
	to the period covered by this report;




	 




	3. Based
	on my knowledge, the financial statements, and other financial information included in this report, fairly present in all material
	respects the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the small business issuer as of, and for, the periods

	4. I
	am responsible for establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e)
	and 15d-15(e)) for the small business issuer and have:




	 




	(a) Designed
	such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under my supervision,
	to ensure that material information relating to the small business issuer, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known
	to me by others within those entities, particularly during the period in which this report is being prepared;




	 




	(b) Evaluated
	the effectiveness of the small business issuer's disclosure controls and procedures and presented in this report our conclusions
	about the effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures, as of the end of the period covered by this report based on
	such evaluation; and




	 




	(c) Disclosed
	in this report any change in the small business issuer's internal control over financing reporting that occurred during the small
	business issuer's most recent fiscal quarter (the small business issuer's fourth fiscal quarter in the case of an annual report)
	that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the small business issuer's internal control over
	financial reporting; and




	 




	5. I
	have disclosed, based on my most recent evaluation of internal control over financial reporting, to the small business issuer's
	auditors and the audit committee of the small business issuer's board of directors (or persons performing the equivalent functions):




	 




	(a) All
	significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control over financial reporting which
	are reasonable likely to adversely affect the small business issuer's ability to record, process, summarize and report financial
	information; and




	 




	(b) Any
	fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the small business
	issuer's internal control over financial reporting.
