How the BuildZoom Score works








Follow this contractor

















Before you Hire

Here are some rules, regulations, and laws governing general contractors
in Washington:













Does Mello, Joseph C carry a valid contracting license?



Any work that impacts the value of real estate in Washington, requires a licensed contractor.
Mello, Joseph C currently holds license MELLOJC870JN , which was Active when we last checked. 











How important is contractor licensing in Washington?



The Washington State Department of Labor & Industries requires licensees to maintain a bond and liability insurance for the protection of consumers.











Your liability risk when hiring Mello, Joseph C



Licensed contractors in Washington are required to maintain general liability coverage that includes a $50,000 property damage policy and $200,000 public liability policy; or $250,000 combined single limit policy.











Financial recourse when hiring Mello, Joseph C



Licensed general contractors in Washington are required to maintain a $12,000 bond and specialty contractors are required to maintain a $6,000 bond. This provides consumers with financial recourse in case they perform defective work or violate license regulations.











How is the BuildZoom score calculated?



The BuildZoom score is based on a number of factors including the contractor's license status, insurance status, verified work history, standing with local consumer interest groups, verified reviews from other BuildZoom users and self-reported feedback from the contractor.











Why you should hire through BuildZoom



When it comes to major construction work or even minor alterations to your home, hiring the wrong contractor could result in incomplete or defective work. You may even find yourself dealing with huge liability claims. BuildZoom does the homework for you and helps you hire the right contractor.











You should get several bids before hiring a contractor



The standard board recommendation is to get at least three written bids before hiring a contractor. Do not automatically accept the lowest bid - an abnormally low bid may indicate the contractor made a mistake and is not including the same work quoted by their competitors. We've made the bid collection process extremely simple (and free). Just click here to get started.

Job Details
               Company Size: Less than $1 mil - Employee Range: Less than 25. We enable our clients to evolve to a plane of execution that aligns with and helps realize their mission, vision and goals. This evolution is realized by effectively leveraging, intertwining and managing what we refer to as the 4 P's which constitute the critical strands of an organization's execution DNA: purpose, people, processes and projects. We accomplish this through our carefully crafted consulting and training services, often packaging the two into what we refer to as consultraining services. Consultraining begins with tailoring training to be responsive to client needs, and progresses to a post-training partnership with our clients to ensure that the course learning is successfully implemented. This arrangement ensures that a client's training dollars outlive the course and yield lasting value. We have a sustained track record of services that provide results for our clients who range across a broad spectrum of industries and organizations: Fortune 500, small- to medium-sized companies, not-for-profit, and government and defense organizations and agencies.
