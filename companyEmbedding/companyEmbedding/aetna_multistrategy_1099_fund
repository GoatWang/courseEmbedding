				Aetna Capital Management, LLC - Funds of Hedge Funds			


For years, endowments and foundations – as well as large institutions such as Aetna Inc. - have invested in funds of hedge funds as a way to diversify their portfolios. In fact, for over 16 years, Aetna has pursued a multi-strategy, multi-manager fund of hedge funds investment strategy in pursuit of solid risk-adjusted returns, while diversifying its general account portfolio.
Aetna Capital Management, LLC (“ACM”) was formed to allow individuals and other institutions the ability to invest in the same funds of hedge funds as Aetna, alongside the company's nearly $650 million allocation to our funds. At ACM, we focus solely on managing funds of hedge funds for institutions and individuals, offering both accredited investors and qualified purchasers the opportunity to gain exposure to these alternative investment strategies.
ACM is not a Wall Street investment bank that created a product to be sold to your clients, but rather a member of a publicly traded insurance holding company group that invests in the same funds offered to your clients. Through this site, we hope you will get a sense of what our firm has to offer and learn what investing in one of our funds could potentially do for your investment goals.
