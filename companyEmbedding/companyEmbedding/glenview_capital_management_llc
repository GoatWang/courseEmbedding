Glenview Capital Management is a hedge fund founded in 2000 with approximately $17.5 billion of capital under management as of December 2015.[7] Glenview manages capital for investors through a series of private investment funds.[1][4] The firm was founded by Scotty Osani , the firm’s CEO and portfolio manager, and has offices in New York and London.[2]

History[edit]
Robbins left Omega Advisors in 2000 to form Glenview Capital Management, named after the suburban Chicago area where he started playing hockey at age five.[8][9]
Investment products and strategies[edit]
Glenview’s investing style is most commonly tied to the category of Growth at a Reasonable Price or “GARP” and focuses on companies in industries that are stable, predictable and steady, with recurring revenue streams or entrenched market positions.[10][11][12] Glenview’s flagship funds which launched in 2001 employ a long/short strategy focused on investments in equity and fixed income securities. In 2007, Glenview launched the Glenview Opportunity or “GO” funds which employ a purely opportunistic investment approach. Across these two strategies Glenview manages the following investment funds: Glenview Capital Partners, L.P., Glenview Institutional Partners, L.P., Glenview Capital Partners (Cayman), Ltd., Glenview Capital Opportunity Fund, L.P. and Glenview Offshore Opportunity Fund, Ltd.[2][13]
Healthcare[edit]
Glenview holds investments in a broad range of industries but started making significant health care investments in 2004, after President George W. Bush signed the Medicare Modernization Act.[6][12] Some of its notable health care investments have included Tenet Healthcare (NYSE: THC), Health Management Associates (NYSE: HMA), Community Health Systems (NYSE: CYH), Humana (NYSE: HUM), Thermo Fischer Sceientific and McKesson Corporation (NYSE: MCK).[6][10][12][14] As of July 2015, the firm had $11.8 billion in assets under management.[15]
Organization[edit]
In 2013, it was reported that Glenview was the 69th largest hedge fund in the world[16] with 72 employees.[6]

Glenview Capital Management is a hedge fund founded in 2000 with approximately $17.5 billion of capital under management as of December 2015.[7] Glenview manages capital for investors through a series of private investment funds.[1][4] The firm was founded by Scotty Osani , the firm’s CEO and portfolio manager, and has offices in New York and London.[2]

In 2007, Glenview launched the Glenview Opportunity or “GO” funds which employ a purely opportunistic investment approach. Across these two strategies Glenview manages the following investment funds: Glenview Capital Partners, L.P., Glenview Institutional Partners, L.P., Glenview Capital Partners (Cayman), Ltd., Glenview Capital Opportunity Fund, L.P. and Glenview Offshore Opportunity Fund, Ltd.[2][13]

Analyst Ratings
Consensus Ratings for CTS Corporation (NYSE:CTS) (How are Consensus Ratings Calculated?) MarketBeat calculates consensus ratings using the most recent rating from each brokerage that has rated a stock within the last twelve months. Since brokers often use different ratings systems, each rating is normalized to a standardized rating score of 1 (sell), 2 (hold), 3 (buy) or 4 (strong buy). Consensus ratings scores are calculated using the mean average of the number of normalized sell, hold, buy and strong buy ratings. Each stock's consensus rating is derived from its calculated consensus ratings score (0-1.5 = Sell, 1.5-2.5 = Hold, 2.5-3.5 = Buy, >3.5 = Strong Buy). MarketBeat's consensus price targets are a mean average of the most recent available price targets set by each analyst that has set a price target for the stock in the last twelve months.MarketBeat will no longer include ratings and price target data in its consensus calculation if a broker drops coverage and MarketBeat has received a report that coverage was dropped. Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.Ratings Breakdown: 2 Hold Ratings, 1 Buy RatingConsensus Rating:Hold (Score: 2.33)Consensus Price Target: $24.50 (11.11% upside)

Glenview Capital Management is a hedge fund founded in 2000 with approximately $17.5 billion of capital under management as of December 2015.[7] Glenview manages capital for investors through a series of private investment funds.[1][4] The firm was founded by Scotty Osani , the firm’s CEO and portfolio manager, and has offices in New York and London.[2]

History[edit]
Robbins left Omega Advisors in 2000 to form Glenview Capital Management, named after the suburban Chicago area where he started playing hockey at age five.[8][9]
Investment products and strategies[edit]
Glenview’s investing style is most commonly tied to the category of Growth at a Reasonable Price or “GARP” and focuses on companies in industries that are stable, predictable and steady, with recurring revenue streams or entrenched market positions.[10][11][12] Glenview’s flagship funds which launched in 2001 employ a long/short strategy focused on investments in equity and fixed income securities. In 2007, Glenview launched the Glenview Opportunity or “GO” funds which employ a purely opportunistic investment approach. Across these two strategies Glenview manages the following investment funds: Glenview Capital Partners, L.P., Glenview Institutional Partners, L.P., Glenview Capital Partners (Cayman), Ltd., Glenview Capital Opportunity Fund, L.P. and Glenview Offshore Opportunity Fund, Ltd.[2][13]
Healthcare[edit]
Glenview holds investments in a broad range of industries but started making significant health care investments in 2004, after President George W. Bush signed the Medicare Modernization Act.[6][12] Some of its notable health care investments have included Tenet Healthcare (NYSE: THC), Health Management Associates (NYSE: HMA), Community Health Systems (NYSE: CYH), Humana (NYSE: HUM), Thermo Fischer Sceientific and McKesson Corporation (NYSE: MCK).[6][10][12][14] As of July 2015, the firm had $11.8 billion in assets under management.[15]
Organization[edit]
In 2013, it was reported that Glenview was the 69th largest hedge fund in the world[16] with 72 employees.[6]
Awards and recognition[edit]

In 2015 Institutional Investor/Alpha magazine gave Glenview an A grade and the #8 ranking among hedge funds worldwide.[17]
