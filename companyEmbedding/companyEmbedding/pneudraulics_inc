Nothing in this clause shall relieve Seller from proceeding without delay in the performance of this order as changed.

								For Default
								

										Buyer may terminate this purchase order, or any part thereof, by written notice of default to Seller under any of the following circumstances:
									


											If Seller fails to perform within the time specified.
										

											If Seller fails to comply with other provisions of this order and does not cure any such failure within a period of ten (10) days after receipt of notice from Buyer specifying such failure.
										

											If Seller becomes insolvent or makes a general assignment for the benefit of creditors or files or has filed against it a petition of bankruptcy or for reorganization, or pursues any other remedy under any other law relating to the relief for debtors or in the event a receiver is appointed for Seller’s property or business.
										


										In the event of such termination, Buyer may purchase or manufacture similar supplies and/or require Seller to transfer title and deliver to Buyer any and all property produced or procured by Seller under this order and Seller shall be liable to Buyer for any excess cost to Buyer.
									



								Buyer may terminate this order in whole or in part at any time by notice to Seller in writing. On receipt by Seller of such notice, Seller shall, to the extent specified therein, stop work hereunder and the placement of subcontracts, terminate work under subcontracts outstanding hereunder, and take any necessary action to protect property in Seller’s possession in which Buyer has or may acquire an interest. In such event, Buyer shall pay to Seller, without duplication the (1) amounts due for supplies delivered and accepted or services completed in accordance herewith prior to the effective date of termination; plus (2) actual costs incurred by Seller if property allocable or apportionable under recognized commercial accounting practices to the terminated portion of the contract, including liabilities to the subcontractors which are so allocable and excluding any charges for interest or material or parts which may be delivered to others; plus (3) a reasonable profit on work actually done by Seller prior to such termination; plus (4) the reasonable costs of settlement, provided that the total settlement shall not exceed the contract price and, provided further, that if it appears that Seller would have sustained a loss on the entire contract had it been completed, no profit shall be included or allowed and an appropriate adjustment shall be made reducing the amount of the settlement to reflect the indicated rate of loss.

The remedies provided herein to Seller in the event Buyer unilaterally terminates this order by notice are the exclusive remedies of the Seller.
							

								Any termination by Buyer, whether for default or otherwise, shall be without prejudice to any claims for damages or other rights of Buyer against Seller.
							

								Buyer shall have the right to audit all elements of any termination claim and Seller shall make available to Buyer on request all books, records and paper relating thereto.
							

								Seller shall continue performance of this order to the extent not terminated. Any provisions for delivery or acceptance of the supplies in installments shall not make severable the obligations of Seller.

						Top

						 from   TransDigm Group Incorporated 











 
















































 

 




















 


CLEVELAND, July 28, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- TransDigm Group Incorporated (NYSE:   TDG) announced today that it has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire PneuDraulics, Inc. ("PneuDraulics" or "the Company") for approximately $325 million in cash. The purchase price includes approximately $107 million of tax benefits to be realized by TransDigm over a 15 year period beginning in 2015. TransDigm expects to finance the acquisition through existing cash on hand.
Located in Rancho Cucamonga, California, PneuDraulics employs approximately 275 people. The Company manufactures proprietary, highly engineered aerospace pneumatic and hydraulic components and sub-systems for commercial transport, regional, business jet and military applications.

W. Nicholas Howley, Chairman and CEO of TransDigm Group Incorporated, stated, "PneuDraulics is a long standing manufacturer of proprietary, sole source products with established positions on a number of high use platforms, strong aftermarket content and an outstanding reputation. The highly engineered products will allow us to expand our content on a number of substantial platforms, including Boeing 787 and Airbus A350. PneuDraulics fits well with our consistent product and acquisition strategy. As with all TransDigm acquisitions, we see opportunities for significant value creation."
The acquisition, which is expected to close before the end of fiscal year 2015, is subject to regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions. 
Houlihan Lokey served as exclusive financial advisor to PneuDraulics.
