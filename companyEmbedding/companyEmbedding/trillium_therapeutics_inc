About Trillium Therapeutics


Our lead program SIRPαFc is a decoy receptor that blocks the activity of CD47, a molecule that allows tumor cells to escape destruction by the immune system.

A Phase 1 clinical trial (NCT02663518) evaluating SIRPaFc (TTI-621) is ongoing in advanced hematologic malignancies, and a second Phase 1 trial is underway in solid tumors (NCT02890368). TTI-622 is an IgG4 SIRPaFc protein, which is primarily being developed for combination therapy. An IND filing is targeted for 2H/17.




SIRPαFc



CD47 binds SIRPαFc on the surface of macrophages, and transmits a "do not eat" signal that protects cells from macrophage attack
