BRADSHAW INTERNATIONAL EXPANDS ITS PORTFOLIO OF BRANDS & CATEGORIES WITH BLACK & DECKER® AND MR. CLEAN® LICENSES


RANCHO CUCAMONGA, Calif. (July, 2011) – Bradshaw International, Inc.—a leading marketer of housewares products and best known for its flagship brand, Good Cook®—expands its licenses to include a full line of cleaning tools under the Black & Decker® brand, and a license to market Mr. Clean® Household Cleaning Gloves and Reusable Wipes through Butler Home Products, a company division.
“The new license with Mr. Clean allows us to expand our product mix, and our license with Black & Decker provides us entry into hardware and home improvement distribution channels,” said Mike Rodrigue, CEO of Bradshaw International, Inc. “The expansion of Butler Home Products licenses with these two strong household names marks another milestone in Bradshaw’s goal of continued growth in the brands and licenses we hold.”
Black & Decker products will be available in 2012 and will cover several categories including: push brooms, angle brooms, mops, dusters, buckets, dustpans, squeegees, overhead cleaning, sponges, scrubbers, scourers and more. Designed primarily for distribution in the hardware/home center class of trade, the products will also find placement in mass merchants, grocery and specialty stores as seasonal offerings.
Procter & Gamble, manufacturer of Mr. Clean All-Purpose Cleaner and Mr. Clean Magic Eraser, will consolidate its licensed Mr. Clean Household Cleaning Accessories program to Butler Home Products, a division of Bradshaw International. The company has been a Mr. Clean licensee for over 11 years, successfully expanding the line of products and growing the business.

What Makes Us Different?
Property Data + People Data
Our reports include the traditional info you’d expect to find about a property (ownership, deeds, tax info, etc.), but we dig deeper and offer background records on people too.
Find criminal background records on owners, registered sex offenders in the neighborhood, and more.










The Extras We Include, for FREE


Run criminal background checks on previous owners, their associates, or the neighbors. Get to know the whole story.



Know your new neighborhood by seeing sex offender information, which may include names, addresses, and criminal convictions.



Easy to use reporting. Just enter an address, a name, or even a phone number and we will give you all the information we have.

Natasha, Oklahoma
Nursing Student
"My daughter recently went out for soccer. I decided it would be a good idea to run another player’s father through BeenVerified. Turns out this guy had been charged with indecent exposure and was on parole."


Maryann, New Jersey
Analyst
"I used BeenVerified to check into a guy that I had met online. It turns out he had lied to me about where he lived and his family. Needless to say, thanks to BV I severed contact with him and have not heard from him since. Thank you BV!"


Bob M, New Jersey
Retired Detective
"I am retired and have a ministry helping the dying and sick. I found a son and the mother was dying of cancer. She held on waiting for her son who had not been in touch for years."


Rhonda, Missouri
Caring Mom
"I'm a single mother dating online and I use BeenVerified to help protect my family!"
