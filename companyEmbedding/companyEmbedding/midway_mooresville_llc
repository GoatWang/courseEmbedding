We had moved out of state and needed someone we could trust.  Mark went over & above what we could have expected.  He took care of our house, made sure everything was done and kept us informed of anything going on.  He made sure all agents had any information they needed and sold our home in less than a month!If you are looking for an agent who only has your best interest in mind and does all he can to be sure you are taken care of, Mark Missler is your man!   Highly recommended.Norm & Marge LefortLawrie Lawrence Real Estategaylehoward ratedMy wife and I feel the Lawrie Lawrence Real Estate team is the best! Lawrie was so knowledgeable of the real estate in the Lake Norman area, that we were able to find our dream home in no time and with such ease. We always felt we were in good hands and never felt stressed about the process. We plan on telling all of our friends looking for a real estate agent they have to go with Lawrie!
