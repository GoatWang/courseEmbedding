CX-072 (PD-L1-TARGETING PROBODY THERAPEUTIC)

CX-072 is a wholly owned PD-L1-targeting Probody therapeutic for the treatment of cancer, currently being evaluated in a Phase 1/2 clinical trial. To support initiation of the study, CytomX launched PROCLAIM (Probody Clinical Assessment In Man), a first-of-its-kind clinical trial program that enables clinical study sites and physicians to access our wholly-owned Probody therapeutics under one international umbrella.
The first module within the PROCLAIM program is an open-label, dose-finding Phase 1/2 study evaluating CX-072 as monotherapy and in combination with Yervoy® (ipilimumab) or Zelboraf® (vemurafenib) in patients with certain cancers.
Clinical data is expected to begin to emerge by the end of 2017 and throughout 2018. In preclinical studies, CX-072 demonstrated anti-tumor activity, while minimizing activation of the immune system outside the tumor.
CytomX aims to achieve three goals as part of the PROCLAIM-CX-072 clinical trial:



CX-2009 (CD166-Targeting Probody Drug Conjugate)

The company is current enrolling patients in the PROCLAIM-CX-2009 study (Probody Clinical Assessment In Man), a Phase 1/2 clinical trial evaluating CX-2009 as monotherapy in patients with select advanced solid tumors, including non-small cell lung cancer, breast cancer, ovarian cancer, endometrial cancer, cholangiocarcinoma (bile duct cancer), head and neck cancer, castration-resistant prostate cancer.
While CD166 is widely and highly expressed on solid tumor cells, it has been previously considered “undruggable” given its expression on normal tissues. In preclinical studies, PDCs targeting CD166 have led to complete regressions in models of lung and breast cancer at therapeutically relevant doses, and are well tolerated in non-human primates. CX-2009 has been conjugated with DM4, a highly potent cytotoxic drug, to deliver the highest payload to the tumor across a greater number of cancers. DM4 is developed by and licensed from ImmunoGen.

CLTA-4-Directed Probody Therapeutic

Bristol-Myers Squibb has initiated IND-enabling studies for its CTLA-4-directed Probody therapeutics.
CTLA-4, a clinically validated inhibitory immune checkpoint protein, is the most advanced target from the 12-target collaboration.  Clinical trial initiation is expected by early 2018.


CX-2029 (CD71 Probody Drug Conjugate)

CytomX and AbbVie™ are co-developing a Probody drug conjugate directed against CD71, the transferrin receptor that is highly expressed on a number of solid and hematologic tumors, as well as many normal tissues. CX-2029 is in the IND-enabling stage with an IND filing anticipated in 2018.
CD71 is an excellent “internalizer,” which has the potential to efficiently deliver toxin to tumor cells. Historically, CD71 has not been widely pursued as a target given its expression on normal tissues and potential for causing toxicities. CytomX has presented proof-of-concept data at AACR in 2016 demonstrating the creation of a therapeutic window for a CD-71-targeting PDC.

You are here: Home / Probody Therapeutics
THE SCIENCE OF PROBODY THERAPEUTICSProbody™ therapeutics are designed to bind selectively to tumors, and not to healthy tissue, to minimize toxicity and create safer, more effective cancer therapies.

Traditional antibodies bind to unique antigens that exist in abundance on diseased tissue. However, many of these antigen targets also are found on healthy tissue. This is a critical challenge for today’s highly potent next-generation antibody therapies, including immunotherapy combinations, antibody drug conjugates, T-cell engaging bispecific antibodies and CAR-NK cell therapies.
Diseased Tissue
Healthy Tissue
A Probody therapeutic solves this problem by binding only to diseased tissue. A masking peptide limits binding to healthy tissue, thereby minimizing toxicities.

The improved target selectivity of our Probody therapeutics allows us to open a therapeutic window for previously inaccessible targets, and to expand the therapeutic index of existing, validated targets. With this, we are transforming the landscape for therapeutic antibodies.


The Probody PlatformA pioneering antibody prodrug technology designed to localize antibody binding to diseased tissue.
The Probody platform aims to overcome toxicity challenges by creating therapies that are activated selectively in the tumor microenvironment. The platform and its resulting Probody drugs are based on a deep understanding of protease biology.
With this technology, CytomX is advancing Probody cancer immunotherapies and Probody drug conjugates toward clinical investigation, while also exploring Probody technology applications for improved T-cell engaging Probody bispecifics and ProCAR-NK cell therapies.
Our Probody Platform and pipeline of Probody therapeutics are based on a robust portfolio of intellectual property and patented technology.

ABOUT PROTEASE BIOLOGY
Proteases are enzymes that digest proteins into smaller pieces by cleaving specific amino acid sequences known as substrates. In normal healthy tissue, protease activity is tightly controlled. But in cancer cells, protease activity is dysregulated.
Our Probody platform leverages this dysregulated protease activity found in the tumor microenvironment. A Probody therapeutic is engineered with its target-binding region masked, which limits interaction with healthy tissue. When Probody therapeutics encounter proteases near tumor tissue, the proteases remove the mask from the therapeutics. The activated Probody therapeutic then binds to its target on the tumor, localizing the efficacy of a potent antibody-based therapeutic.
In healthy tissue, where protease activity is regulated and minimal, our preclinical data suggests that the target-binding region of the Probody therapeutic remains masked and unable to bind.

WHY CHOOSE RESEARCH AND MARKETS?



WORLD'S LARGEST SELECTION




TRUSTED BY THE BEST




CUSTOMER FOCUSED




SAFE & SECURE







I was looking everywhere with no luck for an important research publication called World Retail Data

                         & Statistics 2014. Eventually, I gave up but found a 2012 edition of the same publication at Research and Markets. I then emailed customer support to see if they could get me the 2014 edition and within hours, I had the 2014 edition - even at no additional charge.Wow, that was truly impressive customer service by you guys.Thanks a ton to Research and Markets.

About CytomX TherapeuticsCytomX is a clinical-stage, oncology-focused biopharmaceutical company pioneering a novel class of investigational antibody therapeutics based on its Probody technology platform. Probody therapeutics are designed to take advantage of unique conditions in the tumor microenvironment to enhance the tumor-targeting features of an antibody and reduce drug activity in healthy tissues. The Company uses its platform to create proprietary cancer immunotherapies against clinically-validated targets, such as PD-L1, and first-in-class cancer therapeutics against difficult-to-drug targets, such as CD166 and CD71. The Company’s lead program, CX-072, a wholly-owned PD-L1-targeting Probody therapeutic, is being evaluated in a Phase 1/2 study as part of PROCLAIM (Probody Clinical Assessment In Man), an international umbrella clinical trial program that provides clinical trial sites with access to the Company’s novel therapies under one central protocol. A Phase 1/2 clinical trial for CX-2009, a first-in-class Probody drug conjugate, targeting the highly expressed tumor antigen, CD166, is also in progress under the PROCLAIM umbrella. In addition to its wholly owned programs, CytomX is collaborating with strategic partners, including AbbVie, Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, Pfizer Inc., MD Anderson Cancer Center and ImmunoGen, Inc. BMS expects to advance its first collaboration product candidate, a Probody therapeutic targeting CTLA-4, into clinical studies in early 2018. CytomX, in collaboration with AbbVie, expects to advance the CD71-targeting Probody Drug Conjugate, CX-2029, into clinical studies in 2018.

CytomX Therapeutics Inc.Read MoreMore News  CytomX Achieves Development Milestone in Strategic Oncology Collaboration with AbbVie for CD71-Targeting Probody Drug Conjugate  SOUTH SAN FRANCISCO, Calif., June  29, 2017  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- CytomX Therapeutics, Inc. (Nasdaq:CTMX), a biopharmaceutical company developing investigational Probody™ therapeutics for the treatment of cancer, today announced that the company has advanced CX-2029, a Probody drug conjugate (PDC) targeting CD71 and being developed in collaboration with AbbVie, into GLP toxicology studies, a key step on the path to filing an Investigational New Drug (IND) application in 2018. Upon commencement of the GLP toxicology study, CytomX will receive a $15 million milestone payment from AbbVie as part of the 2016 strategic oncology collaboration between the companies.
“CD71 is highly attractive for delivery of cytotoxic payloads to cancer cells, but its presence on normal cells has precluded the development of antibody drug conjugates using this high-potential target. We have used our Probody platform to design and optimize CX-2029, a CD71-targeting Probody drug conjugate with the potential to safely and effectively treat a wide range of cancers,” said Sean McCarthy, D.Phil., president and chief executive officer of CytomX Therapeutics. “Rapid progression of the CX-2029 program to this important milestone has been enabled by our close collaboration with AbbVie, and we look forward to advancing this first-in-class molecule into the clinic.”
About CD71 and the CytomX/AbbVie 2016 Strategic Oncology CollaborationCytomX and AbbVie are co-developing a PDC against CD71, with CytomX leading pre-clinical and early clinical development. CD71 is also known as the transferrin receptor 1 (TfR1), the biological function of which is to internalize iron-complexed transferrin into dividing cells. CD71 is highly and homogeneously expressed on many solid and hematologic tumor types. These properties render CD71 an ideal target for antibody drug conjugate strategies except for the fact that the target is present on most normal cells. CX-2029 has been designed to target CD71 on tumor cells and spare normal cells by localizing the drug candidate’s activity primarily to cancer tissue. AbbVie will lead later development and commercialization with global late-stage development costs shared between the two companies. CytomX received an upfront payment of $30 million and is eligible to receive up to $470 million in development, regulatory and commercial milestones, pending the achievement of pre-determined outcomes. AbbVie will lead global commercial activities with CytomX eligible to receive a profit share in the U.S. and tiered double-digit royalties on net product sales outside of the U.S. CytomX retains an option to co-promote in the U.S. 
AbbVie also receives exclusive worldwide rights to develop and commercialize Probody drug conjugates against up to two additional, undisclosed targets. Should AbbVie ultimately pursue these targets, CytomX is eligible to receive additional milestone and royalty payments per target on any resulting products.

About 


CytomX is unlocking the potential of antibody therapeutics in oncology by developing a novel therapeutic antibody class of highly targeted Probody™ therapeutics.


  Our Probody Platform
Our novel Probody Platform allows us to design drugs that selectively activate in the tumor microenvironment while reducing drug activity in healthy tissue and in circulation. This unique ability to localize therapeutic effects to the tumor reduces systemic toxicity, with potential for safer and more effective therapies for a broad array of validated and previously inaccessible oncology targets.
Driven by a vision to transform patient lives, we are advancing multiple Probody cancer immunotherapies and Probody drug conjugates toward clinical investigation, while also applying our technology to bispecific T-cell engaging antibodies and ProCAR-NK cell therapies.

The Probody Platform has attracted strategic partnerships with leading pharmaceutical companies and research institutions, including AbbVie™, Bristol-Myers Squibb™, Pfizer™, ImmunoGen™ and MD Anderson Cancer Center™. Through these and other collaborations, we broaden the reach of our technology.
