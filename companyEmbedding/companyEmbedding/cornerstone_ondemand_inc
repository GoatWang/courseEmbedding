				Empowering Your People

				Recruit, train, manage, and connect people across your organization.




 





				What We Do

				Cornerstone OnDemand (NASDAQ: CSOD) helps organizations to recruit, train and manage their people. We work with hundreds of the world’s largest companies—from Walgreens and Starwood Hotels & Resorts to Deutsche Post DHL and Xerox—and thousands of smaller ones to help them engage their workforces and empower their people. Our software impacts every aspect of the employee experience, helping people to make their best work even better – which ultimately translates into greater business results.


 Our solutions are in use by over 30+ million people in 191 countries, and in 43 languages.


				Along with corporations, we work with government agencies, hospitals, non-profits and schools to more effectively manage the entire employee lifecycle. Our software and services are in use by over 30+ million people in 191 countries and in 43 languages.

				Since 1999, Cornerstone has been an innovator in cloud technology. It’s the only way we deliver our products, and we’re proud of that. With pure Software-as-a-Service, clients are always on the latest version of Cornerstone, they reduce IT and maintenance costs, and they can easily integrate with any other technology platforms. And, users can conveniently access our software anytime, anywhere and on any device.



                



				How We Got Here

				Cornerstone started with a simple (but bold) idea – to improve access to education on a global basis through online learning. We were a tiny company back in 1999, with a different name, a single shared cordless phone, and a jarringly bright orange logo. But the seed was planted: we were off and running with the belief that ongoing learning and development are at the heart of how to be both a better individual and a better organization.

				In the past 17 years, Cornerstone has come a long way. We’ve got more than one phone now, for instance. But our heritage of focusing on the importance of learning has remained a constant. The Cornerstone Unified Talent Management suite addresses critical talent needs. It helps businesses find and attract the right people for the right roles and then makes sure they are onboarded in the most efficient and effective way possible. It helps organizations keep a better pulse on employee performance and ensure readiness for new roles. It helps to connect employees and locate expertise so that people can do their jobs better in any given moment.


 Our mission has always been to improve access to education on a global basis through online learning.


				But the thread that connects these central HR processes continues to be learning and development. It is the glue that holds talent management together, and it’s the step that makes so many other HR processes actionable in the real world. Learning makes onboarding more impactful. Training makes performance management actionable. Development drives people to the right roles in the organization. And social learning occurs every day in every workplace around the world.


			We’ve built our business the old fashioned way: deliberately and with an eye to forging lasting relationships with our clients, employees and partners.Today, we are especially proud of a few things:





			 


				Our Culture

				Cornerstone built a team that is smart, cool, dependable and visionary, and totally committed to client success, check out our career site.
