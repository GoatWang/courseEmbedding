JOIN THE LISTClickFIND A STOREFundamentals Of Oil & Gas Lawby Hughes, William E.Framed for a global audience, William Hughes' new book provides a fudamental basis for understanding legal problems commonly encountered when doing business in the international oil and gas industry. Hughes- a Harvard Law School graduate, practicing attorney, adjunct professor, and Fulbright scholar- devotes substantial attention to industry legal problems arising under non-U.S. legal systems, such as those in the European Union and Islamic law regimes. Including case studies and end-of-chapter questions and notes, Fundamentals of International Oil & Gas is an excellent desk reference, course textbook, or introductory guide.Business Law, Energy Industries, PetroleumCondition: --HPB condition ratingsNew: Item is brand new, unused and unmarked, in flawless condition.Fine/Like New (F): No defects, little usage.

How the BuildZoom Score works








Follow this contractor

















Before you Hire

Here are some rules, regulations, and laws governing general contractors
in Annapolis:













Does Hughes, William E. Jr carry a valid contracting license?



Maryland laws protect consumers by requiring home improvement contractors to hold a current license issued by the Maryland Home Improvement Commission.
Hughes, William E. Jr currently holds license E2226 (Electrical Cont, Master General), which was Active when we last checked. 











How important is contractor licensing in Annapolis?



The Maryland Home Improvement Commission maintains high standards for home improvement contractor licensing. Applicants must provide proof of at least two years of experience or education in their given field and pass a board exam prior to receiving their license.











Your liability risk when hiring Hughes, William E. Jr



Licensed contractors in Maryland are required to show proof of $50,000 liability insurance in order to obtain their license.











Financial recourse when hiring Hughes, William E. Jr



If you hire a licensed contractor in Maryland, you are protected by the State's Home Improvement Guaranty Fund. This fund is administered by the Home Improvement Commission to compensate homeowners who suffer economic damages at the hands of a licensed home improvement contractor. No coverage is provided to the homeowner if the contractor is not properly licensed. 











What else should I know before hiring Hughes, William E. Jr



Licensed contractors in Maryland must provide proof of financial solvency based on the scope and size of their business in relation to total assets, liabilities, credit rating, and net worth.











How is the BuildZoom score calculated?



The BuildZoom score is based on a number of factors including the contractor's license status, insurance status, verified work history, standing with local consumer interest groups, verified reviews from other BuildZoom users and self-reported feedback from the contractor.











Why you should hire through BuildZoom



When it comes to major construction work or even minor alterations to your home, hiring the wrong contractor could result in incomplete or defective work. You may even find yourself dealing with huge liability claims. BuildZoom does the homework for you and helps you hire the right contractor.











You should get several bids before hiring a contractor



The Maryland Home Improvement Commission recommends getting at least three written bids before hiring a contractor. Do not automatically accept the lowest bid - an abnormally low bid may indicate the contractor made a mistake and is not including the same work quoted by their competitors. We've made the bid collection process extremely simple (and free). Just click here to get started.
