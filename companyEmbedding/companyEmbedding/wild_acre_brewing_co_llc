Soul Pleasure is a full-bodied stout with beautiful color, brewed with a complex combination of seven different premium malts. Albeit rich with coffee and chocolate flavor, Soul Pleasure maintains a smooth texture attributed to the addition of oatmeal in the mash.





ABV 6.0%
IBU 35
Yeast - American Ale











Billy Jenkins Session Bock beer is an exceptionally quaffable beer, lower in alcohol, and less malt-forward than a traditional German bock. The deep amber color results from a blend of domestic and German malts. Clean and well balanced, Billy Jenkins gives off malt aroma, plus biscuit and toffee flavor profiles.





ABV 5.2%
IBU 15
YEAST - LAGER











Tarantula Hawk is an American style, Red IPA dry-hopped with an abundance of coveted Mosaic and Amarillo hops. The deep red color is derived from a blend of Two Row, Victory, Munich, and dark caramel malts. Tarantula Hawk possesses a striking grapefruit, pine, and tropical fruit aroma; and finishes with a firm and clean bitterness.





ABV 6.5%
IBU 75
YEAST - AMERICAN ALE











Moonlight Shine is an lightly filtered, dry-hopped, and exceptionally drinkable American style wheat ale. Hints of vanilla and orange zest give Moonlight Shine a refreshing flavor profile and pleasing citrus aroma, which, shines through absent high bitterness.





ABV 5.7%
IBU 15
Yeast - American Ale

Soul Pleasure is a full-bodied stout with beautiful color, brewed with a complex combination of seven different premium malts. Albeit rich with coffee and chocolate flavor, Soul Pleasure maintains a smooth texture attributed to the addition of oatmeal in the mash.





ABV 6.0%
IBU 35
Yeast - American Ale











Billy Jenkins Session Bock beer is an exceptionally quaffable beer, lower in alcohol, and less malt-forward than a traditional German bock. The deep amber color results from a blend of domestic and German malts. Clean and well balanced, Billy Jenkins gives off malt aroma, plus biscuit and toffee flavor profiles.





ABV 5.2%
IBU 15
YEAST - LAGER











Tarantula Hawk is an American style, Red IPA dry-hopped with an abundance of coveted Mosaic and Amarillo hops. The deep red color is derived from a blend of Two Row, Victory, Munich, and dark caramel malts. Tarantula Hawk possesses a striking grapefruit, pine, and tropical fruit aroma; and finishes with a firm and clean bitterness.





ABV 6.5%
IBU 75
YEAST - AMERICAN ALE











Moonlight Shine is an lightly filtered, dry-hopped, and exceptionally drinkable American style wheat ale. Hints of vanilla and orange zest give Moonlight Shine a refreshing flavor profile and pleasing citrus aroma, which, shines through absent high bitterness.





ABV 5.7%
IBU 15
Yeast - American Ale
