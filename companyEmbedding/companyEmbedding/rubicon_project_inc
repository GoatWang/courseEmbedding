    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.


RDF
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage.date> "2001-02"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#gYearMonth>  .
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm>  <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage.source> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11x1gf2m6>  .

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)
language_code

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).

History[edit]
The company was founded in 2007 by Frank Addante, Craig Roah, Duc Chau and Julie Mattern, who had previously worked together at L90, an online advertising network.
By April 2009, the company had raised $33 million in venture funding led by Clearstone Venture Partners, IDG Ventures Asia and Mayfield Fund. The company also secured $8 million in venture debt from Silicon Valley Bank.[1]
In February 2017, the company released its president and several other top executives.[2]
On March 14, 2017, CEO and founder Frank Addante stepped down from his position to take the role of chairman. The company announced Michael Barrett, previously the chief executive of mobile advertising marketplace Millennial Media and chief revenue officer at Yahoo!, would be the new chief executive.[3]
Early acquisitions[edit]
In September 2009, the company acquired OthersOnline, an audience profiling technology company based in Seattle.
In May 2010, the company bought Site Scout, a malware detection company also based in Seattle.[4]
In October 2010, the company acquired Fox Audience Network from News Corp. in return for a minority stake in the company. It also received $18 million in additional funding led by Peacock Equity, the venture division of NBC Universal.
In May 2012, the company acquired Mobsmith, a mobile technology company.
In August 2012, the company became the top-ranked online advertising company in terms of reach, with a 96.2% audience share, according to rankings provided by ComScore. This placed Rubicon ahead of Google for the first time, and also ahead of other competitors such as AOL and AT&T.[5]
In July 2013, the company expanded its executive ranks with the addition of 10 senior people.[6]
Initial public offering[edit]
In February 2014, the company filed for an IPO[7] and went public in April 2014 opening at over $20 per share. The stock fell back to about $16 per share later in the month.[8]

History[edit]
The company was founded in 2007 by Frank Addante, Craig Roah, Duc Chau and Julie Mattern, who had previously worked together at L90, an online advertising network.
By April 2009, the company had raised $33 million in venture funding led by Clearstone Venture Partners, IDG Ventures Asia and Mayfield Fund. The company also secured $8 million in venture debt from Silicon Valley Bank.[1]
In February 2017, the company released its president and several other top executives.[2]
On March 14, 2017, CEO and founder Frank Addante stepped down from his position to take the role of chairman. The company announced Michael Barrett, previously the chief executive of mobile advertising marketplace Millennial Media and chief revenue officer at Yahoo!, would be the new chief executive.[3]
Early acquisitions[edit]
In September 2009, the company acquired OthersOnline, an audience profiling technology company based in Seattle.
In May 2010, the company bought Site Scout, a malware detection company also based in Seattle.[4]
In October 2010, the company acquired Fox Audience Network from News Corp. in return for a minority stake in the company. It also received $18 million in additional funding led by Peacock Equity, the venture division of NBC Universal.
In May 2012, the company acquired Mobsmith, a mobile technology company.
In August 2012, the company became the top-ranked online advertising company in terms of reach, with a 96.2% audience share, according to rankings provided by ComScore. This placed Rubicon ahead of Google for the first time, and also ahead of other competitors such as AOL and AT&T.[5]
In July 2013, the company expanded its executive ranks with the addition of 10 senior people.[6]
Initial public offering[edit]
In February 2014, the company filed for an IPO[7] and went public in April 2014 opening at over $20 per share. The stock fell back to about $16 per share later in the month.[8]
In March 2014, the company was named number two on the top Ad Exchange Entities by comScore.[9]

Rubicon Project Partners with Kiip to Automate Mobile In-App Rewarded Inventory
Jul 13 17
Rubicon Project announced that Kiip has partnered with Rubicon Project to bring the power of automation to its highly engaging “Moments” platform. The integration with Rubicon Project’s xAPI technology will automate the process through which brands purchase the inventory to advertise with Kiip in any environment that best suits their needs, including private marketplaces, direct and in the open market. Kiip’s “Moments” technology allows brands to identify opportunities in mobile apps that merit reward or acknowledgement, thus garnering a measurable emotional response that builds positive associations. Kiip has identified over 100 high-impact categories (engagement opportunities) such as loyalty (checking in with an app 3+ times a week), challenge (overcoming a challenge in a game), completion (checking an item off a to-do list), health (completing a run) and luck (receiving a bonus). Research data shows that moments-based ad placement boosts favorability by 160%.

Rubicon Project is an equal opportunity employer
        Rubicon Project is committed to a diverse work environment and overall culture of inclusion. As such, we are an equal opportunity employer committed to principles of equal employment opportunity for all employees and applicants and, in accordance with applicable laws, does not discriminate on the basis of sex, race, color, religion, national origin, ancestry, age, marital status, disability, medical condition, sexual orientation, genetic information, veteran status, or on any other basis prohibited by law.  Discrimination on the basis of sex includes discrimination on the basis of gender, gender identity (including transgender identity), or based upon pregnancy, childbirth or related medical condition, gender stereotyping, and any other basis protected by law.  In accordance with the laws prohibiting discrimination against qualified individuals with disabilities, the Company will provide reasonable accommodation to the known physical or mental limitations of an otherwise qualified disabled employee or applicant.  The Company will also reasonably accommodate the religious beliefs of employees and applicants in accordance with applicable law. This policy applies to all areas of employment, including, without limitation, recruitment, hiring, training, promotion, compensation, benefits, discipline, and transfers.
        
This Employer Participates in E-Verify


        
        N O T I C E:
      
        Federal law requires all employers to verify the identity and employment eligibility of all persons hired to work in the United States.
        
        This employer will provide the Social Security Administration (SSA) and, if necessary, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), with information from each new employee’s Form I-9 to confirm work authorization.
        
        IMPORTANT: If the Government cannot confirm that you are authorized to work, this employer is required to provide you written instructions and an opportunity to contact SSA and/or DHS before taking adverse action against you, including terminating your employment.
        
        Employers may not use E-Verify to pre-screen job applicants or to re-verify current employees and may not limit or influence the choice of documents presented for use on the Form I-9.
        
        In order to determine whether Form I-9 documentation is valid, this employer uses E-Verify’s photo screening tool to match the photograph appearing on some permanent resident and employment authorization cards with the official U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services’ (USCIS) photograph.
        
        If you believe that your employer has violated its responsibilities under this program or has discriminated against you during the verification process based upon your national origin or citizenship status, please call the Office of Special Counsel at 1-800-255-7688 (TDD: 1-800-237-2515).
        
        For more information on E-Verify, please contact DHS at: 1-888-464-4218

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.



Value Score

Growth Score

VGM Score

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

The Zacks Equity Research reports, or ZER for short, are our in-house, independently produced research reports.
The ever popular one-page Snapshot reports are generated for virtually every single Zacks Ranked stock. It's packed with all of the company's key stats and salient decision making information. Including the Zacks Rank, Zacks Industry Rank, Style Scores, the Price, Consensus & Surprise chart, graphical estimate analysis and how a stocks stacks up to its peers.
The detailed multi-page Analyst report does an even deeper dive on the company's vital statistics. In addition to all of the proprietary analysis in the Snapshot, the report also visually displays the four components of the Zacks Rank (Agreement, Magnitude, Upside and Surprise); provides a comprehensive overview of the company business drivers, complete with earnings and sales charts; a recap of their last earnings report; and a bulleted list of reasons to buy or sell the stock. It also includes an industry comparison table to see how your stock compares to its expanded industry, and the S&P 500.
Researching stocks has never been so easy or insightful as with the ZER Analyst and Snapshot reports.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.
