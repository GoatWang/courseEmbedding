Radiant Logistics Provides Update On Its Expanded Credit Capacity
Secures CAD$10.0 Million Term Loan
PR Newswire






BELLEVUE, Wash., June 28, 2017


 BELLEVUE, Wash., June 28, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Radiant Logistics, Inc. (the "Company") (NYSE MKT: RLGT) today announced that it has secured a new CAD$10.0 million senior secured Canadian term loan from Integrated Private Debt Fund V LP (the "IPD V Term Loan").  The proceeds from the IPD V Term Loan will effectively replenish the Company's U.S. senior credit facility with Bank of America, N.A., which had been used as a bridge to finance the Company's acquisition of Lomas Logistics earlier this year. The IPD V Term Loan will amortize monthly over a seven year period and accrues interest at a rate of 6.65%.
"We are very pleased to announce our new CAD$10.0 million term loan from IPD," said Bohn Crain, Founder and CEO of the Company. "The new term loan, in combination with our recently expanded US$75.0 million senior credit facility, gives us additional capacity to continue to execute on compelling acquisition opportunities while also preserving our ability to pursue other initiatives to unlock shareholder value, including opportunities to call our redeemable perpetual preferred stock and/or execute a buyback of our common stock, if either are warranted at the time."

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.



Value Score

VGM Score

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.

The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.
