Are you considering purchasing a new home? Are you thinking about selling your current home? Or, maybe you're just eager to refinance while interest rates are low?
Whatever the case may be, you'll need to know the value of the property in question. Our home value search can provide you with a wealth of information, and unlike a costly appraisal, it's completely free.
Our home prices are calculated using a proprietary algorithm that takes recent comparable sales, neighborhood data, and specific property information into account when creating a broad property value estimate.
We're not suggesting that you use our home value estimate in lieu of an appraisal from a trained professional when selling, purchasing, or refinancing, but it's the perfect source when you just need a reasonable estimate and you don't want to wait.
In addition to a ballpark value figure, you'll have access to valuable data, incuding transaction histories, home features, mortgage insurance and property tax estimates, and recent local sales.
And if you're looking for mortgage or refinance rates, you'll find them right there, right where you need them: on our price estimate page.
Whether you're just daydreaming or you've started hunting for a home in earnest, we hope you'll find our free home pricing page to be a valuable research tool.

What Will Be the Lasting Impact of Brexit on US Mortgages?
Steve Cook
 Although Britain will not actually implement June’s Brexit referendum to leave the European Union until next March at the earliest, it has already made a major impact on US mortgage rates. Will the long term impact of Brexit be as significant?
Within days of the referendum, uncertainty about the potential impact of Brexit on European economies caused investors to sell riskier global stocks and buy safer...

What Will Be the Lasting Impact of Brexit on US Mortgages?
Steve Cook
 Although Britain will not actually implement June’s Brexit referendum to leave the European Union until next March at the earliest, it has already made a major impact on US mortgage rates. Will the long term impact of Brexit be as significant?
Within days of the referendum, uncertainty about the potential impact of Brexit on European economies caused investors to sell riskier global stocks and buy safer...

I bought this level in Dec. 2012. I bought it thinking it was Professional quality an would last a life time of home owner use. Well it looks like today 05-2017 the spinning laser has stopped spinning.
I spent a lot of money for this and thought this was a quality piece. Companies wonder why people by cheap stuff and just throw it away, because it will probably last as long as the more expensive stuff. I'm at a point where Harbor Freight may be my go to, I won't feel so mad when it something stops working.

        Make sure to calibrate!
The rotary laser does a great job. I love that everything you need comes in the case (stand, tripod, receiver, laser). Its great to just grab the case and go. My only problem with this unit was i made the mistake of receiving it and started using it immediately. I used it to transit footing heights for a job and found out after the fact that it was 10" OFF OVER 50 FEET. Needless to say this screwed my job and materials up big time. It is not super hard to calibrate but i would 100% recommend you calibrate before using. Besides that, unit seems to work great and is nice for one man operation.

        Great features, easy to use, all in one unit with case to store everything
This complete laser level setup saved me a bunch of time versus using a water level to set up batter boards for building a concrete block foundation for my house addition. It didn't take any time at all to set up.
The night before, I calibrated it according to the directions from inside the house. The unit was dead on in the X axis at 25', and within the 1/16" tolerance in the Y axis. Good enough. When I set it up outside on the included tripod, I placed the X axis in the longest direction I needed to minimize any error.
It was a simple matter to align the detector on the grade stick where I needed it. I placed the grade stick on the existing foundation, and moved the detector until it gave me a solid beep. Then I simply walked around and marked a line at bottom of the grade stick onto each stake I had pounded in the ground. It took just a couple of minutes and all those marked were perfectly level with the foundation!
The only thing I was disappointed to see was that the detector that comes with this kit is of lower quality than the other kit you can purchase for this laser level that does not come with tripod and full case. While it works OK, it's not as nice as the other detector available through Johnson Tool. I may sell this detector and purchase the better one alone.
The tripod was sturdy enough for my needs. It's not indestructible, but should last indefinitely if taken care of.

        Easy to use
I bought this to paint horizontal lines in a bedroom. This made it so easy. I marked the lines around the room and then taped and painted. This is a very easy self leveler to use.

        Everything you need in a laser level
This works great. The case is a littler bigger than I would like but is is nice to have everything when you go to a job. I have paid for the laser is one week with its usefulness. Hung a drop ceiling, had the bracket I needed in the case to hang off of the track. Hung some chair rail used the tripod. Framed up a wall no problem with the vertical setting. Great laser for the price. Can't imagine not having it in my toolbox.

        Starter set
This kit comes with everything you need to do the most basic laser level work. I use it to dig footers, and lay out concrete flat work such as sidewalks and drive ways. The laser seams to be a good unit, but the tripod, stick and other accessories are light weight. The laser target only has one tone, so you have to look at the lights to tell up or down. You cant just rely on the tone. For 400 bucks you get a nice kit that seems to work very well. I have already put 30 hours on it and had no problems. I am comparing this to an older kit that would cost around 1400 bucks. I would bet that it wont take abuse very well. Be careful who uses it.

        Excellent tool for leveling foundation
I am leveling my batter boards that will mark my foundation site. I found this tool to be simple to use. The laser is powerful and can be read easily on a cloudy day or in the sun when using the laser detector and goggles. It is important that you check the calibration before using on the job. I could easily calibrate the horizontal beam. However, the calibration for the vertical beam is extremely confusing. The manual could be better written. I wished there was more on the web about it.
