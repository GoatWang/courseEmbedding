About Robert W. Lazar
Bob is one of the most well respected business professionals in the Capital Region. After a long career as the president of the New York Business Development Corporation, Bob became the Director of Business Development at TBC in 2010. In this role, he is involved with strategic planning, client advisory services and business development.A little known fact, 30 years prior to taking the position, Bob had taken a sabbatical from his position in banking to obtain the experience needed to earn his CPA license. He earned that experience right here at Teal, Becker & Chiaramonte. In addition to his role at TBC, Bob is a board member for Sterling Bank Corp, parent company of Sterling National Bank, a NYSE company with over $7 billion in assets where he also serves on the audit and compensation committees.

Providing a high security password from an initial character string of lowercase letter and numbers, and inclusion of one or more other characters



Patent number:  9697351
                                            

Abstract:  A technique supplies a high security password. The technique involves receiving, by processing circuitry, a series of randomly generated values from random number generator circuitry. The technique further involves deriving, by the processing circuitry, an initial character string from the series of randomly generated values, each character of the initial character string being an element of a first collection of characters which includes lowercase letters and numbers. The technique further involves providing, by the processing circuitry and as the high security password, a modified character string based on (i) the initial character string and (ii) inclusion of at least one element of a second collection of characters which is mutually exclusive of the first collection of characters.
                        

Type: 
                                                    Grant

Patent number:  9229850
                                            

Abstract:  A method is used in mapping data storage and virtual machines. A logical volume from a data storage system is provided for use by a hypervisor.

Apparatus for controlling embedded security on a storage platform



Patent number:  8751827
                                            

Abstract:  A method of securely operating a computerized system includes forming a connection to a user-removable physical security device (PSD) which is uniquely paired with the computerized system and which stories cryptographically secured data required for performing a protected function on the computerized system. The PSD may be realized as a USB or similar peripheral device containing security-related data and potentially security processing capability as well. The protected function could be decrypting of encrypted data encryption keys used to encrypt/decrypt user data for example. A user who has an established association with the PSD (e.g. by some preceding registration process) is authenticated, resulting in activation of the PSD on the computerized system. Upon such activation of the PSD, the computerized system engages in a security operation using the cryptographically secured data from the PSD to enable the protected function to be performed under control of the user on the computerized system.

Providing secure access to a set of credentials within a data security mechanism of a data storage system



Patent number:  8555342
                                            

Abstract:  A technique provides secure access to a set of credentials within a data storage system. The technique involves obtaining a unique identifier (e.g., a hostname which is unique to the system) and a set of stable values (e.g., machine-generated codes which are random to users of the system); and, in response to a storage request from a client application, storing a set of credentials of the client application within a data security mechanism of the data storage system. The set of credentials is in encrypted form when stored within the data security mechanism of the data storage system. The technique further involves configuring the data security mechanism of the data storage system to provide the set of credentials in non-encrypted form in response to new fingerprints matching a system fingerprint which is formed at least in part from the unique identifier and the set of stable values.

Inter-process communication management



Patent number:  8407720
                                            

Abstract:  Inter-process communication management allows a first data storage system management application to execute a second data storage system management application. For example, when a user directs a client device to execute a second application while executing a first application, the client device establishes an inter-process communication (IPC) channel between the two applications to allow for security and navigation commands to be passed from the first application to the second application. With such a configuration, the first application does not require the user to re-enter information, such as a target IP address, and encrypted password to execute the second application. In one arrangement, the IPC channel is configured to detect the termination of either the first or the second application. Once detected, the client device can safely terminate the IPC channel between the two applications and execute the remaining, non-terminated application as a standalone product.

Resolving multiple master node conflict in a DDB



Patent number:  7730180
                                            

Abstract:  In a multinode computer network, a directory database (DDB) in each of the nodes, contents of the DDB being replicated throughout the network through use of one of its nodes having been appointed as master node. The master node updates each DDB in each node in its network or domain configuration when the configuration changes. A global administrator has authority to replace or select a master node and to configure a domain, and performs these and other functions by way of computer terminal screen dialogs offered by a graphical user interface (GUI) associated with the computer network. In the case of multiple master nodes attempting to be master for the same nodes in the same network at the same time, this conflict is resolved in one embodiment of the present invention by allowing the most recently selected purported master node to be the actual master node. After resolution of this conflict the result is communicated by the prevailing master node to all nodes in the network.

Patent number:  7624155
                                            

Abstract:  A data replication facility for distributed computing environments. A computer network having a plurality of network nodes utilizes a distributed directory provider service (DPS) having an established master node. The DPS supports a file replication service (FRS). The FRS establishes one of the nodes as originator node which receives new or updated files from one or more user/GUIs and/or from one or more software providers such as a security provider. The originator node in cooperation with the master node establish a backup copy of the new or updated file in the master node. Thereafter, the originator node publishes a File Version Variable (FVV) representation of the new or updated file to other network nodes (slave nodes) which obtain such file from the originator or, if need be, from the backup master node.

Bob Lazar


 



The Insiders




Bob Lazar
..





Robert Scott Lazar or Bob Lazar (born January 26, 1959,
in Coral Gables, Florida, United States, to Albert Lazar and Phyllis Berliner),
claims to have worked from 1988 until 1989 as a physicist at an area called
S-4
(Sector Four), located near Groom
Lake, Nevada, next to Area
51. According to Lazar, S-4 served as a hidden military location for
the study and possible reverse engineering of extraterrestrialflying saucers.
Lazar says he saw nine different discs there and provides details on their
mode of propulsion. His critics have asserted that "Lazar's credibility
crumbled" after "schools he was supposed to have attended had no record
of him, while others in the scientific community had no memory of ever
meeting him."[2]
Biography and claims
Lazar first jumped on the media map in 1982 in the
Los Alamos Monitor. The article titled "LA MAN JOINS THE JET SET - AT 200
MILES AN HOUR" was about a jet car that Lazar had created and worked on
for years with help from a NASA researcher. The car was built from a jet
engine modified and placed on an existing car model. It is also important
to note that the article noted Lazar as "a physicist at the Los Alamos
Meson Physics Facility", as it is one media article that puts Robert on
the map as a physicist.[3]
In November 1989, Lazar appeared in a special interview
with investigative reporter George Knapp on Las Vegas TV station KLAS to
discuss his purported employment at S-4. In his interview with Knapp, Lazar
said he first thought the saucers were secret terrestrial aircraft whose
test flights must have been responsible for many UFO reports. Gradually,
on closer examination and from having been shown multiple briefing documents,
Lazar came to the conclusion that the discs were actually of extraterrestrial
origin. In his filmed testimony Lazar explains how this impression first
hit him after he boarded one craft being studied and examined its interior.[4]
For the propulsion of the studied vehicles, Bob Lazar
claims that the atomic Element
115 served as a nuclear fuel. Element 115 (nicknamed 'Ununpentium'
(Uup)) reportedly provided an energy source which would produce anti-gravity
effects under proton bombardment along with antimatter for energy production,
as the intense strong nuclear force field of Element 115's nucleus would
be properly amplified the resulting large-scale gravitational effect would
be a distortion of the surrounding space-time continuum that would, in
effect, greatly shorten the distance and travel time to a charted destination.[5]
Lazar also claims that he was given introductory briefings
describing the historical involvement by extraterrestrial beings with this
planet for the past 1,000,000 years. The beings originate from the Zeta
Reticuli 1 & 2 star system and are therefore referred to as Zeta
Reticulians, popularly called 'Greys'.[6]
Lazar says he has degrees from the California Institute
of Technology and Massachusetts Institute of Technology. In 1993, the Los
Angeles Times looked into his background and found there was no evidence
to support his claims.[1] Stanton Friedman was only able to verify that
Lazar took electronics courses in the late 1970s at Pierce Junior College.[7]
The Times did discover that in 1990 Lazar had pled guilty to felony
pandering (he installed a computer system for a local brothel[8], declared
bankruptcy and listed his occupation as self-employed photo processor on
documents.[1] A 1991 Times article reported, Lazar was "on probation
in Clark County, Nevada, on a pandering charge. His educational and professional
background cannot be verified - a fact he attributes to government deletion
of records."[9]
Desert Blast
Lazar and long time friend Gene Huff run Desert Blast,
an annual festival for "explodaholics" in the Nevada desert. Starting in
1987 (but only formally named in 1991, inspired by Desert Storm) the festival
features home-made explosives, rockets, jet-powered vehicles, and other
pyrotechnics, with the intention of emphasizing the fun aspect of physics.[10][11]
United Nuclear
In the year 2000 Lazar started United Nuclear, an amateur
scientific supply company formerly operated in Sandia Park, New Mexico
and recently moved to Laingsburg, MI. United Nuclear sells a variety of
materials including radioactive ores, powerful magnets, scientific curiosities
like aerogel,
and a variety of lab chemicals. United Nuclear claims "over 300,000 satisfied
customers," including law-enforcement agencies, schools and amateur scientists.[12]
In 2006 Lazar and wife Joy White were charged with
violating the Federal Hazardous Substances Act for shipping restricted
chemicals across state lines following a federal investigation started
in 2003. The charges stemmed from a 2003 raid on Lazar's business where
chemical sales records were examined. The maximum penalty is 270 days in
prison and a $15,000 fine.[13] Lazar claimed that he mistakenly concluded
that he could legally sell the chemicals after finding incorrect information
on the internet.[14]
In 2007 Lazar/United Nuclear were fined $7,500 for
violating a law against selling chemicals and components used to make illegal
fireworks.[15] Lazar "pled guilty to three criminal counts of introducing
into interstate commerce and aiding and abetting the introduction into
interstate commerce of banned hazardous substances."Lazar also "entered
into a consent decree that permanently limits the amount of future sales
of fireworks-related chemicals", and United Nuclear Scientific Equipment
and Supplies was placed on probation for three years.[16] 
Lazar again gained attention in 2006 from news reports
that he sold small amounts of Polonium,
a radioactive element which was in the news because of its role in fatally
poisoning former Soviet intelligence agent and whistleblower Alexander
Litvinenko.[17]
Fact or Fiction
Although his stories have garnered some rather interesting
fanfare and media attention, it is hard to determine what the truth really
is. Some hold out for Bob's story, but the majority of others remain skeptical.
Including Stanton Friedman, who looked into Lazar's claims and did his
own investigating on the matter.[7] Another debunker is Dr. David L. Morgan.
Morgan looked into all of Lazar's scientific claims and put down most of
the ideas that Lazar had elaborated on in his description of the alien
spacecraft, particularly its propulsion systems and use of Element 115.
Morgan also went on to say, "After reading an account by Bob Lazar of
the "physics"� of his Area 51 UFO propulsion system, my conclusion is this:
Mr. Lazar presents a scenario which, if it is correct, violates a whole
handful of currently accepted physical theories. That in and of itself
does not necessarily mean that his scenario is impossible. But the presentation
of the scenario by Lazar is troubling from a scientific standpoint. Mr.
Lazar on many occasions demonstrates an obvious lack of understanding of
current physical theories."[18]

Robert Lazar Security
Badge
Older version of Wikipedia
Robert Lazar Security BadgeIn November 1989, Lazar
appeared in a special interview with investigative reporter George Knapp
on Las Vegas TV station KLAS to talk about the several aspects and implications
of his work at S-4.[4]
Bob Lazar says he was initially introduced to work
at S-4 by Dr. Edward Teller. He claims his tasks consisted in the scientific
investigation of the propulsion system of one of nine disc-shaped aircraft,
as a general part of the ongoing reverse engineering project taking place
at S-4.[5]
Lazar claims that he initially thought the saucers
were secret, terrestrial aircraft, whose test flights must have been responsible
for many of the UFO reports. However, Lazar stated that, gradually, on
closer examination and from having been shown multiple briefing documents,
he came to the conclusion that the discs must have been of extraterrestrial
origin. In his filmed testimony, Lazar claims that this impression first
hit him after he boarded the craft under study and examined their interior.[6]
For vehicular propulsion Lazar claims that an unexpectedly
stable element with atomic number 115 served as nuclear fuel. The onboard
Element 115 or Ununpentium reactor reportedly provided an enormous energy
source for the triad of gravity-field generators located in the bottom
section of the craft. The energy conversion rate of this reactor supposedly
allowed a craft at least 20 years' operation on less than a quarter-kilogram
of Element 115.
An additional property of Element 115 also allowed
its reactor to produce a very miniscule Gravity-A wave which was fantastically
amplified and channelled through the gravity-distortion devices to provide
lift and propulsion for the alleged alien vehicles. Gravity-A is distinguished
from Gravity-B in that Gravity-A acts only between atomic nuclear components
and is vastly more powerful than the Gravity-B which we all know from our
own everyday experience.[7]
Lazar further claimed that he was given introductory
briefings describing the historical involvement by extraterrestrial beings
with this planet for 10,000 years. He claimed that the beings originated
from the Zeta Retuculi 1 & 2 star system and are therefore referred
to as Zeta Reticulans, and are what many people refer to as the 'Greys'.[8]
 





.."W-2"
presented by Robert S. Lazar
On his commercial United Nuclear
website, Bob Lazar writes in the 'about'-section: "Bob had previously worked
at Los Alamos National Laboratory (specifically in the Meson Physics facility
), involved with experiments using the 1/2 mile long Linear Particle Accelerator."[13]
Critics have argued that the Los Alamos Nuclear Laboratory could not back
up this claim: the experimental laboratory denied ever having employed
Lazar. Investigative reporter George Knapp, however, found Bob Lazar's
name among that of other scientists in the 1982 Los Alamos phone book,
indicating Lazar did work there as a technician.
In August 1990, George Knapp,
the reporter that first broke the story, uncovered a W2 for Robert Lazar.
This slip represents payments, after deductions, for five days, (non-consecutive)
working at the S4 base.  Lazar started at the end of December 1988.

Bob Lazar: The Man Behind Element

Investigative Reporter George Knapp

How does this sound -- a conversion kit that would
allow your car to run on clean, plentiful hydrogen? It's in the works in
New Mexico, and the name of the guy who is building it may ring a bell.
He's Bob Lazar, and 16 years ago he told the I-Team's George Knapp about
Area 51 and said scientists there were studying UFOs. He dropped out of
sight, but George caught up with him.
As a teenager, Bob Lazar built a jet-powered bicycle,
then a jet Honda, then a jet dragster. These day's he's focused on a different
propulsion system. Bob Lazar, former government scientist, said, "Every
vehicle we have here is powered by hydrogen."
At his new home in rural New Mexico, Lazar has been
working on a conversion kit that will turn any car into a hydrogen hybrid.
His two vehicles have already been converted and can travel up to 450 miles
on hydrogen, then switch automatically back to gasoline. Lazar wants to
take it a step further.
Lazar said, "Every major car company is working on
a hydrogen system, but the only difference is, they want to sell you a
new hydrogen car and sell you hydrogen gas at hydrogen gas stations. Basically,
we're making a conversion kit you can use in your own car and instead of
buying hydrogen from someone else, you make it."
He makes hydrogen using water and a solar powered generator.
But again, with a Lazar twist. "It's the only particle accelerator on the
block, I guarantee ya."
The small lab behind his home has a 30-foot long particle
accelerator he built from scratch. He uses it to produce metal hydrides,
which absorb hydrogen gas like a sponge and make it much safer to use as
a fuel.
Lazar says, "You can do that with ordinary metal hydrides
but we found a way to manipulate the atomic structure to change things.
It's worked fantastically."
George Knapp teases, "It almost sounds like you're
a real scientist."
Lazar replies, "That's what they tell me."
It's an inside joke based on the ridicule Lazar has
faced ever since he went public in 1989 with his claims that he worked
on flying saucers in the Nevada desert. The military refused to answer
any questions about Lazar or his claims, nor could we verify much of anything
about his life.
Lazar told us he previously worked at Los Alamos National
Lab. The lab repeatedly denied it, even after we found Lazar's name in
the lab phone book. His critics say that since he can't prove he ever earned
a college degree, he can't be a real scientist, even if he can build jet
engines, hydrogen systems and particle accelerators.
Is there a way to prove any part of his story? Maybe.
In 1989, Lazar claimed the ET saucers he worked on could produce their
own gravity. This propulsion was made possible by a superheavy substance
Lazar called Element 115. What is the problem with this story? Element
115 did not exist in 1989. Now, however, it does.
Scientists at the Lawrence Livermore Lab created a
miniscule amount of 115 last year. A profound development, but the material
decayed almost instantly. So where did the government get 500 pounds of
the stuff, which is what Lazar claimed long ago?
Lazar says, "It has to come from some place where it's
natural, like from a super nova."
In other words, it comes from a solar system other
than ours. Lazar's critics say the fact that 115 as created in a lab is
unstable and fleeting proves Lazar is a liar. Lazar says the first batch
was only a starting point and that he will be proven right in the long
run.
"I'd like to see them continue to work and produce
different isotopes of 115 because they're gonna come up with a handful
of different varieties and they're gonna come up with a stable isotope,
and that's what we're interested," he countered.
By no means does he dwell on being proven right. He
and his wife have left the UFO crowd far behind and could care less, they
say. Lazar stands by his original story, but says, "I can't say I would
do it again. I would probably keep my mouth shut this time."
George Knapp inquired, "But you must get a twinge about
the program."
Lazar said, "Oh sure. I mean, who wouldn't like to
go back and see what they're doing now? But on the other hand, I'd rather
be here."
Earlier this year, British scientists
say they demonstrated an anti-gravity system that appears to be based on
the theories revealed years ago by Lazar. Some scientists say it's proof
that what Lazar said about Element 115 is true after all.

..





A calcium-48 ion is accelerated
to a high velocity in a cyclotron and directed at an americium-243 target.
LIVERMORE, Calif. � Scientists
from the Glenn T. Seaborg Institute and the Chemical Biology and Nuclear
Science Division at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, in collaboration
with researchers from the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research in Russia
(JINR), have discovered the two newest super heavy elements, element 113
and element 115.
In experiments conducted at the
JINR U400 cyclotron with the Dubna gas-filled separator between July 14
and Aug. 10, 2003, the team of scientists observed atomic decay patterns,
or chains, that confirm the existence of element 115 and element 113. In
these decay chains, element 113 is produced via the alpha decay of element
115.
The results have been accepted
for publication in the Feb. 1, 2004 issue of Physical Review C.

The Lazar Synopsis
..





by Gene Huff
posted to alt.conspiracy.area51
12 Mar 1995
Summary: This is a synopsis,
or maybe booklet, of Bob Lazar's story which is being offered as a ground
zero for future dialogue.
This is a synopsis, or maybe
booklet, of Bob Lazar's story which is being offered as a ground zero for
future dialogue. After coming to the internet a short time ago, I noticed
that people's knowledge of Bob's story varied widely. This is an effort
to increase that knowledge base so people who either support or dismiss
Bob's story do it for the right reasons. Bob's story is long and complex
and in this document I've tried to condense it to a manageable size without
omitting relevant points. I'm going to emphasize how things looked from
my point of view. I won't elaborate on propulsion systems and things of
that sort, so if you want that you can get it on the Lazar Tape and hear
if from Bob himself. So here we go...
In the late 1980's I was working
as a real estate appraiser in Las Vegas, and still am for that matter.
Bob Lazar, known as "Bob, the photo guy" to most Las Vegas appraisers operated
the photo lab that serviced many appraisers at that time. Bob and I had
met in 1985 and by 1988 we had become friends and began to socialize together.
Bob's wife, Tracy, usually did the photo deliveries to our office and,
at first, I had talked to her and seen her infinitely more than Bob. Periodically
she would talk about when she and Bob lived in Los Alamos, not together,
and I just presumed that he ran a photo lab down there. Bob and Tracy met
when Tracy was hired to work at a business run buy Bob's first wife, Carol.
Tracy's dad, Don Merck, worked at the Los Alamos National Lab (LANL from
here on out) and that's how she happened to be living there. Don worked
on the conventional charge that implodes and compresses the nuke material
to make an atomic bomb explode.
After Bob and I started socializing,
I began to notice that he knew a lot about many things. I knew that he
was somewhat of an egghead because, when he would do a rare photo delivery,
he would drive a Honda CRX in which he had installed a jet engine. But
his knowledge base extended far beyond that. There was little he didn't
know about jet engines, combution engines, electronics, computer hardware
and software, etc. He even made some nitro- glycerin one day while we sat
talking at the kitchen table. We later took it out to the desert and blew
it up, that's how I knew it was, indeed, a high energy explosive. Eventually,
I asked him why he knew all of this stuff. He said, "I've got degrees in
physics and electronic technology". I said, "Well, what's the difference
between you and a scientist?" He said, " I AM a scientist". I said, "Why
didn't you tell me?" He said, "What did you want me to do, say hey man,
I'm a scientist"? I said, "Yeah, I would have". He just shook his head
and walked away. I later found out that he had worked at the Meson Physics
facility at LANL.
All this time, I just thought
he was some guy who ran a photo lab and just happened to have an interest
in jet engines. He also had, and still has, a rail type dragster with a
jet engine from one of the military's first supersonic fighters. Anyway,
in time, I met: Bob's dad, Al; his mother, Phyllis; Tracy's dad Don; Joe
Vaninetti, an old friend from Los Alamos. Joe's last job at LANL was melting
down plutonium. He is currently completing his masters in soils analysis
(soils science?) up in Utah. You'll hear more about Joe later; Melissa
Crey (maybe Cray) Joe's room mate and a physicist at LANL; and Jim Tagliani,
and old friend and computer & electronic tech. All of these people
seemed to think Bob was a scentist and, to this day, I have no reason to
doubt him and numerous reasons to believe him. Jim Tagliani actually worked
with Bob at Fairchild Electronics in southern Cal where Bob was the youngest
electrical engineer ever to have worked there. This was a couple of years
prior to Bob's Los Alamos job.
At this point, in 1988, Bob was
bored with the photo lab and had sent out resumes to various government
labs to try and get back into another scientific job. Included on that
list was Dr. Edward Teller, the father of the hydrogen bomb and scientific
consultant to the last 5 or 6 presidents. Bob had met Teller in 1982 in
Los Alamos when Teller was there lecturing. Coincidentally, at this same
time, Bob's picture was on the front page of the Los Alamos Monitor newspaper.
A staff writer named Terry England had done an article on Bob and a Honda
CRX in which he had installed a jet engine. This wasn't the same jet CRX
he had when I first met him. This article ran in the June 27, 1982 edition
of that paper and in it they refer to Bob as, and I quote, "Lazar, a physicist
at the Los Alamos Meson Physics Facility". It's difficult to believe that
in a town of 10,000 scientists, who all have egos about their credentials,
the only local newspaper could refer to Bob as a scientist if he was not
one, at least not without any public outrage. Anyway, when Bob arrived
early to hear Teller speak, there Teller sat reading the newspaper article
about Bob. Bob used this as an avenue to introduce himself and they had
a short chat about jets, etc. Bob later heard Teller's speech and that
was that. So in 1988 when Bob sent out all of these resumes, he thought,
why not take a shot?
..





Joe, Bob, Gene, John 
It had been a while since he
sent out these resumes and one day I dropped by his house and asked him
if he had heard any news. He said, "As a matter of fact, yeah, Edward Teller
called me". I said, "Who's Edward Teller?". After he explained, I understood
the importance of the call. Teller had responded by phone and said that
he was no longer active, but currently worked in a chief consultant capacity.
However, Teller did give Bob the name of a gentleman to call here in Las
Vegas. Bob called this guy and talked to him and a short time later, someone
from EG&G called Bob to set up an interview. EG&G is a company
that has all kinds of high tech interests here at the Nevada Test Site.
Bob threw away the piece of paper with the name Teller gave him on it.
Remember, at this point in time, nobody knew what Bob was headed for and
it's obvious that it would be nice to have that name now.
So Bob went to EG&G for the
interview. Bob later told me that he "dazzled" them by having every answer
to some pretty complex questions and he was optimistic about getting the
job. This was unusual because Bob isn't one to pat himself on the back.
However, dazzling them temporarily backfired because they told him he was
overqualified for the job and he didn't get it. They then told him not
to lose hope because they had something coming up that he might be interested
in. Ultimately, they called him back and hired him to work on a propulsion
project in an "outer area".
Bob reported to the EG&G
building at McCarran airport, which had runway access, where he was met
by Dennis Mariani. Mariani was a security man of medium build and heighth,
about 35 to 40 years old, blonde hair and a tightly cropped blonde mustache.
Mariani had a military look and manner, but he didn't wear a uniform. With
Mariani as his escort, Bob was flown out to area 51 at Groom Lake.
At area 51, Bob had to sign a
secrecy agreeement and an agreement to waive his constitutional rights,
which is illegal but was made possible by an executive order with Ronald
Reagan's signature on it. He also had to sign an agreement which allowed
them to monitor his phone line. Bob already had "Q" clearance, which is
top secret civilian clearance, at Los Alamos but he had never gone through
anything like this. The clearance he was now attaining would require perpetual
monitoring of his activities and would never simply be attained and forgotten
about until the next review date. After some abrupt suggestions that he
honor his secrecy agreement and watch his general conduct, he and Mariani
boarded a bus with blacked out windows and took a 20 to 30 minute ride
down a bumpy dirt/gravel road. They arrived at a base near Papoose dry
lake bed know as S4.
S4 was a combination of buildings
and hangars built into the side of a mountain. Armed guards were everywhere,
and security was oppressive. Bob even got an armed escort when he went
to the bathroom. They arranged Bob's I.D. and gave him a physical which
included a test for allergic reactions to substances which were not identified
for Bob. After this he was placed in a briefing room by himself to read
some briefings as part of his indoctrination. As Mariani closed the door
to leave Bob alone, Bob saw a poster on the back of the door. It was a
"flying saucer" hovering over a dry lake bed and it was captioned, "They're
Here". Bob opened the top folder on the desk and it contained 8 x 10 glossy
photos of 9 different flying saucers, including the one on the poster.
To this day, no one knows why
Bob was selected for this project. Bob has a comprehensive knowledge base
and is an excellent problem solver, but this may not be uncommon in the
scientific community. Maybe the good word from Edward Teller carried a
lot of weight. It's even possible that the nod from Teller carried more
weight than was originally intended, no one knows.
At this point in time, Tracy
helped with the photo lab during the day and worked out at a health club
and took flying lessons at night. Bob was on call for S4 and would generally
be called to go out once every week or two. They said he'd be working on
an on call basis until he was "brought up to speed", at which time he would
work on a more consistant basis. They'd always have Bob report in the late
afternoon and work evenings which allowed him to maintain the photo lab
during the day. Bob was now very secretive about his job and would only
tell his wife and friends that he was working on something that required
clearance. He eventually did tell us that he flew into area 51 when he
went to work. We had no idea what he was actually doing and, because of
that, none of us were overly curious as to what his project was.
Around this same time, KLAS,
the CBS affiliate is Las Vegas, had been running local news shows, featuring
UFO researchers, which I found entertaining and intriguing. These shows
were hosted by George Knapp, a local news anchor who is now high profile
and arguably the most informative and motivating speaker on the UFO circuit.
George doesn't speak as regularly as "UFO experts", but is infinitely more
informed than them, especially with things ufological in Nevada. On these
shows, much ado was being made about alleged UFOs and aliens at area 51.
Bob assured us that there were no UFOs at area 51. As it ended up, he was
telling the truth. They were at S4 and they were called "discs" and they
were anything but "unidentified".
Bob had been hired to be part
of a "back engineering" team. Back engineering is the act of taking apart
a finished product to find out what makes it tick. In this instance, their
job was to back engineer a flying disc to see if it could be reproduced
with earth materials. Bob's specific job was to help back engineer the
propulsion system. In subsequent trips to S4 Bob was exposed to the propulsion
system on a bench in a lab, as well as the propulsion system, in place,
in a disc. In a sleek disc he would eventually nickname the "sport model"
Bob had to hang upside down through an opening on the floor of the central
level to view the gravity amplifiers on the lower level. He eventually
witnessed a brief, low altitude test flight of this same disc. He was also
taught how the discs are able to distort space/time to achieve interstellar
travel. The "Sport Model" disc is currently being produced as a plastic
model by the Testor Corporation.
In subsequent visits to the briefing
room, he read read overview reports which were used to give the diverse
group of S4 scientists some idea of the breadth of the project. Naturally,
they were all given in depth information regarding their own particular
endeavors, but it seems that they couldn't put good scientific minds to
work and compartmentalize information so much that someone wouldn't say,
" By the way, aren't these flying saucers we're working on?". The scientists
at S4 worked in teams and were obviously not allowed to chat in the lunch
room about what everybody else was doing so apparently they gave them all
a limited overview to satisfy their curiousity and keep them sane.
In these reports Bob read information
about man's history and philosophy and theology and the part that these
aliens, who brought the disc technology, played in these areas. Much of
this information was alarming, even shocking, and it has certainly changed
my life. This information, combined with the defense capabilities and possibilities
of disc technology and gravity propulsion , has caused this to be the most
secret program in history and THE pet project which the military and political
elite have kept from the rest of the DOD and, for that matter, the rest
of mankind.
..





During this time, agents from
the Office of Federal Investigation, the OFI, would randomly visit Bob's
house. The OFI agents are the guys who do background checks on people hired
for classified positions on the Nevada Test Site, and elsewhere I would
imagine. One time an agent named Mike Thigpen visited with other agents
and searched Bob's house and belongings. Thigpen was witnessed there by
Kristen Merck, Bob's now ex-sister-in-law and Mrs. Wayne Higdon, the wife
of a mutual friend of Bob's and mine. George Knapp later asked Thigpen
what he was doing at Bob's house. Thigpen claimed he had no file on it
and he couldn't remember being there. He said maybe he was there asking
Bob questions about Jim Tagliani, a friend of ours who was then trying
to get clearance to work as an electronics technician at the stealth fighter
base on the Tonopah Test Range. This was a ridiculous response. Thousands
of people nationwide have been visited by investigators from the OFI or
DOD to respond to questions about friends and neighbors and relatives who
are in the process of getting cleared for classified positions. These agents
hardly retain the right to search your house and personal belongings. Obviously,
Thigpen was doing his job by not remembering being at Bob's house, even
though he was witnessed there by two women who didn't even really know
each other. In defense of the OFI investigators, the guys doing the background
checks are not necessarily informed of the destination of the subject of
their investigation. Even if Thigpen had admitted his activities at Bob's
house, this would have been no sort of verification that he knew what Bob
was in for. The depth of the requisite investigation may indicate the level
of security clearance, but not the actuality of the subject's employment.
Around this same time, the U.S.
scientists at S4 had made some sort of discovery which was a major step
forward in understanding disc technology and gravity propulsion. We had
apparently involved some Russian scientists to whatever degree, and rather
than share this advance with them, we kicked them out. Bob doesn't know
that the Russians were allowed to actually work with the hardware. They
may have only been involved in the mathematical and physical theory, he
doesn't know. Anyway, the Russians weren't pleased about being left out.
One of the S4 scientists didn't show up for work for a couple of days and
security was paranoid. They said that the KGB had a presence in Las Vegas
and they were afraid that they would either abduct someone that worked
at S4 or make the bribe so good that someone wouldn't be able to refuse.
The S4 guy eventually turned up, but security wanted to be safe rather
than sorry. They decided to make everyone in the program who flew out from
EG&G carry guns from home to EG&G and from EG&G back home.
At EG&G, a female official
distributed a small caliber pistol to Bob and told him that if he lost
it, he'd have to pay them $500 for it. Bob said no way, because he knew
this pistol wasn't even worth $500. After some discussion, Bob made them
aware that he had a .44 magnum, amongst other guns, and they agreed that
he would carry his own gun. However, since all of Bob's guns were purchased
in New Mexico and had never been registered, they wanted Bob to register
his guns so everything was legal. Dennis Mariani escorted Bob down to the
Las Vegas Metro substation on the southwest corner of Atlantic and St.
Louis. Bob sat in a waiting area and Mariani went in and spoke about whatever
with the police official in charge. A short time later, the police official
came out of the office with Mariani to make a copy of something. He looked
at Bob and scoffed, "So THIS is the kid the Russians might be after?" I
guess Bob wasn't the big, strong, he-man required to command this guy's
respect. It's curious that Mariani would have even mentioned anything like
that to a local cop. In Nevada, you can carry a gun in your car as long
as it's not concealed. Your car is interpreted as an extension of your
home, so Bob didn't need a permit to carry a concealed weapon or anything
like that. This event has subsequently caused us to question whether or
not Dennis Mariani was from Nevada.
Also around this same time something
was going on that Bob didn't know about. The feds monitoring his phone
line had heard Tracy talking with her flight instructor, who was teaching
her more than just how to fly. She was having an affair and they knew that
if Bob inadvertantly found out or if Tracy confessed, Bob could potentially
become emotionally unstable. They kept him involved at S4 on a limited
basis but the time intervals between calls to work lengthened and he became
frustrated. This was ultimately a blessing for Jim Tagliani and me.
Bob sensed that something was
wrong. They had give him a taste of honey and he had a strong desire to
get back out to S4. He would hear us talking about George Knapp's UFO shows
and we would wonder aloud about the actuality of the situation. In a rebellious
move, Bob threw us some hints and finally decided that he would do us the
favor of allowing us to KNOW, not suspect, that something was really happening.
After not being called to work for some time, he broke down and told me.
I understand that he told Jim Tagliani around the same time. We didn't
have group meetings or anything like that. Jim didn't know what I knew
and I didn't know what Jim knew. Bob was the central cog in that relationship
and, though I consider Jim Tagliani a friend, we seldom socialize together
unless Bob is involved.
When Bob told me we were riding
down Alta drive in my car. He said that he was working at S4 on flying
discs and he was back engineering the propulsion system. I was intrigued
to say the least. He said one of the discs looked like it had been stood
up on it's edge to have a projectile fired through it to test the integrity
of the metal or something along those lines. The conversation was brief,
but I remember it like it was yesterday.
I now had a million questions
to ask Bob, but we couldn't talk on the telephone and, considering the
state of the art in listening devices, we couldn't talk at his house either.
This confirmation increased my appetite for reading UFO literature exponentially.
I soon saw that no one knew what Bob knew and I was lucky enough to have
him telling me. When we felt it was safe and convenient we would have discussions
and he would tell me things about S4 and I would tell him things that I
had read. We both found it hilarious that organizations like MUFON andCUFON
named themselves by placing UFON after their initials. So we jokingly nicknamed
each other Bufon and Gufon, for Bob's UFO network and Gene's UFO network,
respectively. These were nicknames that, later, government agents would
not find so funny.
Around this same time, Bob received
his first paycheck for one week's pay even though the days had never been
worked consecutively. The check was for $958.11. Bob showed me the check
and I remember commenting that I thought that a senior staff physicist,
which was Bob's position, would have been paid more than that. He proceeded
to tell me how underpaid scientists were and I later found out that was
true. I think I was the only one, other than Bob, to ever see that check.
He had his eye on some electronic equipment so he decided to buy it and
not tell Tracy that the check had ever arrived. In later years when people
questioned Bob's W-2, I knew it was actual because, even though I didn't
remember the exact amount, I knew that it was nine hundred and fifty or
sixty bucks which showed me that Bob's W-2 reflected the money actually
received. Later, when he left the program, the government still owed him
for some time worked, a bill which remains unpaid to this day.
The next time he was called to
work, the people at S4 were questioning Bob about his friend, Joe Vaninetti.
They implied they might be interested in Joe and wanted Bob to get a resume
from Joe and take it to the office at EG&G. On the day when Bob told
them he'd have it there, he was busy and couldn't make it. Since Joe was
still down in Los Alamos, Bob asked me to drop it off for him. I took Joe's
resume out to EG&G and the receptionist asked me what I was doing there.
I told her that I had Joe's resume and she grabbed it from me as though
she was expecting it. We still don't know if they were interested in Joe
or they just wanted to know more about him because he was Bob's main, but
not only, Los Alamos connection. They may have heard Bob talking on the
phone with Joe or something like that, no one knows. The bottom line is,
they never hired Joe and his name was never brought up again.
On one of Bob's last nights at
S4, he was being escorted down a hallway by armed guards and was told to
keep his eyes forward. As they passed a door with one of those small square
windows in it, out of the corner of his eye, Bob thought he saw a small
"grey" alien standing between two men in lab coats. All three were facing
a console of some sort and had their backs to the door. When he tried to
turn his head to actually look and confirm his sighting, he was pushed
forward by a guard behind him and told, again, to keep his eyes forward.
Bob recognized it as a "grey" alien because these types of beings were
shown in reports in the briefing room. To this point, he had surmised that
any grey aliens had been gone since 1979, at least that's what the briefing
reports implied. The sight in that room surprised him, to say the least.
After work that night, Bob arrived
home and Tracy was gone, apparently to her flying lesson. He needed someone
to talk to so he called me. I had been sick with the flu all that day and
my wife had been nursing me back to health all that evening. I let the
answering machine go off and after it beeped, I heard Bob say, "Gufon,
it's Bufon, pick up the phone". I answered and he suggested that we get
together that night. I explained to him that I had been sick and, after
all of my wife's efforts, she would be mad if I left. He insisted and said
that he wanted to talk to me about those "baby pictures". He and I had
no business with baby pictures so I recognized this as code and he mentioned
photos so if anyone was listening, they wouldn't be suspicious. I reminded
him that I rise early and suggested we get together the next morning. I
asked if he would be up at that early hour. He replied that he would probably
be up all night. I told him I'd talk to my wife and call him right back.
I told my wife that something
big must have been up because he was so persistent. After all, we already
knew he was working on flying saucers so this had to be something big.
Whatever it was he wanted to talk about was so important that he risked
sounding suspicious to those monitoring his phone. I called Bob back to
tell him I'd come over and, oddly, there was no answer. I thought maybe
he had stepped out to get something to eat. I'd wait about 5 minutes between
calls, but he didn't answer the next four times I called him. Finally,
on the sixth call he picked up the phone and said, "I'll have to call you
back, some people from work are here. Bob didn't call back that night,
but since I had the flu, I fell asleep anyway. As it ended up, right after
I had hung up with him the first time, government agents arrived at his
door and wanted to know who this "Gufon" character was. To them, this sounded
like a code name, not a joke. Bob explained and they stayed there and filled
out a multi-page report on Gene Huff aka Gufon. We don't know if these
were the guys who were actually listening to our conversation or if they
had been radioed or telephoned about it. However they found out, they couldn't
have been far from Bob's house to arrive that quickly.
The next morning I arrived at
my office around seven. I had taken some baby pictures to the office with
me, just in case. Bob walked into my office around seven thirty and motioned
with his hands in an effort to tell me to watch what I said. He now knew
they were suspicious of me and he didn't want to talk in my office or on
my phone. It was highly unusual for Bob to ever be at my office before
ten thirty or so and his face was very ruddy. He looked like he just may
have been up all night. I said, "Here are those baby pictures" as I handed
them to him and he said "Thanks". Since we couldn't talk, I grabbed a legal
pad and wrote down two questions. The first one said, "Have you only flown
in planes?", as I was thinking he might have flown in a disc. The second
one said, "Has everyone you've seen been from earth?", for obvious reasons.
He grabbed the pen and answered the questions Yes and No respectively.
He said, "I'll take care of these baby pictures" and left my office. Just
to be safe, I went out to the wetbar sink at my office and burned that
piece of paper. Bob later told me the rest of the story which I've just
told you. Now, in present day, when Bob is asked about this event by strangers,
he explains it away by saying that it may just have been an alien doll
or something along those lines which was employed just to test him. He
tends to diminish this story with time, but as you can tell, that's not
what he thought back on that night.
Another substantial period of
time had passed since Bob had been called to work and one day I dropped
by his house. He answered the door and we walked out to the sidewalk in
front of his house to have a short chat. I was telling him about all of
the UFO stuff I had read recently and the whole time he was looking up
in the sky, preoccupied with his own thoughts. I was essentially whining
that everything of substance in ufology always happened a long time ago,
i.e., the Roswell crash in the '40s, the Russian sightings in the '50s.
I told him that if all this was reality, there should be something happening
somewhere, now, and that's where I wanted to be. He stopped looking at
the sky and looked at me and said, "What are you doing Wednesday night?
Bob had had it. He was tired
of them not involving him to a greater degree and he decided to rebel in
an aggressive manor. He had decided to take me to the desert out off of
the now infamous highway 375 to witness a disc flight test. Bob knew the
tests were held on Wednesday evenings right after dusk.
The first Wednesday, March 22,
1989, we arrived right at dusk, turned our lights off, and went in about
5 miles on the Groom Lake road. Soon we saw a bright light rise above the
mountains which were between us and S4. The light begin jumping and dancing
around, doing step moves in the sky, then would come to a dead stop and
hover, etc. It repeated this type of activity for a few minutes which was
thrilling, but it was so far away, we could only see so much. This activity
by the object was blatant and it wasn't our eyes playing tricks on us with
starlight and planet light being distorted by the atmosphere or clouds,
or anything of that sort. Eventually, the light slowly sat back down behind
the mountains. Little did we know that the next Wednesday, March 29, 1989,
would present us with the thrill of a lifetime. I would not generally remember
these Wednesday dates, but my son was born Wednesday, March 15, 1989, so
the Wednesday dates were easy to remember.
The next Wednesday, Bob, Tracy,
Jim Tagliani, and I rented a Lincoln towncar to make the trip a little
more comfortable. We all owned compact cars and the round trip out to Groom
Lake was a killer. We arrived, turned our lights off, and went in about
5 miles on the Groom Lake road. We pulled off on a side road and unloaded
our video camera, telescope, binoculars, etc. out of the trunk and we left
the trunk lid open.
The disc came up around the same
place but, this time, it staged a breathtaking performance. It repeated
moves similar to the week before, but this time it came down the mountain
range toward us. At first it seemed far away, then you'd blink and it would
seem a lot closer, then you'd blink again and it would seem a LOT closer.
It wasn't the same sensation as seeing a set of headlights on a car or
landing lights on a jet approach you at night time. There was no sense
of continual movement toward you, it just sort of "jumps" toward you and
this is very alarming to your brain. Bob explained that this is because
of it's method of propulsion and the way it distorts space/time and light.
Bob also explained that the bright glow of the disc was due to the way
it was energized. When the disc came our direction, it glowed so brightly
that we thought it might explode so we moved behind the open trunk lid
for protection. The fact is that an explosion was the only thing, other
than the sun, that we had ever seen be that bright so that's why we suspected
an explosion. As we all look back on that now, it's difficult to believe
it came so close that we backed away from it. After all, it was probably
still a few miles away and that fact reflects how brightly it was glowing.
But the fact is, it did come that close and the event was much more thrilling
than I've described here. It, too, eventually sat down behind the mountains
and we left. We have never seen anything comparable to this in the sky
out in central Nevada since then, and we haven't even heard other people's
descriptions come close to describing what we saw. Remember, this all happened
prior to the highway 375 sky watch becoming ufology's favorite past time.
The next Wednesday, April 5,
1989, we arrived shortly before dusk. On the drive out, Bob told us he
had been called to go into work the next day. Numerous security vehicles
were sweeping the roads that the cattle ranchers use to round-up their
cattle after open range grazing. It seemed that this night, more than the
previous Wednesday nights, they wanted to make sure no one was outside
of area 51. We tried to sneak in using our usual "stealth" mode, but security
saw our brake lights and began to chase us. We tried to beat them out to
the highway, but they came from all directions and ultimately we had to
stop. We told them we were simply out there star gazing, which they didn't
believe for one moment. They agreed that they couldn't chase us off of
public land, but simply said they would "prefer" that we retreat back up
to the highway. They issued us a copy of a written warning that said we
were approaching a military installation and it stated the Nevada Revised
Statutes which cited the penalties for taking pictures of the base, etc.
So much for those UFO researchers who say that the government won't admit
that area 51 exists. If that warning isn't an admission, I don't know what
is. We went back up to the highway, but we didn't leave. A short time later
a Lincoln County cop named LaMoreaux pulled us over and hassled us. He
took our I.D.s and radioed our identities into the security base station.
It was obvious that the guards and the sherriff's office worked together.
He let us go and we went back home.
The next day when Bob reported
to EG&G, Dennis Mariani stopped him and told him they wouldn't be flying
out to Groom. Instead, they took Bob's car and drove out to Indian Springs
Air Force Base, a small, rural base about an hour north of Las Vegas. On
the drive out Mariani sarcastically told Bob that when they told Bob this
was top secret, they presumed he understood that meant not to bring his
family or friends out to watch a disc test. He also told Bob that our shenanigans
outside of area 51 had caused them to postpone a "high performance" disc
test. Mariani was totally silent for most of the rest of the drive.
At Indian Springs, Bob was debriefed
and reprimanded for bringing us out to watch the disc test. They didn't
know we had been successful the two previous Wednesdays. They helicoptored
the head security man in from area 51 to identify Bob as one of the people
he saw when they stopped us the night before. They told him that if they
caught any of the rest of us out there again, they'd arrest us for espionage.
Bob explained that he couldn't tell us what to do and also reminded them
that we were on public land. They explained that they would simply claim
that we were on government land and that a judge would certainly believe
twenty of them before he'd believe us. They blatantly stated that they
would collectively lie to get us convicted, not that we were surprised
by that. That was certainly enough to keep me away from there, at least
for a while.
They also showed Bob transcripts
of Tracy's phone conversations with her boyfriend/flight instructor. Bob
already knew about the affair, but he was shocked to see that they had
actual typed transcripts of her conversations. Since they now knew that
he was aware of the affair, they considered him to be a sure candidate
for emotional instability. They revoked his security clearance and said
he could reapply in 6 to 9 months. They let him go back home that night,
but they apparently weren't done with him yet. A short time later they
called and demanded his presence back out on the Nevada Test Site, but
Bob refused. He knew they had no intention of letting him go this time
and he was not about to volunteer to help them out. Dennis Mariani called
and threatened him but Bob stood firm.
After losing his wife and the
most important job a scientist could ever have, Bob was pretty much a broken
man. His concern for their efforts at retaliation caused him to decide
to go on television in silhouette and tell the story of what was going
on out in central Nevada. After he did that, they shot his back tire out
one evening as he was driving up an entrance ramp to get on the highway.
This was an extra hint at what was in store for him if he didn't shut up.
Bob had decided to work with
George Knapp to expose the story. This was an aggressive move on his part
to try and gain some leverage. If he went high profile, he could force
them to adopt a hands off policy. After going high profile, if they incarcerated
him or killed him, they would have confirmed that what he was saying was
true, and that was definitely not their desire.
At this point, we all agreed
that there was great power in knowing that someone was listening on the
phone. People watch what they say when they suspect their phone line is
tapped, but it's a much different story when you're confident they're listening.
We called friends in other states and told them Bob's story. We would also
imply that we had informed numerous friends and agencies by mail, something
that they could not monitor. If someone actually was listening, and I think
they were, we must have driven them crazy trying to figure out what was
real. They had to prepare for the worst and presume we might be telling
the truth. Bob was being followed by unmarked cars both day and night.
I was even followed one evening.
Finally, Dennis Mariani contacted
Bob and send he wanted to meet and speak with Bob on a "personal level".
Bob set up the meeting at the Union Plaza casino in downtown Las Vegas.
The meeting was set for 8 PM on Saturday night when there's be plenty of
witnesses if anything bad happened. Joe Vaninetti happened to be in town
from Los Alamos that weekend. We created a stealth plan and Joe and I accompanied
Bob down to the Union Plaza hotel.
Bob entered first and, a short
time later, Joe and I entered and sat down to play the slot machines as
though we were tourists. Bob walked around and looked for Mariani, but
at first he couldn't find him. Bob even paged him on the house phone. Finally,
Bob saw Mariani approaching in a crowd of people and walked up to him.
Mariani wouldn't make eye contact with Bob and walked on by as if Bob wasn't
there. Bob also noticed another security man from S4 over by the wall on
the other side of the crowd. Bob casually walked by Joe and I and told
us what happened without looking at us or appearing to socialize with us.
From a distance he then saw Mariani walk into another part of the casino.
Bob asked me to go into that
other part of the casino with him, but to stay out of sight. He wanted
someone else to be able to visually identify Dennis Mariani. We entered
in a crowd and Bob pointed out Mariani, who was now sitting at a blackjack
table. I went and hid behind a bank of slot machines behind Mariani. I
was only about 20 feet from him and I had a clear view of him. He looked
exactly as Bob had described him. Thirty five to forty years old, medium
build, blonde hair , and a tightly cropped blonde mustache, and this night
he was also smoking a slender cigar.
Mariani's manor was quite curious.
He was sitting between two very attractive, very buxom, women at the blackjack
table, yet he would only look down at his cards and didn't seem to be enjoying
himself. This is unusual behavior for someone in the festive casino atmosphere
of a Saturday night in Las Vegas. Bob walked down the other side of the
blackjack pit parallel to a long bar. Mariani looked up and his head followed
Bob as Bob made that walk. Since this was the only time he looked up from
his cards, especially considering the other available scenery, this indicated
to me that he, indeed, knew who Bob was.
Bob walked around the blackjack
pit and walked right up to Mariani and said, "Well, Dennis, you said you
wanted to meet and here I am, now what's the deal?". Not only did Mariani
not answer, he didn't even look at Bob or acknowledge his existence. Bob
said, "Dennis, what the hell is going on, what is this shit?". Again, Mariani
didn't acknowledge him.
Bob came over to me behind the
slot machines and we quickly formulated a plan to follow him and try and
get his license number or something along those lines. Mariani was only
out of our sight for less than 15 seconds, but when we looked back, he
was gone. We hurried through the casino in different directions looking
for him. We even checked the restrooms, but he was nowhere to be found.
We went back to the other part of the casino where Joe was sitting and
asked him if anybody fitting Mariani's descripton had come that way. Joe
said no one who looked like that had walked by his area. We could only
surmise that maybe Mariani was there to speak on a personal level and that
the other security guy that Bob had spotted was a surprise to everyone,
including Dennis. No one has seen or heard anything from Dennis Mariani
since that night.
After this Bob proceeded to cooperate
with George Knapp, who subsequently produced "UFOs, The Best Evidence".
George won the UPI individual achievement award for that special. During
the making of that documentary, George tried to check out Bob's credentials,
including his schooling and his previous employment. George could only
find a record of Bob's schooling at Pierce Junior College in California.
Even Los Alamos denied that Bob ever worked there.
Bob provided George with evidence
that he had worked at Los Alamos. This included the names of people he
worked with, newpaper articles about him, and even a LANL phone book that
listed Bob's name in it. People were apparently going to great lengths
to detach from Bob Lazar. Eventually Bob cooperated with George in contacting
Kirk-Mayer, the LANL sub-contractor that Bob worked for at LANL. Both Kirk-Mayer
and LANL admitted that Bob had been issued a "Z number" of 094729 on May
18, 1982, but both said they no longer had any record of Bob's employment.
By the way, a "Z number" is some prerequisite identification number for
anyone who works at any of the LANL facilities. Bob also provided George
with his W-2 from S4, however, George ran into dead ends when he tried
to find who deposited money in IRS and FICA accounts on behalf of Bob Lazar.
The word was that some IRS and Social Security files are also classified.
Pandering
Charge
In the months that followed,
ufology began to become more mainstream and much of it was due to George
Knapp and others exposing Bob Lazar's story. The Rachel Bar and Grill,
outside of area 51, became the "Little A le Inn" and people began running
bus tours out to watch the sky over Groom Lake. George Knapp received 30
to 40 phone calls on a daily basis which involved peoples reports and questions
reagarding all aspects of ufology. Journalists from all over the world
were chasing Bob Lazar for interviews, and still are for that matter. Then
came the brothel bust.
Bob was still a broken man, but
when he had recovered enough to go out in public, he sought some comfort
with a hooker. Now I don't know how this looks and sounds elsewhere in
the world, but in Nevada this is no big deal. Prostitution is legal in
the state of Nevada, but illegal in the counties that house Las Vegas,
Reno, and Lake Tahoe. However, this is just for show and it's common knowlege
that brothels and hookers in the form of escort services exist in these
cities also. The police pretend to passively pursue this, but along with
gambling, drinking, and entertainment, prostitution is part of the package.
Bob called a number out of the
newpaper and happened upon a 40 to 45 year old madam/hooker who ran 2 to
4 girls out of a condominium project in the southeast part of town. This
was an upper line condo project so don't envision some dark sleezy place
engulfed in red lights. Bob went there and did his business, but before
he left, the hookers were having some problems with a stereo or something
like that and, naturally, Bob came to the rescue. He fixed it for them
and they invited him back for a freebie.
Well, Bob went back more than
once and, in time, all of the girls loved him. Bob has this unique manor
about him in which he treats everyone equally. When you interact with Bob,
he never gives you the feeling that he's a scientist and you're not so
you're not worthy. He treated the hookers with respect, like friends and
equals, and this was a breath of fresh air to them considering the attitudes
they get from some people. The madam explained to Bob that she had an ongoing
affair with a member of Las Vegas Metro Vice and that as long as she didn't
do outcalls to the hotels, vice would turn their heads and allow her to
operate. It is unknown whose interest these cops were protecting in the
hotels. The madam also told Bob that she was an FBI, DEA, and Las Vegas
Metro informant. Bob felt a sense of security because of all of this and
proceeded to tell the madam how he could streamline her operation by installing
computers, security cameras, and other electronic equipment. This appealed
to her and she financed her brothel's entrance into the computer age. During
all of this, something bad happened. The madam fell in love with Bob. She
offered him fifty percent of the business to stay around, but once the
electronics were installed, he was no longer interested. Since he wasn't
really interested in her, it was a drag for him to be around and he detached
himself from her and the brothel. To say that she didn't take this very
well is an understatement.
So now television sweeps rolled
around and George Knapp thought it would be a great idea to give his audience
an update on what the now famous Bob Lazar had been up to since his exit
from the program at S4. KLAS had set ratings records with George's previous
UFO special about Bob Lazar and they were interested in doing that again.
When George did the interview
Bob said, amongst other things, that he had installed a computer system
for a local brothel. That was a bad idea. The fact that Bob had broadcast
this on television reflected his naivety about the ramifications of his
actions. The Las Vegas cops now had a problem. Here was a guy stating that
he knew where a local brothel was and all they had to do was ask him it's
whereabouts and then bust it. The problem was compounded by the fact that
the brothel was run by one of their informants and they were aware of her
operation.
The madam's vice buddies explained
to her that they had to bust her operation because of Bob's televised admission.
After all, the entire vice department didn't know about this, just a couple
of vice cops she knew and did business with. They busted the place and
she blamed the entire operation on Bob, probably under their advice. She
had a client list of some very high level Las Vegans, including cops, and
they weren't about to force her to make that public. They let her off with
a misdemeanor called, "Keeping a Disorderly House", which is Nevada statute
from the early 1900s. I don't think anybody even knows what that's supposed
to mean. They then charge Bob with six felonies.
These cops thought they could
just hang this whole thing on Bob and be done with it. They soon found
out that Bob Lazar had a large following and hundreds of thousands of people
were scrutinizing this story. Naturally, most following Bob's story thought
this was a setup by the federal government to discredit him, and they may
have been involved, but that is unknown to this day.
Anyway, under some of the most
incompetent and questionable legal advice in history, Bob plead guilty
to pandering and they dropped the rest of the charges. We all urged Bob
to fight it but he didn't want to spend the money. This is part of his
"I can do everything myself" attitude because his dad is a wealthy L.A.
businessman and money would have been no problem. Bob simply won't depend
on anyone, even those that love him and want to help him.
Prior to sentencing Judge John
Lehman questioned how it was possible that a guy with no previous criminal
record, like Bob, would have plead guilty under these circumstances. He
also couldn't understand how the madam of the brothel wasn't in front of
him as a co-defendant. After all, in the madam's original statement to
the police she admitted having become a prostitute in 1971 when Bob Lazar
was 12 years old. The judge wasn't buying that Bob coerced HER into anything.
All of the judges questions and apprehensions were stated on the record,
ON CAMERA, and George Knapp still has a copy of the raw footage.
Bob was sentenced to 3 years
probation and community service. Ironically, he completed his community
service by installing yet another computer system, this time for Clark
County, Nevada. The guys down at probation would jockey for position to
see who got to go visit Bob so they could talk to him and ask him UFO questions.
He's now off probation and we're currently investigating the possibilities
for a pardon. The whole thing was one bad dream and somewhat of a joke
because there have only been a handful of pandering convictions in the
history of Las Vegas and the others weren't scientists with no criminal
record.
Even after the brothel fiasco,
Bob was still a highly sought after interview. In 1990, I had an operation
on my left leg which laid me up for ten weeks. Since Bob kept turning down
people who wanted interviews, I suggested we make a video tape. He said,
"Who would want to see a video tape about all of that stuff?". I proceeded
to question Bob at length about things and I proceeded to write the script
of the "Lazar Tape". Unless our distributors are lying to us, it has become
the most highly purchased, and bootlegged, video in the history of UFO
videos. The original was produced with elementary facilities and it is
currently being remade, broadcast quality, with state of the art graphics
and imaging. The rest of the story is pretty much history.
The story I've just presented
you is in no way the totality of what happened, but it does present the
basic facts. I'm fully aware of everything else that happened so I can
answer questions on subjects and details that have not been mentioned here.
No one knows everything so if I don't know the answer, I'll simply say
"I don't know".
In this synopsis I've also given
researchers, pseudo researchers, and "wanna be" researchers new tidbits
to chase down and verify and to them I say "Go for it". As you have just
read, Bob went public to save his own butt, not to do a favor for everyone
else. This is not to say that there isn't a part of him that thinks we
all have the right to know. His motive for going public should help explain
to some why he is reluctant to participate in some of the the current sideshows,
that was never his intent.
I'd also like to include the
personal observation that people who think Bob would perpetrate a fraud
are wrong. He is totally self sufficient and doesn't care enough about
what other people think to waste the time to try and fool them. If I had
to describe Bob Lazar in one word, I'd call him "productive". Bob doesn't
watch television unless it's the news or weather channel. He doesn't waste
one moment of his life preoccuping himself with irrelevant minutia like
the rest of us. Bob couldn't tell you who was in the super bowl or the
world series and if the baseball strike never ends it won't affect his
life one bit. He's busy with one scientific project or another and he certainly
isn't sitting around wondering what we're saying about him on the internet.
I know that this synopsis, in
itself, doesn't prove a thing. I'm now going to write a counterpoint to
the infamous "Lazar Timeline" and post that. I don't intend to refute everything
that's in it, I just intend to put it in perspective. This story isn't
as simple as some guy with no credentials makes some flying saucer claims
and then gets busted for pandering.
I fully understand everyone's
apprehensions about the lack of evidence of Bob Lazar's schooling. If I
didn't know him, I would be apprehensive, too. I wish I had been around
when Bob went to school, but I wasn't. Anyone who has met Bob Lazar knows
that you don't know what he knows by taking 1 electronics course at Pierce
Junior College in California. When George Knapp couldn't find any records
on Bob, I asked Bob about it privately. I told him that if he did overstate
his credentials that he should tell me and I would try and help him smooth
it over. I certainly believed he worked at Los Alamos and S4, even if he
had overstated his credentials. I believed, and still believe, his story
is way too important to lose it's impact because of something like this.
Bob stood firm and didn't change his story. I've seen him do this about
other subjects and I haven't caught him in a lie yet.
Evidence is abundant that he
worked at Los Alamos. In the early 80's if you worked at Los Alamos you
had to have a degree or be working toward one at the University of New
Mexico at Los Alamos. That's why there IS a branch of the University of
New Mexico in Los Alamos. That's probably still the rule, I don't know.
Since Bob was never enrolled there, obviously, LANL believed Bob had credentials.
After you've read the preceding
information and after we've had some questions and answers and dialogue
on internet, I think you'll have enough information to put Bob's story
in perspective. I'm aware of all of the different theories about him which
range from total fraud to a subject of mind control to who knows what.
Most of those are based on misinformation by incompetent UFO researchers
and blatant liars.
You don't need UFO researchers
and other assorted characters to pass judgment for you, even when it comes
to the physics of gravity propulsion and disc technology. There are numerous
books available which are written to the intelligent layman and they explain
how physicists know what they know and why they don't know what they don't
know. If this subject is important to you then do some reading and upload
your own knowledge base. I'm comfortable with whatever conclusions you
draw, both for and against Bob Lazar, I understand.
The bottom line is that the only
opinion that really counts for you is yours. All of our current opinions
are based on the best information we have at this point in time and all
of our opinions are subject to change based on new information. That's
true of Bob Lazar's story, science, and life in general.
Up to this point I've responded
to all of you by Email, but now I'm going to do it on UseNet so any benefit
of dialogue will be available to all. I'll treat you as fairly and respectfully
as you treat me. Einstein was quoted as saying "Common sense is all the
prejudices you acquire by the age of 18". So use your common sense when
you examine Bob's story, but remember to expand your knowledge base at
the same time. Bob Lazar is 100% certain the S4 story is true. I'm 99%
sure, saving 1% for the fact that I wasn't there myself. I hope my effort
here will move your opinion up or down so at least it will have been worth
the time one way or another. Please forgive any typos, spelling, or sentence
and paragraph structure as I am not a professional writer and I haven't
found spell check yet on my new word processsing program. Keep in touch

Maximum Distortion
..





As the intensity of the gravitational field around
the disc increases, the distortion of space/time around the disc also increases.
If you could see the space/time distortion, which we can't, this is how
it would look.
..





..
    As the gravitational field from the
amplifiers becomes more intense, the form of the space/time around the
disc not only bends upward, but at maximum distortion, actually folds over
into almost a heart shape around the top of the disc.
    This space/time distortion is taking
place 360 degrees around the disc, creating a volume of distortion, so
if you were looking at the disc from the top, the space/time distortion
would be in the shape of a donut as it enclosed the disc.
    When the gravitational field around
the disc is so intense that the space/time around the disc achieves maximum
distortion, the disc can't be seen from any vantage point and, for all
practical purposes, is invisible.  All you would se would be the sky
around it.
    At various angles prior to the disc
achieving maximum distortion, the disc could be visible from one vantage
point and not another.  All you could see would be the environment
around it. This is similar to being able to see stars that are behind the
sun, due to the intense gravity of the sun bending the light path between
the star and earth.
    Essentially, this creates a sort
of space-time bubble around the craft. "Maximum distortion" is not necessary
for standard flight over the surface of a planet. Except in the case of
rapid "streaks" across the sky. Maximum distortion is essential for this
mode of travel. The typical fire light comet in the night sky is not the
craft, but rather the air around the craft ionizing and trailing it.
