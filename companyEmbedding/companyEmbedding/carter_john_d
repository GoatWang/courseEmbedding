		Gestalt Saga	


$0.00







						Written by John D. Carter

In the year 2000 the Gestalt Institute of Cleveland had three distinct Centers and the Institution known as GIC was struggling with another of issues that had existed since the very beginning of days of the founders.  It had over a 25 year period become the number one training center for therapist learning Gestalt theory and methods in the world.  The professional community of GIC was confronted with the three Centers working together to become the number one personal and professional development organization in the world or splintering into three organizations and dissolution of the Institution.  John wrote this Saga to express his perspective on the struggle within the organization and some of the choices facing the Institution.  In 2002 the Clinical Center separated from GIC and in 2006 the Organization & Systems Development Center separated from the Institution.  The professional staff in 2006 voted 70 to zero to terminate the professional staff and the Institution thus dissolved itself.  Three organizations emerged from the dissolution.

                                                                                                                                        I can't say enough positive things about this doctor.  He has great bedside manner.  He is extremely knowledgeable.   He has the confidence to say I don't know which rarely happens.  I always recommend him to friends.  The downside is that he is so good that it's difficult to get an appointment.

                                                                                                                                        I originally saw Dr. Carter over twelve years ago and started seeing him again about 2 years ago.  Recently, I wanted to discuss a possible diagnosis and he said I don't think that fits and I reminded him that he had given me that diagnosis more than 12 years ago so he checked his computer and was surprised that he had given me the diagnosis.  And I wanted to ask if he had also done a specific blood test for it which he advised is not a real predictor but again we were both surprised he had ran the blood test which was negative.  The gave me a sense of security that he had even in his younger years done a thorough investigation of my symptoms even though the diagnosis was no longer valid.  At the time it was probably right and may still prove to be right because most of the illnesses he heals with can and do co-habitat unfortunately.  Even when I feel bad he always has a sunny disposition that is contagious making me leave the office happier than when entered even when the prognosis is not good.

He takes his time and treats me like a person, and never talks down to me.   He's thorough and does not hesitate to order tests and/or x-rays, etc.  I really feel like he cares about me as a patient, and I'm not just a dollar sign.  He also has a great sense of humor and never fails to make me laugh, especially when I'm hurting.

I UNDERSTAND THEY HAD TO REMODEL HIS DEPARTMENT SO AS TO ALLOWING HIS HEAD THROUGH THE DOORS.

By helping to find studies that we might be able to fit into. This has helped me and my life is once again some what normal and I'm able to attend family outings again. Thank you so much Dr. Carter

He is in such high demand, getting an appointment can be difficult.  He is certainly worth the wait.

Rheumatologists in Tampa, FL

    A rheumatologist is a physician who has received extensive training in diagnosing and treating rheumatic conditions. Rheumatic conditions involve the joints, soft tissues, autoimmune system, vascular system, and connective tissues.


    Some of the conditions that rheumatologists treat are rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, gout, sarcoidosis, vasculitis, and lupus.

Boost productivity with exact positioning
Integrated laser projection systems for both 2D and 3D applications providing precision alignment. Allows for projection of laser patterns onto complex curved surfaces in complete 3D images, suitable for mold composite layup, wind turbine blade production, vehicle construction, aerospace and a variety of manufacturing processes.







Carter lights the way to greater accuracy
A full offering of high powered line lasers, both red and green, suitable for any application requiring a clean crisp line for visual alignment. These lasers carry a full two-year warranty, are waterproof and come in a variety of line lengths, optics and mounts.







The Next Evolution in Steadyrest Work Support Systems
This system is compatible with a range of lathe sizes from mini to 20" all with one unit. The system is lightweight, yet very robust. The system can be split open to access or remove the work piece as well as converting it from Steadyrest to Bowlrest configurations.







Spend more time cutting and less time adjusting
Carter Upgrade conversion kits increase your saws performance through the use of sealed ball bearing roller guides or Tefloy™ lubricated block support guides. This provides your saw with reduced blade friction, improved cutting accuracy, and is adjustable for various blade widths. Our bearing guides have no wear surfaces which means that until you need to change the blade size you won’t have to adjust your guides, so spend more time woodworking and less time adjusting.







Innovative new Hollowing System from Carter
The Hollow Roller™ system is a complete, easy to set-up turnkey hollowing system that allows the operator to focus on the work and art of the vessel being turned versus on the system. The boring bar is completely captive and incorporates a full sealed bearing lubrication free roller system that eliminates the drag on the bar, thus enabling a smoother flowing motion to all tool movements.
