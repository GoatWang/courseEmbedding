7-DAY BRIDGE PROGRAMKETOPIA GUIDE | MAINTENANCE PLAN | WHAT IS KETOSIS 


 





7 DAYS TO SUCCESS

 








HOW TO USE KETOPIA™

 


Ketopia is a one-of-a-kind program designed to put you in nutritional ketosis in as little as one hour, and help you stay on the path toward optimal health and wellness for long after.

 


DAYS 1-7: THE BRIDGE

 


The Bridge to Ketopia includes the tools you need to achieve nutritional ketosis and reinvigorate your body in just one week.

Drink 1 KetonX with 1 enzyme every morning.
Three to four hours later, enjoy 1 enzyme and a Dough Bite either straight out of the package or warmed up for a sweet treat.
Three to four hours after that, mix contents of one KetoCream or Fixx pouch into 8-12 ounces of water and drink with 1 enzyme.
Pair a keto-friendly meal with 1 enzyme every evening.


 
 





WHAT DOES KETO-FRIENDLY MEAN?

 


The best way to support your Ketopia journey is with a diet that consists primarily of fat, with moderate protein and low carbohydrate intake. For best results, aim for a ratio of 70% fat, 25% protein, and 5% carbohydrates.

TIPS FOR SUCCESS

 


Before you begin, you are encouraged to take a “before” photo and an inventory of your body measurements, energy level, mental clarity, and overall sense of wellbeing so you can track your results. It’s also wise to get plenty of rest and consult your healthcare professional before starting any health program.

 
DOWNLOAD BEFORE AND AFTER CHECKLIST









THE MAINTENANCE PLAN

 


Once you’ve crossed the bridge, staying in ketosis is as simple as maintaining a keto-friendly diet, plenty of exercise, and enjoying all the KetoCafé has to offer.
 
As a foundation, we recommend enjoying a KetoCream Shake each day and taking two Enzymes with your evening meal. Of course, the KetoCafé includes a number of delicious keto-friendly options that allow you to customize a maintenance plan that works best for you!
 
Don’t worry! It’s OK to spring for dessert or splurge at the buffet at your next family gathering—the 7-Day Bridge is always there for you when you need it.

WHAT IS KETOSIS?




Ketosis is a metabolic state where your body burns fat for energy. Despite its many known health benefits, nutritional ketosis has traditionally been believed to be out of reach… until now. With Ketopia, it’s never been easier to access all the benefits of a fat-burning body in as little as one hour.

 







 




Every body is different. Just as the causes for being overweight, metabolic rates, physical exercise and food intake vary from person to person, so will results. A healthy diet, plenty of rest, and regular exercise is essential in any wellness program. This is not intended as medical advice. This is intended to be of general informational use and is not intended to constitute medical advice, probable diagnosis, or recommended treatments, nor should any information on this site be construed as such.

WHEY FOR WEIGHT MANAGEMENT

  


 




FIXX is an ideal start to any day. It is an amazing source of protein and other nutrients, and it tastes great. But how can it help you reach your weight management goals?
 
According to a study performed at the University of Missouri-Columbia, eating breakfast can help people experience a dramatic decline in cravings for sweet foods throughout the day. The study also showed that higher-protein breakfasts have beneficial effects on the appetitive hormonal and neural signals that control energy intake regulation in overweight individuals.
 
One of the biggest health problems faced today is that people have difficulty losing weight. A recent study performed at Australia’s University of Adelaide found that a high-protein diet reduces the need for calorie intake, and that whey protein is more effective than red meat in reducing body weight gain and increasing insulin sensitivity.
 
Whey is great for increasing lean muscle and burning fat. It is better absorbed before any form of exercise, and has even been shown to have a positive effect on stress and mood. A recent article from the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition found that whey “improved coping ability, probably through alterations in brain serotonin.”
 
Additionally, the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition has also stated that “Under most conditions, protein is more satiating than the ingestion of carbohydrates. This suggests that a modest increase in protein may promote satiety and facilitate weight loss through reduced energy (caloric) consumption.

24 May ForeverGreen Worldwide Corporation Announces New Ketogenic Product in European Market

KetoBrü, expected to be number one selling product in Europe by Q3.

LINDON, Utah, May 24, 2016 /PRNewswire/
ForeverGreen Worldwide Corporation (OTCBB: FVRG), a leading direct marketing company and provider of health-centered products, today announced it will launch a ketogenic product in the European market, KetoBrü, in June. KetoBru supports those living a keto diet by helping to maintain ketosis state.
“European’s are currently being educated about the impact of the product as we ready for the launch and availability of the product in June. By Q3, we expect it to be the number one selling product in Europe,” commented Tomasz Stanislawski, president of Europe.
“The long wait for a keto-friendly product in Europe is over. Our distributors are thrilled about KetoBrü and the aggressive business building opportunities it provides,” Stanislawski continued.
Michelle Lesueur, Vice President, Product Education and Development commented, “KetoBrü is a pure cacao gel that can be served hot or cold. It can be added to coffee like a sweetener for a great mocha flavor but with the benefits of cacao. Unlike chocolate that has been heavily processed and contains about 13% of finished chocolate, there are no hydrogenated oils, sugars or other ingredients added.
She continued, “Theobromine, anandamide and Phenylethylamine are naturally occurring in KetoBrü. It is high in MCT and has a more neutral pH for those that have been told to avoid acidic products for health reasons. This is also great for those that are needing to avoid products with stimulants in them. KetoBrü has not been over fermented or processed to help maintain the highest quality. Only the finest post harvesting practices are used to ensure a potent product”.

ForeverGreen Worldwide Corporation Announces New Weight Loss Product, Ketopia

		  The company gains exclusivity for patented product
		

Jun 30, 2015, 08:15 ET
		  		  					
						 from   ForeverGreen Worldwide Corporation 











 
















































 

 




















 


PLEASANT GROVE, Utah, Jun. 30, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- ForeverGreen Worldwide Corporation (OTCBB: FVRG), a leading direct marketing company and provider of health-centered products, today announced the company is commencing the pre-launch of a new weight loss product, Ketopia.
For the past two years the company has been in negotiations to be granted exclusivity of the patent-pending technology. The company was chosen over other top industry leaders to manufacture, market and sell the product.
ForeverGreen has been granted a license in the United States and Canada, and a special worldwide exclusive license (outside the United States and Canada), to bring this technology to the world for the first time in modern history.
The product will be sold as a three product system including new products, KetonX and Dough Bites along with already established product, Fixx. 
KetonX is the raw blend of all the right ingredients mixed into a refreshing drink. A scientific discovery determined that the body will begin to convert to a state of nutritional ketosis in a matter of hours when the perfect ratios of specific natural ingredients are ingested. This breakthrough means more than weight loss. Ketosis is a natural metabolic state where the body burns fat for most of its energy rather than carbohydrates. Many leading scientists believe the ketosis lifestyle will be the pinnacle of health and well-being. It's scientifically documented and safe.
"For the past two years, our team has been working diligently to get this product in our catalogue, and we are eager and ready to begin its launch. This product changes the game for us. The exclusivity is so important because it gives us a substantial advantage over competitors and helps us solidify our place in the industry. Entering the global $600 billion weight loss market is exciting, and this product separates us in this very competitive arena," noted CEO Ron Williams.
For more information on ForeverGreen's products, visit www.forevergreen.org.
ForeverGreen Worldwide Corporation develops, manufactures and distributes an expansive line of all natural whole foods and products to North America, Australia, Europe, Asia, Africa and South America, including their new global offerings, PowerStrips, SolarStrips and BeautyStrips. They also offer Azul and FrequenSea, whole-food beverages with industry exclusive marine phytoplankton, the Versativa line of hemp-based whole-food products, immune support and weight management products, Pulse-8 powdered L-arginine formula, TRUessence Essential Oils and Apothecary, 24Karat Chocolate(R) and an entire catalog of meals, snacks, household cleaners and personal care products.
