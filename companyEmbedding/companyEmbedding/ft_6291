        Great rug, but gets very dirty easily.
This rug is amazing, however the white colors show dirt too easily. I have it in my office here in Hawaii and the white parts of the "G" are already turning orange after a week or two. Might be permanently stained. Looks awesome though!

Logitech International SALogitech Delivers Double-Digit Growth and Raises OutlookTwitterFacebookLinkedInGooglePlusRedditPinterestUrlJul 25 2017 02:00 BSTSource: Business Wire

Gaming, Video Collaboration, Smart Home Up Over 40%


NEWARK, Calif. & LAUSANNE, Switzerland--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Jul. 24, 2017--
      Logitech International (SIX: LOGN) (Nasdaq: LOGI) today announced
      financial results for the first quarter of Fiscal Year 2018.
    


        Q1 sales were $530 million, up 13 percent in constant currency
        compared to Q1 of the prior year. Q1 sales grew 10 percent in USD.
      

        Q1 GAAP operating income grew 22 percent to $31 million, compared to
        $26 million a year ago. Q1 GAAP earnings per share (EPS) grew 69
        percent to $0.22, compared to $0.13 a year ago.
      

        Q1 non-GAAP operating income grew 14 percent to $43 million, compared
        to $38 million a year ago. Q1 non-GAAP EPS grew 20 percent to $0.24,
        compared to $0.20 a year ago.
      


      “We’re off to a strong start,” said Bracken Darrell, Logitech president
      and chief executive officer. “Our innovative and diverse portfolio is
      delivering, with growth and profitability exceeding expectations this
      quarter. Our growth was broad-based — we grew double-digits in constant
      currency across all three regions. Looking out to the rest of the year,
      the strength of our innovation program combined with the expected
      closing of the ASTRO Gaming acquisition, give us the confidence to raise
      our FY 2018 outlook.”
    

Vincent Pilette, Logitech chief financial officer, said, “We delivered a
      strong financial performance during this first quarter of the fiscal
      year, with sales up 13% and profitability up 14%. Q1’s healthy gross
      margin — up 140 basis points compared to last year — allows us to
      continue our investment in numerous growth opportunities to build an
      exciting future.”
    

Outlook


Logitech raised its Fiscal Year 2018 outlook to 10 to 12 percent sales
      growth in constant currency and $260 to $270 million in non-GAAP
      operating income. This includes the anticipated impact of the ASTRO
      Gaming acquisition, expected to close in August 2017.
    

Prepared Remarks Available Online


Logitech has made its prepared written remarks for the financial results
      teleconference available online on the Logitech corporate website at http://ir.logitech.com.
    

Financial Results Teleconference and Webcast


Logitech will hold a financial results teleconference to discuss the
      results for Q1 FY 2018 on Tuesday, Jul. 25, 2017 at 8:30 a.m. Eastern
      Daylight Time and 2:30 p.m. Central European Summer Time. A live webcast
      of the call will be available on the Logitech corporate website at http://ir.logitech.com.
    

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Information and Constant Currency


      To facilitate comparisons to Logitech’s historical results, Logitech has
      included non-GAAP adjusted measures, which exclude share-based
      compensation expense, amortization of intangible assets, purchase
      accounting effect on inventory, acquisition-related costs, change in
      fair value of contingent consideration for business acquisition,
      restructuring charges (credits), gain (loss) on investments in privately
      held companies, investigation and related expenses, non-GAAP income tax
      adjustment, and other items detailed under “Supplemental Financial
      Information” after the tables below. Logitech also presents percentage
      sales growth in constant currency to show performance unaffected by
      fluctuations in currency exchange rates. Percentage sales growth in
      constant currency is calculated by translating prior period sales in
      each local currency at the current period’s average exchange rate for
      that currency and comparing that to current period sales. Logitech
      believes this information, used together with the GAAP financial
      information, will help investors to evaluate its current period
      performance and trends in its business. With respect to the Company’s
      outlook for non-GAAP operating income, most of these excluded amounts
      pertain to events that have not yet occurred and are not currently
      possible to estimate with a reasonable degree of accuracy. Therefore, no
      reconciliation to the GAAP amounts has been provided for Fiscal Year
      2018.

      This press release contains forward-looking statements within the
      meaning of the federal securities laws, including, without limitation,
      statements regarding: our innovation, pipeline of products, ASTRO Gaming
      acquisition and its timing, growth opportunities, investment in growth
      opportunities, future performance, and outlook for Fiscal Year 2018
      operating income and sales growth. The forward-looking statements in
      this release involve risks and uncertainties that could cause Logitech’s
      actual results and events to differ materially from those anticipated in
      these forward-looking statements, including, without limitation: if our
      product offerings, marketing activities and investment prioritization
      decisions do not result in the sales, profitability or profitability
      growth we expect, or when we expect it; the demand of our customers and
      our consumers for our products and our ability to accurately forecast
      it; if we fail to innovate and develop new products in a timely and
      cost-effective manner for our new and existing product categories; if we
      do not successfully execute on our growth opportunities or our growth
      opportunities are more limited than we expect; if sales of PC
      peripherals are less than we expect; the effect of pricing, product,
      marketing and other initiatives by our competitors, and our reaction to
      them, on our sales, gross margins and profitability; if our products and
      marketing strategies fail to separate our products from competitors’
      products; if we are not able to maintain and enhance our brands; if we
      do not successfully execute on strategic acquisitions and investments;
      if we do not fully realize our goals to lower our costs and improve our
      operating leverage; if there is a deterioration of business and economic
      conditions in one or more of our sales regions or product categories, or
      significant fluctuations in exchange rates. A detailed discussion of
      these and other risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results
      and events to differ materially from such forward-looking statements is
      included in Logitech’s periodic filings with the Securities and Exchange
      Commission, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year
      ended March 31, 2017, available at www.sec.gov,

      Note: These preliminary results for the three months ended June 30, 2017
      are subject to adjustments, including subsequent events that may occur
      through the date of filing our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.
    

      (A) Non-GAAP Financial Measures
    

      To supplement our condensed consolidated financial results prepared in
      accordance with GAAP, we use a number of financial measures, both GAAP
      and non-GAAP, in analyzing and assessing our overall business
      performance, for making operating decisions and for forecasting and
      planning future periods. We consider the use of non-GAAP financial
      measures helpful in assessing our current financial performance, ongoing
      operations and prospects for the future as well as understanding
      financial and business trends relating to our financial condition and
      results of operations.
    

      While we use non-GAAP financial measures as a tool to enhance our
      understanding of certain aspects of our financial performance and to
      provide incremental insight into the underlying factors and trends
      affecting both our performance and our cash-generating potential, we do
      not consider these measures to be a substitute for, or superior to, the
      information provided by GAAP financial measures. Consistent with this
      approach, we believe that disclosing non-GAAP financial measures to the
      readers of our financial statements provides useful supplemental data
      that, while not a substitute for GAAP financial measures, can offer
      insight in the review of our financial and operational performance and
      enables investors to more fully understand trends in our current and
      future performance. In assessing our business during the quarter ended
      June 30, 2017, we excluded items in the following general categories,
      each of which are described below:
    

Share-based compensation expenses. We believe that providing
      non-GAAP measures excluding share-based compensation expense, in
      addition to the GAAP measures, allows for a more transparent comparison
      of our financial results from period to period. We prepare and maintain
      our budgets and forecasts for future periods on a basis consistent with
      this non-GAAP financial measure. Further, companies use a variety of
      types of equity awards as well as a variety of methodologies,
      assumptions and estimates to determine share-based compensation expense.
      We believe that excluding share-based compensation expense enhances our
      ability and the ability of investors to understand the impact of
      non-cash share-based compensation on our operating results and to
      compare our results against the results of other companies.
    

Amortization of intangible assets. We incur intangible asset
      amortization expense, primarily in connection with our acquisitions of
      various businesses and technologies. The amortization of purchased
      intangibles varies depending on the level of acquisition activity. We
      exclude these various charges in budgeting, planning and forecasting
      future periods and we believe that providing the non-GAAP measures
      excluding these various non-cash charges, as well as the GAAP measures,
      provides additional insight when comparing our gross profit, operating
      expenses, and financial results from period to period.
    

Purchase accounting effect on inventory. Business combination
      accounting principles require us to measure acquired inventory at fair
      value. The fair value of inventory reflects the acquired company’s cost
      of manufacturing plus a portion of the expected profit margin. The
      non-GAAP adjustment excludes the expected profit margin component that
      is recorded under business combination accounting principles associated
      with our business acquisitions. We believe the adjustment is useful to
      investors because such charges are not reflective of our ongoing
      operations.
    

Acquisition-related costs and change in fair value of contingent
      consideration for business acquisition. We incurred expenses and
      credits in connection with our acquisitions which we generally would not
      have otherwise incurred in the periods presented as a part of our
      continuing operations. Acquisition related costs include all incremental
      expenses incurred to effect a business combination. Fair value of
      contingent consideration is associated with our estimates of the value
      of earn-outs in connection with certain acquisitions. We believe that
      providing the non-GAAP measures excluding these costs and credits, as
      well as the GAAP measures, assists our investors because such costs are
      not reflective of our ongoing operating results.
    

Restructuring charges (credits). These expenses are associated
      with re-aligning our business strategies based on current economic
      conditions. We have undertaken several restructuring plans in recent
      years. In connection with our restructuring initiatives, we incurred
      restructuring charges related to employee terminations, facility
      closures and early cancellation of certain contracts. We believe that
      providing the non-GAAP measures excluding these charges, as well as the
      GAAP measures, assists our investors because such charges (credits) are
      not reflective of our ongoing operating results in the current period.
    

Gain (loss) on investments in privately held companies. We
      recognized gain (loss) related our investments in various privately-held
      companies, which varies depending on the operational and financial
      performance of the privately-held companies in which we invested. We
      believe that providing the non-GAAP measures excluding these charges, as
      well as the GAAP measures, assists our investors because such charges
      are not reflective of our ongoing operations.
    

Investigation and related expenses. These expenses are forensic
      accounting, audit, consulting and legal fees related to the Audit
      Committee’s investigation and the formal investigation by and settlement
      with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), together with
      accruals based on settlement with the SEC. We believe that providing the
      non-GAAP measures excluding these charges, as well as the GAAP measures,
      assists our investors because such charges are not reflective of our
      ongoing operations.
    

Non-GAAP income tax adjustment. Non-GAAP income tax adjustment
      primarily measures the income tax effect of non-GAAP adjustments
      excluded above and other events; the determination of which is based
      upon the nature of the underlying items, the mix of income and losses in
      jurisdictions and the relevant tax rates in which we operate.
    

      Each of the non-GAAP financial measures described above, and used in
      this press release, should not be considered in isolation from, or as a
      substitute for, a measure of financial performance prepared in
      accordance with GAAP. Further, investors are cautioned that there are
      inherent limitations associated with the use of each of these non-GAAP
      financial measures as an analytical tool. In particular, these non-GAAP
      financial measures are not based on a comprehensive set of accounting
      rules or principles and many of the adjustments to the GAAP financial
      measures reflect the exclusion of items that are recurring and may be
      reflected in the Company’s financial results for the foreseeable future.
      We compensate for these limitations by providing specific information in
      the reconciliation included in this press release regarding the GAAP
      amounts excluded from the non-GAAP financial measures. In addition, as
      noted above, we evaluate the non-GAAP financial measures together with
      the most directly comparable GAAP financial information.
    

Additional Supplemental Financial Information - Constant Currency


      In addition, Logitech presents percentage sales growth in constant
      currency to show performance unaffected by fluctuations in currency
      exchange rates. Percentage sales growth in constant currency is
      calculated by translating prior period sales in each local currency at
      the current period’s average exchange rate for that currency and
      comparing that to current period sales.

Range-wide patterns of greater sage-grouse persistenceProduct Type: Journal ArticleYear: 2008Author(s): Aldridge, C.L., S.E. Nielsen, H.L. Beyer, M.S. Boyce, J.W. Connelly, S.T. Knick, and M.A. SchroederSuggested Citation: Aldridge, C.L., S.E. Nielsen, H.L. Beyer, M.S. Boyce, J.W. Connelly, S.T. Knick, and M.A. Schroeder. 2008. Range-wide patterns of greater sage-grouse persistence. Diversity and Distributions. 14(6): 983-994. Aim: Greater sage-grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus), a shrub-steppe obligate species of western North America, currently occupies only half its historical range. Here we examine how broad-scale, long-term trends in landscape condition have affected range contraction.
Location: Sagebrush biome of the western USA.
Methods: Logistic regression was used to assess persistence and extirpation of greater sage-grouse range based on landscape conditions measured by human population (density and population change), vegetation (percentage of sagebrush habitat), roads (density of and distance to roads), agriculture (cropland, farmland and cattle density), climate (number of severe and extreme droughts) and range periphery. Model predictions were used to identify areas where future extirpations can be expected, while also explaining possible causes of past extirpations.
Results: Greater sage-grouse persistence and extirpation were significantly related to sagebrush habitat, cultivated cropland, human population density in 1950, prevalence of severe droughts and historical range periphery. Extirpation of sage-grouse was most likely in areas having at least four persons per square kilometre in 1950, 25% cultivated cropland in 2002 or the presence of three or more severe droughts per decade. In contrast, persistence of sage-grouse was expected when at least 30 km from historical range edge and in habitats containing at least 25% sagebrush cover within 30 km. Extirpation was most often explained (35%) by the combined effects of peripherality (within 30 km of range edge) and lack of sagebrush cover (less than 25% within 30 km). Based on patterns of prior extirpation and model predictions, we predict that 29% of remaining range may be at risk.
Main Conclusions: Spatial patterns in greater sage-grouse range contraction can be explained by widely available landscape variables that describe patterns of remaining sagebrush habitat and loss due to cultivation, climatic trends, human population growth and peripherality of populations. However, future range loss may relate less to historical mechanisms and more to recent changes in land use and habitat condition, including energy developments and invasions by non-native species such as cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum) and West Nile virus. In conjunction with local measures of population performance, landscape-scale predictions of future range loss may be useful for prioritizing management and protection. Our results suggest that initial conservation efforts should focus on maintaining large expanses of sagebrush habitat, enhancing quality of existing habitats, and increasing habitat connectivity.
