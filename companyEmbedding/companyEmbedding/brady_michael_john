To the Hero I never got to meet....  
Posted on 7/6/15 - by Michael E. Doherty llachiana2000@aol.com
								

								 
								 My name is Michael and I am currently 46 years old.  My grandmother and grandfather are buried next to PFC. Brady.  Since I was a young child visiting my grandparents I would notice that PFC. Brady never had a visitor or any kind of remembrance on his grave.  Since that day and until this day, July 6, 2015, I have been putting American flags and other small gifts at his grave.  I want you to know that I will always remember this young man of 19, and I will always leave something for him, no matter how small it may be, a pebble, a little note, a flower, a flag, or even just a small kiss to his headstone.  He will always be a hero in my eyes and the eyes of our country. I am now a father of two, a young man and my young daughter, and I am trying to teach them to never forget the men and women who gave their lives to protect our freedom.  Thank you for your service and for giving your life to save our country.

Remembering an American Hero
Posted on 1/15/13 - by Curt Carter ccarter02@earthlink.net
								

Dear PFC Michael John Brady, sir,As an American, I would like to thank you for your service and for the ultimate sacrifice that you made on behalf of our wonderful country.  The youth of today could gain much by learning of heroes such as yourself, men and women whose courage and heart can never be questioned.May God allow you to read this, and may He allow me to someday shake your hand when I get to Heaven to personally thank you. And please know that men and women like you have stepped forward to defend our country yet again, showing the same love for country and their fellow Americans that you did- you would be proud.  With respect, and the best salute that a civilian can muster for you. Curt Carter

About VVMF
        Based in Arlington, Virginia, VVMF (the Vietnam Veterans Memorial Fund) is the nonprofit organization authorized by the U.S. Congress in 1980 to build a national memorial dedicated to all who served with the U.S. armed forces in the Vietnam War. Incorporated on April 27, 1979 by a group of veterans led by Jan C. Scruggs, the organization sought a tangible symbol of recognition from the American people for those who served in the war.
