							Montana which is expected to cut Capex costs 
							significantly, reduce operating costs, and expedite 
							the start of the circuit. 
At the 
							Wadley deposit in San Luis Potosi Mexico, 
							underground miners have been increased to 90 men. 
							Plans are underway to reopen the Guadalupe deposit 
							in Zacatecas, Mexico. Mexican production is being 
							increased to compensate for the reduction of 
							Australian concentrate processing.
The 
							Company has posted a Face book page for United 
							States Antimony and another for Bear River Zeolite 
							and has already seen significant activity. 

CEO 
							John Lawrence said �We are excited about the Los 
							Juarez gold, silver, and antimony estimated 
							recovered values of $127.06 per metric ton during 
							the recent milling campaign. Completing the process 
							in Montana will reduce Capex and expedite the start 
							of the project.  Mexican antimony production and BRZ 
							zeolite sales are anticipated to increase to provide 
							cash flow for the leach plant.�

MEXICAN MINING OPERATIONS

Although USAC has 
extensive antimony mineralization at Thompson Falls, Montana, the time and cost 
of re--permitting the mine as well as the uncertainty of even getting a permit 
caused USAC to return to Mexico to mine. Most of the Mexican antimony 
deposits are oxide ores or mixed oxide sulfide deposits. The oxides are 
recoverable by gravimetric methods, typically jigs and tables. The sulfide ores 
are recoverable by flotation. During World War II, the United States  relied on 
Mexico for antimony for military applications. Historically, Mexico was at one 
point the second largest producer of antimony in the world. USAC does not claim 
any reserves by S.E.C. definitions.


 






LOS JUAREZ 
PROPERTY, QUERETARO, MEXICO. 
 At the Los Juarez property USAC relied on a Mexican Government 
publication, Consejo de Recursos Minerales, Monografia 
Geologico-Minera del Estado de Querearo, pages 74-75. The paper 
reported a reserve of 1,000,000 metric tons containing 253 grams per ton 
silver and 1.8% antimony 40 hectares (100 acres). The deposit was 
interpreted as a manto (layered) deposit up to 5 meters thick.  Although 
USAC used the report to start mining, it was disallowed by the S.E.C. as 
a basis for reserves. Detailed mapping and sampling delineated jasperoid 
mineralization over an east-west strike length of 3.5 kilometers with a 
maximum width of 1 kilometer. Unlike most Mexican deposits, this deposit 
is primarily all sulfide. Preliminary exploration indicates that it 
could be a deep-seated jasperoid. USAC controls this property directly. 
The grade of 1,415 tons of rock from the Minas Grande area that was 
milled assayed 0.728% antimony, 6.22 ounces (193 grams) of silver per 
metric ton, and 0.023 ounces of gold (0.7 grams) per metric ton.

SOYATAL 
DISTRICT, QUERETARO, MEXICO. 
USAC is sourcing 
mill feed and DSO for Madero from the Soyatal District in the State of 
Queretaro, Mexico. The deposit was the third largest antimony producer 
in Mexico. Donald E. White (U. S. Geological Survey Bulletin 960-B, Antimony Deposits of Soyatal District, State of Queretaro, Mexico, 
1948) prepared an extensive report and said that the production (p. 40) 
was estimated through 1943 at 25,630 metric tons of metal contained. 
USAC has purchased this property but claims no reserves.

WADLEY, SAN LUIS 
POTOSI, MEXICO. 
According to the U. S. Geological Survey (Bulletin 946-E, San Jose 
Antimony Mines Near Wadley, State of San Luis Potosi, Mexico, 1946, 
Donald E. White and Jenaro Gonzales R.) by 1943 the �San Jose 
mines have produced more antimony than any other district in Mexico, and 
they have been surpassed in production by only one or two other deposits 
in the world.�  By 1943, the recorded production was 57,612 
metric tons of contained antimony metal.  Since that time the mine has 
probably produced another 25,000 metric tons of metal. Although the 
Rotterdam price of metal peaked at $17,879.00 per metric ton during 
April 2011, 2013 prices averaged $10, 418 per metric ton. The 
mineralization is primarily is in five layered deposits or 
�mantos� that were fed by fracture filling veins that also 
contain mineralization. The zone is approximately 2 kilometers 
long and a kilometer in width and has been developed by 500 
kilometers of drifts and tunnels.. . There are more than 500 
kilometers of drifts and tunnels. The ore consists almost 
entirely of oxide minerals that were recovered by hand-sorting 
�direct shipping ore� for smelting. Gravimetric concentration of the 
lower-grade material did not start until a water well was drilled. 
In 1943, the U. S. Geological Survey noted �If the mining of low-grade 
ore becomes feasible in the future, large tonnages can be blocked out in 
the mantos and in the veins. In addition dumps resulting from more than 
50 years of mining are readily available� The future of the San Jose 
mines depends to a large extent upon the development of a milling 
process by means of which antimony can be extracted from low-grade oxide 
ores�The mines have been operated for the high-grade deposits -- those 
that contain ore that can be sorted to an antimony content of at least 
30 percent.� In the late 1990�s a heavy media separator (HMS) plant was 
installed with a capacity of up to 500 tons per day. Unfortunately, the 
plant recovered only 20-25% of the values and made a low-grade 
concentrate. USAC claims no reserves at the present time at WadleyIn the 
last two years, USAC produced __pounds of contained antimony 
from Wadley direct shipping ore (DSO) sent to the USAC smelter at Madero, 
Mexico.. The DSO was mined by a prior operator. During this time USAC 
utilized the crushing and screening circuit of the HMS plant and added 
gravimetric equipment to produce a 40-50% antimony concentrate with up 
to a 55% recovery.  The main headquarters at Wadley include a man-camp, 
assay lab, hospital, administrative offices, store, railroad siding, 
shop, warehouse, mess hall, gardens, entertainment area, guard house, 
equipment and parts.

chronic effects from short and long-term exposure

 

Acute effects                            
Gastro-intestinal distress

 

Chronic toxicity

Prolonged and excessive inhalation exposures 
to antimony trioxide may result in respiratory effects, antimony pneumoconiosis, 
pulmonary fibrosis, inflammation of the lungs, airway obstruction, broncospasms, 
reproductive effects, gastrointestinal upset, liver effects, and neurological 
effects (muscle weakness, subnormal gait).

Prolonged and excessive oral exposure may 
result in gastrointestinal discomfort and ulcers, blood effects, liver effects, 
neurological effects inflammation of the mucous membranes and stomatitis.

In a recent 90 day oral study in male and 
female rats, no adverse effects were observed at doses of 1000, 5000, and 20000 
ppm.  The No Adverse Effect Level for antimony trioxide was 20000 ppm for both 
sexes.

In a developmental study in Sprague-Dewley 
rats consisting of three treatment groups and a control group, each containing 
26 females at doses of 2.6, 4.4, and 6.3 mg/m3, no developmental 
effects were observed.  The LOAEL for material toxicity was established at 2.6 
mg/m3.  The NOEL for developmental toxicity was 6.3 mg/m3, 
the highest exposure level evaluated.

Antimony trioxide has been classified by IRAC 
as a Class 2B. An IARC 2B material exhibits sufficient evidence in animal tests 
to be a possible human carcinogen.  Antimony oxide production has been 
determined by ACGIH to be a carcinogenic risk.  Antimony trioxide has been 
identified by the EPA as a suspected lung carcinogen.  Historical studies have 
concluded that exposure to elevated levels of antimony oxide may cause lung 
carcinoma.  However, the most recent study conducted under the EPA�s Voluntary 
Test Program by the Antimony Oxide Industry Association (AOIA), has concluded 
that antimony oxide does not cause lung cancer in rats at occupational exposure 
levels.  The levels tested ranged from 0.005 mg/m3 to 6 mg/m3 
(from one tenth to ten times the OSHA TWA Threshold Limit Value.

FLAME RETARDANT 
THEORY


Antimony oxide by itself is not a fire retardant, 
and the halogens by themselves, mainly bromine and chlorine, are weak fire 
retardants. However, when they are combined they become synergistic and are the 
most effective and most widely used flame retardant system for plastics. Usually 
three to four parts of halogenated flame retardants are used to one part of 
antimony oxide on a weight basis. Using more than the 4: 1 ratio offers little 
additional protection. The stoichiometric ratio of chlorine to antimony in 
antimony trichloride is 3: 1. Formulations in different applications will depend 
on thermal stability, cost, tinting strength, Change in physical properties, 
smoke considerations, streaking, blend ability, and the flame retardant 
specification. 

Two mechanisms exist in the synergistic system. 
First is the "free radical capture" process that takes place in the vapor phase. 
On combustion at a temperature of over 6000
F, the halogen forms 
hydrochloric or hydrobromic acid that reacts with the antimony oxide to form 
antimony trichloride, antimony oxychloride, 
antimony tribromide, or antimony oxybromide. 
The flame retarding action takes place in the vapor stage above the burning 
material. It is thought that "free radicals propagate" the flame. But, the 
antimony trihalides or antimony oxyhalides act as "free radical traps", and take 
up free radicals. They inhibit ignition and pyrolysis in the solid, liquid, and 
vapor phases. 

 

A second process occurs in a solid phase and is the 
"char process". The antimony oxide promotes the formation of "char" (essentially 
carbon) on the substrate which reduces volatile gas formation. The barrier 
between the substrate and the vapor phase reduces the available oxygen to the 
underlying substrate. The barrier effect is obtained by almost any inert 
additive. In plastics there is a cross linking with antimony to produce a more 
stable thermoset polymer. Additionally in the solid phase, the formation of SbCI3
and SbOCI acts as a 
dehydrating agent that increases charring. Sometimes phosphorous compounds 
(TCP), magnesium oxide, alumina trihydrate, molybdic oxide, zinc borate, or zinc 
oxide are used in combination or in place of antimony oxide to reduce costs, to 
increase char formation, or to reduce smoke. However, the substitution of the 
other retardants greatly reduces the flame retardance normally rendered by 
antimony oxide. Testing of the amounts of the halogen and antimony oxide in each 
formulation is necessary to optimize the flame retardance and lower costs. 
Alumina trihydrate is not synergistic with halogenated flame retardants. It 
functions as a flame retardant by the release of its water of hydration and 
cannot be used in high temperature processes. Zinc borate, molybdic oxide, zinc 
oxide, and magnesium oxide can be used in conjunction with antimony oxide to 
augment char formation and decrease smoke. Replacement of the antimony oxide to 
meet a smoke requirement compromises the flame retardance. 

A relationship exists between particle size and 
tinting strength. If the particles are very fine (less than 300 nanometers) they 
are below the visual range and there is no tint strength. However, within the 
visual range, the smaller the particle size, the higher the tint strength. Or 
conversely, the larger the particle size, the lower the tint strength.

United
States
Antimony
Corporation (USAC)  
NYSE MKT (uamy) 
 is a rapidly 
growing natural resource company that is increasing its raw material supply of 
antimony from properties in Mexico and third parties around the world. 
USAC has produced various antimony products since 1969 and is a fully integrated 
mining, transportation, milling, smelting, and marketing company. 

 

USAC operates the only significant antimony smelter in the 
United States and it is in a �sold out� condition. 
The Company has proven experience in underground and open pit mining, flotation 
and gravimetric milling, crushing and screening, dry grinding, cyanide leaching, 
precious metal refining, pyro-metallurgy, and marketing. USAC has developed 
proprietary technology to smelt a variety of raw materials and recover 
impurities such as lead, arsenic, bismuth, mercury, selenium, silver, and gold. 
China 
supplies more than 90 percent of all the antimony in the world, and their 
resources are being depleted. 
 
 



 


Operations include a smelter and a precious metal refinery in Montana, and a 
smelter and three mills in Mexico. A larger 400 ton mill is being installed in 
Mexico. Three Mexican properties supply direct shipping ore (DSO) or mill feed 
for the Mexican operations. The Los Juarez property and mill at Puerto Blanco 
are being permitted to start gold and 
silver production that will supplement the antimony values and identify 
the Company as a �precious metal producer.�

 

USAC owns 100% of the 
Bear River Zeolite, Corp. mine in southeast Idaho that management  regards as 
one of the best zeolite properties in the world due to its high cation exchange 
capacity, low sodium content, hardness,  uniformity, high potassium content, 
large surface area, and low clay and impurity content. The deposit can be mined 
and processed cheaper than other deposits because there is little internal or 
external overburden, it is more than 800 feet thick, and it is very homogeneous. 
BRZ zeolite has hundreds of applications as an �environmentally friendly� 
material.

ANTIMONY OXIDE STORAGE 
AND HANDLING  
 

During 
handling, protective clothing and NIOSH/MSHA 
approved 
respiratory equipment should be worn. Dust control systems should be used 
throughout the handling areas. Sweeping should be avoided; a vacuum cleaner 
should be used to handle spillage. Food and cigarettes should not be taken into 
work areas. Hands and faces should be washed before smoking, eating, or 
drinking. All plant personnel should shower and change clothes before leaving 
the plant. Work clothes should be washed frequently.  

Handling and storage should be engineered to 
minimize spillage. Additionally, antimony oxide should not be stored near an 
acid, because the mixing of antimony oxide with an acid will generate stibine 
gas (HSb), a deadly poison. An MSDS sheet is available upon request. 

 

PACKING IS AVAILABLE AS FOLLOWS:

50lb bag, 40 per pallet

25kg bag, 40 per pallet

2000 poung bulk bag on pallet

Metric tonne bulk bag on pallet

Bulk Truck Loads, up to 48,000 pounds

Other packing sizes are available on a price to be 
determined basis.

U. S. 
ANTIMONY REPORTS LOS JUAREZ PRODUCTION TESTING

December 5, 2016. Thompson Falls, 
Montana. United States Antimony Corporation (�USAC�, NYSE MKT �UAMY�) 
reported that production testing of the Los Juarez circuits has begun.

The alkaline leach plant in Mexico 
has been installed, tested, and recoveries are now being verified. 
Approximately 19.8 metric tons of concentrates from previous milling 
will be processed during December and the beginning of 2017.  Answers to 
questions from our original application for the cyanide permit to leach 
the mill tailings have been submitted to SEMARNAT, and the permit is 
being vigorously pursued. Previously mined mill feed from a 19,000 
metric ton stockpile at the Los Juarez property will be hauled to the 
mill in Guanajuato. The flotation mill will be started during Q1 2017. 
 Mining at greater depths in the pits and in close proximity will 
commence. USAC will continue operating while the cyanide circuit is 
added in stages using internally generated cash flows. 


The objectives of the production 
testing are as follows:

To 
further verify costs, grades, and recoveries of the circuit.
To 
determine whether rock at greater depth is less oxidized and will 
yield better recoveries than near surface rock.
To 
further study the recovery of gold. Mill recoveries of gold have 
varied from 30% to more than 90%. 
To 
further open up the deposit and perform more drilling.

Cautious production testing will minimize the risk of encountering a 
fatal flaw.
To 
determine whether the cyanide leach plant is necessary. Two options 
are considered. Option 1 is using the floatation mill and the 
alkaline leach circuit. Option 2 will be the flotation mill, 
alkaline leach circuit, and the cyanide leach plant for the mill 
tailings.

USAC does not claim any reserves at 
the Los Juarez deposit in accordance with S. E. C. definitions or per 
Canadian Institute 43-101.

The Australian concentrates will be 
finished by the end of December, but the processing of the slag for gold 
will continue into 2017. Presently, USAC is ramping up production at the 
Wadley and Soyatal properties in Mexico. 

The new BRZ sales representatives 
have five new truckload customers, and two of them have ordered their 
second truckload. Most of the new customers are in the dairy business 
and BRZ is now expanding its focus to poultry and hog producers.

per pound); during October it was $7,740.00 ($3.51 per pound) a decrease 
of $0.09 per pound. 

 CEO John Lawrence said that �we are 
excited to begin initial pilot production from the Los Juarez deposit 
and will determine optimum operating conditions from trials throughout 
2017.�

U. S. ANTIMONY REPORTS EXPANDED ZEOLITE SALES PROGRAM

November 7, 2016. Thompson 
Falls, Montana. United States Antimony Corporation (�USAC�, NYSE 
MKT �UAMY�) reported that it has embarked on a sales program of 
BRZ zeolite with field representatives. 

Sue Mahaney  has joined the 
BRZ staff as the Director of Research and Development. She has 
more than 20 years experience and resides in Lancaster, 
Wisconsin and will be updating our website for BRZ and preparing 
more sales brochures. Bill Buchman and Debbie Stelma head up 
High Sierra Bio Distributing, Inc. (HSBD, Inc.). HSBD personnel 
travel throughout the United States and are familiar with the 
major feed mills and dairy farms. The dairy industry is the 
immediate focus, but poultry, hogs, composting, odor control, 
and soil amendments are also being targeted. The new BRZ 
representatives have already received orders from several new 
truckload customers. More than 36% of BRZ sales are agricultural 
that include animal feed, composting, soil amendments, and odor 
control. More than 27 percent of the sales are currently made in 
Canada.

Following are the sales 
estimates for October 2016: 





Product


October 2016 





Antimony pounds


274,514




BRZ zeolite tons

During October, the average 
Rotterdam price per metric ton of antimony metal was $7,740.00 
($3.51 per pound); during September it was $7,615.00 ($3.45 per 
pound) an increase of $0.06 per pound by the end of October.


Testing of the Los Juarez 
caustic leach circuit in Coahuila that is designed to recover 
contaminants from the floatation concentrates has proven 
successful and is ready for Los Juarez concentrates when the 
cyanide leach circuit has been approved at Puerto Blanco, 
Guanajuato. The diagrams and answers to questions from SEMARNAT 
(the Mexican equivalent of the EPA) will be submitted on 
November 11, 2016. SEMARNAT is expected to review the answers 
and respond by the end of November.           

CEO John Lawrence said that 
�field representatives selling BRZ zeolite is the most cost 
effective way of increasing revenues and profits for the 
Company. It will involve little capex and time to implement. 
Rising antimony prices and the transition of Mexican production 
to more profitable USAC mine sources will help to bring the Los 
Juarez property on stream and start a deeper exploration 
drilling program into 2017.

During 
the third quarter of 2016, the Rotterdam price per metric ton of 
antimony metal increased from $6,750.00 ($3.06 per pound) to 
$7,750.00 ($3.5153 per pound) by the end of the quarter, an 
increase of $1,000.00 per ton ($0.4536 per pound).

 


Currently, production from both the Wadley and Soyatal property 
is being ramped up to replace Australian concentrates by the end 
of 2016. The Guadalupe property will be put back on stream, and 
it will provide a high-grade concentrate suitable for the 
higher-rate production in the LRF furnace at Madero. The margin 
on production from the USAC properties should be greater than 
Australian concentrates. USAC claims no reserves in these 
properties by S.E.C. definitions.        .

 The 
environmental permit for the cyanide leach plant at the Puerto 
Blanco mill site in Guanajuato, Mexico has been reviewed by 
SEMARNAT (the Mexican equivalent of the EPA), and they have 
responded with various questions. We anticipate answering the 
inquiries in October. SEMARNAT is expected to review the answers 
and respond within 30 days.           

 

The Los 
Juarez caustic leach circuit in Coahuila is designed to recover 
contaminants from the flotation concentrates, and pilot-scale 
production is expected during Q4 2016. Depending on the approval 
of SEMARNAT permitting of the cyanide leach plant at Puerto 
Blanco and the installation of equipment, testing of the Los 
Juarez circuit could start in Q1 2017. 

 

Two new 
BRZ representatives are beginning to take orders. They will be 
covering the agricultural markets in the United States. BRZ will 
be represented at the World Dairy Expo in Madison, Wisconsin 
from October 3-8, 2016. The dairy market represents a growing 
market for BRZ.   

 

CEO 
John Lawrence said �rising antimony prices and the possibility 
of new orders for BRZ will help to bring the Los Juarez property 
on stream and start a deeper exploration drilling program into 
2017.

U. S. ANTIMONY REPORTS 
PROGRESS

September 
6, 2016. Thompson Falls, Montana. United States Antimony 
Corporation (�USAC�, NYSE MKT �UAMY�) reported the following 
sales estimates for August 2016: 






Product



August  





Antimony pounds



245,785





BRZ zeolite tons



1,120





Gold from Australia ounces



61.663




During the 
month of August, the Rotterdam price per metric of antimony 
firmed from $6,950.00 ($3.15 per pound) to $7200 ($3.265 per 
pound) by the end of the month, an increase of $250.00 per ton 
($0.113 per pound).

Antimony 
sales during August were up from July (173,498 pounds) due to 
greater raw material supply.  Australian antimony concentrates 
will be finished by the end of 2016, but gold production will 
continue into 2017. Our Mexican mine production is being ramped 
up to provide smelter feed to Madero to replace the
australian 
production.  Australian gold production was off during August 
due to a lack of refractory supplies from India.

The 
environmental permit for the cyanide leach plant at the Puerto 
Blanco mill site in Guanajuato, Mexico is being reviewed by 
SEMARNAT (the Mexican equivalent of the EPA), and the initial 
response is expected by the middle of September. When SEMARNAT 
issues the permit the mill will recover gold and silver from the 
tailings of the flotation mill. Recovered values per ton of open 
pit   mine feed are expected to be in the $145.00 to $155.00 
range. USAC does not claim any reserves by S.E.C. definition.

The Los 
Juarez leach circuit at the Madero smelter designed to recover 
gold and silver from the flotation concentrates has been 
completed, and test work will begin this month. The Company has 
an inventory of Los Juarez concentrates at Madero from the 
flotation tests.

A new BRZ 
salesman and his staff have been retained, primarily for animal 
feed sales, the largest market for BRZ.  

CEO John 
Lawrence said �the testing of the Madero leach plant and the 
imminent permit for the leach plant at Puerto Blanco brings the 
company closer to becoming a significant precious metal 
producer.�

U. S. 
ANTIMONY REPORTS STRONG ZEOLITE SALES 


July 5, 2016. Thompson Falls, 
Montana. United States Antimony Corporation (�USAC�, NYSE MKT �UAMY�) 
reported strong production at the Bear River Zeolite mine which 
increased from 3,072 tons in Q1:16 to 4,236 tons in Q2:16, an 
increase of 36.8%. Growth can be attributed to the new 
production line for granules and fines and increased sales.

Following are the sales 
estimates for June:

Antimony production was 
slightly lower due to the startup of the recovery of gold from 
Australian concentrates. During the month of June, the Rotterdam 
price for antimony firmed from $6,150.00 per metric ton ($2.79 
per pound) to $6,750.00 ($3.06 per pound) by the end of the 
month, an increase of $600.00 per ton ($0.27 per pound). The 
price is now approximately $3.15 per pound in the United States.

The Environmental Permit 
(�MIA� the equivalent of an Environmental Impact Study) and a 
�Risk Analysis� for the cyanide leach plant at the Puerto Blanco 
mill site in Guanajuato, Mexico was filed with SEMARNAT (the 
Mexican equivalent of the EPA.). The plant will recover gold and 
silver from the tailings of the flotation mill. Based on the 
latest mill test of 140 metric tons from the Reynaldo pit at Los 
Juarez anticipated overall recoveries using the cyanide circuit 
are as follows:

CEO John Lawrence said �the 
Los Juarez permitting is in the hands of SEMARNAT, and they 
should respond within 60 working days. The sourcing of equipment 
is now underway for the cyanide leach plant. Following the 
permitting, the plant will be installed and very cautious 
testing will begin to confirm the metallurgy, engineering, and 
the training of personnel.  The increase in the price of 
antimony and volume of zeolite sales should help fund the Los 
Juarez leach plant to expand silver and gold production.�

54.573




At the present time, Bear 
River Zeolite (BRZ), a wholly owned subsidiary of USAC, has 
current orders for 1,992 tons, of which 822 tons are in 
progress. BRZ has added another production line to the plant. 
The new production line should double the production of granular 
products and fines. Now there are two granular production lines 
and a third line with a grinding mill that produces very fine 
products. The demand for all products has increased and the 
Company is now producing for a large order for water 
remediation. 

The Rotterdam price for 
antimony metal has remained firm and was quoted at $2.79 per 
pound on June 1. The increase in prices will begin to impact 
USAC sales by this month. The production of antimony for May was 
significantly more than the sales.


Additional equipment has been 
installed to increase the gold production from Australian 
concentrates. These additions will facilitate the silver and 
gold from Los Juarez production in the future. Permits for Los 
Juarez have been prepared and are expected to be filed in June. 
Semarnat (Mexican equivalent of the EPA) will have 60 days to 
respond to them. A significant silver and gold shipment will be 
made this month from North American sources. 

CEO John Lawrence said �the 
increase in the price of antimony is coming at a time when 
zeolite sales are surging and the increase in income should help 
to fund the Los Juarez leach plant to expand silver and gold 
production.�

U. S. ANTIMONY REPORTS ANTIMONY PRICE INCREASE AND LARGE ZEOLITE 
ORDER 

May 2, 
2016. Thompson Falls, Montana. United States Antimony 
Corporation (�USAC�, NYSE MKT �UAMY�) reported the following 
sales for April: 






Product



April 2016





Antimony pounds



221,145





BRZ zeolite tons



1,253





Gold from Australia ounces



60.109




Production 
of antimony during April was actually 349,224 pounds that had 
been sold but 128,079 had not been delivered.  Zeolite sales 
were good despite bad weather conditions. Additionally, BRZ, a 
wholly owned subsidiary of USAC, has received a new order for 
1,400 tons of zeolite for the mining industry. The shipment of 
this order could be as fast as 160 tons per week. 


USAC 
reported that the Rotterdam price for antimony metal has 
increased from $2.449 per pound on April 1 to $2.834 on April 
25, a 15.7% increase. The Rotterdam pricing is fundamental to 
Europe where inventories are low. The increase in prices will 
begin to impact USAC sales by the end of May. 

The two 
largest impediments to the profitability of USAC have been (1) 
the decline in the price of antimony from $8.11 per pound in 
April 2011 to $2.27 in January 2016, a 72% decrease, and (2) the 
�non production Mexican expenses� that have been included in the 
cost of antimony  production. These costs include the holding 
costs of mines and mills in Mexico that have been idle due to a 
lack of furnace capacity at Madero and the solving of the Los 
Juarez metallurgical problems. To solve this second problem, in 
April the processing of Wadley hand sorted ore and concentrates 
was begun at Madero. Additionally, the SEMARNAT (our equivalent 
of the EPA) Environmental Impact Statement and Risk Analysis 
Study will be filed in May to permit the installation of the 
cyanide leach plant at the Puerto Blanco mill in Guanajuato. The 
permit, when issued, will also start the significant production 
of gold and silver from the Los Juarez property.

CEO John 
Lawrence said �the increase in the price of antimony is what we 
have been waiting for and the processing of the Mexican ore 
inventory will supplement income to fund the Los Juarez leach 
plant. Additionally, new applications of zeolite remain 
exciting.�

U. S. ANTIMONY REPORTS PRODUCTION AND LOS JUAREZ  MILL TESTING


April 4, 2016. Thompson 
Falls, Montana. United States Antimony Corporation (�USAC�, NYSE 
MKT �UAMY�) reported preliminary Q1 2016 production as follows:

The Rotterdam price per 
metric ton for antimony metal has gone up $200.00 from $5,225.00 
($2.370 per pound) to $5,425.00 ($2.461 per pound) in the last 
three weeks. Hopefully this may mark the bottom of the market.

Zeolite production and sales 
have held steady due to heavy rain and snow at Preston, Idaho 
which delayed the production of multiple orders. However, 
production should increase in Q2 of 2016 and may include new 
orders for ammonium control in the mining industry.

Gold production from 
Australia has begun and the complex metallurgy has been solved, 
and the capacity of the plant has been increased.

The initial mill testing of 
140 metric tons from the Reynaldo pit at Los Juarez was 
completed to determine the grade of non-selectively mined rock, 
the recoveries, and whether a cyanide leach circuit was 
necessary at the Puerto Blanco mill. The ball mill grind was 
increased to boost liberation of the sub-microscopic gold and 
silver. Samples were taken every 10 minutes of the heads and 
tails (feed and discharge of the mill) and combined for a two 
hour composite that represents 10 metric tons. The samples were 
submitted to American Analytical Services, an independent assay 
laboratory.  Following are the results:





Metal

The recoveries are not 
acceptable. Previous flotation testing indicated higher 
recoveries of the antimony and silver in the 70-80% range. The 
lower recoveries from the Reynaldo pit were probably due to 
near-surface oxidation of the minerals. The flotation 
concentrate from this test was excellent and contained 59.2% 
antimony, 8.69 ounces per metric ton gold, and 481.9 ounces per 
metric ton silver, a gross value of $20,919.15 per ton. 


Using gold at $1215 per 
ounce, silver at $15.00 per ounce, and antimony at $2.40 with a 
70% recovery, the following values are anticipated per metric 
ton:




  Metal


Value no leach

  Gold


$24.30

$71.69



  Silver


$24.45

$38.40



  Total


$53.50

$125.28




 Given the metallurgical 
results, the installation of the leach circuit is required to 
achieve economic production. Leach recoveries by independent 
laboratories have been excellent. Accordingly, the plan is as 
follows:


 Stage 
1. Test the 
newly installed alkaline leach circuit at the Madero smelter 
to process flotation concentrates.


           Stage 2. 
Permitting is in process and construction of the leach plant at 
the Puerto Blanco mill will begin. USAC owns much of the 
necessary
                          
equipment.

            Stage 3. 
Install the 450-500 ton per day mill at Puerto Blanco or closer 
to the mine to reduce trucking costs.  

USAC 
claims no reserves per SEC definitions, and the drilling does 
not comply with Canadian NI 43-101.

 

CEO John Lawrence said �A 
cyanide leach plant is necessary at the Puerto Blanco mill. 
Construction of the leach plant will be expedited once the 
permit have been granted.. The Company is approaching the 
project in a slow methodical manner to prevent any mistakes and 
then ramp up to a rate of 450-500 tons per day.�

U. S. ANTIMONY REPORTS LOS JUAREZ  MILL TESTING IN PROGRESS


March 7, 
2016. Thompson Falls, Montana. United States Antimony 
Corporation (�USAC�, NYSE MKT �UAMY�) reported mill testing of 
the Los Juarez property in Queretaro, Mexico is in progress to 
determine whether a cyanide leach circuit is necessary. If it is 
not required, then no further permitting is foreseen to commence 
pilot scale production. 

The startup 
plan is to test every step of the operation on a pilot mill 
scale of up to100 tons per day. 

            Stage 1. The 
installation of the alkaline leach circuit at the Madero smelter 
in Mexico to process flotation concentrates is nearing
                           
completion.

            Stage 2. 
Milling campaigns of rock from different locations at Los Juarez 
are now underway to determine (1) whether selective mining
                          
is possible, and  (2) to determine whether a cyanide circuit at 
the Puerto Blanco mill in Guanajuato is required. 


            Stage 3. The 
installation of the cyanide leach plant at Puerto Blanco may not 
be necessary following stage 2. 

            Stage 4. will 
include the installation of the 500 ton per day mill close to 
the mine to reduce trucking costs.  

Los Juarez 
is a gold-silver-antimony deposit consisting of pipes intruded 
into limestone from substantial depths that are exposed over 3.5 
kilometers in length and up to1kilometer in width.  A shallow 
reconnaissance drilling program indicates a global average grade 
of 0.057 ounces (1.432 grams) gold, 2.43 ounces (75.24 grams) 
silver per metric ton, and 0.343% antimony. The gross value is 
$128.22 per ton based on gold at $1,250.00/oz, silver at 
$15.000/oz, and antimony at $2.45/lb. USAC claims no reserves 
per SEC definitions, and the drilling does not comply with 
Canadian NI 43-101.

A 63% 
increase in production from 2015 to 2016 was a result of the 
full time use of the LRF furnace. The production of antimony and 
BRZ zeolite are as follows:

CEO John 
Lawrence said �If a cyanide leach plant is not necessary at the 
Puerto Blanco mill, a tremendous savings in time and money could 
be realized for the startup of Los Juarez. Continued growth 
during 2016 is being funded internally to prevent the dilution 
of the shareholder base or taking on debt.�

U. S. 
ANTIMONY REPORTS PLANS TO START LOS JUAREZ 


February 1, 
2016. Thompson Falls, Montana. United States Antimony 
Corporation (�USAC�, NYSE MKT �UAMY�) reported plans to start 
its Los Juarez gold-silver-antimony property in Queretaro, 
Mexico


LOS JUAREZ DEPOSIT

ECONOMIC GEOLOGY. 
Los Juarez is a gold-silver-antimony deposit hosted by jasperoid 
(siliceous) pipes intruded into limestone from substantial 
depths that are exposed over 3.5 kilometers in length and up 
to1kilometer in width. Los Juarez resembles gold deposits in the 
Carlin trend in Nevada in terms of mineralogy and structure.  A 
shallow reconnaissance drilling program was begun to delineate 
the higher grade zones for mining.  The global average grade 
based on these drill holes and rock chip samples is 0.057 ounces 
(1.432 grams) gold, 2.43 ounces (75.24 grams) silver per metric 
ton, and 0.343% antimony. The gross value is $116.16 per ton 
based on gold at $1,100.00/oz, silver at $14.000/oz, and 
antimony at $2.36/lb.  To date, less than 5% of the property has 
been drilled.   USAC claims no reserves per SEC definitions, and 
the drilling does not comply with Canadian NI 43-101.

Management 
is not sure whether these higher grade intercepts can be 
selectively mined. However, in 2013 USAC milled 3,556 metric 
tons of legacy dump rock that averaged 0.049 oz (1.52 g) gold, 
6.11 oz (189 g) silver, and 0.78% antimony. At today�s prices, 
the rock had a gross value of $180.00 per ton. 


METALLURGY.

The complex metallurgy of the deposit has been a deterrent to 
two major Mexican mining companies to exploit the deposit.  USAC 
believes it has solved these problems.

ANTICIPATED COSTS. 
Utilizing the Puerto Blanco mill, the costs per ton of mined 
rock would include mining at $8.00, trucking $15.00, milling at 
$25.00, and concentrate smelting $15.00 � a total of $65.00. The 
addition of the cyanide plant would increase the cost $8.00 per 
ton of mine rock � a total of $73.00. The 500 ton per day mill 
placed close to the mine could reduce costs to $50.00 per ton.

STARTUP PLAN. 
This plan is designed to test every step of the operation on a 
pilot scale of up to 100 tons per day to prevent fatal 
engineering flaws.


Stage 1. is to 
complete the installation of the alkaline leach circuit at 
the Madero smelter that is currently underway. It will 
include the
processing of Los Juarez concentrates in inventory.

Stage 2. will include 
milling campaigns of rock from different mine locations at 
to determine (1) whether selective mining is possible and 
(2) to determine the recovery of the gold. Recovery of the 
silver and antimony has varied from 75-90%, but the gold 
recovery has varied from 30-80%. 

Stage 3. will be the 
installation of the cyanide leach plant at Puerto Blanco to 
increase the recovery of the silver but especially the gold.


Stage 4. will include 
the installation of the 500 ton per day mill close to the 
mine to reduce trucking costs estimated at $15.00 per ton. 




ANTIMONY MARKET

The average price per 
pound for USAC�s antimony contained in oxide and metal has rose 
$0.05, and the demand for USAC antimony products remains strong. 
Currently USAC is exploring the possibility of selling the 
Guadalupe stibnite concentrates (antimony tri-sulfide) directly 
to the friction brake industry.


GOLD PRODUCTION

Gold is now 
being recovered from the Australian concentrates. When 
processing of the inventory has been completed, USAC may recover 
more than 1,000 ounces.  


BEAR RIVER ZEOLITE

During the 
month of January, Bear River zeolite has sold about 
1,089             tons of zeolite, which will contribute to the 
completion of the Los Juarez gold-silver-antimony project.

CEO John 
Lawrence said �USAC is postured to start production of Los 
Juarez gold, silver and antimony and increase antimony and 
zeolite output. Continued growth during 2016 is being funded 
internally to prevent the dilution of the shareholder base.�


About U.S. Antimony

US Antimony 
is a growing, vertically- integrated natural resource company 
that has production and diversified operations in precious 
metals, zeolite and antimony.  Key operations currently 
generating revenues are located in Northwest Montana, Southern

ANTIMONY REPORTS RECORD ZEOLITE AND ANTIMONY SALES 


January 4, 
2016. Thompson Falls, Montana. United States Antimony Corporation 
(�USAC�, NYSE MKT �UAMY�) reported that it has sold 5,377 tons of 
zeolite in Q4 of 2015 compared to 3,063 tons in Q4 of 2014, an 
increase of 75%. During 2015, the Company sold 15,235 tons of 
zeolite compared to 11,079 sold in 2014, an increase of 37%.

During Q4 of 
2015, the Company sold 617,451 pounds of antimony compared to 
425,351 pounds during Q4 of 2014, an increase of 45%. During 2015, 
the Company sold 2,487,321 pounds of antimony, compared to 1,727,804 
sold in 2014, an increase of 44%. The Mexican Government (SAT) has 
released approximately $120,000 to USAC for taxes withheld by IMMEX, 
and USAC has also utilized more of that money for payroll taxes in 
Mexico.

On December 23, 
2015, Hillgrove Mines Pty Ltd announced the closure of their mine at 
Amidale, New South Wales, Australia due to the 2015 declining price 
of antimony from $8,000 to $5,000 per metric ton (from $3.62 to 
$2.27 per pound). Hillgrove has placed the mine on care and 
maintenance pending improved antimony prices.  At the present time, 
USAC has a four to five month inventory of Hillgrove concentrates at 
Madero, Mexico. USAC will replace the Hillgrove concentrates with 
production from Wadley, Soyatal, and Guadalupe. 

USAC personnel 
are working to meet the military specification for antimony 
tri-sulfide for use in all ordnance for the U. S. Department of 
Defense and for private use. The sale price of the antimony in this 
specialty product is significantly higher, at approximately double 
the sale price of antimony metal.

China controls 
more than 90% of the world supply of antimony. Some of the Chinese 
producers have completed their production for the year and will not 
start again until after the Chinese New Years in February 8, 2016, 
complaining that they have been selling $0.34 per pound below their 
cost.

A circuit to 
recover by-products from the Los Juarez concentrates is being 
installed at the Madero smelter. The Company expects to submit an 
application for a permit to recover by-products from the flotation 
tailings from Los Juarez in early January 2016. Approval of the 
permit is expected by the end of Q1 2016.

CEO John 
Lawrence said �Although we are disappointed with the price of 
antimony and suspension of Hillgrove�s production, this provides us 
the opportunity to transition back into smelting our own 
concentrates from Wadley, Soyotal, and Guadalupe.  This, combined 
with increased zeolite sales and possible production from Los Juarez 
in the first half of 2016, positions the Company for continued 
growth in the coming year.�

Where applicable, a project is considered as such until the end of construction and ramp-up to full capacity (with the exception of mining projects, where the date of commissioning signifies the end of the project). Projects must have a:  a) Start date b) Estimate for completion c) Initial investment estimate  Data For state-owned projects, initial information about the start date and estimates for completion and investment are taken from original signed contracts, along with addendums and annexes. If original contracts cannot be obtained, information is taken from public documents, presentations, news articles from BNamericas archives, and external sources. In cases where contracts are subject to approval by legislators, the start date is the date of the law or legislative approval. In the case of private projects, information is taken from public sources, such as stock exchange filings, annual reports, company presentations, third party research and press releases. In judging the timing of investment decisions for private projects, great care was taken to differentiate between large projects receiving environmental approval and proceeding directly to construction, and smaller projects where the investment decision hinges on securing financing. Best care is taken to ensure that recorded data is correct at the time of entry and that each entry is backed with a relevant source. The greatest care possible was taken to ensure consistency of information in order make a like-for-like comparison in project costs. Insofar as the figures rely on disclosure by the organization or company responsible, the figures can be considered to be conservative in nature. No attempt was made to adjust figures for inflation during the course of research or for consideration of the time value of money. Validation In the case of state-owned projects, validation is carried out where possible with either a member of the consortium, EPC contractor, a relevant state agency or advisors to either party. Currency Projects costs are measured in US dollars. Where project costs are measured in a local currency, amounts are converted to US dollars at the date of the relevant announcement, signature or report.  Severity of deviation from original estimates The severity of deviation from original estimates is defined according to set criteria.
