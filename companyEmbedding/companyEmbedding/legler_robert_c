Capital One® Secured Mastercard®


                                            I never had played in credit before, and someone suggested this card to me to build credit for the first time. I've been really satisfied for the most part. They report quickly and accurately, remind me when my bill is due, and the customer service has been kind and thorough....show more

GEICO


                                            GEICO needs in depth review by AG's nationwide. Highly recommend that you shop around and take time to review each company. GEICO will let you down 100% You work hard for your money, Invest your time to find a real insurance company. Good luck.

Wells Fargo


                                            I find it quite disturbing to see 24 one star, the lowest, ratings on the first page of Wallet Hub's most recent reviews of Wells Fargo. Somehow, in its overall summary, Wallet Hub still gives the impression Wells Fargo is a good banking option. What's going on here?

Navy Federal Credit Union nRewards® Credit Card


                                            I thought this was a good program until I tried to order a Yeti cooler on the members mall and every cooler in every size was out of stock.

Bed Bath & Beyond® Credit Card


                                            The Bed Bath & Beyond Mastercard was purchased from US Bank in October 2016.

                                            It is my opinion that you would do better to find a different company. In the long run they will charge you plenty and the support is virtually non-existent. They don't even have a working answering system. They are disorganized  and a nightmare to work with.

                                            i love banking with veridian, but the new updated online banking is garbage.10x harder to navigate than before staring from the log in page. Making simple transfers or even looking at accounts is harder and more confusing. bring back the old version.

Capital One® Secured Mastercard®


                                            I never had played in credit before, and someone suggested this card to me to build credit for the first time.

GEICO


                                            GEICO needs in depth review by AG's nationwide. Highly recommend that you shop around and take time to review each company. GEICO will let you down 100% You work hard for your money, Invest your time to find a real insurance company. Good luck.

Wells Fargo


                                            I find it quite disturbing to see 24 one star, the lowest, ratings on the first page of Wallet Hub's most recent reviews of Wells Fargo. Somehow, in its overall summary, Wallet Hub still gives the impression Wells Fargo is a good banking option. What's going on here?

                                            It is my opinion that you would do better to find a different company. In the long run they will charge you plenty and the support is virtually non-existent. They don't even have a working answering system. They are disorganized  and a nightmare to work with.

Making simple transfers or even looking at accounts is harder and more confusing. bring back the old version.

                                            I was pre qualified for a mortgage loan. They waited until the week before closing and decided that I did not qualify.  This was after i put $500.00 down and paid for the inspection and gave notice to where I was renting .

If the company isn't reporting the account correctly, you can submit a dispute to the credit bureaus asking them to correct it.

If you were a grad victim you don't need to fill out a fraud package. Google it. And send it to the credit bureaus.

I live on a fixed income. Its very difficult. My father and I are fairly comfortable, but due to the 40+ derogatory items on my credit report, which are all medically related. Lexington law, if you can afford their services, have done soo much for me. In only two months time, they removed 25+ items off my report. Unfortunately I'm unable to continue working with them, due to the roughly $100/mo fee, which is a bit too high for me.… read more

Who is taking it?  If you are just paying taxes and insurance no one can take it from you if you send a letter of intentions and pay what you can every month.  You might put the home up for a fast sale and with the money move into something affordable while paying the six thousand.

Excellent staff and service, but excessive advertising detracted from the experience — Edward S.

              
                  (Patient since Wed May 11 00:00:00 MDT 2016)
              
            
All of the staff were extremely helpful and friendly, and I felt that I got a good cleaning and good advice on next steps to take care of my teeth. However, the amount of advertising for products by outside vendors was a little disturbing. Not only was the only decoration of the office advertisements for dental products, but I was asked three separate times if I wanted to also buy a variety of extra dental care products. The whole experience felt more like what I would expect at a hair salon rather than a doctor's office (should I have given my dental hygenist a tip?). Dental health is primarily a health concern, so a trip to the dentist should feel like a trip to the doctor. I understand that outside vendors help support the business, but these products should be advertised in the check-out paperwork or via email - not in person by the dental assistants and oral hygenists.

I have had terrible experiences at some local dental offices, but the staff at DentalWorks made my visit wonderful.  From the assistant who did my xrays, to the dental hygienist who cleaned my teeth, to Dr. Leger himself,  every single staff member was courteous, helpful and a calming presence. Going to the dentist has been such a nerve wrecking experience for me in the past that I have avoided it. But I tried out this office and I'm SO glad I did. Thank you all for your caring manner and extremely welcoming demeanor.

 It's a shame that money comes first before caring for patients.  — Thomas B.

              
                  (Patient since Tue Sep 29 00:00:00 MDT 2015)
              
            
You guys do a great job. It's a shame that money comes first before caring for patients. I'm stuck with broken temporary dentures that I can't eat with. The money issues and the broken temporaries are my fault, but rather than trying to work with me in some kind of fashion, you turned me away and more or less told me that you will not do any further work until I come up with the balance and the cost of my permanent dentures. How sad that money takes precedence of the care of patients.

Prompt, friendly, professional.  The technician and dentist both took great care of me.  No poking or pain.  I was in and out in about 30 minutes.  I came prepared with a book to read, and only got in a couple of pages during my flouride treatment--no other waiting!

Dr. Legler impressed me in two ways — Robert Z.

Dr. Legler impressed me in two ways.  First, another Dentist I saw prior to him said that I needed extensive dental work.  I went for a second opinion with Dr. Legler.  He said that all that I really needed were 2 cavities filled!  Secondly, one of those fillings came out a year later.  I have other fillings, and would not have been surprised if they were the culprit.  Dr. Legler replaced the filling at no cost.  The above speaks volumes, as well as the fact that my teeth have been whiter, and given me no trouble since seeing him.  His staff is professional, knowledgeable, and caring.  I recommend this practice with no hesitation!

Avoid this practice at all costs. They are rude, don't explain things, and seem more interested in their money than in taking care of teeth. I can't comment on the dentist, because he only examined me and presented no treatment plan, in spite of my requests. I won't be going back.

Dentalworks is a good provider for dental needs but the true service comes from the individual dentist.  I am an 86 year old male with multiple health issues one of which is blindness.  In my requests for dentures over the past 5 years they were the only ones that understood my dental issues and were willing to make it happen.  Dr. Best (surgeon) and Dr. Legler are very compassionate and know what they are doing - give them a consult - you will not regret it!

I first went to DentalWorks at Southpoint years ago to have a denture relined. A few years ago was for an emergency extraction due to a chip/crack. This time was for new dentures, a partial, and some other work. Regardless of the reason for the visit, I have always received great service and the staff is excellent. They are thorough with explaining everything up front and answering questions. Even financing options for extensive work was completely covered to help me make the best decision for my needs. They will be my dentist for a long time to come.

Words can not express how happy I am with Dr. Legler and his team. I have never been a person who liked going to the dentist. Before finding Dr. Legler and Associates I had not been to a dentist in almost 10 years. Now, I go every 6 months without fail. They make going to the dentist a relaxed and pain free experience. Everyone in his office is friendly and Dr. Legler is a dental genius. I can honestly say I now enjoy going to the dentist. Thank You Dr. Legler and Associates!

I've been going to DentalWorks for a couple years now and would highly recommend this office.

The staff are all very friendly and good at what they do. At my latest appointment I was in and out of the office for a thorough cleaning and exam in only 30 minutes. I definitely plan to keep my business with Dr. Legler's office for as long as I am living in Durham.

T;he office gets a 5. The Dentist, introduced himself and shook my hand but afterwards explained to me the results of my exam by continuing to sit at my shoulder just behind my head and talk to "my ear". If I had wanted to make eye contact with him, I wouldve had to turn my head very awkwardly to the right. I felt like that was disrepectful. I may not return.    The assitant amd Dental Hygentist were excellant. Dr. Legler's bedside manor was much to be desired.  after leaving the office I felt the products you sold me , were PUSHED on to me

Dr. Best - is the Best! His Assistant is very nice to me as well. Dr. Best contacted me post surgery to ensure that I was ok. More Doctors should do this. At first I was a little Leary of visiting this office again after leaving in pain during my initial visit with Dr. Legler's. The dental assistant did not explain everything to me until I called after I left... I was then able to get a prescription and better explanation after returning to the office again.The front desk office staff recognized me and called me name during my 3rd visit. The service here has improved. Keep doing what you're doing!

Although my hygienist was very good I had issues upon checking out. I inquired about why they had charged me monies on my 1st visit. After some heated discussion it was discovered that they made an error. I had to argue to get my money refunded back to me. They wanted to keep it on the account as a "credit" however after that experience I will not be returning. The concept makes me think that Dental Works is the McDonalds of dentistry.

To put it mild  I HATE DENTIST... I picked dental works because they participate in my plan. I expected the same old service as every dentist has given me and for my anxiety of dentist to remain the same. I went for my first appointment and was surprised. I work in insurance and for a change I didn't have to explain to your fornt staff how to do the insurance part of their job.  They new that.. the assistants that worked with me was informative, friendly, understanding and very very helpful.  Within in 10 minutes my anxiety was calm and by the time I had to have my work I was fine.  I need more extensive dental work and I have no fear of getting the work done now that I have found Dr. Leglar and staff.

Dr. Legler and Staff are very professional, courteous, and personable. The office environment is peaceful and calming to 'jittery' nerves that one might feel visiting 'The Dentist'. They are very thorough in examining and treating your teeth. Everyone needs to go to the dentist. I definitely recommend Dr. Legler.

Everyone at the office is always pleasant.  This past trip, however, I had a new hygienist.  She was quick... probably too much so.  During my cleaning, she sped through so quickly that precision didn't seem to be a concern.  My gums felt like they were being massacred -- it was one of the more painful, non-surgical dental visits I can remember.  It might serve her well to slow down a pinch.

The office is clean and makes you feel comfortable.  The staff is friendly and knowledgeable.  It is not hard to get an appointment even on a short notice. I was givien the facts about my treatment and all the options from the dentist.  The staff provided me with a cost analysis for each option of my treatment.  The hygentist was very nice and understanding with all my questions.  I do not like dentist but for once this dentist office took that fear away just with the little things they do. I will update my review after my first initial work towards my treatment.  This was just an initial establishing visit so no real work was completed.  If the dentist is as good as the staff in the office, then this should be another great review.

Overall, the staff at DentalWorks at Southpoint are always professional and courteous. Initially, I came away from my first dental check-up almost two years ago unsure that I had made the right decision about selecting this dental office due to the dental hygienist that used to be there. She was not personable at all and didn't seem too pleased to be there. Now, there is a wonderful dental hygienist there, Dominique, who is gentle, professional, courteous, and doesn't mind answering questions. Dr. Legler and the lady who seems to serve different roles (not sure if she's his spouse) are always friendly. With Dominique on board, things can only get better!

I had a very pleasant experience with the dental hygienist this time. I think her name was Danielle. She was cordial, had a beautiful smile, and wasn't too rough with her cleaning technique. Overall, she is a nice addition to the team there.

I was very happy with my experience at DentalWorks!  I didn't expect to be able to get an appointment the day after I requested one, but you were able to accommodate me.  I needed a cavity replaced right away, and you did that painlessly and quickly.  Also, you didn't try to upsell any other services (which always makes me uncomfortable).  Thanks for your help!

This being my first visit, I can say on this visit everyone was polite and courteous.  I didn't feel pressure to get any procedure done.  Because of that I decided to have the recommended procedure done even though I thought the cost was a little pricey.
