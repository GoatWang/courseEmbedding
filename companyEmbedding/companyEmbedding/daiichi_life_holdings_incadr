Who trades options the most? Millennial investors
              
              Millennials are frequently criticized by market experts for the way they invest—or, more accurately, the way they’re not investing—but recent research indicates that at least some young market participants are going about things in a more sophisticated way than they’re typically given credit for.

              The U.S. dollar churned lower against most rivals save for the depreciating Swiss franc on Friday ahead of an update on the broadest measure of the U.S. economy—a GDP report that could help shape the Federal Reserve’s so far slow-moving approach to interest rates.
