That is 60.00% of the  financing offer. The total  offering amount was $250,000.  The form was filed on 2015-07-17. The reason for the financing was: unspecified.  The fundraising still has about $100,000 more and is not closed yet. We have to wait more to see if the offering will be fully taken.
 Pivot Holdings II  is based in New York. The  filler’s business is Investing. The  SEC form was  signed by Dinkar Jetley Director of Pivot Investment Partners LLC, Manager.  The company was incorporated in 2015. The filler’s address is: 25 Broadway, Suite 9019, New York, Ny, New York, 10004.

Analysis of Pivot Holdings II  Offering
On average,  firms in the Investing sector, sell 66.70% of the total offering  size. Pivot Holdings II  sold 60.00% of the offering.  The fundraising is still open. The average  offering size for companies in the Investing industry is $1.41 million. The offering was 89.35% smaller than the average of $1.41 million.  Of course this should not be  taken as negative.  Companies  raise funds for  a variety of  needs and reasons. The minimum investment for this  financing  was set at $25000. If you know more about the reasons for the  fundraising, please comment below.
What is Form D? What It Is Used For
Form D disclosures could be used to track and understand better your competitors. The information in Form D is usually highly confidential for ventures and startups and they don’t like revealing it. This is because it reveals amount raised or planned to be raised as well as reasons for the financing. This could help competitors. Entrepreneurs usually want to keep their financing a ‘secret’ so they can stay in stealth mode for longer.
Why Fundraising Reporting Is Good For Pivot Holdings II  Also
The Form D signed by Dinkar Jetley might help Pivot Holdings II Llc’s sector. First, it helps potential customers feel more safe to deal with a firm that is well financed. The odds are higher that it will stay in the business. Second, this could attract other investors such as venture-capital firms, funds and angels. Third, positive PR effects could even bring leasing firms and venture lenders.
