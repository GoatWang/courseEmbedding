(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation.  The information set forth in this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ("MD&A") contains certain "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including, among others (i) expected changes in our revenue and profitability, (ii) prospective business opportunities and (iii) our strategy for financing our business. Forward-looking statements are statements other than historical information or statements of current condition. Some forward-looking statements may be identified by use of terms such as "believes", "anticipates", "intends" or "expects". These forward-looking statements relate to our plans, liquidity, ability to complete financing and purchase capital expenditures, growth of our business including entering into future agreements with companies, and plans to successfully develop and obtain approval to market our product. We have based these forward-looking statements largely on our current expectations and projections about future events and financial trends that we believe may affect our financial condition, results of operations, business strategy and financial needs.  Although we believe that our expectations with respect to the forward-looking statements are based upon reasonable assumptions within the bounds of our knowledge of our business and operations, in light of the risks and uncertainties inherent in all future projections, the inclusion of forward-looking statements in this Annual Report should not be regarded as a representation by us or any other person that our objectives or plans will be achieved.  We assume no obligation to update these forward-looking statements to reflect actual results or changes in factors or assumptions affecting forward-looking statements.  Our revenues and results of operations could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements as a result of numerous factors, including, but not limited to, the following: the risk of significant natural disaster, the inability of the our company to insure against certain risks, inflationary and deflationary conditions and cycles, currency exchange rates, and changing government regulations domestically and internationally affecting our products and businesses.  You should read the following discussion and analysis in conjunction with the Financial Statements and Notes attached hereto, and the other financial data appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report.  US Dollars are denoted herein by "USD", "$" and "dollars".  Overview  During the period from our formation on November 2014 to October 2015, we did not generate any significant revenue, and accumulated no significant assets, as we explored various business opportunities.  On February 10, 2016, Muliang Industry Co., Ltd. ("Muliang Industry") entered into an entrusted management agreement with Muliang Agriculture Ltd.'s wholly owned subsidiary, Shanghai Mufeng Investment Consulting Co., Ltd. ("Shanghai Mufeng"), which provides that Shanghai Mufeng will be entitled to the full guarantee for the performance of such entrusted management agreement entered into by the Company. Muliang Agriculture Ltd. ("Muliang HK") was incorporated in Hong Kong, PRC on August 21, 2014. Other than the equity interest in Shanghai Mufeng, Muliang HK does not own any assets or conduct any operations. Shanghai Mufeng is also entitled to receive the residual return of the Company. As a result of the agreement, Shanghai Mufeng will absorb 100% of the expected gains or losses of the Company, which results in Shanghai Mufeng being the primary beneficiary of the Company.  Shanghai Mufeng also entered into a pledge of equity agreement with the principal shareholders of the Company (the "Principal Shareholders"), who pledged all their equity interest in the entity to Shanghai Mufeng. The pledge of equity agreement, which were entered into by each Principal Shareholder, pledged each of the Principal Shareholders' equity interest in the Company as a guarantee for the entrustment payment under the Entrusted Management Agreements. In addition, Shanghai Mufeng entered into an option agreement to acquire the Principal Shareholders' equity interest in these entities if or when permitted by the PRC laws.  Based on these exclusive agreements, the Company will be treated as a variable interest entity ("VIE") of Muliang HK as required by generally accepted accounting principles in the United States ("US GAAP"), because Muliang HK is the primary beneficiary of the VIE. The profits and losses of the Company are allocated based upon the Entrusted Management Agreement.  On February 10, 2016, we entered into a Share Exchange Agreement (the "Exchange Agreement") with Muliang HK. Pursuant to the terms of the Exchange Agreement, the shareholders of Muliang HK transferred to Mullan Agritech all of the Muliang HK Shares in exchange for the issuance of 150,525,000 shares of our common stock (the "Share Exchange"). As a result of the Share Exchange, Muliang HK became a wholly-owned subsidiary of us and the shareholders of Muliang HK acquired approximately 100% of our issued common shares.  The effect of the Share Exchange is such that effectively a reorganization of the entities has occurred for accounting purposes and is deemed to be a reverse acquisition. Subsequent to the Share Exchange the financial statements presented are those of a combined Muliang HK and its subsidiaries, including its VIE, Muliang Industry, as if the Share Exchange had been in effect retroactively for all periods presented. As previously noted the "Company" for financial statement purposes was the consolidation of Muliang HK, Shanghai Mufeng, Muliang Industry and Muliang Industry's subsidiaries. Muliang Industry's subsidiaries include its wholly-owned subsidiaries which are limited liability companies in People's Republic of China ("PRC"), Shanghai Zongbao Environment Engineering Co., Ltd. ("Zongbao") and Shanghai Muliang Agritech Development Co., Ltd. ("Agritech Development"); its 99% owned subsidiary, Weihai Fukang Bio-Fertilizer Co., Ltd. ("Fukang"), a PRC limited liability company, and Shanghai Muliang Agricultural Sales Co., Ltd. (Muliang Sales), a PRC limited liability company found in July 2015.  Subsequent to the Share Exchange the "Company" is referred to as the consolidation of Muliang HK, Shanghai Mufeng, Muliang Industry, Zongbao, Fukang, Agritech Development, Muliang sales, and Mullan Agritech, with Mullan Agritech as the legal acquirer in Share Exchange, and subsequent to the Share Exchange the parent company of the consolidated entity. For financial reporting purposes, Muliang HK was considered the acquirer in such transaction.  We are principally engaged in the fertilizer and forage grass processing and distribution business in the People's Republic of China ("PRC"). Currently, we have one fertilizer processing plant located in Shanghai in the PRC. Our current maximum production capacity is 30,000 metric tons a year. We have completed building two new fertilizer plants in Weihai City, Shandong Province and in Shanghai in the PRC. One of the new plants located in Weihai City was in operations in August 2015 with annual production capacity of 50,000 metric tons. Another new plant located in Shanghai has been completed in June 2016 with annual production capacity of 100,000 metric tons.This facility was designed with 4 production lines, with total contractual payment of approximately $11 million or RMB 67.7 million. While this facility has not put in operations since its completion. Part of the plant was rent to Huayu Sandian Automobile Air Conditioner Co. Ltd as warehouse from June 1 2016 to May 31, 2017, with a total rent of $235,705. We have an organic fertilizer processing facility, located in Weihai City, Shandong Province, with the annual production capacity of 50,000 tons organic fertilizers. The facility was designed with 2 production lines, with total contractual payment of approximately $4.6 million or RMB 28 million, and had been completed on August 2015.  Our products are sold under the "Zongbao" brand name. Our customers are mainly located in provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang and Shandong.  On June 6, 2016, Muliang Industry established a wholly-owned subsidiary, namely, Muliang (Ningling) Bio-chemical Fertilizer Co. Ltd ("Ningling Fertilizer") in Henan Province, the central plain of China. Ningling Fertilizer is setup for a new production line of bio-chemical fertilizer and has not begun any operation yet.  On July 7, 2016, Muliang Industry established a subsidiary, namely, Zhonglian Huinong (Beijing) Technology Co., Ltd (Zhonglian) in Beijing City, China. Muliang Industry owns 65% shares of Zhonglian, and a third-party company, Zhongrui Huilian (Beijing) Technology Co., Ltd owns the other 35% shares. Zhonglian is to develop and operate an online agricultural product trading platform.  On October 27, 2016, Muliang Industry established a subsidiary, namely, Yunnan Muliang Animal Husbandry Development Co., Ltd ("Yunnan Muliang") in Yunnan Province, China. Muliang Industry owns 55% shares of Yunnan Muliang, and a third-party company, Shuangbai County Development Investment Co., Ltd. owns the other 45% shares.YunnanMuliang was setup for the sales development of West China.  Critical Accounting Policies  Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. We evaluate, on an on-going basis, our estimates for reasonableness as changes occur in our business environment. We base our estimates on experience, the use of independent third-party specialists, and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.  Critical accounting policies are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments, estimates and uncertainties, and potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions. We believe the following are our critical accounting policies:  Basis of Presentation  Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, or U.S. GAAP.  Going Concern  As reflected in the accompanying consolidated financial statements, we had net accumulated deficit of $14,101,952 and $13,535,298 as of December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015. Our cash balances as of December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015 were $17,213 and $13,217, respectively. We had short-term payable of $11.95 million at December 31, 2016 which would due in the next 12 months. In addition, we had a working capital deficit of $9,544,224 and $5,293,361 at December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015 respectively. These matters raise substantial doubt about the company's ability to continue as a going concern. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent on the Company's ability to further implement its business plan, raise additional capital, and generate more revenues. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern.  Principles of Consolidation  The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Mullan Agritech, Muliang HK, Shanghai Mufeng, Muliang Industry, Zongbao, Fukang, Agritech Development, Zongbao Cangzhou, Ningling Fertilizer, Muliang Sales, Zhonglian ,and Yunnan Muliang. All intercompany transactions and account balances are eliminated in consolidation.  Use of Estimates  In preparing financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP, management makes estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements, as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Significant estimates, required by management, include the recoverability of long-lived assets and the valuation of inventories. Actual results could differ from those estimates.  Accounts Receivable  We state accounts receivable at cost, net of allowance for doubtful accounts. Based on our past experience and current practice in the PRC, management provides for an 100% allowance for doubtful accounts equivalent to those accounts that are not collected within one year plus 50% for receivables outstanding for six months old. It is management's belief that the current bad debt allowance adequately reflects an appropriate estimate based on management's judgment.  Inventory Valuation  We value our fertilizer inventories at the lower of cost, determined on a weighted average basis, and net realizable value (the estimated market price). Substantially all inventory expenses, packaging and supplies are valued by the weighted average method.  Apple Orchard  Apple Orchard consists primarily of rental for an apple farm, labor cost, fertilizers, apple seeds, apple seedlings and others. The costs to purchase and cultivate apple trees and the expenditures related to labor and materials to plant apple trees until they become commercially productive are capitalized, which require a 2-year period. The estimated production life for apple tree is 10 years, and the costs are amortized without a residual value. Expenses incurred maintaining apple trees during the growth cycle until seedling apple trees or grafted varieties are fruited are capitalized into inventory and included in Work in process-apple orchard, a component of inventories.  Amortized expenses pertaining to apple orchard are included in inventory costs for those apples to be sold and ultimately become a component of cost of goods sold. Similar to other assets, the failure of our apple orchard to be serviceable over the entirety of their anticipated useful lives or to be sold at their anticipated residual value will negatively impact our operating results.  Revenue Recognition  Our revenue recognition policies are in compliance with Securities Exchange Commission ("SEC") Staff Accounting Bulletin ("SAB") 104 (codified in Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") Topic 605). Sales revenue is recognized after delivery is complete, customer acceptance of the product occurs and collectability is reasonably assured. Payments received before satisfaction of all relevant criteria for revenue recognition are recorded as unearned revenue. Unearned revenue consists of payments received from customers prior to customer acceptance of our products.  Sales revenue represents the invoiced value of goods, net of value-added tax, or VAT. Our products sold and services provided in China are subject to VAT of 13% of gross sales price. This VAT may be offset by VAT paid by us on raw materials and other materials included in the cost of producing the finished product. We recorded VAT payable and VAT receivable net of payments in the financial statements. The VAT tax return is filed offsetting the payables against the receivables.  Income Taxes  We account for income taxes in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes." We compute our provision for income taxes based on the statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available to us in the PRC. Significant judgment is required in evaluating our tax positions and determining our annual tax position.  New Accounting Standards  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-08,"Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net)". The amendments in this ASU are intended to improve the operability and understandability of the implementation guidance on principal versus agent considerations by amending certain existing illustrative examples and adding additional illustrative examples to assist in the application of the guidance. The effective date and transition of these amendments is the same as the effective date and transition of ASU 20140-9, "Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)". Public entities should apply the amendments in ASU 2014-09 for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim reporting periods therein. The Company is currently in the process of evaluating the impact of the adoption on its consolidated financial statements.  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09, "Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting". The amendments are effective for public companies for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods. Several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment award transactions are simplified, including: (a) income tax consequences; (b) classification of awards as either equity or liabilities; and (c) classification on the statement of cash flows. The Company is currently in the process of evaluating the impact of the adoption on its financial statements.  In April 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-10, "Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing". The amendments add further guidance on identifying performance obligations and also to improve the operability and understandability of the licensing implementation guidance. The amendments do not change the core principle of the guidance in Topic 606. The effective date and transition requirements for the amendments are the same as the effective date and transition requirements in Topic 606. The Company is currently in the process of evaluating the impact of the adoption on its financial statements.  In May 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-12, "Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients". The amendments, among other things: (1) clarify the objective of the collectability criterion for applying paragraph 606-10-25-7; (2) permit an entity to exclude amounts collected from customers for all sales (and other similar) taxes from the transaction price; (3) specify that the measurement date for noncash consideration is contract inception; (4) provide a practical expedient that permits an entity to reflect the aggregate effect of all modifications that occur before the beginning of the earliest period presented when identifying the satisfied and unsatisfied performance obligations, determining the transaction price, and allocating the transaction price to the satisfied and unsatisfied performance obligations; (5) clarify that a completed contract for purposes of transition is a contract for which all (or substantially all) of the revenue was recognized under legacy GAAP before the date of initial application, and (6) clarify that an entity that retrospectively applies the guidance in Topic 606 to each prior reporting period is not required to disclose the effect of the accounting change for the period of adoption. The effective date of these amendments is at the same date that Topic 606 is effective. The Company is currently in the process of evaluating the impact of the adoption on its consolidated financial statements.  In June 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-13 (ASU 2016-13) "Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments" which requires the measurement and recognition of expected credit losses for financial assets held at amortized cost. ASU 2016-13 replaces the existing incurred loss impairment model with an expected loss methodology, which will result in more timely recognition of credit losses. ASU 2016-13 is effective for annual reporting periods, and interim periods within those years beginning after December 15, 2019. The Company is currently in the process of evaluating the impact of the adoption on its consolidated financial statements.  In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15, Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments, which is intended to reduce diversity in practice in how certain cash receipts and payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows. The standard provides guidance in a number of situations including, among others, settlement of zero-coupon bonds, contingent consideration payments made after a business combination, proceeds from the settlement of insurance claims, and distributions received from equity method investees. The ASU also provides guidance for classifying cash receipts and payments that have aspects of more than one class of cash flows. The Company is currently in the process of evaluating the impact of the adoption on its consolidated financial statements.  In October 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-17, "Consolidation (Topic 810):  In November 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-18, "Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Restricted Cash". These amendments require that a statement of cash flows explain the change during the period in the total of cash, cash equivalents, and amounts generally described as restricted cash or restricted cash equivalents. As a result, amounts generally described as restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents should be included with cash and cash equivalents when reconciling the beginning-of-period and end-of-period total amounts shown on the statement of cash flows. The amendments do not provide a definition of restricted cash or restricted cash equivalents. The amendments in this ASU are effective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. The amendments should be applied using a retrospective transition method to each period presented. The Company is currently in the process of evaluating the impact of the adoption on its consolidated financial statements.  In December 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-20, "Technical Corrections and Improvements to Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers". The amendments in ASU 2016-20 affect narrow aspects of the guidance issued in ASU 2014-09 including Loan Guarantee Fees, Contract Costs, Provisions for Losses on Construction-Type and Production-Type Contracts, Disclosure of Remaining Performance Obligations, Disclosure of Prior Period Performance Obligations, Contract Modifications, Contract Asset vs. Receivable, Refund Liabilities, Advertising Costs, Fixed Odds Wagering Contracts in the Casino Industry, and Costs Capitalized for Advisors to Private Funds and Public Funds. The effective date of these amendments are at the same date that Topic 606 is effective. Topic 606 is effective for public entities for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim reporting periods therein (i.e., January 1, 2018, for a calendar year entity). The Company is currently in the process of evaluating the impact of the adoption on its consolidated financial statements.  The Company believes that there were no other accounting standards recently issued that had or are expected to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations.  Results of Operations  We focus on the implementation of our strategic plan to complete our new fertilizer production facilities. Those two new facilities were designed with 50,000 metric tons and 100,000 metric tons of fertilizer production capacities. With completion of the two new factories, we would be able to expand our market shares in Jiangsu, Zhejiang and Shandong Province, PRC. One of our two new fertilizer factories located in Weihai City, Shandong Province was completed in May 2015 and put in operations in August 2015, and another located in Shanghai City was completed in June 2016.

(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.  The information set forth in this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ("MD&A") contains certain "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including, among others (i) expected changes in our revenue and profitability, (ii) prospective business opportunities and (iii) our strategy for financing our business. Forward-looking statements are statements other than historical information or statements of current condition. Some forward-looking statements may be identified by use of terms such as "believes", "anticipates", "intends" or "expects". These forward-looking statements relate to our plans, liquidity, ability to complete financing and purchase capital expenditures, growth of our business including entering into future agreements with companies, and plans to successfully develop and obtain approval to market our product. We have based these forward-looking statements largely on our current expectations and projections about future events and financial trends that we believe may affect our financial condition, results of operations, business strategy and financial needs.  Although we believe that our expectations with respect to the forward-looking statements are based upon reasonable assumptions within the bounds of our knowledge of our business and operations, in light of the risks and uncertainties inherent in all future projections, the inclusion of forward-looking statements in this Quarterly Report should not be regarded as a representation by us or any other person that our objectives or plans will be achieved.  We assume no obligation to update these forward-looking statements to reflect actual results or changes in factors or assumptions affecting forward-looking statements.  Our revenues and results of operations could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements as a result of numerous factors, including, but not limited to, the following: the risk of significant natural disaster, the inability of our company to insure against certain risks, inflationary and deflationary conditions and cycles, currency exchange rates, and changing government regulations domestically and internationally affecting our products and businesses.  You should read the following discussion and analysis in conjunction with the Financial Statements and Notes attached hereto, and the other financial data appearing elsewhere in this Quarterly Report.  US Dollars are denoted herein by "USD", "$" and "dollars".  Overview  During the period from our formation on November 2014 to October 2015, we did not generate any significant revenue, and accumulated no significant assets, as we explored various business opportunities.  On February 10, 2016, Muliang Industry Co., Ltd. ("Muliang Industry") entered into an entrusted management agreement with Muliang Agriculture Ltd.'s wholly owned subsidiary, Shanghai Mufeng Investment Consulting Co., Ltd. ("Shanghai Mufeng"), which provides that Shanghai Mufeng will be entitled to the full guarantee for the performance of such entrusted management agreement entered into by the Company. Muliang Agriculture Ltd. ("Muliang HK") was incorporated in Hong Kong, PRC on August 21, 2014. Other than the equity interest in Shanghai Mufeng, Muliang HK does not own any assets or conduct any operations. Shanghai Mufeng is also entitled to receive the residual return of the Company. As a result of the agreement, Shanghai Mufeng will absorb 100% of the expected gains or losses of the Company, which results in Shanghai Mufeng being the primary beneficiary of the Company.  Shanghai Mufeng also entered into a pledge of equity agreement with the principal shareholders of the Company (the "Principal Shareholders"), who pledged all their equity interest in the entity to Shanghai Mufeng. The pledge of equity agreement, which were entered into by each Principal Shareholder, pledged each of the Principal Shareholders' equity interest in the Company as a guarantee for the entrustment payment under the Entrusted Management Agreements. In addition, Shanghai Mufeng entered into an option agreement to acquire the Principal Shareholders' equity interest in these entities if or when permitted by the PRC laws.  Based on these exclusive agreements, the Company will be treated as a variable interest entity ("VIE") of Muliang HK as required by generally accepted accounting principles in the United States ("US GAAP"), because Muliang HK is the primary beneficiary of the VIE. The profits and losses of the Company are allocated based upon the Entrusted Management Agreement.  On February 10, 2016, we entered into a Share Exchange Agreement (the "Exchange Agreement") with Muliang HK. Pursuant to the terms of the Exchange Agreement, the shareholders of Muliang HK transferred to Mullan Agritech all of the Muliang HK Shares in exchange for the issuance of 150,525,000 shares of our common stock (the "Share Exchange"). As a result of the Share Exchange, Muliang HK became a wholly-owned subsidiary of us and the shareholders of Muliang HK acquired approximately 100% of our issued common shares.  The effect of the Share Exchange is such that effectively a reorganization of the entities has occurred for accounting purposes and is deemed to be a reverse acquisition. Subsequent to the Share Exchange the financial statements presented are those of a combined Muliang HK and its subsidiaries, including its VIE, Muliang Industry, as if the Share Exchange had been in effect retroactively for all periods presented. As previously noted the "Company" for financial statement purposes was the consolidation of Muliang HK, Shanghai Mufeng, Muliang Industry and Muliang Industry's subsidiaries. Muliang Industry's subsidiaries include its wholly-owned subsidiaries which are limited liability companies in People's Republic of China ("PRC"), Shanghai Zongbao Environment Engineering Co., Ltd. ("Zongbao") and Shanghai Muliang Agritech Development Co., Ltd. ("Agritech Development"); its 99% owned subsidiary, Weihai Fukang Bio-Fertilizer Co., Ltd. ("Fukang"), a PRC limited liability company, and Shanghai Muliang Agricultural Sales Co., Ltd. (Muliang Sales), a PRC limited liability company found in July 2015.  Subsequent to the Share Exchange the "Company" is referred to as the consolidation of Muliang HK, Shanghai Mufeng, Muliang Industry, Zongbao, Fukang, Agritech Development, Muliang sales, and Mullan Agritech, with Mullan Agritech as the legal acquirer in Share Exchange, and subsequent to the Share Exchange the parent company of the consolidated entity. For financial reporting purposes, Muliang HK was considered the acquirer in such transaction.  We are principally engaged in the meat and food processing and distribution business in the People's Republic of China ("PRC"). Currently, we have one fertilizer processing plant located in Shanghai in the PRC. Our current maximum production capacity is 30,000 metric tons a year. We are currently building 2 new fertilizer plants in Weihai City, Shandong Province and in Shanghai in the PRC. One of the new plants located in Weihai City was in operations in August 2015 with annual production capacity of 100,000 metric tons. Another new plant located in Shanghai has been completed in June 2016 with annual production capacity of 100,000 metric tons. This facility was designed with 4 production lines, with total contractual payment of approximately $11 million or RMB 67.7 million. While this facility has not put in operations since its completion. Part of the plant was rent to Huayu Sandian Automobile Air Conditioner Co. Ltd as warehouse from June 1 2016 to May 31, 2017, with a total rent of $235,705. We have an organic fertilizer processing facility, located in Weihai City, Shandong Province, with the annual production capacity of 50,000 tons organic fertilizers. The facility was designed with 2 production lines, with total contractual payment of approximately $4.6 million or RMB 28 million, and had been completed on August 2015.  Our products are sold under the "Zongbao" brand name. Our customers are mainly located in provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang and Shandong.  On June 6, 2016, Muliang Industry established a wholly-owned subsidiary, namely, Muliang (Ningling) Bio-chemical Fertilizer Co. Ltd ("Ningling Fertilizer") in Henan Province, the central plain of China. Ningling Fertilizer is setup for a new production line of bio-chemical fertilizer and has not begun any operation yet.  On July 7, 2016, Muliang Industry established a subsidiary, namely, Zhonglian Huinong (Beijing) Technology Co., Ltd (Zhonglian) in Beijing City, China. Muliang Industry owns 65% shares of Zhonglian, and a third-party company, Zhongrui Huilian (Beijing) Technology Co., Ltd owns the other 35% shares. Zhonglian is to develop and operate an online agricultural product trading platform.  Critical Accounting Policies  Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. We evaluate, on an on-going basis, our estimates for reasonableness as changes occur in our business environment. We base our estimates on experience, the use of independent third-party specialists, and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.  Critical accounting policies are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments, estimates and uncertainties, and potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions. We believe the following are our critical accounting policies:  Basis of Presentation  Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, or U.S. GAAP.  Going Concern  As reflected in the accompanying consolidated financial statements, we had net accumulated deficit of $13,153,276 and $13,535,298 as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. Our cash balances as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 were $76,311 and $13,217, respectively. We had short-term payable of $12.37 million at September 30, 2016 which would due in the next 12 months. In addition, we had a working capital deficit of $9,787,566 and $4,985,276 at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 respectively. These matters raise substantial doubt about the company's ability to continue as a going concern. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent on the Company's ability to further implement its business plan, raise additional capital, and generate more revenues. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern.  Principles of Consolidation  The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Mullan Agritech, Muliang HK, Shanghai Mufeng, Muliang Industry, Zongbao, Fukang, Agritech Development, Zongbao Cangzhou, Ningling Fertilizer, Muliang Sales and Zhonglian. All intercompany transactions and account balances are eliminated in consolidation.  Use of Estimates  In preparing financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP, management makes estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements, as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Significant estimates, required by management, include the recoverability of long-lived assets and the valuation of inventories. Actual results could differ from those estimates.  Accounts Receivable  We state accounts receivable at cost, net of allowance for doubtful accounts. Based on our past experience and current practice in the PRC, management provides for an 100% allowance for doubtful accounts equivalent to those accounts that are not collected within one year plus 50% for receivables outstanding for six months old. It is management's belief that the current bad debt allowance adequately reflects an appropriate estimate based on management's judgment.  Inventory Valuation  We value our fertilizer inventories at the lower of cost, determined on a weighted average basis, and net realizable value (the estimated market price). Substantially all inventory expenses, packaging and supplies are valued by the weighted average method.  Apple Orchard  Apple Orchard consists primarily of rental for an apple farm, labor cost, fertilizers, apple seeds, apple seedlings and others. The costs to purchase and cultivate apple trees and the expenditures related to labor and materials to plant apple trees until they become commercially productive are capitalized, which require a 2-year period. The estimated production life for apple tree is 10 years, and the costs are amortized without a residual value. Expenses incurred maintaining apple trees during the growth cycle until seedling apple trees or grafted varieties are fruited are capitalized into inventory and included in Work in process-apple orchard, a component of inventories.  Amortized expenses pertaining to apple orchard are included in inventory costs for those apples to be sold and ultimately become a component of cost of goods sold. Similar to other assets, the failure of our apple orchard to be serviceable over the entirety of their anticipated useful lives or to be sold at their anticipated residual value will negatively impact our operating results.  Revenue Recognition  Our revenue recognition policies are in compliance with Securities Exchange Commission ("SEC") Staff Accounting Bulletin ("SAB") 104 (codified in Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") Topic 605). Sales revenue is recognized after delivery is complete, customer acceptance of the product occurs and collectability is reasonably assured. Payments received before satisfaction of all relevant criteria for revenue recognition are recorded as unearned revenue. Unearned revenue consists of payments received from customers prior to customer acceptance of our products.  Sales revenue represents the invoiced value of goods, net of value-added tax, or VAT. Our products sold and services provided in China are subject to VAT of 13% of gross sales price. This VAT may be offset by VAT paid by us on raw materials and other materials included in the cost of producing the finished product. We recorded VAT payable and VAT receivable net of payments in the financial statements. The VAT tax return is filed offsetting the payables against the receivables.  Income Taxes  We account for income taxes in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes." We compute our provision for income taxes based on the statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available to us in the PRC. Significant judgment is required in evaluating our tax positions and determining our annual tax position.  New Accounting Standards  In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01, "Financial Instruments Overall (Subtopic 82510): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities". The amendments in ASU 201601, among other things, requires equity investments (except those accounted for under the equity method of accounting, or those that result in consolidation of the investee) to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income? Requires public business entities to use the exit price notion when measuring the fair value of financial instruments for disclosure purposes? Requires separate presentation of financial assets and financial liabilities by measurement category and form of financial asset (i.e., securities or loans and receivables) ? Eliminates the requirement for public business entities to disclose the method(s) and significant assumptions used to estimate the fair value that is required to be disclosed for financial instruments measured at amortized cost. The amendments in this ASU are effective for public companies for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The new guidance permits early adoption of the own credit provision. In addition, the new guidance permits early adoption of the provision that exempts private companies and not-for-profit organizations from having to disclose fair value information about financial instruments measured at amortized cost. The Company is currently in the process of evaluating the impact of the adoption on its consolidated financial statements.  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, "Leases (Topic 842)". Among other things, in the amendments in ASU 2016-02, lessees will be required to recognize the following for all leases (with the exception of short term leases) at the commencement date: A lease liability, which is a lessee's obligation to make lease payments arising from a lease, measured on a discounted basis? and A right-of-use asset, which is an asset that represents the lessee's right to use, or control the use of, a specified asset for the lease term. Under the new guidance, lessor accounting is largely unchanged. Certain targeted improvements were made to align, where necessary, lessor accounting with the lessee accounting model and Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. The amendments in this ASU are effective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early application is permitted for all public business entities and all nonpublic business entities upon issuance. Lessees (for capital and operating leases) and lessors (for sales type, direct financing, and operating leases) must apply a modified retrospective transition approach for leases existing at, or entered into after, the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements. The modified retrospective approach would not require any transition accounting for leases that expired before the earliest comparative period presented. Lessees and lessors may not apply a full retrospective transition approach. The Company is currently in the process of evaluating the impact of the adoption on its consolidated financial statements.  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-08,"Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net)". The amendments in this ASU are intended to improve the operability and understandability of the implementation guidance on principal versus agent considerations by amending certain existing illustrative examples and adding additional illustrative examples to assist in the application of the guidance. The effective date and transition of these amendments is the same as the effective date and transition of ASU 20140-9, "Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)". Public entities should apply the amendments in ASU 2014-09 for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim reporting periods therein. The Company is currently in the process of evaluating the impact of the adoption on its consolidated financial statements.  In April 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-10, "Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing". The amendments add further guidance on identifying performance obligations and also to improve the operability and understandability of the licensing implementation guidance. The amendments do not change the core principle of the guidance in Topic 606. The effective date and transition requirements for the amendments are the same as the effective date and transition requirements in Topic 606. The Company is currently in the process of evaluating the impact of the adoption on its consolidated financial statements.  In May 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-12, "Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients". The amendments, among other things: (1) clarify the objective of the collectability criterion for applying paragraph 606-10-25-7; (2) permit an entity to exclude amounts collected from customers for all sales (and other similar) taxes from the transaction price; (3) specify that the measurement date for noncash consideration is contract inception; (4) provide a practical expedient that permits an entity to reflect the aggregate effect of all modifications that occur before the beginning of the earliest period presented when identifying the satisfied and unsatisfied performance obligations, determining the transaction price, and allocating the transaction price to the satisfied and unsatisfied performance obligations; (5) clarify that a completed contract for purposes of transition is a contract for which all (or substantially all) of the revenue was recognized under legacy GAAP before the date of initial application, and (6) clarify that an entity that retrospectively applies the guidance in Topic 606 to each prior reporting period is not required to disclose the effect of the accounting change for the period of adoption. The effective date of these amendments is at the same date that Topic 606 is effective. The Company is currently in the process of evaluating the impact of the adoption on its consolidated financial statements.  In June 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-13 (ASU 2016-13) "Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments" which requires the measurement and recognition of expected credit losses for financial assets held at amortized cost. ASU 2016-13 replaces the existing incurred loss impairment model with an expected loss methodology, which will result in more timely recognition of credit losses. ASU 2016-13 is effective for annual reporting periods, and interim periods within those years beginning after December 15, 2019. The Company is currently in the process of evaluating the impact of the adoption on its consolidated financial statements.  In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15, Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments, which is intended to reduce diversity in practice in how certain cash receipts and payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows. The standard provides guidance in a number of situations including, among others, settlement of zero-coupon bonds, contingent consideration payments made after a business combination, proceeds from the settlement of insurance claims, and distributions received from equity method investees. The ASU also provides guidance for classifying cash receipts and payments that have aspects of more than one class of cash flows. The Company is currently in the process of evaluating the impact of the adoption on its consolidated financial statements.  Results of Operations  We focus on the implementation of our strategic plan to complete our new fertilizer production facilities. Those 2 new facilities were designed with 50,000 metric tons and 100,000 metric tons of fertilizer production capacities. With completion of the 2 new factories, we would be able to expand our market shares in Jiangsu, Zhejiang and Shandong Province, PRC. One of our 2 new fertilizer factories located in Weihai City, Shandong Province was completed in May 2015 and put in operations in August 2015. However, due to a lack of funding, we have put on hold of our another new factory construction which was located in Shanghai with a design annual production capacity of 100,000 metric tons of fertilizer products and will continue to do so until additional funding is secured. As of the date of this report, we had invested approximately $6.6 million or RMB 40 million in the Shanghai new factory construction. To complete the Shanghai new factory construction, we may need additional $4.4 million or RMB 27.7 million to install equipment.  For the Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 For Three Months Ended September 30, Amount 2016 2015 Net Change % Revenues $ 527,715 $ 746,618 $ (218,903 ) -29 % Cost of goods sold 338,126 376,558 (38,432 ) -10 % Gross profit 189,589 370,060 (180,471 ) -49 % Gross margin percentage 36 % 50 % Selling, G&A expenses 373,822 384,505 (10,683 ) -3 % Loss from operations (184,233 ) (14,445 ) (68,808 ) 1,175 % Interest expense (139,350 ) (582,737 ) 443,387 -76 % Government subsidy income 83,549 168,174 (84,625 ) -50 % Loss from disposal of fixed asset (5,234 ) (490,423 ) 485,189 -99 % Gain on recovery of receivables written-off 218,616 - 218,616 100 % Gain on sale of equipment 32,875 - 32,875 100 % Other expense, net (589,443 ) (164,234 ) (425,209 ) 259 % Net other expense (398,987 ) (1,069,220 ) (670,233 ) -63 % Loss before income taxes (583,220 ) (1,083,665 ) 500,445 -46 % Income taxes - - - N/A Net loss $ (583,220 ) $ (1,083,665 ) $ 500,445 -46 %  Revenue. Total revenue decreased from $746,618 for the three months ended September 30, 2015 to $527,715 for the same period in 2016, which represented a decrease of $218,903, or approximately 29%. Considering our old fertilizer plant located in Shanghai was not cost effective and our new Weihai plant was in operations since August 2015 which was designed with modern equipment and better production capacity, therefore, we put more marketing efforts in Shandong Province where our new Weihai plant locates to leverage our sale forces.  Cost of sales. Cost of sales decreased from $376,558 for the three months ended September 30, 2015 to $338,126 for the three months ended September 30, 2016, which represented a decrease of approximately $38,432, or 10%.  Gross Profit (loss). The gross profit decreased from $370,060 for the three months ended September 30, 2015 to $189,589 for the three months ended September 30, 2016. The gross profit margin was decreased from 50% to 36% during the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. Our fertilizer products were facing strong competition from our competitors with lower selling prices. We reduced the prices for some products to re-position our products in the market which was the main reason for the lower gross margin for the three months ended September 30, 2016.  Expenses. We incurred $75,481 in selling expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $40,779 for the three months ended September 30, 2015. We incurred $298,341 in general and administrative expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $343,726 for the three months ended . . .

	FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS



	 


	This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains
	“forward-looking statements”. Forward-looking statements discuss matters that are not historical facts. Because they
	discuss future events or conditions, forward-looking statements may include words such as “anticipate,” “believe,”
	“estimate,” “intend,” “could,” “should,” “would,” “may,”
	“seek,” “plan,” “might,” “will,” “expect,” “anticipate,”
	“predict,” “project,” “forecast,” “potential,” “continue” negatives
	thereof or similar expressions. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, are based on various underlying
	assumptions and current expectations about the future and are not guarantees. Such statements involve known and unknown risks,
	uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual results, level of activity, performance or achievement to be materially
	different from the results of operations or plans expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements.


	 


	We cannot predict all of the risks and
	uncertainties. Accordingly, such information should not be regarded as representations that the results or conditions described
	in such statements or that our objectives and plans will be achieved and we do not assume any responsibility for the accuracy or
	completeness of any of these forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are found at various places throughout
	this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and include information concerning possible or assumed future results of our operations, including
	statements about potential acquisition or merger targets; business strategies; future cash flows; financing plans; plans and objectives
	of management; any other statements regarding future acquisitions, future cash needs, future operations, business plans and future
	financial results, and any other statements that are not historical facts.


	 


	These forward-looking statements represent
	our intentions, plans, expectations, assumptions and beliefs about future events and are subject to risks, uncertainties and other
	factors. Many of those factors are outside of our control and could cause actual results to differ materially from the results
	expressed or implied by those forward-looking statements. In light of these risks, uncertainties and assumptions, the events described
	in the forward-looking statements might not occur or might occur to a different extent or at a different time than we have described.
	You are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of the Quarterly
	Report on Form 10-Q. All subsequent written and oral forward-looking statements concerning other matters addressed in this Quarterly
	Report on Form 10-Q and attributable to us or any person acting on our behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by the
	cautionary statements contained or referred to in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.


	 


	Except to the extent required by law, we
	undertake no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events,
	a change in events, conditions, circumstances or assumptions underlying such statements, or otherwise.

	Mullan Agritech Inc.




	(A Development Stage Company)






	Note to Consolidated Financial Statements




	September 30, 2014 and 2013




	(Unaudited)




	 




	Note 1 – Organization, Business
	and Operations



	 


	The consolidated financial statements include
	the financial statements of Mullan Agritech Inc. (a/k/a China ThermaTech, Inc.) (“Mullan”) and its subsidiaries. Mullan
	and its consolidated subsidiaries are collectively referred to herein as the “Company”, “we” and “us”.


	 


	Mullan was incorporated in the British
	Virgin Island on January 31, 2011 as a limited liability company (a BVI company). It’s wholly owned subsidiary, Advanced
	Environmental Products Limited (“Advanced Environment”) was incorporated in Hong Kong on March 31, 2011 as a limited
	liability company.


	 


	The Company was formed to engage in any
	lawful corporate undertaking, including, but not limited to, selected mergers and acquisitions. It has been in the developmental
	stage since inception and has no operations to date. It will attempt to locate and negotiate with a business entity for the combination
	of that target company with us. The combination will normally take the form of a merger, stock- for-stock exchange or stock-for-assets
	exchange. In most instances, the target company will wish to structure the business combination to be within the definition of
	a tax-free reorganization under Section 351 or Section 368 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. No assurances can
	be given that it will be successful in locating or negotiating with any target company.


	 


	Activities during the development stage
	include developing the business plan and raising capital.


	 


	On August 9, 2013, we change our corporate
	from name China ThermaTech, Inc. to Mullan Agritech, Inc.


	 



	Note 2 – Development Stage Company



	 


	The Company has not generated significant
	revenues to date; accordingly, the Company is considered a development stage enterprise as defined in Financial Accounting Standards
	Board No. 7, "Accounting and Reporting for Development Stage Companies." The Company is subject to a number of risks
	similar to those of other companies in an early stage of development.


	 



	Note 3 – Summary of Significant
	Accounting Policies



	 



	Basis of Presentation



	 


	Management acknowledges its responsibility
	for the preparation of the accompanying consolidated financial statements which reflect all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring
	adjustments, considered necessary in its opinion for a fair statement of its financial position and the results of its operations
	for the years presented. The accompanying financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally
	accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”). This basis differs from that used in the statutory accounts
	in Hong Kong, which are prepared in accordance with the accounting principles and relevant financial regulations applicable to
	enterprises in Hong Kong. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. All necessary
	adjustments have been made to present the consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP.  The Company’s
	functional currency is United States Dollars (“USD”). All significant inter-company transactions and balances have
	been eliminated. The financial statements include all adjustments that, in the opinion of management, are necessary to make the
	financial statements not misleading.


	 



	Interim Financial Statements



	 


	The accompanying consolidated financial
	statements as of September 30, 2014 and for nine months ended September 30, 2014 and 2013 are unaudited. In the opinion of management,
	all necessary adjustments (which include only normal recurring adjustments) have been made to present fairly the financial position,
	results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented. Certain information and footnote disclosure normally included in
	financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America have
	been condensed or omitted. However, The Company believes that the disclosures are adequate to make the information presented not
	misleading. These consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and
	notes thereto included in the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012 financial statements. The results of operations for the nine
	month period ended September 30, 2014 and 2013 are not necessarily indicative of the operating results to be expected for the full
	year ended December 31, 2014, or that have been achieved in the year ended December 31, 2013.

	Use of Estimates



	 


	In preparing financial statements in conformity
	with generally accepted accounting principles, management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
	amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements
	and revenues and expenses during the reported period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.


	 



	Foreign Currency Translation



	 


	The Company’s wholly owned subsidiary,
	Advanced Environment, is incorporated in Hong Kong. The financial position and results of operations of the subsidiary are determined
	using the local currency (“Hong Kong Dollar” or “HKD”) as the functional currency.


	 


	Translation from HKD into United States
	dollars (“USD” or “$”) for reporting purposes is performed by translating the results of operations denominated
	in foreign currency at the weighted average rates of exchange during the reporting periods. Assets and liabilities denominated
	in foreign currencies at the balance sheet dates are translated at the market rate of exchange in effect at that date. The registered
	equity capital denominated in the functional currency is translated at the historical rate of exchange at the time of capital contribution.
	All translation adjustments resulting from the translation of the financial statements into USD are reported as a component of
	accumulated other comprehensive income in shareholders’ equity.

	For the nine months ended September 30,
	2014 and 2013, foreign currency translation adjustments of $0, respectively, have been reported as comprehensive income in the
	consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income.


	 



	Cash



	 


	The Company considers all highly liquid
	temporary cash investments with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. At September 30, 2014 and
	December 31, 2013, the Company had cash of $607, respectively.



	 




	Basic and Diluted Loss per Share



	 


	The Company reports loss per share in accordance
	with FASB ASC 260 “Earnings per share”. The Company’s basic earnings per share are computed using the weighted
	average number of shares outstanding for the periods presented. Diluted earnings per share are computed based on the assumption
	that any dilutive options or warrants were converted or exercised. Dilution is computed by applying the treasury stock method.  Under
	this method, the Company’s outstanding stock warrants are assumed to be exercised, and funds thus obtained were assumed to
	be used to purchase common stock at the average market price during the period. For the nine months ended September 30, 2014 and
	2013, no dilutive instruments outstanding. However, if present, a separate computation of diluted loss per share would not have
	been presented, as these common stock equivalents would have been anti-dilutive due to the Company's net loss.


	 



	Fair Value of Financial Instruments



	 


	Effective January 1, 2008, the Company
	adopted ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosure (“ASC 820”) for assets and liabilities measured at fair value
	on a recurring basis. ASC 820 establishes a common definition for fair value to be applied to existing generally accepted accounting
	principles that require the use of fair value measurements, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosure
	about such fair value measurements. The adoption of ASC 820 did not have an impact on the Company’s financial position or
	operating results, but did expand certain disclosures.


	 


	ASC 820 defines fair value as the price
	that would be received upon sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants
	at the measurement date. Additionally, ASC 820 requires the use of valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs
	and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. These inputs are prioritized below:


	 


	Level 1: Observable inputs such
	as quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities


	Level 2: Observable market-based
	inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data


	Level 3: Unobservable inputs
	for which there is little or no market data, which require the use of the reporting entity’s own assumptions.


	 









	7










	 






	 


	The Company did not identify any assets
	and liabilities that are required to be presented on the condensed consolidated balance sheets at fair value in accordance with
	the relevant accounting standards.


	 


	The carrying values of accounts payables
	and debts approximate their fair values due to the short maturities of these instruments.


	 



	Related Party



	 


	Parties are considered to be related to
	the Company if the parties, directly or indirectly, through one or more intermediaries, control, are controlled by, or are under
	common control with the Company. Related parties also include principal owners of the Company, its management, members of the immediate
	families of principal owners of the Company and its management, and other parties with which the Company may deal if one party
	controls or can significantly influence the management or operating policies of the other to an extent that one of the transacting
	parties might be prevented from fully pursuing its own separate interests. The Company discloses all related party transactions.
	All transactions shall be recorded at fair value of the goods or services exchanged. Property purchased from a related party is
	recorded at the cost to the related party and any payment to or on behalf of the related party in excess of the cost is reflected
	as a distribution to the related party.


	 



	Note 4 – Loan from Related Party



	 


	As of September 30, 2014 and December 31,
	2013, the Company had a loan payable of $34,483 and $18,531 to Mr. Lirong Wang, sole shareholder of the Company. This loan does
	not have interest burden and is due on demand.


	 



	Note 5 – Stockholders’ Deficiency



	 



	Stock Issued for Services



	 


	On January 31, 2011, the Company issued
	200,000 shares of common stock to its founders having a fair value of $200 ($0.001/share) for capital contribution.


	 


	On August 13, 2013, Mr. Hayden Zou, the
	Company’s prior sole shareholder sold all of his shares of the Company to Mr. Lirong Wang for a total of $200. Concurrent
	with the change in control, Mr. Haiping Ma resigned from the position of President of the Company and Mr. Hayden Zou resigned from
	the position of a direction of the Company. Mr. Lirong Wang was appointed as a director and President of the Company.


	 



	Note 6 – Going Concern



	 


	As reflected in the accompanying condensed
	unaudited financial statements, the Company is in the development stage with limited operations. The Company has a net loss of
	$37,080 from inception and a working capital deficit and stockholders’ deficiency of $36,876 at September 30, 2014 and used
	$34,080 cash in operations from inception. This raises substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. The
	ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent on the Company’s ability to raise additional capital and
	implement its business plan. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if the Company is
	unable to continue as a going concern. Management intends to provide the Company with additional loans as needed and is seeking
	a merger target to implement its strategic plans. Management feels these actions provide the opportunity for the Company to continue
	as a going concern.

	Item 2. Management’s
	Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.



	 



	The following discussion of our financial
	condition and results of the operation should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and the related notes thereto
	included elsewhere in this Quarterly report and in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2013.




	 




	This discussion should not be construed
	to imply that the results discussed herein will necessarily continue into the future, or that any conclusion reached herein will
	necessarily be indicative of actual operating results in the future. Such discussion represents only the best present assessment
	of our management.



	 



	Overview



	 


	The Company was organized as a vehicle
	to investigate and, if such investigation warrants, acquire a target company or business seeking the perceived advantages of being
	a reporting corporation. A private company, by merging with us, will become a reporting company as soon as the merger is consummated.
	In contrast, a private company, by filing its own registration statement on Form 10, will not typically become reporting until
	60 days after the filing of the registration statement on Form 10. In our experience, private companies who are interested in becoming
	a public company often perceive a vehicle that allows them to become public without waiting time valuable to them. Our principal
	business objective for the next twelve months and beyond such time will be to achieve long-term growth potential through a combination
	with a business rather than immediate, short-term earnings. The Company will not restrict our potential candidate target companies
	to any specific business, industry or geographical location and, thus, may acquire any type of business.


	 

	 

	 


	The Company currently does not engage in
	any business activities that provide cash flow. During the next twelve months we anticipate incurring costs related to:


	 




	 



	(i)




	filing Exchange Act reports, and





	 


	 


	 




	 



	(ii)




	investigating, analyzing and consummating an acquisition.





	 


	We believe that we will be able to meet
	these costs through funds, as necessary, to be loaned to or invested in us by Mr. Lirong Wang, our sole stockholder and management.
	Pursuant to a verbal agreement with Mr. Lirong Wang in August 2013, he will fund the Company’s operations, including but
	not limited to the investigating and analyzing business combinations and the filing of the Exchange Act reports, until such time
	as we undertake a change of control or a reverse merger whereby Mr. Wang will no longer be the controlling shareholder of the Company.
	At this time we do not have the funds to pay for these filings and do not have any written agreement to raise funds to cover these
	expenses.


	 


	As of the date of the period covered by
	this report, the Company has nominal assets. There are no assurances that the Company will be able to secure any additional funding
	as needed. Currently, however, our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon our ability to generate future profitable
	operations and/or to obtain the necessary financing to meet our obligations and repay our liabilities arising from normal business
	operations when they come due. Our ability to continue as a going concern is also dependent on our ability to find a suitable target
	company and enter into a possible reverse merger with such company. Management’s plan includes obtaining additional funds
	by equity financing through a reverse merger transaction and/or related party advances, however there is no assurance of additional
	funding being available.


	 


	The Company may consider acquiring a business
	which has recently commenced operations, is a developing company in need of additional funds for expansion into new products or
	markets, is seeking to develop a new product or service, or is an established business which may be experiencing financial or operating
	difficulties and is in need of additional capital. In the alternative, a business combination may involve the acquisition of, or
	merger with, a company which does not need substantial additional capital but which desires to establish a public trading market
	for its shares while avoiding, among other things, the time delays, significant expense, and loss of voting control which may occur
	in a public offering.


	 


	Any target business that is selected may
	be a financially unstable company or an entity in its early stages of development or growth, including entities without established
	records of sales or earnings. In that event, we will be subject to numerous risks inherent in the business and operations of financially
	unstable and early stage or potential emerging growth companies. In addition, we may effect a business combination with an entity
	in an industry characterized by a high level of risk, and, although our management will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent
	in a particular target business, there can be no assurance that we will properly ascertain or assess all significant risks. Our
	management anticipates that it will likely be able to effect only one business combination, due primarily to our limited financing
	and the dilution of interest for present and prospective stockholders, which is likely to occur as a result of our management’s
	plan to offer a controlling interest to a target business in order to achieve a tax-free reorganization. This lack of diversification
	should be considered a substantial risk in investing in us, because it will not permit us to offset potential losses from one venture
	against gains from another.


	 









	9










	 






	 


	The Company anticipates that the selection
	of a business combination will be complex and extremely risky. Through information obtained from industry publications and professionals,
	our management believes that there are numerous firms seeking the perceived benefits of becoming a publicly traded corporation.
	Such perceived benefits of becoming a publicly traded corporation include, among other things, facilitating or improving the terms
	on which additional equity financing may be obtained, providing liquidity for the principals of and investors in a business, creating
	a means for providing incentive stock options or similar benefits to key employees, and offering greater flexibility in structuring
	acquisitions, joint ventures and the like through the issuance of stock. Potentially available business combinations may occur
	in many different industries and at various stages of development, all of which will make the task of comparative investigation
	and analysis of such business opportunities extremely difficult and complex. We do not currently intend to retain any entity to
	act as a “finder” to identify and analyze the merits of potential target businesses.



	 


	 




	Corporate Actions



	 


	On August 9, 2013, we change our corporate from name China ThermaTech,
	Inc. to Mullan Agritech, Inc.




	 


	 


	On August 13, 2013, we amended and restated
	our memorandum of association and articles of association to, among others, change our capital shares by increasing the authorized
	number of common shares from 80,000,000 to 1,000,000,000, with the same par value $0.001 per share, and creating a class of 1,000,000,000
	preferred shares, par value $0.001 per share.




	 


	 



	Results of Operations



	 




	Three Months Ended September 30,
	2014 Compared to Three Months Ended September 30, 2013




	 


	The Company has not conducted any active
	operations since inception, except for its efforts to locate suitable acquisition candidates. No revenue has been generated by
	the Company from January 31, 2011 (Inception) to September 30, 2014. It is unlikely the Company will have any revenues unless it
	is able to effect an acquisition or merger with an operating company, of which there can be no assurance. It is management's assertion
	that these circumstances may hinder the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. The Company’s plan of operation
	for the next twelve months shall be to continue its efforts to locate suitable acquisition candidates.


	 




	For the three months ended September 30,
	2014, our operating expenses consisted solely of general and administrative expenses of $9,227, resulting in a net loss of $9,227.
	In comparison, for the three months ended September 30, 2013, our operating expenses consisted solely of general and administrative
	expenses of $12,647, resulting in a net loss of $12,647. Our general and administrative expenses are mainly comprised of legal,
	accounting, and other professional service fees incurred in connection the preparation and filing of the Company’s periodic
	reports.


	 




	Nine Months Ended September 30, 2014
	Compared to Nine Months Ended September 30, 2013




	 




	For the nine months ended September 30,
	2014, our operating expenses consisted solely of general and administrative expenses of $13,952, resulting in a net loss of $13,952.
	In comparison, for the nine months ended September 30, 2013, our operating expenses consisted solely of general and administrative
	expenses of $14,319, resulting in a net loss of $14,319. Our general and administrative expenses are mainly comprised of legal,
	accounting, and other professional service fees incurred in connection the preparation and filing of the Company’s periodic
	reports.


	 



	Liquidity and Capital Resources



	 


	As of September 30, 2014, we had cash of
	$607 as compared to cash of $607 as of December 31, 2013.


	 


	Net cash used in operating activities totaled
	$15,952 for the nine months ended September 30, 2014. Net cash used in operating activities totaled $34,080 for the period from
	January 31, 2011 (Inception) to September 30, 2014.


	 


	Net cash provided by financing activities
	totaled $34,683 for the period from January 31, 2011 (Inception) to September 30, 2014.


	 


	As reflected in the accompanying condensed
	unaudited financial statements, the Company is in the development stage with limited operations. The Company has a net loss of
	$37,080 from inception and a working capital deficit and stockholders’ deficiency of $36,876 at September 30, 2014 and used
	$34,080 cash in operations from inception. This raises substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. The
	ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent on the Company’s ability to raise additional capital and
	implement its business plan. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if the Company is
	unable to continue as a going concern.


	 









	10










	 






	 


	Management intends to provide the Company
	with additional loans as needed and is seeking a merger target to implement its strategic plans. Management believes that actions
	presently being taken to obtain additional funding and implement its strategic plans provide the opportunity for the Company to
	continue as a going concern.


	 



	Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements



	 


	The Company does not have any off-balance
	sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on the Company’s financial condition,
	changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources
	that is material to investors.

	Item 4. Controls and Procedures.



	 



	Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures



	 


	We maintain disclosure controls and procedures
	that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed pursuant to the Exchange Act is recorded,
	processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules, regulations and related forms, and
	that such information is accumulated and communicated to our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate,
	to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.


	 


	As of September 30, 2014, we carried out
	an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our principal executive officer and our principal financial
	officer of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures. Based on this evaluation, our
	principal executive officer and our principal financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were ineffective
	as of the end of the period covered by this report for the material weakness described below.


	 


	During management’s evaluation of
	our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2014, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer
	concluded that we have the following material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2014:


	 





	•




	The Company does not have sufficient number of personnel to provide segregation within the functions consistent with the objectives of internal control.





	 


	Based on their evaluation, our principal
	executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures at September 30, 2014
	were not effective.


	 


	Management intends to remediate the material weakness as soon as practicable after the Company’s
	financial position permits.


	 



	Changes in Internal Controls



	 


	There were no changes in our internal controls
	over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2014 that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to
	materially affect our internal controls.
