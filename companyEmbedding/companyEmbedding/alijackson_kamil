About Peer Rating
Martindale-Hubbell® Peer Review Ratings™ are the gold standard in attorney ratings, and have been for more than a century. These ratings indicate attorneys who are widely respected by their peers for their ethical standards and legal expertise in a specific area of practice.


The Martindale-Hubbell Peer Review Ratings process is the gold standard due to its objectivity and comprehensiveness. Lawyers solicited for peer reviews include both those selected by the attorney being reviewed and lawyers independently selected by Martindale-Hubbell. All reviewers are verified as attorneys through Martindale-Hubbell's extensive attorney database. Only attorneys practicing at least three years and receiving a sufficient number of reviews from non-affiliated attorneys are eligible to receive a Rating.
What are the different Martindale-Hubbell Peer Review Ratings?
AV Preeminent®: The highest peer rating standard. This rating signifies that a large number of the lawyer's peers rank him or her at the highest level of professional excellence for their legal knowledge, communication skills and ethical standards.
Distinguished: An excellent rating for a lawyer with some experience. This rating indicates the attorney is widely respected by their peers for high professional achievement and ethical standards.
Notable: This rating indicates that the lawyer has been recognized by a large number of their peers for strong ethical standards.
Lawyers who have received peer reviews after 2009 will display more detailed information, including practice areas, summary ratings, detailed numeric ratings and written feedback (if available). Details for individual reviews received before 2009 are not displayed.
Attorneys that receive reviews from their peers, but not a sufficient number to establish a Martindale-Hubbell Peer Review Rating, will have those reviews display on our websites.
For more information on Martindale-Hubbell Peer Review Ratings™, please visit our Ratings Page on Martindale.com and our Frequently Asked Questions
Close ×




About Client Rating
The Martindale-Hubbell® Client Review Ratings™ display reviews submitted by clients of lawyers and law firms.


The Client Review Rating score is determined through aggregation of validated responses. People who submit reviews are clients of law firms who hired a lawyer within the last year, whose matter is not pending and who want to share their experience of that lawyer or law firm with other potential clients. Reviewers can be anyone who hires a lawyer including in-house counsel, corporate executives, small business owners and private individuals.
Martindale-Hubbell validates that the reviewer is a person with a valid email address. As part of the review process, respondents must affirm that they have been a client of the lawyer or law firm identified within the past year, although Martindale-Hubbell cannot confirm the lawyer/client relationship as it is often confidential. The content of the responses are entirely from client reviewers.
Prior results do not guarantee a similar outcome and Martindale-Hubbell accepts no responsibility for the content or accuracy of any review.

Age: 52.
Education: Princeton University, AB in politics (1981); Harvard Law School, JD (1984).




 


Career history: Yaupon Therapeutics Inc., present; Iroko Pharmaceuticals, legal consultant (2010-2011); Ception Therapeutics Inc., general counsel and corporate secretary (2006–2010).
Family: Married to Michael Stephen Jackson with son Ross (deceased); daughter Kendall, 19; daughter Karis (15); and daughter Kamryn (12).
Motto to live by: “Nothing beats a failure, but a try” and to paraphrase an Aristotle quote, “Excellence is not an act, but a habit.”
Proudest moment: My daughter’s graduation from high school in June 2011.
How you arrived at your field: I come from a family of three sisters and one brother. Debating is a family sport that we all love to engage in so becoming a lawyer was a natural fit.




Your biggest break: Leaving a big pharmaceutical company to join a small specialty pharmaceutical company.
What motivates you: My own personal standard of excellence, bolstered by my sisters’ high expectations and stellar examples.
Best career advice: Jump!
Greatest inspiration: Ruth Ali — my mother who never got to be what she wanted to be.




 


Biggest challenge: Finding the emotional strength to return to work after my 3-year-old son died in 1994. I was in a terrible car accident in 1994 with both of my children; my son was 3 and my daughter was less than 2 years old. My daughter and I survived and my son died. I had two more daughters after my son died, in 1996 and 1999. After my son died and every day since, I find the strength to get up every morning by remembering that I need not fear the future, because the worst has happened to me.
Biggest disappointment: I keep discovering and rediscovering, over and over again, that there are successful people in the “work space” of my life who do not want to help others succeed. They have achieved great success, but are not interested in helping others attain their personal best.

How you give back: Every person that I meet and talk with, I try to think how I can use my knowledge, financial resources, legal skills, business or personal contacts to help further their goals, projects, businesses or career.
Little-known fact about you: I wrote a book, which was published, about how to get an internship during my sophomore year in college.
Your first job: Teen representative on the JC Penny Fashion Board in Hampton, Va.
Most fun you ever had: Playing soccer in a parent/kid game for my sixth-grader.
Nominator says: “Kamil creates opportunities for women lawyers by her very presence in the various roles she plays due in part to the high caliber of work and passion she brings to every such role.”
— Tara Elliott, principal, Fish & Richardson
