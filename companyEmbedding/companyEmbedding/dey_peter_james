James Dey


James Dey, son of James Hans Dey  

James Dey 
 was born on July 12, 1706 in Staten Island, New York and died before October 12, 1784 in South Amboy,
  Middlesex County, New York.  He married (1) Dinah Tiller who was born on December 2, 1703 and died before 1760. 
  He was the son of James Hans Dey and Margaret Dey. 
James Dey and Dinah had 9 children:
James J. Dey was born on September 15, 1728 in 
Matchaponix (eastern most X  on the map to the right), 
Middlesex County, New Jersey and died before May 2, 1802 in South Amboy, New Jersey.  
He married Margaret Perrine on January 17, 1749/50 in Shrewsbury, Monmouth County, 
New Jersey, (southern X on the map below), some 
12 miles south of Matchaponix.  She was born on June 20, 1733 in Matchaponix, Middlesex County, 
New Jersey and she died after 1806.They had 14 children.

Dinah Dey was born on October 25, 1730 in Monroe, Middlesex, New Jersey and she married William Hillyer on April 21, 1775.
William Dey was born on December17, 1732 and he married Hannah Perrine on July 1, 1756
Mary Dey was born on February 19, 1733/34 and married David Cronk
Peter Dey was born on September 10, 1736 and died before November 21, 1782,  He married Sarah ____
Sarah Dey was born on September 20, 1739 in Union Valley, Middlesex, New Jersey and she married Amijah Merrill.
John Dey was born on December 28, 1741 in Monmouth County, New Jersey and he died on April 26, 1829 in Middlesex, New Jersey.  He married Mary Baird.  Tracking the descendants of these families is often complicated by the similarity of first names.  This chart illustrates some of the difficulties.  There were two David Baird Deys, each with a mother named Mary Baird.  Thus, the names, without consideration of ages and family relationships, by themselves may lead to a misunderstanding.

Benjamin Dey was born on May 9, 1744 and died before 1782 as he is mentioned as
deceased in his father's will (see below).Tom Robertshaw
provided a hand copied probate extract of the Will of Benjamin Dey





Benjamin Dye, Jan 28, 1794. Middlesex Co. Children: John, James, Mary,
Dinah. Jan. 3, 1795, Middlesex Co. Wards, children of Benjamin Dye, of said
county, deceased, make choice of John Dey as gaurdian.

He married Margaret Mount Herbert Rue on  November 25, 1760.  She was married (1)
to James Herbert of New Brunswick.  His will is dated March 1, 1745/6 in which he names his
sons Richard, Daniel and James and his wife Margaret as one of the

As with all your investments through Fidelity, you must make your own determination whether an investment is appropriate for you.  Fidelity is not recommending or endorsing this security by making it available to customers.  You should conduct research and perform a thorough investigation as to the characteristics of any securities you intend to purchase.  Before investing, you should read the prospectus, offering circular, indenture, or similar document carefully for a full description of the product, including its features and risks, to determine whether it is an appropriate investment for your investment objectives, risk tolerance, financial situation and other individual factors, and be sure to re-evaluate those factors on a periodic basis.Performance data shown represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results. Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance data quoted.  Yield and return will vary, therefore, you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares.Stock markets are volatile and can decline significantly in response to adverse issuer, political, regulatory, market, or economic developments.  Growth stocks can be more volatile than other types of stocks.  Value stocks can continue to be undervalued by the market for long periods of time.  Foreign securities are subject to interest-rate, currency-exchange-rate, economic, and political risks, all of which are magnified in emerging markets.  Illiquidity is an inherent risk associated with investing in real estate and REITs.

Closed-end funds can trade at a discount to their NAV.  Shareholders of Master Limited Partnerships may be treated as partners for tax purposes.  Partnerships issue a Schedule K-1 (Form 1065) rather than a Form 1099 form for tax purposes. It lists the partner's share of income, deductions, credits, etc.  Speak with your tax advisor to determine how this may affect you.

Investing Insights



Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/28/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.
