UK Released DVD/Blu-Ray item. It MAY NOT play on regular US DVD/Blu-Ray player. You may need a multi-region US DVD/Blu-Ray player to play this item. Filmed as a classical tragedy, Orson Welles' Othello is a tale of passion, jealousy and murder. Welles used his earnings from several performances (including Carol Reed's classic The Third Man) to finance the production, which was shot over several years across multiple locations including Italy and Morocco. The footage was well matched photographically, resulting in an artistically brave compression of a great play. In the title role, Welles shows us a man who has fought many wars but still maintains a princely disposition. As Desdemona, Suzanne Cloutier is guileless but strong enough to have wanted and pursued the Moor. She alone is accused of pretending to be what she is not, and her openness makes her suspect in a world where few appear to be as they are. In a rare filmed role, MicheÃ¡l MacLiammÃ³r excels as the diabolical Iago, a master of manipulating appearances and devoid of any motive save pure evil. MacLiammÃ³r shows how a hint can be greater than a howl, executing a series of deceptions (whose victims include Roderigo, Brabantio, and Cassio) that culminate in the symbolic destruction of Desdemona. The financial constraints appear to have ignited an even higher level of creativity within Welles, who never takes the expected angle and directs the film with a vertiginous, exhibitionist energy. Though Roderigo's death scene was filmed in a Moroccan steam bath because the costumes had not arrived, it is refreshing to see a Shakespeare film in which the cast doesn't look like it's on its way to a Beverly Hills costume party with an Elizabethan theme. The allegorical journey between heaven and hell concludes with the exposure of both Iago's scheme and the tragedy of Othello, who ultimately could not believe in the purity of his wife. This Othello won the prestigious

Bairdon October 17, 2014Format: DVDSeven Reasons to Watch this Movie1. The Opening 4 ½ MinutesThe film opens with a view of a man laid out for a funeral, shown from just above his head. He’s lifted and carried by hooded monks. We see two other caskets, each with woman’s body, draped in black lace.Religious imagery is everywhere: crosses, a bishop in cope and miter, men making the sign of the cross. People’s clothes appear medieval. The bodies are carried through a crowd, in a castle courtyard, apparently to be taken aboard a ship. A man, under custody of armed guards, is pushed and shoved in the opposite direction. He’s locked into a square iron cage which is suspended from a chain and winched upward, suspended next to the castle wall. Throughout there is eerie music and unintelligible chanting.The scene concludes with a title card and a brief spoken introduction, then we’re taken to Venice, and the story begins.2. Welles the DirectorEverything we expect from an Orson Welles-directed movie is in that first scene: Unusual camera placements and close ups Quick cuts from one face to another A moving camera that follows the actors through doors and into rooms Crowd scenes with lots of people Sharp black & white cinematography Time-shifting, from now to then and back3. The CastWelles assembled a British Isles cast (English and Irish) along with one Canadian and one American. Mostnotable, other than Welles himself, are Michael MacLiammoir as Iago and Robert Coote (ColonelPickering in My Fair Lady) as Roderigo. Detroit native Doris Dowling (from Lost Weekend)plays Bianca, and she’s a hoot. Fay Compton, a BBC-TV veteran, is appropriately in-your-face as Iago’s wife Emilia.Plus, Did anyone ever have a more perfect movie voice than Orson Wells? With him in the lead, along with his veteran British cast, Shakespeare’s words sound marvelous.4. DesdemonaCanadian actress Suzanne Cloutier is just perfect in this role. Though not in her late teens, Desdemona’s age in the play, she projects, flawlessly, strong-willed innocence and devotion to her husband. Also, the camera really likes her. A lot.5. Welles the ActorFilming began in 1948, so we see the Big Guy at his best, powerful and larger-than-life. His makeup is convincing, as is his physical presence: He looks and moves like a soldier.6. The LocalesMorocco, Venice, Tuscany, Rome. The scenery, especially the Moroccan seaside castle, is like an additional character in the drama.7. It’s on YouTube.It clocks in at just 91 minutes. Search “Welles Othello” to find it.Reviewer’s Note: Welles assumes that his audience already knows the basic story and characters of Othello, so don’t expect any on-screen help (like “Venice, 1604” or “Cyprus, After the Storm”).Read more0Comment|

  Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuse5.0 out of 5 stars"One that loved not wisely but too well"ByAnnie Van AukenTOP 500 REVIEWERVINE VOICEon February 6, 2012Format: DVDOrson Welles worked on and off for four years to complete his remarkable adaptation of OTHELLO, which was filmed in Morocco and Italy. When cash was short, Orson would take acting jobs ("The Third Man," for one) in order to fund his pet project.Winner of the Palm d'Or at Cannes in 1952, THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO: THE MOOR OF VENICE was released in America three years later and was briefly shown in only two cities. The movie literally disappeared after that-- the negative assumed lost somewhere in France. Forty years later, Orson's daughter searched and eventually located this one and only silver nitrate master in New Jersey, of all places.In pristine condition visually, restoration was only needed for the audio track. The Chicago Symphony re-recorded note-for-note the original score and this new track was "flown in." The results, picture and sound-wise are superb! Pictorially, OTHELLO is by far Orson's best work-- its beautifully moody scenery, imaginative edits, angles and lighting make for a movie that visually rivals the greatest works of the silent era, and in fact would stand up well in that genre.As for the tragedy of the jealous Moor-- those unfamiliar with Renaissance-era English may at times wonder if the actors are speaking a foreign language! Yet, because of strong visuals the storyline isn't hampered by this. Welles's OTHELLO is the epitome of great film making. Along with Anthony Hopkins in TITUS (1999), it's by far my favorite screen version of Shakespeare. (CAMEOS: Joseph Cotten as a senator and Joan Fontaine as a page.).Parenthetical number preceding title is a 1 to 10 IMDb viewer poll rating.(7.8) The Tragedy of Othello: The Moor of Venice (USA/France/Italy/Morocco-1952) - Orson Welles/Micheál MacLiammóir/Robert Coote/Suzanne Cloutier/Hilton Edwards/Nicholas Bruce/Michael Laurence/Fay Compton/Doris Dowling (uncredited: Joseph Cotten, Joan Fontaine)Read more0Comment|

I purchased the Criterion Collection  box set. As a Wells fan, I thought this was the best option because it came with both versions of the film plus an unexpected bonus feature of the novel by Wells. I should have read the product description better. I wasn't disappointed with my purchase. It exceeded my high expectations.After watching both versions of the film, I ended up liking the longer one better of the two.The Criterion Collection version would make an excellent gift for someone who truly enjoys classic American cinema.Read more0Comment|

Three episodes of an Orson Welles radio show are also included, and they show how parts of Arkadin's script were lifted word-for-word from the shows.  As for the movie itself, I was unimpressed.Read more0Comment|

  Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuse5.0 out of 5 starsFour Reasons for Five StarsByDorothy Mullenon October 25, 2009Format: DVD|Verified PurchaseFirst, I would like to express my appreciation for the review by Felix Felicis (Apr. 20 2006) which I thought was extremely helpful and interesting and wise.  The reason I am adding my own review is to emphasize the wondrous acting interludes in this movie.  Mr. Welles, of course, is always hypnotic, I can never take my eyes off him in any movie in which he appears (or waddles).  The two American leads, Robert Arden and Patricia Medina, are of course hilariously bad, as has been mentioned ad infinitum ad nauseam.  Imagine Robert Mitchum and Marilyn Monroe (or Jayne Mansfield, or maybe Brigitte Bardot), and as Raina, think of Natalie Wood.  Oh well.  Never mind them.  The four reasons Mr. Arkadin is marvelous are:1.  Akim Tamiroff in his sad, pathetic, enormously brave and heartbreaking portrayal of the indignities of old age and poverty.  At one point he pleads to be allowed to put on his trousers (to cover up his soiled underwear?).  I have a feeling that was an improvised line.2.  Mischa Auer and the flea circus.  It is not just the human actor but the insect performers who made my jaw drop as I stared obsessively at the screen in this unbelievable gothic and unforgettable cameo.3.  Michael Redgrave.  I have seen Michael Redgrave in many British films of the 1940's, but I did not recognize him as the weird Hitchcockian antiques dealer.  THAT WAS MICHAEL REDGRAVE??? I thought reading the credits.  I can watch this scene over and over again and never get tired of it.4.  Last -- the most incredible and most marvelous Katina Paxinou.  If the movie contained nothing else but Katina Paxinou as Sophia, it would rate five stars.  Six stars.  Maybe ten stars.Of course there are other things in Mr. Arkadin.  The penitentes.  The masquerade ball.  The German street (reminiscent of The Third Man's Vienna).  The tale of the scorpion and the frog.  (Which one is Arkadin?  Maybe he's both.  Maybe he's Aristotle Onassis.  Who cares.  Watch the movie.)Read more0Comment|

  Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuse3.0 out of 5 starsConfidentially, Doc.....ByAnnie Van AukenTOP 1000 REVIEWERVINE VOICEon May 10, 2008Format: DVD|Verified PurchaseMR. ARKADIN (aka "Confidential Report") is now advertised as a forgotten Orson Welles classic. In all probability this movie in first run was rightly dismissed as a mediocrity. The script is by turn confused and transparently predictable. Welles as the main character mugs for a tilted camera to the point of annoyance and his direction is heavy handed: the overuse of skewed horizons, bizarre camera angles, cluttered sets and jarring edits do nothing but distract the viewer. Peripheral eccentrics pass through the story as rapidly as the blurry panning used in one scene.(*Plot spoilers follow*)The wealthy Mr. A. (estimated worth: 100 million dollars) feigns amnesia and sends a would-be blackmailer (Guy Van Stratten) on a worldwide search for answers to his "mysterious" past-- the true motive is to prevent his daughter (Raina) from learning that her father was once a lowlife gangster. Arkadin secretly tails his hired investigator and disposes of old acquaintances as each is discovered. (Note that none of these killings is ever shown.) Once the last link to his past is destroyed, Arkadin intends to either frame Van Stratten for the several murders or kill him. Realizing this, the frightened man flees to Spain and the arms of waiting Raina, where he believes he will be safe. Arkadin follows by piloting his small plane in a race to beat Van Stratten to Raina. In a desperate radio conversation with his daughter, Arkadin is misled into believing she knows "everything," so he apparently throws himself from the airplane (again this is implied).MR ARKADIN is -not- of the caliber nor does it resemble in any way CITIZEN KANE or THE THIRD MAN and is in fact one of this great director and actor's weakest efforts. For Welles completists only.Mr. W. receives star billing for his portrayal of a defense attorney in the last part of COMPULSION, a murder story based on the Leopold and Loeb case.Read more0Comment|

  Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuse4.0 out of 5 starsFor Orson enthusiasts only; movie = ***, add an extra for the bonus materialByMatthew Farrellon November 30, 2009Format: DVD|Verified PurchaseI picked this up in my on-going quest to get all things Orson Welles. I've now watched it once, and doubt I'll see it again any time soon. Then again, maybe it'll grow on me?It's no secret this movie has a very checkered history, and Welles himself was highly disappointed with it. There are 3 different edits of this (all included in the collection) so armchair scholars can doubtless spend time comparing and contrasting them... but to be honest the movie itself is not interesting enough to merit it. The story is so-so, and one of the weakest aspects was Orson himself. He looks terrible in this, with the ridiculous beard and wig, and what I can only hope was an attempt at a Hungarian accent.On the plus side, the film has a few diamonds in its rough, "Orson moments" where his brilliance as a director shine through. Notable are a stunning shadow-lit flashback early on, and a fun little POV scene simulating a drunk person on a boat during a storm. Enough to hold my interest, but not really enough to save this. Likewise, there's a lot of nifty bonus material, though it doesn't have high replay value.Like I said, this may well grow on me in the future, but between now and whenever, I expect it to get a lot of dust on the shelf.Read more0Comment|

Nos. 00-55009, 00-55229, 00-55537 and 00-55538.
    Decided: February 01, 2002

		Before:  B. FLETCHER, T.G. NELSON, and BERZON, Circuit Judges.Anthony Glassman,Glassman, Browning & Saltsman, Beverly Hills, California;  Ronald M. Johnston, Blanc Williams Johnston & Kronstadt, LLP, Los Angeles, California, for the plaintiff-appellant. David J. Noonan, Post Kirby Noonan & Sweat LLP, San Diego, California;  Jay S. Kopelowitz, Kopelowitz & Associates, San Diego, California;  Darren J. Quinn, Law Offices of Darren J. Quinn, San Diego, California, for the defendants-appellees.
Playboy Enterprises, Inc. (PEI), appeals the district court's grant of summary judgment as to its claims of trademark infringement, unfair competition, and breach of contract against Terri Welles;  Terri Welles, Inc.;   Pippi, Inc.;   and Welles' current and former “webmasters,” Steven Huntington and Michael Mihalko.   We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1291, and we affirm in part and reverse in part.In a separate memorandum disposition, we resolve Welles' cross-appeal of the district court's grant of summary judgment as to her counterclaims for defamation, intentional infliction of emotional distress, unfair competition, and interference with prospective economic advantage.   Welles, Huntington and Mihalko also appeal the district court's denial of their requests for attorney's fees.   We resolve that issue in the memorandum disposition as well.I.BackgroundTerri Welles was on the cover of Playboy in 1981 and was chosen to be the Playboy Playmate of the Year for 1981.   Her use of the title “Playboy Playmate of the Year 1981,” and her use of other trademarked terms on her website are at issue in this suit.   During the relevant time period, Welles' website offered information about and free photos of Welles, advertised photos for sale, advertised memberships in her photo club, and promoted her services as a spokesperson.   A biographical section described Welles' selection as Playmate of the Year in 1981 and her years modeling for PEI. After the lawsuit began, Welles included discussions of the suit and criticism of PEI on her website and included a note disclaiming any association with PEI.1 PEI complains of four different uses of its trademarked terms on Welles' website:  (1) the terms “Playboy” and “Playmate” in the metatags of the website; 2  (2) the phrase “Playmate of the Year 1981” on the masthead of the website;  (3) the phrases “Playboy Playmate of the Year 1981” and “Playmate of the Year 1981” on various banner ads, which may be transferred to other websites;  and (4) the repeated use of the abbreviation “PMOY ′81” as the watermark on the pages of the website.3  PEI claimed that these uses of its marks constituted trademark infringement, dilution, false designation of origin, and unfair competition.   The district court granted defendants' motion for summary judgment.   PEI appeals the grant of summary judgment on its infringement and dilution claims.   We affirm in part and reverse in part.The district court also granted summary judgment on PEI's contract claims.   Those claims arose from a contract between PEI and a corporation created by Welles, “Pippi, Inc.” When Welles agreed to be Playmate of the Year in 1981, Pippi, Inc., signed a contract with PEI. The contract contained a term requiring prior written approval from PEI before Welles made any “non-Playboy use of her name with the designation ‘Playmate of the Year.’ ” Pippi, Inc., was dissolved in 1984.   PEI argues that Pippi, Inc., was Welles' alter ego and that the terms of the contract are currently enforceable against Welles.   The district court rejected this argument and granted summary judgment on PEI's contract claims in favor of Welles.   We affirm.II.Standard of Review We review the district court's grant of summary judgment de novo.4  Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, we must determine whether there are any genuine issues of material fact and whether the district court correctly applied the relevant substantive law.5  The court must not weigh the evidence or determine the truth of the matter but only determine whether there is a genuine issue for trial.6 III.DiscussionA. Trademark InfringementExcept for the use of PEI's protected terms in the wallpaper of Welles' website, we conclude that Welles' uses of PEI's trademarks are permissible, nominative uses.   They imply no current sponsorship or endorsement by PEI. Instead, they serve to identify Welles as a past PEI “Playmate of the Year.” 7  We articulated the test for a permissible, nominative use in New Kids On The Block v. New America Publishing, Inc.8 The band, New Kids On The Block, claimed trademark infringement arising from the use of their trademarked name by several newspapers.   The newspapers had conducted polls asking which member of the band New Kids On The Block was the best and most popular.9  The papers' use of the trademarked term did not fall within the traditional fair use doctrine.   Unlike a traditional fair use scenario, the defendant newspaper was using the trademarked term to describe not its own product, but the plaintiff's.10  Thus, the factors used to evaluate fair use were inapplicable.11  The use was nonetheless permissible, we concluded, based on its nominative nature. We adopted the following test for nominative use:First, the product or service in question must be one not readily identifiable without use of the trademark;  second, only so much of the mark or marks may be used as is reasonably necessary to identify the product or service;  and third, the user must do nothing that would, in conjunction with the mark, suggest sponsorship or endorsement by the trademark holder.12We noted in New Kids that a nominative use may also be a commercial one.13  In cases in which the defendant raises a nominative use defense, the above three-factor test should be applied instead of the test for likelihood of confusion set forth in Sleekcraft.14  The three-factor test better evaluates the likelihood of confusion in nominative use cases.   When a defendant uses a trademark nominally, the trademark will be identical to the plaintiff's mark, at least in terms of the words in question.   Thus, application of the Sleekcraft test, which focuses on the similarity of the mark used by the plaintiff and the defendant, would lead to the incorrect conclusion that virtually all nominative uses are confusing.   The three-factor test-with its requirements that the defendant use marks only when no descriptive substitute exists, use no more of the mark than necessary, and do nothing to suggest sponsorship or endorsement by the mark holder-better addresses concerns regarding the likelihood of confusion in nominative use cases.We group the uses of PEI's trademarked terms into three for the purpose of applying the test for nominative use.   First, we analyze Welles' use of the terms in headlines and banner advertisements.   We conclude that those uses are clearly nominative.   Second, we analyze the use of the terms in the metatags for Welles' website, which we conclude are nominative as well.   Finally, we analyze the terms as used in the wall-paper of the website.   We conclude that this use is not nominative and remand for a determination of whether it infringes on a PEI trademark.1. Headlines and banner advertisements. To satisfy the first part of the test for nominative use, “the product or service in question must be one not readily identifiable without use of the trademark[.]” 15  This situation arises “when a trademark also describes a person, a place or an attribute of a product” 16 and there is no descriptive substitute for the trademark.   In such a circumstance, allowing the trademark holder exclusive rights would allow the language to “be depleted in much the same way as if generic words were protectable.” 17  In New Kids, we gave the example of the trademarked term, “Chicago Bulls.”   We explained that “one might refer to the ‘two-time world champions' or ‘the professional basketball team from Chicago,’ but it's far simpler (and more likely to be understood) to refer to the Chicago Bulls.” 18  Moreover, such a use of the trademark would “not imply sponsorship or endorsement of the product because the mark is used only to describe the thing, rather than to identify its source.” 19  Thus, we concluded, such uses must be excepted from trademark infringement law.The district court properly identified Welles' situation as one which must also be excepted.   No descriptive substitute exists for PEI's trademarks in this context.   The court explained:[T]here is no other way that Ms. Welles can identify or describe herself and her services without venturing into absurd descriptive phrases.   To describe herself as the “nude model selected by Mr. Hefner's magazine as its number-one prototypical woman for the year 1981” would be impractical as well as ineffectual in identifying Terri Welles to the public.20We agree.   Just as the newspapers in New Kids could only identify the band clearly by using its trademarked name, so can Welles only identify herself clearly by using PEI's trademarked title.[4] The second part of the nominative use test requires that “only so much of the mark or marks may be used as is reasonably necessary to identify the product or service[.]” 21  New Kids provided the following examples to explain this element:  “[A] soft drink competitor would be entitled to compare its product to Coca-Cola or Coke, but would not be entitled to use Coca-Cola's distinctive lettering.” 22  Similarly, in a past case, an auto shop was allowed to use the trademarked term “Volkswagen” on a sign describing the cars it repaired, in part because the shop “did not use Volkswagen's distinctive lettering style or color scheme, nor did he display the encircled ‘VW’ emblem.” 23  Welles' banner advertisements and headlines satisfy this element because they use only the trademarked words, not the font or symbols associated with the trademarks.The third element requires that the user do “nothing that would, in conjunction with the mark, suggest sponsorship or endorsement by the trademark holder.” 24  As to this element, we conclude that aside from the wallpaper, which we address separately, Welles does nothing in conjunction with her use of the marks to suggest sponsorship or endorsement by PEI. The marks are clearly used to describe the title she received from PEI in 1981, a title that helps describe who she is.   It would be unreasonable to assume that the Chicago Bulls sponsored a website of Michael Jordan's simply because his name appeared with the appellation “former Chicago Bull.” Similarly, in this case, it would be unreasonable to assume that PEI currently sponsors or endorses someone who describes herself as a “Playboy Playmate of the Year in 1981.”   The designation of the year, in our case, serves the same function as the “former” in our example.   It shows that any sponsorship or endorsement occurred in the past.25 In addition to doing nothing in conjunction with her use of the marks to suggest sponsorship or endorsement by PEI, Welles affirmatively disavows any sponsorship or endorsement.   Her site contains a clear statement disclaiming any connection to PEI. Moreover, the text of the site describes her ongoing legal battles with the company.26 For the foregoing reasons, we conclude that Welles' use of PEI's marks in her headlines and banner advertisements is a nominative use excepted from the law of trademark infringement.2. Metatags. Welles includes the terms “playboy” and “playmate” in her metatags.   Metatags describe the contents of a website using keywords. Some search engines search metatags to identify websites relevant to a search.27  Thus, when an internet searcher enters “playboy” or “playmate” into a search engine that uses metatags, the results will include Welles' site.28  Because Welles' metatags do not repeat the terms extensively, her site will not be at the top of the list of search results.   Applying the three-factor test for nominative use, we conclude that the use of the trademarked terms in Welles' metatags is nominative.As we discussed above with regard to the headlines and banner advertisements, Welles has no practical way of describing herself without using trademarked terms.   In the context of metatags, we conclude that she has no practical way of identifying the content of her website without referring to PEI's trademarks.A large portion of Welles' website discusses her association with Playboy over the years.   Thus, the trademarked terms accurately describe the contents of Welles' website, in addition to describing Welles.   Forcing Welles and others to use absurd turns of phrase in their metatags, such as those necessary to identify Welles, would be particularly damaging in the internet search context.   Searchers would have a much more difficult time locating relevant websites if they could do so only by correctly guessing the long phrases necessary to substitute for trademarks.   We can hardly expect someone searching for Welles' site to imagine the same phrase proposed by the district court to describe Welles without referring to Playboy-“the nude model selected by Mr. Hefner's organization․” Yet if someone could not remember her name, that is what they would have to do.   Similarly, someone searching for critiques of Playboy on the internet would have a difficult time if internet sites could not list the object of their critique in their metatags.There is simply no descriptive substitute for the trademarks used in Welles' metatags.   Precluding their use would have the unwanted effect of hindering the free flow of information on the internet, something which is certainly not a goal of trademark law.29  Accordingly, the use of trademarked terms in the metatags meets the first part of the test for nominative use.We conclude that the metatags satisfy the second and third elements of the test as well.   The metatags use only so much of the marks as reasonably necessary 30 and nothing is done in conjunction with them to suggest sponsorship or endorsement by the trademark holder.   We note that our decision might differ if the metatags listed the trademarked term so repeatedly that Welles' site would regularly appear above PEI's in searches for one of the trademarked terms.31 3. Wallpaper/watermark. The background, or wallpaper, of Welles' site consists of the repeated abbreviation “PMOY ′81,” which stands for “Playmate of the Year 1981.” 32  Welles' name or likeness does not appear before or after “PMOY ′ 81.” The pattern created by the repeated abbreviation appears as the background of the various pages of the website.   Accepting, for the purposes of this appeal, that the abbreviation “PMOY” is indeed entitled to protection, we conclude that the repeated, stylized use of this abbreviation fails the nominative use test.The repeated depiction of “PMOY ′81” is not necessary to describe Welles.   “Playboy Playmate of the Year 1981” is quite adequate.   Moreover, the term does not even appear to describe Welles-her name or likeness do not appear before or after each “PMOY ′81.” Because the use of the abbreviation fails the first prong of the nominative use test, we need not apply the next two prongs of the test.Because the defense of nominative use fails here, and we have already determined that the doctrine of fair use does not apply, we remand to the district court.   The court must determine whether trademark law protects the abbreviation “PMOY,” as used in the wallpaper.B. Trademark Dilution The district court granted summary judgment to Welles as to PEI's claim of trademark dilution.   We affirm on the ground that all of Welles' uses of PEI's marks, with the exception of the use in the wallpaper which we address separately, are proper, nominative uses.   We hold that nominative uses, by definition, do not dilute the trademarks. Federal law provides protection against trademark dilution:The owner of a famous mark shall be entitled, subject to the principles of equity and upon such terms as the court deems reasonable, to an injunction against another person's commercial use in commerce of a mark or trade name, if such use begins after the mark has become famous and causes dilution of the distinctive quality of the mark․ 33Dilution, which was not defined by the statute, has been described by the courts as “the gradual ‘whittling away’ of a trademark's value.” 34  Traditionally, courts have recognized two forms of dilution:  blurring and tarnishment.   Blurring occurs when another's use of a mark creates “the possibility that the mark will lose its ability to serve as a unique identifier of the plaintiff's product.” 35  Tarnishment, on the other hand, occurs “when a famous mark is improperly associated with an inferior or offensive product or service.” 36  As we recognized in Panavision, dilution may occur through uses on the internet as well as elsewhere.37  Dilution works its harm not by causing confusion in consumers' minds regarding the source of a good or service, but by creating an association in consumers' minds between a mark and a different good or service.38  As explained in a First Circuit case, in dilution (as compared to infringement) “an entirely different issue is at stake-not interference with the source signaling function but rather protection from an appropriation of or free riding on the investment [the trademark holder] has made in its [trademark].” 39  Thus, for example, if a cocoa maker began using the “Rolls Royce” mark to identify its hot chocolate, no consumer confusion would be likely to result.   Few would assume that the car company had expanded into the cocoa making business.   However, the cocoa maker would be capitalizing on the investment the car company had made in its mark.   Consumers readily associate the mark with highly priced automobiles of a certain quality.   By identifying the cocoa with the Rolls Royce mark, the producer would be capitalizing on consumers' association of the mark with high quality items.   Moreover, by labeling a different product “Rolls Royce,” the cocoa company would be reducing the ability of the mark to identify the mark holder's product.   If someone said, “I'm going to get a Rolls Royce,” others could no longer be sure the person was planning on buying an expensive automobile.   The person might just be planning on buying a cup of cocoa.   Thus, the use of the mark to identify the hot chocolate, although not causing consumer confusion, would cause harm by diluting the mark. Uses that do not create an improper association between a mark and a new product but merely identify the trademark holder's products should be excepted from the reach of the anti-dilution statute.   Such uses cause no harm.   The anti-dilution statute recognizes this principle and specifically excepts users of a trademark who compare their product in “commercial advertising or promotion to identify the competing goods or services of the owner of the famous mark.” 40  For the same reason uses in comparative advertising are excepted from anti-dilution law, we conclude that nominative uses are also excepted.   A nominative use, by definition, refers to the trademark holder's product.   It does not create an improper association in consumers' minds between a new product and the trademark holder's mark.When Welles refers to her title, she is in effect referring to a product of PEI's. She does not dilute the title by truthfully identifying herself as its one-time recipient any more than Michael Jordan would dilute the name “Chicago Bulls” by referring to himself as a former member of that team, or the two-time winner of an Academy Award would dilute the award by referring to him or herself as a “two-time Academy Award winner.”   Awards are not diminished or diluted by the fact that they have been awarded in the past.   Similarly, they are not diminished or diluted when past recipients truthfully identify themselves as such.   It is in the nature of honors and awards to be identified with the people who receive them.   Of course, the conferrer of such honors and awards is free to limit the honoree's use of the title or references to the award by contract.   So long as a use is nominative, however, trademark law is unavailing. The one exception to the above analysis in this case is Welles' use of the abbreviation “PMOY” on her wallpaper.   Because we determined that this use is not nominative, it is not excepted from the anti-dilution provisions.   Thus, we reverse as to this issue and remand for further proceedings.   We note that if the district court determines that “PMOY” is not entitled to trademark protection, PEI's claim for dilution must fail.   The trademarked term, “Playmate of the Year” is not identical or nearly identical to the term “PMOY.” Therefore, use of the term “PMOY” cannot, as a matter of law, dilute the trademark “Playmate of the Year.” 41 C. Contract The district court granted summary judgment against PEI on its contract claims.   We affirm.   Although we conclude that PEI advanced sufficient evidence to establish unity of interest, the first prong of the alter ego test,42 we agree with the district court that PEI advanced insufficient evidence to defeat summary judgment on the second prong.   PEI did not show that “the facts are such that an adherence to the fiction of the separate existence of the corporation would, under the particular circumstances, sanction a fraud or promote injustice.” 43  We note that the alter ego rule is generally applied with caution.44  The district court did not err by declining to apply it here.IV.ConclusionFor the foregoing reasons, we affirm the district court's grant of summary judgment as to PEI's claims for trademark infringement and trademark dilution, with the sole exception of the use of the abbreviation “PMOY.” We reverse as to the abbreviation and remand for consideration of whether it merits protection under either an infringement or a dilution theory.   We also affirm as to PEI's claims for breach of contract.   In a separate memorandum disposition, we resolve the issues raised by Welles' cross-appeal.AFFIRMED in part, REVERSED and REMANDED in part.   Costs to Terri Welles and Terri Welles, Inc.FOOTNOTES1.   The disclaimer reads as follows:  “This site is neither endorsed, nor sponsored, nor affiliated with Playboy Enterprises, Inc.

West Coast Entertainment, 174 F.3d 1036, 1045 (9th Cir.1999).28.   We note that search engines that use their own summaries of websites, or that search the entire text of sites, are also likely to identify Welles' site as relevant to a search for “playboy” or “playmate,” given the content of the site.29.   Admittedly, this hindrance would only occur as to search engines that use metatags to direct their searches.30.   It is hard to imagine how a metatag could use more of a mark than the words contained in it, but we recently learned that some search engines are now using pictures.   Searching for symbols, such as the Playboy bunny, cannot be far behind.   That problem does not arise in this case, however, and we need not address it.31.   PEI asserts that it introduced evidence showing that Welles' site has been listed before PEI's on occasion.   However, an examination of the evidence PEI cites shows that Welles' site, although sometimes ranked highly, was still listed below PEI's in search results.32.   “PMOY” is not itself registered as a trademark.   PEI argued before the district court that it is nonetheless protected because it is a well-known abbreviation for the trademarked term “Playmate of the Year.” In this court PEI cites one affidavit that supports this argument.33.   15 U.S.C. § 1125(c)(1).34.   Academy of Motion Picture Arts & Sciences v.

Playboy Enterprises Inc. v. Terri Welles Inc.


United States District Court for the Southern District of California


Full case name
'Playboy Enterprises Inc., v. Terri Welles Inc., Terri Welles, Steven Huntington, Michael Mihalko, and PIPPI, Inc.'


Date decided
December 1, 1999


Judge sitting
Judith N. Keep


Case holding


Welles’ nominative use of Playboy’s trademarked terms in the metatags of her web site was fair use because web users must utilize identifying words to find their intended web site. Not all web searches utilizing the words “Playboy,” “Playmate,” and “Playboy Playmate of the Year 1981” are intended to find “Playboy” goods or the official “Playboy” site. There was no likelihood of confusion between Defendant's website and Playboy's trademark. Defendant’s fame and recognition derive from her popularity as a Playboy model and Playmate of the year, thus her use of the trademarked terms was descriptive (nominative).


Keywords

Facts[edit]
Welles maintained a website which identified her as a former PMOY and displayed the registered trademarked terms Playboy, Playmate of the Year, and Playmate of the Month and the unregistered trademark "PMOY" in metatags, wallpaper, banner ads, and the masthead. Playboy sued Welles, claiming both trademark infringement and trademark dilution.
Defendant was featured on the cover of a 1981 Playboy magazine. Defendant was a Playboy model and Playmate of the Year who used these trademarked terms to describe herself via her personal website. Plaintiff’s sued Defendant for Defendant’s under two theories: trademark infringement and trademark dilution.
Opinion of the Court[edit]
The Court held that nominative use (a type of fair use for discussing the product itself) is permitted where:

The product or service can not be readily identified without using the trademark (i.e. trademark is descriptive of a person, place, or product attribute);
Only so much of the mark may be used as is reasonably necessary for identification (e.g. the words may be reasonably used but not the specific font or logo); and
The user does nothing to suggest sponsorship or endorsement by the trademark holder - which applies even if the nominative use is commercial.

Here, the Ninth Circuit Court applied the nominative fair use test to the defendant and concluded the Defendant’s use of these trademarked items was permissible because there was no other practical way for the Defendant to describe herself. The Plaintiff was relying on the decision in Brookfield Communications, Inc. v. West Coast Entertainment Corp., to support the contention that the Defendant’s use of Playboy trademark in her web site infringes on its trademark by causing likelihood of confusion shown on the basis of initial interest confusion.
However, the court added that the Plaintiff’s reliance on Brookfield was misplaced. None of the cases which Brookfield discusses involved fair use defense or a use of trademarks in the metatags which accurately and fairly described the contents of the web page or web site.
The court defined Plaintiff’s use of the theory of ‘initial interest of confusion’ as “confusion of ‘consumer attention, even though no actual sale is finally completed as a result of the confusion.” In order for this type confusion to be actionable under the Lanham Act, several factors must be reviewed:

Evidence of the initial interest confusion as being “damaging and wrongful,”
Evidence that confusion between two products “will mistakenly lead the consumer to believe there is some connection between the two and therefore develop an interest in the defendant’s line that it would otherwise not have,” or
Evidence that the “situation offers an opportunity for sale not otherwise available by enabling defendant to interest prospective customers by confusion with the plaintiff’s product.”

In this case, the Plaintiff failed to present any of the facts indicating:

Any initial interest confusion was “damaging and wrongful;”
Anyone believes or is likely to believe there is a connection Welles’ site and Playboy’s.
Welles received “opportunities for sale not otherwise available” by confusing web users; or
Any of Welles’ actual customers were in the “appreciable number,” or majority of people who when plugging in one of the Plaintiff’s trademark terms into a web browser search engine, was “looking for Playboy’s official site.”

There was also no evidence Welles intended to divert Plaintiff’s customers to her web site by trading on Playboy’s goodwill. This intent was relevant since the court in Brookfield stated that in “Dr. Seuss, the Ninth Circuit explicitly recognized that the use of another’s trademark in a manner calculated to capture initial consumer attention, even though no actual sale is finally completed as a result of the confusion, may be still an infringement.” Brookfield at 1062.
Conclusion[edit]
The court wanted to render an analysis that was flexible and reflective of “emerging technologies”, but also wanted to uphold common sense principles of trademark law.
On appeal, the Ninth Circuit affirmed the district court’s conclusion with respect to Welles' use of metatags because the court considered the use nominative.

United States Court of Appeals, Ninth Circuit.
Argued and Submitted September 11, 2001.Filed February 1, 2002.

Before: B. FLETCHER, T.G. NELSON, and BERZON, Circuit Judges.
T.G. NELSON, Circuit Judge.
Playboy Enterprises, Inc. (PEI), appeals the district court's grant of summary judgment as to its claims of trademark infringement, unfair competition, and breach of contract against Terri Welles; Terri Welles, Inc.; Pippi, Inc.; and Welles' current and former "webmasters," Steven Huntington and Michael Mihalko. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1291, and we affirm in part and reverse in part.
In a separate memorandum disposition, we resolve Welles' cross-appeal of the district court's grant of summary judgment as to her counterclaims for defamation, intentional infliction of emotional distress, unfair competition, and interference with prospective economic advantage. Welles, Huntington and Mihalko also appeal the district court's denial of their requests for attorney's fees. We resolve that issue in the memorandum disposition as well.
I.
Background
Terri Welles was on the cover of Playboy in 1981 and was chosen to be the Playboy Playmate of the Year for 1981. Her use of the title "Playboy Playmate of the Year 1981," and her use of other trademarked terms on her website are at issue in this suit. During the relevant time period, Welles' website offered information about and free photos of Welles, advertised photos for sale, advertised memberships in her photo club, and promoted her services as a spokesperson. A biographical section described Welles' selection as Playmate of the Year in 1981 and her years modeling for PEI. After the lawsuit began, Welles included discussions of the suit and criticism of PEI on her website and included a note disclaiming any association with PEI.[1]
[800] PEI complains of four different uses of its trademarked terms on Welles' website: (1) the terms "Playboy" and "Playmate" in the metatags of the website;[2] (2) the phrase "Playmate of the Year 1981" on the masthead of the website; (3) the phrases "Playboy Playmate of the Year 1981" and "Playmate of the Year 1981" on various banner ads, which may be transferred to other websites; and (4) the repeated use of the abbreviation "PMOY '81" as the watermark on the pages of the website.[3] PEI claimed that these uses of its marks constituted trademark infringement, dilution, false designation of origin, and unfair competition. The district court granted defendants' motion for summary judgment. PEI appeals the grant of summary judgment on its infringement and dilution claims. We affirm in part and reverse in part.
The district court also granted summary judgment on PEI's contract claims. Those claims arose from a contract between PEI and a corporation created by Welles, "Pippi, Inc." When Welles agreed to be Playmate of the Year in 1981, Pippi, Inc., signed a contract with PEI. The contract contained a term requiring prior written approval from PEI before Welles made any "non-Playboy use of her name with the designation `Playmate of the Year.'" Pippi, Inc., was dissolved in 1984. PEI argues that Pippi, Inc., was Welles' alter ego and that the terms of the contract are currently enforceable against Welles. The district court rejected this argument and granted summary judgment on PEI's contract claims in favor of Welles. We affirm.
II.
Standard of Review
We review the district court's grant of summary judgment de novo.[4] Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, we must determine whether there are any genuine issues of material fact and whether the district court correctly applied the relevant substantive law.[5] The court must not weigh the evidence or determine the truth of the matter but only determine whether there is a genuine issue for trial.[6]
III.

Except for the use of PEI's protected terms in the wallpaper of Welles' website, we conclude that Welles' uses of PEI's trademarks are permissible, nominative uses. They imply no current sponsorship or endorsement by PEI. Instead, they serve to identify Welles as a past PEI "Playmate of the Year."[7]
[801] We articulated the test for a permissible, nominative use in New Kids On The Block v. New America Publishing, Inc.[8] The band, New Kids On The Block, claimed trademark infringement arising from the use of their trademarked name by several newspapers. The newspapers had conducted polls asking which member of the band New Kids On The Block was the best and most popular.[9] The papers' use of the trademarked term did not fall within the traditional fair use doctrine. Unlike a traditional fair use scenario, the defendant newspaper was using the trademarked term to describe not its own product, but the plaintiff's.[10] Thus, the factors used to evaluate fair use were inapplicable.[11] The use was nonetheless permissible, we concluded, based on its nominative nature.
We adopted the following test for nominative use:
First, the product or service in question must be one not readily identifiable without use of the trademark; second, only so much of the mark or marks may be used as is reasonably necessary to identify the product or service; and third, the user must do nothing that would, in conjunction with the mark, suggest sponsorship or endorsement by the trademark holder.[12]
We noted in New Kids that a nominative use may also be a commercial one.[13]
In cases in which the defendant raises a nominative use defense, the above three-factor test should be applied instead of the test for likelihood of confusion set forth in Sleekcraft.[14] The three-factor test better evaluates the likelihood of confusion in nominative use cases. When a defendant uses a trademark nominally, the trademark will be identical to the plaintiff's mark, at least in terms of the words in question. Thus, application of the Sleekcraft test, which focuses on the similarity of the mark used by the plaintiff and the defendant, would lead to the incorrect conclusion that virtually all nominative uses are confusing. The three-factor test — with its requirements that the defendant use marks only when no descriptive substitute exists, use no more of the mark than necessary, and do nothing to suggest sponsorship or endorsement by the mark holder — better addresses concerns regarding the likelihood of confusion in nominative use cases.
We group the uses of PEI's trademarked terms into three for the purpose of applying the test for nominative use. First, we analyze Welles' use of the terms in headlines and banner advertisements. We conclude that those uses are clearly nominative. Second, we analyze the use of the terms in the metatags for Welles' website, which we conclude are nominative as well. Finally, we analyze the terms as used in the wall-paper of the website. We [802] conclude that this use is not nominative and remand for a determination of whether it infringes on a PEI trademark.
1. Headlines and banner advertisements.
To satisfy the first part of the test for nominative use, "the product or service in question must be one not readily identifiable without use of the trademark[.]"[15] This situation arises "when a trademark also describes a person, a place or an attribute of a product"[16] and there is no descriptive substitute for the trademark. In such a circumstance, allowing the trademark holder exclusive rights would allow the language to "be depleted in much the same way as if generic words were protectable."[17] In New Kids, we gave the example of the trademarked term, "Chicago Bulls." We explained that "one might refer to the `two-time world champions' or `the professional basketball team from Chicago,' but it's far simpler (and more likely to be understood) to refer to the Chicago Bulls."[18] Moreover, such a use of the trademark would "not imply sponsorship or endorsement of the product because the mark is used only to describe the thing, rather than to identify its source."[19] Thus, we concluded, such uses must be excepted from trademark infringement law.
The district court properly identified Welles' situation as one which must also be excepted. No descriptive substitute exists for PEI's trademarks in this context. The court explained:
[T]here is no other way that Ms. Welles can identify or describe herself and her services without venturing into absurd descriptive phrases. To describe herself as the "nude model selected by Mr. Hefner's magazine as its number-one prototypical woman for the year 1981" would be impractical as well as ineffectual in identifying Terri Welles to the public.[20]
We agree. Just as the newspapers in New Kids could only identify the band clearly by using its trademarked name, so can Welles only identify herself clearly by using PEI's trademarked title.
The second part of the nominative use test requires that "only so much of the mark or marks may be used as is reasonably necessary to identify the product or service[.]"[21] New Kids provided the following examples to explain this element: "[A] soft drink competitor would be entitled to compare its product to Coca-Cola or Coke, but would not be entitled to use Coca-Cola's distinctive lettering."[22] Similarly, in a past case, an auto shop was allowed to use the trademarked term "Volkswagen" on a sign describing the cars it repaired, in part because the shop "did not use Volkswagen's distinctive lettering style or color scheme, nor did he display the encircled `VW' emblem."[23] Welles' banner advertisements and headlines satisfy this element because they use only the trademarked words, not the font or symbols associated with the trademarks.
[803] The third element requires that the user do "nothing that would, in conjunction with the mark, suggest sponsorship or endorsement by the trademark holder."[24] As to this element, we conclude that aside from the wallpaper, which we address separately, Welles does nothing in conjunction with her use of the marks to suggest sponsorship or endorsement by PEI. The marks are clearly used to describe the title she received from PEI in 1981, a title that helps describe who she is. It would be unreasonable to assume that the Chicago Bulls sponsored a website of Michael Jordan's simply because his name appeared with the appellation "former Chicago Bull." Similarly, in this case, it would be unreasonable to assume that PEI currently sponsors or endorses someone who describes herself as a "Playboy Playmate of the Year in 1981." The designation of the year, in our case, serves the same function as the "former" in our example. It shows that any sponsorship or endorsement occurred in the past.[25]
In addition to doing nothing in conjunction with her use of the marks to suggest sponsorship or endorsement by PEI, Welles affirmatively disavows any sponsorship or endorsement. Her site contains a clear statement disclaiming any connection to PEI. Moreover, the text of the site describes her ongoing legal battles with the company.[26]
For the foregoing reasons, we conclude that Welles' use of PEI's marks in her headlines and banner advertisements is a nominative use excepted from the law of trademark infringement.
2. Metatags.
Welles includes the terms "playboy" and "playmate" in her metatags. Metatags describe the contents of a website using keywords. Some search engines search metatags to identify websites relevant to a search.[27] Thus, when an internet searcher enters "playboy" or "playmate" into a search engine that uses metatags, the results will include Welles' site.[28] Because Welles' metatags do not repeat the terms extensively, her site will not be at the top of the list of search results. Applying the three-factor test for nominative use, we conclude that the use of the trademarked terms in Welles' metatags is nominative.
As we discussed above with regard to the headlines and banner advertisements, Welles has no practical way of describing herself without using trademarked terms. In the context of metatags, we conclude that she has no practical way of identifying the content of her website without referring to PEI's trademarks.
A large portion of Welles' website discusses her association with Playboy over the years. Thus, the trademarked terms accurately describe the contents of Welles' website, in addition to describing Welles. Forcing Welles and others to use absurd turns of phrase in their metatags, such as [804] those necessary to identify Welles, would be particularly damaging in the internet search context. Searchers would have a much more difficult time locating relevant websites if they could do so only by correctly guessing the long phrases necessary to substitute for trademarks. We can hardly expect someone searching for Welles' site to imagine the same phrase proposed by the district court to describe Welles without referring to Playboy — "the nude model selected by Mr. Hefner's organization...." Yet if someone could not remember her name, that is what they would have to do. Similarly, someone searching for critiques of Playboy on the internet would have a difficult time if internet sites could not list the object of their critique in their metatags.
There is simply no descriptive substitute for the trademarks used in Welles' metatags. Precluding their use would have the unwanted effect of hindering the free flow of information on the internet, something which is certainly not a goal of trademark law.[29] Accordingly, the use of trademarked terms in the metatags meets the first part of the test for nominative use.
We conclude that the metatags satisfy the second and third elements of the test as well. The metatags use only so much of the marks as reasonably necessary[30] and nothing is done in conjunction with them to suggest sponsorship or endorsement by the trademark holder. We note that our decision might differ if the metatags listed the trademarked term so repeatedly that Welles' site would regularly appear above PEI's in searches for one of the trademarked terms.[31]
3. Wallpaper/watermark.
The background, or wallpaper, of Welles' site consists of the repeated abbreviation "PMOY '81," which stands for "Playmate of the Year 1981."[32] Welles' name or likeness does not appear before or after "PMOY '81." The pattern created by the repeated abbreviation appears as the background of the various pages of the website. Accepting, for the purposes of this appeal, that the abbreviation "PMOY" is indeed entitled to protection, we conclude that the repeated, stylized use of this abbreviation fails the nominative use test.
The repeated depiction of "PMOY '81" is not necessary to describe Welles. "Playboy Playmate of the Year 1981" is quite adequate. Moreover, the term does not even appear to describe Welles — her name or likeness do not appear before or after each "PMOY '81." Because the use of the abbreviation fails the first prong of the nominative use test, we need not apply the next two prongs of the test.
[805] Because the defense of nominative use fails here, and we have already determined that the doctrine of fair use does not apply, we remand to the district court. The court must determine whether trademark law protects the abbreviation "PMOY," as used in the wallpaper.
B. Trademark Dilution
The district court granted summary judgment to Welles as to PEI's claim of trademark dilution. We affirm on the ground that all of Welles' uses of PEI's marks, with the exception of the use in the wallpaper which we address separately, are proper, nominative uses. We hold that nominative uses, by definition, do not dilute the trademarks.
Federal law provides protection against trademark dilution:
The owner of a famous mark shall be entitled, subject to the principles of equity and upon such terms as the court deems reasonable, to an injunction against another person's commercial use in commerce of a mark or trade name, if such use begins after the mark has become famous and causes dilution of the distinctive quality of the mark....[33]
Dilution, which was not defined by the statute, has been described by the courts as "the gradual `whittling away' of a trademark's value."[34] Traditionally, courts have recognized two forms of dilution: blurring and tarnishment. Blurring occurs when another's use of a mark creates "the possibility that the mark will lose its ability to serve as a unique identifier of the plaintiff's product."[35] Tarnishment, on the other hand, occurs "when a famous mark is improperly associated with an inferior or offensive product or service."[36] As we recognized in Panavision, dilution may occur through uses on the internet as well as elsewhere.[37]
Dilution works its harm not by causing confusion in consumers' minds regarding the source of a good or service, but by creating an association in consumers' minds between a mark and a different good or service.[38] As explained in a First Circuit case, in dilution (as compared to infringement) "an entirely different issue is at stake — not interference with the source signaling function but rather protection from an appropriation of or free riding on the investment [the trademark holder] has made in its [trademark]."[39] Thus, for example, if a cocoa maker began using the "Rolls Royce" mark to identify its hot chocolate, no consumer confusion would be likely to result. Few would assume that the car company had expanded into the cocoa making business. However, the cocoa maker would be capitalizing on the investment the car company had made in its mark. Consumers readily associate the mark with highly priced automobiles of a certain quality. By identifying the cocoa with the Rolls Royce mark, the producer would be capitalizing on consumers' association of the mark with high quality items. Moreover, by labeling a different product "Rolls Royce," the cocoa company would [806] be reducing the ability of the mark to identify the mark holder's product. If someone said, "I'm going to get a Rolls Royce," others could no longer be sure the person was planning on buying an expensive automobile. The person might just be planning on buying a cup of cocoa. Thus, the use of the mark to identify the hot chocolate, although not causing consumer confusion, would cause harm by diluting the mark.
Uses that do not create an improper association between a mark and a new product but merely identify the trademark holder's products should be excepted from the reach of the anti-dilution statute. Such uses cause no harm. The anti-dilution statute recognizes this principle and specifically excepts users of a trademark who compare their product in "commercial advertising or promotion to identify the competing goods or services of the owner of the famous mark."[40]
For the same reason uses in comparative advertising are excepted from anti-dilution law, we conclude that nominative uses are also excepted. A nominative use, by definition, refers to the trademark holder's product. It does not create an improper association in consumers' minds between a new product and the trademark holder's mark.
When Welles refers to her title, she is in effect referring to a product of PEI's. She does not dilute the title by truthfully identifying herself as its one-time recipient any more than Michael Jordan would dilute the name "Chicago Bulls" by referring to himself as a former member of that team, or the two-time winner of an Academy Award would dilute the award by referring to him or herself as a "two-time Academy Award winner." Awards are not diminished or diluted by the fact that they have been awarded in the past. Similarly, they are not diminished or diluted when past recipients truthfully identify themselves as such. It is in the nature of honors and awards to be identified with the people who receive them. Of course, the conferrer of such honors and awards is free to limit the honoree's use of the title or references to the award by contract. So long as a use is nominative, however, trademark law is unavailing.
The one exception to the above analysis in this case is Welles' use of the abbreviation "PMOY" on her wallpaper. Because we determined that this use is not nominative, it is not excepted from the anti-dilution provisions. Thus, we reverse as to this issue and remand for further proceedings. We note that if the district court determines that "PMOY" is not entitled to trademark protection, PEI's claim for dilution must fail. The trademarked term, "Playmate of the Year" is not identical or nearly identical to the term "PMOY." Therefore, use of the term "PMOY" cannot, as a matter of law, dilute the trademark "Playmate of the Year."[41]
C. Contract
The district court granted summary judgment against PEI on its contract claims. We affirm. Although we conclude that PEI advanced sufficient evidence to establish unity of interest, the first prong of the alter ego test,[42] we agree with the [807] district court that PEI advanced insufficient evidence to defeat summary judgment on the second prong. PEI did not show that "the facts are such that an adherence to the fiction of the separate existence of the corporation would, under the particular circumstances, sanction a fraud or promote injustice."[43] We note that the alter ego rule is generally applied with caution.[44] The district court did not err by declining to apply it here.
IV.
Conclusion
For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the district court's grant of summary judgment as to PEI's claims for trademark infringement and trademark dilution, with the sole exception of the use of the abbreviation "PMOY." We reverse as to the abbreviation and remand for consideration of whether it merits protection under either an infringement or a dilution theory. We also affirm as to PEI's claims for breach of contract. In a separate memorandum disposition, we resolve the issues raised by Welles' cross-appeal.

[28] We note that search engines that use their own summaries of websites, or that search the entire text of sites, are also likely to identify Welles' site as relevant to a search for "playboy" or "playmate," given the content of the site.
[29] Admittedly, this hindrance would only occur as to search engines that use metatags to direct their searches.
[30] It is hard to imagine how a metatag could use more of a mark than the words contained in it, but we recently learned that some search engines are now using pictures. Searching for symbols, such as the Playboy bunny, cannot be far behind. That problem does not arise in this case, however, and we need not address it.
[31] PEI asserts that it introduced evidence showing that Welles' site has been listed before PEI's on occasion. However, an examination of the evidence PEI cites shows that Welles' site, although sometimes ranked highly, was still listed below PEI's in search results.
[32] "PMOY" is not itself registered as a trademark. PEI argued before the district court that it is nonetheless protected because it is a well-known abbreviation for the trademarked term "Playmate of the Year." In this court PEI cites one affidavit that supports this argument.
