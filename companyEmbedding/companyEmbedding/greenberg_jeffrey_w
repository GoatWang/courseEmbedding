      ■ Jeffrey Greenberg spent most of his early career under the wing
      of his father, Maurice "Hank" Greenberg, head of American
      International Group (AIG). After nearly two decades he surprisingly left
      AIG and joined Marsh & McLennan Companies (MMC), a global
      insurance, investment, and consulting company. Within a few years he was
      named the company's chairman and chief executive officer (CEO).
      Greenberg led AIG through several tumultuous events, including the loss of
      hundreds of employees in the September 11, 2001, attacks on the World
      Trade Center. He also steered AIG through an investment scandal at Putnam
      Investments, one of MMC's subsidiary companies. Greenberg was
      described as a smart and competent executive who tended to avoid the
      spotlight.

          . 
        


      FOLLOWING IN HIS FATHER'S FOOTSTEPS
    

      Jeffrey Greenberg grew up in a privileged environment, but he did not want
      to be a stereotypical rich kid. As a teenager he took jobs pumping gas and
      bagging groceries at a local supermarket (although he reportedly used the
      proceeds to buy an Alfa Romeo sports car). His former wife, Nikki Finke,
      described Greenberg as a "dutiful son." After graduating
      from Brown University and Georgetown University Law School, he took a job
      as a broker at MMC, where he quickly became known for his intelligence and
      hard work. "I think he could have succeeded in any
      business," Michael P. Esposito, a longtime business associate, told
      
      
        BusinessWeek
      
      .
    

      Greenberg left MMC after two years to join his father's company. In
      1988 he was made head of AIG's property-casualty division, the
      National Union Fire Insurance Company.
       Three years later he was named executive vice president of domestic
      brokerage operations. The insurance products he helped develop enabled
      AIG's customers to protect themselves against a wide variety of
      potential problems, from severe weather to currency fluctuations. While at
      AIG, Greenberg adopted his father's tough business style. When
      Hurricane Andrew hit Florida in 1992, Jeffrey Greenberg is said to have
      sent out a memo (supported by his father) telling AIG senior managers,
      "This is an opportunity to get price increases now" (
      
        Washington Post
      
      ).
    

      Greenberg spent 17 years at AIG and was expected to succeed his father as
      head of the company. But in 1995 he abruptly left his position as
      executive vice president, just weeks after his brother, Evan, was awarded
      the same title. Although Jeffrey said he made the move because "it
      would be fun to do something independent of AIG" (
      
        Wall Street Journal
      
      ), there was some speculation that Evan's rapid rise within the
      family business threatened Jeffrey's position as heir apparent.
      Other analysts suggested that Jeffrey was tired of waiting for his
      father's job; though Maurice was well past the age of retirement,
      he showed no signs that he was ready to relinquish the top spot at AIG.
    

      Still other people in the industry suggested that Jeffrey felt strangled
      by his father's tight rope. At one point his father reportedly
      responded to a personnel problem in one of Jeffrey's divisions by
      saying, "You either fix your management problem or I'll fix
      mine" (
      
        Washington Post
      
      ). But Jeffrey denied that there was any strain in his relationship with
      his father. Some AIG executives were saddened when Jeffrey Greenberg left
      the company and were concerned that his brother would not be able to fill
      his shoes. "He was a real creative force," one high-level
      manager said of Jeffrey (
      
        BusinessWeek
      
      ).
    

      RETURN TO MARSH & MCLENNAN
    

      Soon, Greenberg returned to MMC. The move raised eyebrows, because AIG was
      one of MMC's primary sources of insurance coverage for its clients.
      Skeptics were concerned that Greenberg would give preferential treatment
      to his father's company, choosing its policies over those of rival
      insurers.
    

      Greenberg was chairman of MMC Capital from 1996 until 2002. In 1999, at
      the age of 47, he became the youngest CEO in the company's 129-year
      history. At the helm he was charged with overseeing the three divisions of
      the multibillion-dollar financial-services conglomerate: Marsh, one of the
      world's largest corporate risk and insurance brokers; Putnam
      Investments; and Mercer Consulting Group. Within two years MMC's
      stock prices were up 60 percent, and Greenberg had lured top talent from
      companies such as PepsiCo and the Union Bank of Switzerland to fill his
      management team.
    

      Associates described Greenberg as an intellectual and analytical leader
      with a deliberate management style. "He's not a person who
      makes snap decisions," Michael A. Lewis, an analyst at UBS
      Investment Research, told the 
      
        New York Times
      
      . As CEO, Greenberg always kept a low profile, making few public
      appearances, and rarely hosting conference calls to announce quarterly
      earnings, as was the practice of many of his rivals' CEOs.
    

      DIFFICULT TIMES FOR MMC
    

      The rosy period that Greenberg enjoyed during his first few years at MMC
      did not last for long. The economic downturn at the beginning of the 21st
      century hit MMC's stock price hard. The company was also devastated
      by the events of September 11, 2001. MMC had 1,700 employees working in
      the upper floors of the World Trade Center, and nearly 300 of them were
      killed. When he heard news of the terrorist attack, Greenberg quickly
      established a command center at the company's headquarters in
      midtown Manhattan. He later arranged for grief counselors and other
      support for the families of those employees who had perished. September 11
      changed the business world significantly, but for the insurance industry
      the repercussions were not all negative. MMC took advantage of higher
      insurance rates and the increased demand for insurance that resulted from
      the attacks.
    

      In 2003 Putnam Investments, one of MMC's divisions, found itself
      embroiled in scandal. Civil charges were filed against the company for
      alleged trading abuses. According to the Securities and Exchange
      Commission, Putnam's executives used insider information to profit
      from the international funds they managed, at the expense of their
      clients. Within a few months after the story became public, angry
      investors withdrew more than $71 billion from the company. Greenberg
      replaced Putnam CEO Lawrence Lasser soon after the scandal broke, in a
      move many thought reminiscent of his father. ""I see this as
      an aggressive move that hopefully will address whatever problems they have
      and get them firmly back on track," Chris Winans, an insurance
      analyst at Lehman Brothers, told the 
      
        New York Times
      
      . "This is very much like his father's approach to problems,
      to address them quickly and forcefully."
    

      Although Greenberg vowed to stick with Putnam, he was firm that the
      company would not stand for any sort of shady business practices.
      "We are taking measures to see that this does not happen again. The
      kind of conduct that has occurred has no place at Putnam," he said
      in a statement (
      
        CFO.com
      
      ). He directed Putnam Investments' mutual-fund unit to pay millions
      of dollars in restitution to jilted investors. Greenberg also added
      independent directors and limited employee trading, all in an effort to
      restore investor confidence.
    

      While his company was struggling to regain its foothold in the investment
      industry, Greenberg's own finances were solid.
       In 2003 he pocketed approximately $14 million, a hefty in crease from the
      previous year. By the end of the year MMC was on better footing as well.
      The company had a double-digit revenue increase over the previous year,
      fueled primarily by a strong performance by its risk and insurance
      businesses. In 2004, following the controversy over former chairman
      Richard Grasso's $188 million compensation package, Greenberg was
      appointed to the New York Stock Exchange oversight board to help reform
      the organization's business practices.
    

      OTHER ROLES
    

      Greenberg was a trustee of the Brookings Institution, Brown University,
      the Spence School in New York City, and New York Presbyterian Hospital. He
      was a member of the board of overseers of the Joan and Sanford I. Weill
      Graduate School of Medical Sciences of Cornell University, the board of
      directors of ACE Limited, the Council on Foreign Relations, and the
      Trilateral Commission.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).

NEW YORK--Jeffrey W. Greenberg has resigned as chairman and chief executive officer of embattled brokerage Marsh & McLennan Cos. Inc., the company announced after the stock market closed Monday.The announcement comes less than two weeks after New York Attorney General Eliot Spitzer sued MMC, charging it with fraudulent self-dealing and bid-rigging through its use of contingent commission arrangements.Mr. Greenberg will be replaced by Michael G. Cherkasky, the former CEO of MMC's Marsh Kroll consulting unit, who, soon after Mr. Sptizer's suit was filed, was named head of Marsh Inc., MMC's brokerage unit.New York-based MMC also announced in a statement that on Tuesday it will announce "significant reforms in the business model" of Marsh, which "will be rooted in transparency and under which Marsh will receive compensation for its services from only one party: its clients."MMC also announced that it had appointed a special committee of outside directors "to spearhead the company's activities in resolving its legal and regulatory matters," the statement notes. The committee will be headed by Robert F. Erburu, former chairman of The Times Mirror Co.Mr. Greenberg joined Marsh & McLennan as a senior executive at its investment arm in 1995, a few months after he stunned the insurance industry by leaving American International Group Inc. Mr. Greenberg had been seen as the heir apparent to his father, AIG Chairman and CEO Maurice R. Greenberg.Jeffrey W. Greenberg was then named president of MMC in January 1999, and later that year he took on the additional role of CEO. He became chairman on the retirement of A.J.C. Smith in May 2000.As head of the holding company, Jeffrey W. Greenberg was responsible for overseeing the three main business units of MMC: the insurance brokerage unit, Marsh; the benefits consulting unit, Mercer Inc.; and its investment unit, Putnam Investments Inc.Last year, Putnam was the subject of regulatory and civil suits accusing it of improper trading practices. In April this year, Putnam agreed to pay $110 million to settle the charges with regulators and replaced longtime Putnam CEO Lawrence Lasser.

Sins of the Son
In a corporate Greek tragedy, Jeffrey Greenberg tried desperately to escape the vast shadow of his insurance-mogul father, Hank, only to be smote by 
a more powerful god. 






By Noam Scheiber

(Photo: Illustration by Charles Miller)



The first thing you might notice about Jeffrey Greenberg is how modest and self-effacing he can be, particularly for a man who’s held a couple of the most important jobs in the insurance industry. “Jeff was very clever in his way, playful,” says Mark Reagan, a fellow insurance executive who once worked for Greenberg. “You’d walk out of a tough meeting, and Jeff might 
say, ‘That wasn’t as much fun as I hoped.’ ” As a young man, Greenberg was the type who, despite his family’s wealth, insisted on pumping gas and scrubbing boats to pay off a new car. Even when he went on to earn $22 million last year, Greenberg lived with his second wife and four kids in a relatively unassuming apartment on Park Avenue. Before he became CEO of Marsh & McLennan, a job he held for five years before being forced to resign late last month, Greenberg had a reputation for stepping in to 
claim responsibility when higher-ups lashed out at his subordinates. There is something almost cartoonishly all-American about 
him. At six feet tall, Greenberg has the build of a natural athlete. He was, in fact, a standout sprinter, football player, and skier at Choate. As of last month, the 53-year-old Greenberg remained one of the tougher tennis matchups on the executive circuit.
Greenberg is also a textbook incarnation of corporate establishmentarianism. He is a trustee at Brown, his alma mater; at Brookings, the granddaddy of Washington think tanks; and at New York’s elite Spence School, which his eldest daughter attended. Greenberg would be perfectly at home in the halls of the Council on Foreign Relations or at a meeting of the Trilateral Commission. (He’s a member of both institutions.) His family spends weekends at their house in northern Connecticut. 
But for all Jeff Greenberg’s obvious successes, he’d never escaped the shadow of his larger-than-life family. His father, Maurice R. “Hank” Greenberg, the CEO and chairman of AIG, is quite possibly the most famous man in the history of the insurance business. Hank almost single-handedly built the company into a global financial-services powerhouse over the past 37 years. At least since adolescence, Jeff has been dogged by the sense that nothing he could accomplish would amount to more than a footnote alongside the achievements of his father. 
For his part, Hank, whose management style former employees have compared to George Patton’s, did his best to remind Jeff of this fact during the seventeen-year period he worked for his father at AIG. “Do I think he was harsher because [Jeff] was his son? I think the answer is yes,” says one former AIG executive. In one notorious incident, Hank blew up at Jeff over a personnel problem in a roomful of colleagues. “You either fix your management problem or I’ll fix mine!” the father reportedly bellowed. “I think it was a case of two people from the same gene pool with extraordinarily high success drives,” says this executive. “And there’s only so much oxygen in any given room.”


Jeff Greenberg’s white-collar sensibility didn’t mean he refused 
to play hardball like his father, 
Hank, or 
his brother Evan. It’s 
just that 
Jeff wasn’t as good at it.


To further complicate the matter, Jeff was not the only Greenberg son high up in the AIG hierarchy. Toward the end of Jeff’s time at AIG, his younger brother Evan was head of the company’s international operations—and probably the only person who’d risen faster at AIG than Jeff. The brothers had been lifelong rivals. Jeff had always been the good son—successful at school, successful at work, but never quite successful enough to impress Hank. Evan, by contrast, had a knack for screwing up, though he’d earned a special place in Hank’s heart over the years for having the guts to defy him. When Evan began to prove himself Jeff’s equal in the family business, it was more than Jeff could handle. In June 1995, the combination of this fraternal competition and his father’s suffocating management style led Jeff to resign—and walk away from what many observers expected would be his eventual takeover of the company. 
Jeff Greenberg landed at the giant insurance brokerage Marsh & McLennan, where within four years he rose to CEO. It was a triumph, confirmation that he was ultimately his own man. Then two weeks ago, with the firm under fire from New York attorney general Eliot Spitzer, Jeff Greenberg’s career came crashing down. Spitzer is accusing Marsh & McLennan of rigging what were supposed to be competitive bids and collecting kickbacks from insurance companies in exchange for lucrative business. Watching Jeff tender his resignation, you could be forgiven for concluding he was just another greedy CEO getting his comeuppance. But in fact, it’s impossible to judge the story of Jeff Greenberg’s rise and fall without understanding the family dynamics that drove him throughout his career.
When AIG went public in 1969, Hank Greenberg became a very wealthy man, something that would have been difficult to imagine when he set out on his professional career. Hank had come home from the second of two tours of duty in the Army (the first saw him storm Omaha Beach as a Ranger, the second put him in Korea as a military lawyer) in desperate need of a job to support his wife and newborn son Jeff. He went looking for one up and down William Street, then the center of the New York City insurance industry. Legend has it Hank eventually talked his way into an entry-level underwriting position at Continental Casualty after treating the boss of a dismissive personnel employee to an animated lecture on deportment. 
That was 1952. By 1959, Hank had moved to Chicago and become the youngest vice-president ever at Continental, overseeing the company’s accident- and health-insurance operations. Then, in 1960, a mentor of Greenberg’s recommended Hank for a job at American International Companies. By 1962, Hank had taken over the company’s domestic operations, American Home, which at that point could barely be considered “third-rate,” according to David Schiff, the dean of insurance-industry analysts. Hank transformed it into a steady source of profits. Some five years later, buoyed by this success, he took over as head of the entire company, which he incorporated as AIG. 
Though Hank ran a company with hundreds of millions in annual revenue, the Greenberg household in the early seventies hardly gave the impression of abundant wealth. The Greenbergs lived in a fairly modest three-bedroom apartment on Park Avenue, with Jeff, Evan, and younger brother Scott sharing a bedroom when they were home from boarding school or college. The kids were “not arrogant for the amount of money they had, less 
arrogant than most,” says Mark Abouzeid, the son of an AIG executive who grew up around the Greenbergs. In fact, Hank was determined not to flaunt his good fortune. Friends were struck by how proud the family was that its modest country home in Brewster, New York, looked even smaller from the roadside. 
Visitors to the Greenberg residence at the time recall Hank as an almost compulsively disciplined and health-conscious man. The family routinely ate tofu, long before it was fashionable; Hank rode his exercise bike every morning while watching the Today show. Even Thanksgivings were hardly feasts. “I was always on a diet, but everybody would watch what everybody ate,” says Nikki Finke, a Hollywood columnist who was Jeff’s first wife and who first met the family when Evan and Jeff were teenagers. “It wasn’t like, ‘Loosen your belt.’ For Hank and [wife] Corinne, it was more to see how little could you eat.”
