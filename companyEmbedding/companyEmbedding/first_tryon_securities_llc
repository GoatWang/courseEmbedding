The Firm also provides independent financial advisory services to municipal and corporate clients. First Tryon Securities is headquartered in Charlotte, North Carolina—a major U.S. financial center.  The Firm provides markets and advisory services to approximately 1,000 dealers and institutions across the United States and internationally. The combination of secondary trading/sales and financial advisory services enables First Tryon to provide our client base with multidimensional expertise in the fixed income markets.  First Tryon is well capitalized, enabling us to meet a variety of needs, and efficiently staffed to provide the personal attention you deserve. Each customer transaction is valued regardless of size. The markets and advice we provide reflect our seasoned professionals’ comprehensive knowledge of the marketplace and our desire to earn your business. See MoreProducts-Investment Grade and High Yield Corporate Bonds -Municipal Bonds -Liquidity Provider -Financial AdvisorycategoriesFinancial Service · CompanySTORYFirst Tryon Securities, LLC first opened its doors in 1996 with only four employees and a basic principle that the relationship with each and every customer would be the cornerstone of success. Today we handle billions of dollars in volume each year, but have never lost sight of our essential core values— relationships and trust.  Our roots go all the way back to America’s 1976 bicentennial when H.... Keith Brunnemer, Jr. co-founded First Charlotte Corporation — a fixed income broker/dealer servicing the institutional marketplace. First Charlotte Corp thrived and was ultimately sold to J.C. Bradford & Co. in 1991. Then, after retiring from J.C. Bradford in 1994, Mr. Brunnemer was approached about starting a specialty broker/dealer that would focus on trading and selling odd lot corporate bonds to other dealers. Intrigued with the idea and hungry for a new challenge, he agreed to capitalize First Tryon Securities, LLC.  First Tryon has expanded over the years to include additional products and services and has established a large customer base of approximately 1,000 dealers and institutions. The most recent addition to the Firm’s business is First Tryon Advisors, an independent financial advisory practice servicing municipal and corporate clients.  Despite the growth of the Firm and the evolution of the marketplace, each customer is valued, whether large or small. Many of our customers have been with us since we first opened our doors and we are eager to continue establishing long term relationships built on trust and success. We welcome the opportunity to earn your business.

About
History

First Tryon Securities, LLC first opened its doors in 1996 with only four employees and a basic principle that the relationship with each and every customer would be the cornerstone of success. Today we handle billions of dollars in volume each year, but have never lost sight of our essential core values— relationships and trust.
Our roots go all the way back to America’s 1976 bicentennial when H. Keith Brunnemer, Jr. co-founded First Charlotte Corporation — a fixed income broker/dealer servicing the institutional marketplace. First Charlotte Corp thrived and was ultimately sold to J.C. Bradford & Co. in 1991. Then, after retiring from J.C. Bradford in 1994, Mr. Brunnemer was approached about starting a specialty broker/dealer that would focus on trading and selling odd lot corporate bonds to other dealers. Intrigued with the idea and hungry for a new challenge, he agreed to capitalize First Tryon Securities, LLC.
First Tryon has expanded over the years to include additional products and services and has established a large customer base of approximately 1,000 dealers and institutions. The most recent addition to the Firm’s business is First Tryon Advisors, an independent financial advisory practice servicing municipal and corporate clients.
Despite the growth of the Firm and the evolution of the marketplace, each customer is valued, whether large or small. Many of our customers have been with us since we first opened our doors and we are eager to continue establishing long term relationships built on trust and success. We welcome the opportunity to earn your business.
