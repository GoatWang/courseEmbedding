Atlas Copco Product Index | 8435 5140 10
Atlas Copco 8435 5140 10 Ext Inline Fixtured Nutrunner, 15-65 Ft LbsFixtured nutrunners from Atlas Copco are designated QST or ETX. Both are designed to combine durability and reliability with high performance. 1 million duty cycles with +/- 2.5% accuracy makes ETX one of the most reliable tools on the market. ETX nutrunners are compact and easy to integrate in fixtures or robots; both pilot and sandwich mount are possible. ETX nutrunners are precalibrated and tested before delivery. A built-in memory chip in the ETX stores calibration values and general tool service data. 
With the wide range of socket holder lengths, from 0-200 mm, the ETX can handle most screw lengths and still ensure positive contact between socket and bolt during the tightening process. The socket holder is spring loaded and allows travel as the bolt moves away from the spindle body during tightening. The ETX has 50 mm spring travel length as standard, but 76 and 100 mm can be provided upon request.
Features:

High reliability
Calibration value stored in spindle
Robust connector
