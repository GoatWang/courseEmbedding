Overview

God is with us and in us for the redemption of the world, the New Creation gathered into God’s life as it mirrors and participates in the glory of God’s love. With a Trinitarian approach firmly in view, this book maps John Wesley’s understanding of the connections and trajectories of God’s Triune love as it illuminates what is unique to each of Wesley’s salient doctrines of the Christian life.At a very early age, the Church of England began to form and shape John Wesley’s vision of God with its abiding faith and rich theological narrative that drank deeply from the Church catholic. Eventually, what emerged was a catholic spirit—the universal love of God—that connects all Christians to the Church and gives to them the necessary “means of grace” to participate in the “hope of glory.”What did John Wesley do to make his Christian Anglican heritage his own? Wesley assimilated the ‘Way’ of the “Primitive Christian Faith” into his own synthesis of the “Scripture Way of Salvation.” Moreover, Wesley would connect his “Scripture Way of Salvation” to God’s promise of “New Creation,” and then hold these two together with his doxological vision of a missional ecclesiology. “Methodist Connexionalism” was the Trinitarian lynch pin to hold his twin doctrines of soteriology and eschatology together.As “transcripts of the trinity,” gathered and scripted into the fellowship of God, the Church is now “connected’ by the Spirit in the fellowship of Triune love, and sent out into the world to participate in God’s mission to make all things new, rectifying all creation back into the glory of God. The soteriologic of God’s mission would be argued by Wesley in the following ‘way’: because God’s “name and nature is love,” to partake of God’s nature “is” to participate in God’s mission. And so, as we are gathered, scripted, and “filled with the energy of love”—God uses our energy, our love, to “connect” and rectify all creation back into the glory of God. By the Spirit’s gathering into the fellowship of the Triune God, the people of God are given the means of grace to participate in the “hope of glory,” in all of the “connections” here “on earth as in heaven.”

About John:
John received his training at Art Center College of Design and began his career as an illustrator. His paintings have appeared on movie posters, books, billboards, magazines and advertisements throughout the country and around the world.
Seeking an additional outlet for his creative vision, John began his Horse Series, bringing together equine beauty and power with emotions of the human spirit. When the publishers of Walter Farley's The Black Stallion saw John's work, they were inspired to re-issue this classic series, commissioning 24 new paintings by John for the covers.
"My artwork is meant to recall the beauty, majesty and mystery of the life we live, and the world we live it in. Painting the small delicacy of the light on a child¹s face, or the overwhelming power and grace of the sky at sunrise, is my attempt to capture some of that wonder. Through my work I hope to remind you and myself how truly wonderful, complex, and vivid life is. Whether we are looking into the eyes of someone we love, or struggling just to breath, life is a priceless gift."
John has maintained a successful painting career for nearly 20 years. His studio is in La Canada California, where he lived with his wife and two children. He received his art training at Art Center College of Design, and has worked with clients throughout the United States and around the world.

 Detailed Description

			           	           
						Welcome to John Deere Heaven � where all is mellow and even the cows are green and yellow. We first visited John Deere Heaven in All About John Deere Part 4, and people enjoyed the trip so much we decided to return and stay for an entire show.
 
See John Deere toys come alive in this fanciful, fast-paced mix of toy trains, tractors, and big machines. TM�s video magic will thrill and delight young and old alike. See O gauge and Standard gauge John Deere trains zip around elaborately detailed train layouts along with John Deere 1/16th, 1/50th and 1/64th scale tractors, cars, and trucks. Plus ten original songs by our favorite singer/songwriter James Coffey. Otto is in town and his little switch engine is blocking the mainline and  here comes the Circus Train! Oh no! 

If you love John Deere toys, music, and fun�buy this    
DVD. You�ll love it. 
Guaranteed.
45 minutes

Customer Reviews
"John Deere Heaven Part 1 is a DVD in which stop-motion animation makes beloved John Deere toys come alive. Ten original songs by singer and songwriter James Coffey spice up the elaborate miniature train layouts and interactions between exquisitely accurate replicas of machines. Young and old toy collectors alike are sure to enjoy watching 1/16, 1/50, and 1/64 scale tractors, cars, and trucks vroom about in this entertaining show, especially recommended for tractor lovers."
 Midwest Book Review

"The children really love this video if they love John Deere tractors. It also shows trains so it covers two areas boys adore."
Sarah Gerber

The screenplay was fairly good with two exceptions: (a) the sex scene in Ireland seemed out of character/unnecessary and (b) the relationship between Hilary Swank's grieving widow and Harry Connick's lovesick bartender really missed.  Gerard Butler turned in a solid performance (the occasional slip in his faux-Irish brogue didn't bother me too much) and Kathy Bates stole a couple of scenes, as you would expect.  Also good supporting turns by Gina Gershon, Lisa Kudrow and James Marsters.  Harry Connick, Jr. (who I normally like) had a purposefully unsympathetic role which was poorly written - I thought he was wasted in this film.  Incredible camera work for all the scenes filmed in Ireland.As others have noted, Hillary Swank can be great in certain vehicles, but totally miss in others.  This movie falls toward the later for me: she's not terrible, but I never empathized with her character (she comes across as spoiled and entitled here) and I could envision other actresses who would be more engaging in the role.At 2 hours, I thought the movie could have been more concise without sacrificing the story line... but that's what happens when the director is also the screenwriter.  All-in-all, I thought the movie was well crafted and IMDb's rating of 7.1/10 is spot on.Read more0Comment|

  Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuse5.0 out of 5 starsAn Unusual Role...ByPhilip Scholzon June 27, 2014Format: DVD|Verified PurchaseI don't recall too many, if any, romantic comedies on Hillary Swank's resume.  In fact, I don't recall too many comedies on her resume.  But, in a film where she doesn't die by the end, Swank shines as always as she plays a woman who, in the wake of her beloved husband's sudden death, must learn to pick up the pieces and move on in her life.  As I've said, Swank did as great as ever here and this change of genre was surprising but ultimately welcome.  Did anyone beside me see Phoebe from "Friends?  Yes, I know Lisa Kudrow was in the movie, but unfortunately, she's Phoebe.  So seeing her as a female version of Joey was just weird...and sometimes a bit forced.  But she and the rest of the cast were still pretty good throughout the film.  Even Harry Connick, Jr. showed some life here and there.  And Gerard Butler left us with a memorable performance as Swank's now-dead husband, making us miss him all the more.  My only wish is that we'd seen more of Kathy Bates on the grounds that she's just awesome.  My biggest praise goes for the ending as it did not go the way we all thought it would.  Oh, there were plenty of hints towards the ending every one of these movies moves towards, but there's a nice, and completely believable, twist at the end that leaves us with as much, if not a bit more, satisfaction as if a stereotypical ending had been chosen.  This is a fine film.  Enjoy.  P.S.:  I love you, film.Read more0Comment|

  Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuse5.0 out of 5 starsGreat movie to watch in bed with other half and tissues (do NOT wear eye make up lol it'll be everywhere)ByAlly Caton May 20, 2016Format: Amazon Video|Verified PurchaseHow do I love thee? Let me count the ways lol. I love how you meet Gerry and Holly in the beginning a real couple having a fight that a million couples (the one I'm in included) about if they are ready or not ready to have a baby and her fear because of her own father issuses (which I can also understand). But then when she loses him anyway it's heartbreaking and a part of me felt it was kind of mean like let the woman move on but he knew better then anyone what she would really need to move on. It sounds weird but she almost needed his permission and his guidence to move on. I also really liked Holly's best friends in the movie and how hard it can feel when it looks like everyone is moving on with their wonderful carefree lives and you're just depressed and not moving at all. It's really about not loving the man you were with anymore but loving him but know you need to move on and if the man you loved really loved you he wouldn't want you to just be a person who walks and talks like their alive but really are alive. Because if something happened to me and Joe stopped his life right then and there and just lived sad and alone for the rest of his life I'd be mad at him because he's amazing and while I might hate him with another girl I'd be a much happier dead person knowing he's with someone who he loves and who loves him back then is all alone. That is what loving someone means, wanting them to be happy even if it isn't with you. Thats what I took from this movie anyway. But best quote I've gotta say is Lisa Kudrow when Gina Gerswhen's husband says "this is why you can't get a guy." and Lisa's character let's him in on a BIG point in what it means to becoming equal to men in this world trust me.  Snuggle up with your man or your big strong dog or even your big handsome teddy bear, a box of tissues and make sure to take off your eye make up not actually just all make up so you don't have to wash your face 10 times and your pillow case is ruined lol.Read more0Comment|

Effective but unremarkable adaptation of ANNA KARENINA






                        15 January 2003 | by arneblaze

                              (Putney, VT)
                        – See all my reviews


 With a mix of modern dresses for the ladies and typical regimental outfits for the men, this adaptation of ANNA KARENINA is quite different from the novel and other film versions in a few ways.  After deserting her family for Vronsky, he does not tire of and desert her - he stays faithful - it is she who voluntarily gives him up to prevent his being thrown out of the Guards and thereby saves his name from disgrace - her suicide is to save him, rather than being an act of despair.Anna's completely "losing it" when his horse falls in a race - in front of society - is her downfall as it exposes their affair to the world, after which society must wreak its revenge.  Without this "flaw," things might have gone otherwise for her.   The finest scenes are between Garbo and Philippe de Lacy, who plays her son.  Their two scenes are so full of playful mother-son love as to prove to better than Garbo's scenes with Gilbert. Indeed, there is none of the passion or obsession here that the two displayed earlier that year in FLESH AND THE DEVIL.  de Lacy is a beautiful young actor and a "natural."  One of the annoying things about Vronsky is his inability to understand this love - he selfishly wants Anna all to himself - the cad!Garbo's farewell scene with Gilbert, she knowing she'll never see him again and he oblivious to this fact, is also quite well done.The TCM print is flawed by having a live audience reacting poorly on the soundtrack, although the newly commissioned score by Arnold Brostoff is quite fine.  This soundtrack addition occurred in 1994 and seems the only one accompanying prints of the film currently.  There is a beautifully photographed waltz with Garbo and Gilbert - oft seen in compilations and reminiscent of his waltz scenes with Mae Murray in THE MERRY WIDOW.All in all, worth catching for Garbo, but the two later remakes of the work are much better.

Drama




                        Here is a play about commitment and responsibility in love. Jack, an aspiring actor is serious about his career but not about his girlfriend Martha, an aspiring dancer. They drift along on a cloud of good times until Martha gets pregnant. By the time Jack realizes he wants to make an emotional commitment to Martha and their child, she has had the baby and put it up for adoption. Martha becomes a self sufficient contemporary woman; it is Jack who will hurt forever from the pain of eternal separation from his child.
