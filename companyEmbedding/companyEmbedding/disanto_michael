Our main service is providing  Illinois attorney referrals and legal guidance.  In addition to our personalized referrals, Illinoislawyers.com also provides a directory of almost all licensed attorneys in Illinois. The list, which we update daily, includes attorneys who are licensed in Illinois and who are physically in Illinois. The list does not include attorneys who have let their registration lapse or those who are out of state.
You can search by an attorney's first or last name, the name of a law firm, or their city. Each listing should include an attorney's name and the name of their firm, along with their address, phone number, fax number, e-mail address, website, and the year they were admitted to practice in Illinois. We also try to include, based on our research, the area of law in which the attorney practices.
The list is a good way to get the contact information for an Illinois attorney or law firm. We want to be clear that this list is completely different and separate from our attorney referral list. The network of attorneys we have created for referrals is a specific list of the Illinois attorneys we know and trust. Our network is made up of attorneys we would hire ourselves if we needed a lawyer. Basically, we have handpicked the attorneys we recommend to you.
If you have any questions related to this list, please do not hesitate to contact us.
Attorney Finder:
There are two ways to find contact information for Illinois lawyers:

Start typing the last name and click on the attorney when you find the one you are looking for.
