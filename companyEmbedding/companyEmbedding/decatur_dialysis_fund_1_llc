EarlyIQ will then take you through a brief process to confirm your accreditation status. This will involve uploading one or more documents. Though you can complete this process in a matter of minutes, you can also save your responses and return later to complete as needed. If you would like more details on exactly what to expect from the process and how EarlyIQ keeps your information confidential and secure, click here.
