For the fifth consecutive year, Beer Institute (BI) and its members are proud to highlight the federal governments We Dont Serve Teens program that provides parents and other adults with tools they need to help reduce teen drinking.  BI and its members share the governments concern over research indicating that most teens who drink get alcohol from parents and other adults.  BI and its members fully support the program's message that serving alcohol to teens is unsafe, illegal, and irresponsible.
 

The Federal Trade Commission, as part of this consumer awareness effort, has chosen to focus on this important message during the month of September, when schools around the country are back in session for a new year.  Beer Institute and its member companies are supporting the We Dont Serve Teens campaign in a variety of ways  such as highlighting it on their Web sites, securing outdoor, print and radio advertising and focusing on getting this important message out to the public in their corporate hometowns  all with goal of reducing underage drinking.    
  
  
These efforts remind adults that most underage drinkers get alcohol from family members or other adults and if teens cant get alcohol, they cant drink it.  In addition, there are specific calls to action: dont buy or provide alcohol to underage persons; talk to your kids about teen drinking; and visit DontServeTeens.gov for more information.

The Pacifico Brewery, located in beautiful Mazatlán, Mexico was founded in 1900 by German settlers and was acquired by Grupo Modelo in 1954. Its unique packaging and distinctive taste made Pacifico a popular choice with American surfers who brought it into the U.S., and in 1985 Grupo Modelo began exporting Pacifico to the United States. 

Pacifico achieved an important milestone in 2013 selling more than 6 million cases annually.

Pacifico appeals to consumers coast to coast who live life as a journey and a collection of adventures and experiences. Pacifico's ties to the more rugged, off-the-beaten-path part of Mexico helps them discover that adventure is where you find it.

Pacifico is made with filtered water, malted barley, hops, corn and yeast.  Its clean and hearty flavor makes Pacifico an exceptionally drinkable lager thats compatible with all types of food, especially seafood.

The largest and most prestigious brewery in China, the Tsingtao Brewery was founded in 1903 by German settlers in Qingdao. The brand is sold in more than 60 countries worldwide. Tsingtao is the #1 branded consumer product exported from China.

Introduced to the United States in 1972, Tsingtao soon became the top-selling Chinese beer in the U.S. market and has maintained this leadership position ever since.


 Tsingtao Lager is the top-selling Chinese beer in the U.S., and is  sold in more than 95% of Chinese restaurants. It is one of the few branded products from China that is recognized worldwide. Tsingtao Lager is brewed with domestically-grown hops, imported barley,   all-natural yeast and spring water from China's Laoshan Mountains.

Tsingtao Lager is made with spring water, malted barley, hops, rice and yeast.  Tsingtao Lager is an amber-colored, pilsner-style beer delivering a crisp, slightly malty flavor and a nutty sweet taste.  Its refreshing flavor profile complements spicy or flavorful Asian cuisine.  Tsingtao Lager is an authentic Asian beer that transforms any meal into a cultural experience. Tsingtao Lager exemplifies Asian cool--the fusion of traditional Chinese heritage and modern Western culture.
