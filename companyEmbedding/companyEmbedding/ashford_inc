That community is Ashford University where you can earn your degree at home or abroad. Military advisors will support you while you earn your Associate's, Bachelor's, or Master's degree. 
You may be eligible for the Ashford Military Grant, which reduces tuition for all undergraduate courses to $250 per credit. In addition, this grant also covers Sales Tax, Technology Fees, and all required material when ordering through the Ashford bookstore with free standard shipping.

MONTGOMERY GI BILL ®

The updated GI Bill (Chapter 33) or “Post-9/11 GI Bill,” boasts the most comprehensive education benefits package since the original GI Bill was signed into law in 1944. This benefit went into effect August 1, 2009. If you are eligible for the Post-9/11 GI Bill and other GI Bill benefits such as the Montgomery GI Bill (MGIB) you will at some point be required to make an irrevocable choice of which benefit you wish to receive.
There are many things to consider before you choose which benefit you wish to receive and whether or not to participate in the Active Duty or Reserve GI Bill programs. Consider these important factors when making your choice: your preferred type of training and the amount of benefits you will get under each benefit.
Please note that even if you are an Ashford military student using tuition assistance benefits, this legislation will negatively impact you upon separation or retirement, as it does not take into account the 64% of the active duty force who currently prefer to study online. Ashford University encourages everyone currently under Chapter 30 benefits to carefully compare and choose before switching to Chapter 33.
GI Bill® is a registered trademark of the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). More information about education benefits offered by VA is available at the official U.S. government Web site at http://www.benefits.va.gov/gibill.

YELLOW RIBBON PROGRAM

Ashford University is a proud participant in the Yellow Ribbon Program. The Yellow Ribbon program is a voluntary agreement between Veterans Affairs and the University that allows eligible students (current and newly admitted) to have 100% tuition covered. The Yellow Ribbon benefits include a 50/50 grant between Veterans Affairs and the University to cover any tuition and required fee charges. The grant will be applied after Post-9/11 GI Bill® funds, equaling 100% tuition coverage for you. The grant is applicable only during the University's participation in the Yellow Ribbon Program.
Grant terms and coverage amounts are subject to change every academic year.

Tuition grants will be applied for courses with future start dates following full authorization status from the US Department of Veterans Affairs. Continuing Yellow Ribbon students will have course materials covered. Any applicable fees not covered by this grant must be paid in accordance with the terms of the selected finance option(s) as stated in the student's enrollment agreement.

Who is Eligible?
    Only individuals entitled to the maximum Post-9/11 GI Bill benefit rate (based on service requirements) are eligible for Yellow Ribbon funding. Therefore, you may be eligible if:

You served an aggregate period of active duty after September 10, 2001 of at least 36 months;
You were honorably discharged from active duty for a service-connected disability and you served 30 continuous days after September 10, 2001; and
You are a dependent eligible for Transfer of Entitlement under the Post-9/11 GI Bill based on a veteran's service under the eligibility criteria listed above.

To qualify for the Yellow Ribbon program, you must:

Have served 36 months on active duty in the United States military after September 10, 2001 thus making you 100% eligible for the Post-9/11 GI Bill.
Submit an application for the Post-9/11 GI Bill to the Department of Veterans Affairs online at www.va.gov and provide a Certificate of Eligibility (COE) to your Admissions Counselor.
Obtain admission to Ashford University.
Remain enrolled or return as scheduled from an approved break. Should you lose eligibility for not maintaining continuous enrollment, any future grant benefit(s) will be forfeited. Online students must remain enrolled without breaks in attendance greater than 14 days. If you plan to take a break in attendance that is greater than 14 days from your last date of attendance but less than 45 days from the end of the course you last attended, then you must provide a written confirmation of your intent to return. Providing this documentation will ensure that you are not administratively withdrawn or forfeit grant benefits, provided you return as scheduled. Written confirmations must be provided via the Break Request form (found in the Student Portal) within 14 days of the last date of attendance.

GI Bill® is a registered trademark of the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). More information about education benefits offered by VA is available at the official U.S. government Web site at http://www.benefits.va.gov/gibill.

MILITARY TUITION ASSISTANCE

You can trust Ashford University to provide military-friendly service at all levels and aid you with military tuition assistance. To start, you work with a specialized division of Ashford University that focuses on the educational needs of the military community. 
All books required for your program of study and purchased through Ashford University’s textbook partner will be covered, including shipping costs, by Ashford University.
To determine your benefit status, contact a benefits counselor at the Department of Veterans Affairs at 1.888.GIBILL.1 (1.888.442.4551) or visit www.gibill.va.gov. Once your benefit status has been determined, speak to an Ashford University Miilitary Admissions Counselor to learn how your benefits can best be applied to your education at Ashford University. You have earned these benefits, so be sure you use them. You’ll find the process quick, easy and informative.

MILITARY SPOUSES, DEPENDENTS, AND SURVIVORS

As the spouse, dependent, or survivor of a member of the military community, you may be eligible for benefits as well, including the Montgomery GI Bill®, the Yellow Ribbon Program, and Ashford University military benefits. Ashford recognizes the important role military spouses and military dependents play in the success of our country, and we want to help you use the education benefits for which you are eligible.

GUIDING PRINCIPLES
Ashford embraces five guiding principles which we believe best describe what our company stands for: ethical, innovative, profitable, engaging and tenacious.

 
Our guiding principles are more than just a catchy phrase or slogan, they are a way of doing business. Our adherence to these standards is a key component in building a reputation of excellence and integrity.

 
PHILANTHROPIC SPIRIT
One of our Five Guiding Principles is to be Engaging. The focus of this principle is for AINC to be an active partner and contributor to our surrounding community and to positively support organizations that assist those less fortunate.

 
Our major company-wide philanthropic events are our Community Service Day (Spring) and Holiday Events Participation (Winter). In addition, throughout the year, we encourage associates to be mindful of community contributions and we financially support many charitable causes in our markets.

 
COMMUNITY SERVICE DAY
SUPPORTED 3 ORGANIZATIONS
Habitat For Humanity
Job Corps
S.M. Wright Foundation
 
HOLIDAY EVENTS
Salvation Army Day
S.M. Wright's Christmas in the Park.
Ashford-hosted Angel Tree - providing gifts for angels in need.
 
CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY PHILOSOPHY
When evaluating opportunities for partnership and contribution we review the mission statements and financial distribution strategy of the charity. Our preferred partnerships are with organizations that focus on assisting individuals to be able to live independently. We believe the best organizations are driven by the adage, "Give a man a fish and you feed him for a day. Teach a man to fish and you feed him for a lifetime."

Ashford Formula from Curecrete Distribution Inc.Product OverviewIn 2009, Curecrete Distribution, Inc., celebrated an important and unprecedented milestone in the concrete densification industry - 60 years and over 3 billion square feet of Ashford Formula.
Product Description, Applications 
Ashford Formula, a leader in concrete densification since 1949, is a transparent, chemically reactive, water-based sealer that penetrates concrete and masonry building materials, permanently protecting, preserving and strengthening them.
Curing—Ashford Formula controls hairline checking and temperature cracking on new concrete. When applied to properly placed, structurally sound freshly finished concrete, Ashford Formula will uniformly cure the concrete through a combined chemical/moisture retention reaction so vital to the complete hydration process
Sealing—Ashford Formula penetrates deep into the concrete, forming a chemical re-action that locks the pores from within, providing a deep permanent seal on all types of concrete surfaces
Hardening—Ashford Formula solidifies the component parts of the concrete into one solid mass, increasing the density, toughness, hardness and substantially increasing the abrasion resistance and durability of the concrete surface. Smooth steel troweled surfaces develop a marble-like finish and sheen. Ashford Formula treated concrete has been compressively tested 38% harder after 30 days than fully cured, untreated concrete
Dustproofing—Ashford Formula chemically reacts with the salts in the concrete, per-manently eliminating the release of concrete dust through the surface pores
Neutralizing Alkali - As the Ashford Formula progressively penetrates the concrete, it 
neutralizes the alkalis, forcing them to the surface where they can be washed away during the application. The deep alkalis are locked in, and efflorescence and the leaching of lime and alkalis stop
Bonding—Ashford Formula prepares the treated surface for paints, caulking compounds, adhesives and floor coverings by eliminating the surface concrete salts that are so detrimental to proper bonding. Ashford Formula contains no silicone and is coatable and compatible with any type of covering when standard surface preparation guidelines are followed
With one application of Ashford Formula, concrete or other masonry is cured and permanently sealed for its lifetime and is rendered highly resistant to oils, greases and other surface contaminants. The component parts of the concrete are solidified into a solid mass that toughens, hardens and increases the density. Surface alkalis are neutralized, and efflorescence and the leaching of lime and alkalis are stopped. 
Applications for Ashford Formula include warehouses, distribution facilities, aviation hangars, manufacturing plants, food processing and distribution buildings, pulp and paper mills or other types of facilities with large exposed concrete floors.

DALLAS, Sept. 18, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- 
Transaction Highlights:

Transaction values Remington at an estimated EBITDA multiple of 9.4x 
916,500 shares of subsidiary nonvoting common stock issued at $100 per share, a premium of 54% to the current market price of Ashford common stock 
$230 million of subsidiary participating convertible preferred stock convertible at $120 per share, a premium of 85% to the current market price of Ashford common stock 
Large transformational acquisition with only $625,000 to be paid in cash each quarter for four years 
Enhances strong alignment of management with the interests of shareholders through issuance of non-voting common equity and convertible preferred equity in subsidiary 
Sellers' and management voting interests in Ashford does not increase 
Transaction rapidly builds operating scale and increased earnings power 
Transaction is expected to be immediately accretive to normalized adjusted net income per share 
Clarification that incremental EBITDA to Ashford from Remington will not be included in the termination fee calculation under the advisory agreements with Ashford Trust and Ashford Prime 
Combination creates the only public, pure-play provider of asset and property management services to the lodging industry 
Ashford Inc. (NYSE MKT: AINC) ("Ashford" or the "Company") today announced that it has entered into a definitive agreement for a business combination with Remington Holdings, LP ("Remington"). The transaction is expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2016, and is subject to receiving an acceptable private letter ruling from the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (the "IRS"), the Company's stockholders' approval, receipt of certain tax opinions, satisfaction of other tax related conditions, and other customary closing conditions.  
Remington is a premier hotel property and project management company with over 40 years of experience in the lodging industry, with a proven track record of outperforming other hotel property managers at its managed REITs. It currently operates 93 hotels in 28 states with almost 18,000 hotel rooms and approximately 8,000 associates. Current brand operations include: Marriott, Renaissance, Residence Inn, Courtyard, Fairfield Inn, SpringHill Suites, Sheraton, Westin, Crowne Plaza, Hilton, Embassy Suites, Hyatt, Hampton Inn, Hilton Garden Inn, and Homewood Suites. In addition to branded hotels, Remington also operates several independent hotels and The Gallery™, Remington's collection of independent luxury resort hotels. During 2015, Remington has added a net of 14 hotels to its property management portfolio reflecting growth of approximately 18% over 2014.  
"We are extremely pleased with this opportunity to combine Remington's proven expertise in improving RevPAR penetration and bottom-line asset performance with Ashford's capabilities in investing and asset managing lodging real estate," said Monty J. Bennett, Ashford's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. "This combination we believe will complement our asset management platform well and has great growth prospects." 
The transaction is being structured as a Section 351 tax-free exchange for federal income tax purposes. Ashford is creating a new subsidiary structure that will acquire an 80% stake in Remington and all of Ashford's existing business. The Remington sellers will retain a 20% interest in Remington. Approximately 3% of the consideration delivered to the Remington sellers, or $10 million, will be paid in cash in equal quarterly installments of $625,000. Ashford's new subsidiary will issue $230 million of participating convertible preferred securities with a dividend rate of 6.625% with a conversion premium 85% above yesterday's Ashford common stock price and  916,500 shares of its nonvoting common stock (assuming a $100 stock price – 54% above yesterday's Ashford common stock price) to the Remington sellers. Ashford will retain 100% of the subsidiary's voting common stock. The subsidiary preferred and common stock and the retained 20% interest in Remington will be subject to certain put, call and/or conversion rights. The subsidiary common stock is intended to be economically equivalent to Ashford's common stock. The transaction is expected to be immediately accretive to Ashford's normalized adjusted net income per share. Also, as part of the transaction, the Company and its managed REITs entered into letter agreements that stipulate that the incremental EBITDA to the Company from the combination with Remington will not be included in the termination fee calculation under the advisory agreements.
Mr. Bennett added, "Our initiatives with forming the Ashford group of companies the past few years have positioned us well for this opportunity. With the rapid growth in operating scale and immediate incremental earnings this acquisition provides, this will be a transformational transaction for Ashford with little cash consideration. The transaction is also being completed at an estimated forward EBITDA multiple similar to where recent comparable transactions have been completed. We will continue to look for opportunities to install Remington as the property manager at the hotels owned by our managed REITs as Remington has a long, demonstrated track record of outperforming other property managers and driving revenue and EBITDA growth at the hotels it manages. Through that growth, this strategic transaction should deliver substantial long-term value to our shareholders."
Remington is currently owned by Monty J. Bennett and Archie Bennett, Jr., the Company's CEO and his father. The Company's Board of Directors, therefore, formed a special committee of independent and disinterested directors to analyze and negotiate the transaction. The transaction is subject to approval by Ashford stockholders, regulatory approvals, the issuance by the IRS of a private letter ruling relating to Remington's qualification as an eligible independent contractor under IRC Sec. 856(d)(9)(A), receipt of certain tax opinions, satisfaction of other tax related conditions, and other  customary closing conditions. 
Ashford's special committee was advised by BMO Capital Markets Corp. as financial advisor, and Norton Rose Fulbright US LLP acted as its legal advisor.  Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. acted as Remington's financial advisor, and Baker Botts L.L.P. acted as Remington's legal advisor. 
Investor Conference Call
Ashford will conduct a conference call at 11:00 a.m. ET on Friday, September 18, 2015, to discuss the transaction. The number to call for this teleconference is 719-325-2354. A replay of the conference call will be available through Friday, September 25, 2015, by dialing 719-457-0820 and entering the confirmation number, 7966967.

MONTGOMERY GI BILL ®

The updated GI Bill (Chapter 33) or “Post-9/11 GI Bill,” boasts the most comprehensive education benefits package since the original GI Bill was signed into law in 1944. This benefit went into effect August 1, 2009. If you are eligible for the Post-9/11 GI Bill and other GI Bill benefits such as the Montgomery GI Bill (MGIB) you will at some point be required to make an irrevocable choice of which benefit you wish to receive.
There are many things to consider before you choose which benefit you wish to receive and whether or not to participate in the Active Duty or Reserve GI Bill programs. Consider these important factors when making your choice: your preferred type of training and the amount of benefits you will get under each benefit.
Please note that even if you are an Ashford military student using tuition assistance benefits, this legislation will negatively impact you upon separation or retirement, as it does not take into account the 64% of the active duty force who currently prefer to study online. Ashford University encourages everyone currently under Chapter 30 benefits to carefully compare and choose before switching to Chapter 33.
GI Bill® is a registered trademark of the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). More information about education benefits offered by VA is available at the official U.S. government Web site at http://www.benefits.va.gov/gibill.

YELLOW RIBBON PROGRAM

Ashford University is a proud participant in the Yellow Ribbon Program. The Yellow Ribbon program is a voluntary agreement between Veterans Affairs and the University that allows eligible students (current and newly admitted) to have 100% tuition covered. The Yellow Ribbon benefits include a 50/50 grant between Veterans Affairs and the University to cover any tuition and required fee charges. The grant will be applied after Post-9/11 GI Bill® funds, equaling 100% tuition coverage for you. The grant is applicable only during the University's participation in the Yellow Ribbon Program.
Grant terms and coverage amounts are subject to change every academic year.

Tuition grants will be applied for courses with future start dates following full authorization status from the US Department of Veterans Affairs. Continuing Yellow Ribbon students will have course materials covered. Any applicable fees not covered by this grant must be paid in accordance with the terms of the selected finance option(s) as stated in the student's enrollment agreement.

Who is Eligible?
    Only individuals entitled to the maximum Post-9/11 GI Bill benefit rate (based on service requirements) are eligible for Yellow Ribbon funding. Therefore, you may be eligible if:

You served an aggregate period of active duty after September 10, 2001 of at least 36 months;
You were honorably discharged from active duty for a service-connected disability and you served 30 continuous days after September 10, 2001; and
You are a dependent eligible for Transfer of Entitlement under the Post-9/11 GI Bill based on a veteran's service under the eligibility criteria listed above.

To qualify for the Yellow Ribbon program, you must:

Have served 36 months on active duty in the United States military after September 10, 2001 thus making you 100% eligible for the Post-9/11 GI Bill.
Submit an application for the Post-9/11 GI Bill to the Department of Veterans Affairs online at www.va.gov and provide a Certificate of Eligibility (COE) to your Admissions Counselor.
Obtain admission to Ashford University.
Remain enrolled or return as scheduled from an approved break. Should you lose eligibility for not maintaining continuous enrollment, any future grant benefit(s) will be forfeited. Online students must remain enrolled without breaks in attendance greater than 14 days. If you plan to take a break in attendance that is greater than 14 days from your last date of attendance but less than 45 days from the end of the course you last attended, then you must provide a written confirmation of your intent to return. Providing this documentation will ensure that you are not administratively withdrawn or forfeit grant benefits, provided you return as scheduled. Written confirmations must be provided via the Break Request form (found in the Student Portal) within 14 days of the last date of attendance.

MILITARY SPOUSES, DEPENDENTS, AND SURVIVORS

As the spouse, dependent, or survivor of a member of the military community, you may be eligible for benefits as well, including the Montgomery GI Bill®, the Yellow Ribbon Program, and Ashford University military benefits. Ashford recognizes the important role military spouses and military dependents play in the success of our country, and we want to help you use the education benefits for which you are eligible.
