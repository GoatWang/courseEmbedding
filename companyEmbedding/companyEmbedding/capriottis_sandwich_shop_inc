Meet franchisee, James Gimbel
“What intrigued me the most about Capriotti’s was the simplicity of the concept and the ability to grow it quickly. The quality of the food and unique menu options make for a phenomenal sandwich that almost no other brand can come close to. I love interacting with our customers. 
Our customers love Capriotti’s because they know that their subs are being made fresh to order, using the freshest homemade ingredients, right in front of their eyes.  It is a special opportunity for the employees and management to interact with our customers.”

About Capriotti's Sandwich Shop Inc.
In 1976, Lois and Alan Margolet opened a sandwich shop in Wilmington, Delaware, naming it after their grandfather, Philip Capriotti.

In 2008, they sold the company to an investment group led by Ashley Morris, who had been a Las Vegas area Capriotti's franchisee since 2004.

Small Business Snapshot: Capriotti's Sandwich Shop


                        By Ashley Morris, CEO of Capriotti's
 May 29, 2017 08:30 am EST

Our Small Business Snapshot series features photos that represent, in just one image, what the small businesses we feature are all about. Ashley Morris, CEO of Capriotti's Sandwich Shop, Inc., explains how this image represents his business.
Founded in 1976, Capriotti's is an award-winning sandwich shop that remains true to their 40-year tradition of slow-roasting whole, all natural turkeys in-house every day for their signature subs. The concept originated in Delaware by 28-year-old Lois Margolet and her brother. Together, they sought to create a sandwich for "real turkey lovers" – and began roasting whole fresh turkeys overnight.
This concept sets them apart from their competition. People loved their sandwiches from the start, and word spread about their fresh roasted turkey, quality meats and cheeses, fresh rolls and produce. They serve a variety of classic flavors, but their signature item is a Bobbie sandwich, which is made with slow-roasted turkey, cranberry sauce, homemade stuffing and a hint of mayonnaise on a freshly baked roll.
This photo of the original location in Little Italy in Wilmington, Delaware is a perfect representation of the Capriotti's brand for two reasons. First, the success of the brand stems from the success seen in the early days back in Little Italy. Sandwich shops were abundant in that area; but Margolet had a dream of creating something unique –something so undeniably good that would stand apart from the rest. Her idea met success because of its difference in approach, and it is something that still resonates with consumers today.
Secondly, the photo represents the family origins of Capriotti's. The shop began as a boarded-up building beneath Margolet's apartment and was named after their grandfather, Philip Capriotti, who loved to cook.
When I took over the brand, it was always my goal to maintain that family feel. My association with Capriotti's first began in 1999 when I fell in love at first bite (my absolute favorite being the chicken cheesesteak). I broke a lease to live closer to one of the locations, and then eventually went on to buy my first location, then three, then the whole franchise! I put my 10 plus years of experience in the finance industry to good use and officially joined as Chief Executive Officer in 2008.
One of the biggest challenge Capriotti's faces is access to great real estate. With the economy continuing to grow, there are many new businesses that are competing for the same limited real estate. And as far as where the brand is headed, we're continuing to focus on national growth.
In January 2017, we added David Bloom to the company as our Chief Development Officer. Bringing more than 25 years of franchise experience, we knew he'd be the perfect person to help elevate Capriotti's to the next level. Currently we receive 50 to 60 inquiries weekly from prospective franchisees, and are slated to open 15 new shops in 2017, 30 in 2018 and 60 the following year – exponentially growing to a 500-location projection by 2022.

History[edit]
Capriotti's was founded in Wilmington, Delaware in 1976.[3][4][7] The restaurant is named after the founders' grandfather, Philip Capriotti.[3][8] In 1988, the second restaurant location opened in New Castle, Delaware. In 1991, Capriotti's began franchising their restaurants.[9]
In 1993, the first restaurant location in Las Vegas, Nevada was opened on Sahara Avenue, near Las Vegas Boulevard.[10] In 2004, Ashley Morris and Jason Smylie opened a franchise in Las Vegas. At the time, Morris was the youngest financial adviser at Wells Fargo.[10][11][12][13] Smylie was a software engineer at Bechtel Nevada. Morris and Smylie were also investors in the housing market and made the decision to invest in a franchise after learning that the return on investment was higher than anything they were looking at investing in.[13] In 2007, Morris and Smylie put the company in escrow. In the following year Morris, Smylie and a group of investors consisting of 95% Las Vegans bought Capriotti's. Capriotti's had 44 restaurant locations by the end of 2008.[12] Morris is the CEO of the company.[12][13][14][15] In 2008 and 2009 the chain was the official sandwich sponsor of the World Series of Poker in Las Vegas.[16][17] Capriotti's was ranked in Entrepreneur magazine's top 500 franchise list in 2010 and remained ranked through 2014.[12]
Capriotti's starred on Food Network's Unwrapped in December 2011.[18][19] In November 2013, Capriotti's expanded its presence on the East Coast by opening its first location in Washington DC.[20][21] Joe Biden was the first customer served at the store's grand opening.[21][22][23] That year, Capriotti's brought in over $58 million in revenue and experienced a 48% growth over the previous three years.[24] In 2014, the company was named one of the "Top 10 Best Food Franchises for Your Buck" and one of "America's Best Franchises" by Forbes magazine.[25][26]
The Sandelman & Associates Quick Track Study on the Top 10 Quick Service Restaurant Concepts ranked Capriotti's among the top ten in overall satisfaction[27] and won the award for highest quality and taste in the 2014 study.[28]
Business Operations[edit]
Capriotti's is based in Las Vegas, Nevada and has its largest concentration of shops there. The restaurant chain has 106 locations in 17 states including: Arizona, California, Delaware, Florida, Illinois, Iowa, Maryland, Massachusetts, Nebraska, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Texas, Utah, Washington State, Wisconsin and Washington D.C.[5][6][29] In 2014, it ranked #293 in Entrepreneur's Franchise 500. In 2016, Capriotti's was ranked #264 in Entrepreneur's Franchise 500.[30]
Products[edit]
Capriotti's specializes in cold, grilled, and vegetarian submarine sandwiches.[6] Each restaurant roasts whole turkeys for 12 hours nightly, hand pulls meats, and makes their own meatballs and coleslaw.[5][7][9]
In November 2009, the Bobbie, one of Capriotti's signature sandwiches was voted "The Greatest Sandwich in America" by AOL.com.[31][32] The sandwich is made with pulled turkey, cranberry sauce, stuffing and mayonnaise.[31] The Margolets named it after their aunt.[33] In 2012, USA Today named Capriotti's one of the "10 Great Places for a Surprising Sandwich."[34]
Technology[edit]
Capriotti has utilized Google Glass to re-film employee training videos in a first person view.[35] Management trainees also wear Google Glass during rush hour periods and review the footage for constructive visual feedback.[35][36] Capriotti's uses an app-based loyalty program.[37]

History[edit]
Capriotti's was founded in Wilmington, Delaware in 1976.[3][4][7] The restaurant is named after the founders' grandfather, Philip Capriotti.[3][8] In 1988, the second restaurant location opened in New Castle, Delaware. In 1991, Capriotti's began franchising their restaurants.[9]
In 1993, the first restaurant location in Las Vegas, Nevada was opened on Sahara Avenue, near Las Vegas Boulevard.[10] In 2004, Ashley Morris and Jason Smylie opened a franchise in Las Vegas. At the time, Morris was the youngest financial adviser at Wells Fargo.[10][11][12][13] Smylie was a software engineer at Bechtel Nevada. Morris and Smylie were also investors in the housing market and made the decision to invest in a franchise after learning that the return on investment was higher than anything they were looking at investing in.[13] In 2007, Morris and Smylie put the company in escrow. In the following year Morris, Smylie and a group of investors consisting of 95% Las Vegans bought Capriotti's. Capriotti's had 44 restaurant locations by the end of 2008.[12] Morris is the CEO of the company.[12][13][14][15] In 2008 and 2009 the chain was the official sandwich sponsor of the World Series of Poker in Las Vegas.[16][17] Capriotti's was ranked in Entrepreneur magazine's top 500 franchise list in 2010 and remained ranked through 2014.[12]

The Sandelman & Associates Quick Track Study on the Top 10 Quick Service Restaurant Concepts ranked Capriotti's among the top ten in overall satisfaction[27] and won the award for highest quality and taste in the 2014 study.[28]
