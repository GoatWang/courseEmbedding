Thomas P. Chambers Joins Kosmos As Chief Financial Officer






Business Wire




Oct 16, 2014 6:00 PM EDT













 




























































  Kosmos Energy Ltd. (“Kosmos”) (NYSE: KOS) announced today that Thomas P. Chambers will join the company as senior vice president and chief financial officer effective November 5, 2014. Greg Dunlevy, who has served as executive vice president and chief financial officer since 2003, will retire from the company at the end of June 2015 as part of a mutually agreed succession plan. Mr. Dunlevy will serve in an advisory role to the chairman and chief executive officer until his retirement to ensure a smooth transition.  Mr. Chambers, 59, has extensive executive experience in the international exploration and production industry. He joins Kosmos most recently from Apache Corporation, where he was executive vice president and chief financial officer from November 2010 to February 2014.  “Tom brings significant corporate finance and industry experience to Kosmos, and is an excellent addition to our senior leadership team. He joins Kosmos at a time of financial strength, with the company capable of self-funding its world-class exploration program, as well as its on-going development projects in Ghana,” said Andrew G. Inglis, Kosmos’ chairman and chief executive officer. “We are pleased to welcome Tom to Kosmos.”  During his nearly 20 years at Apache, Mr. Chambers held a variety of leadership roles in finance, corporate planning, and investor relations. Prior to joining Apache, he served in the international business development group at Pennzoil Exploration and Production Company, and held a range of management positions with the BP plc group of companies. Mr. Chambers earned his bachelor’s degree in chemical engineering from University of Notre Dame. He is a member of the Society of Petroleum Engineers.

Thomas P. Chambers Joins Kosmos as Chief Financial Officer | Business Wire
























































Thomas P. Chambers Joins Kosmos as Chief Financial Officer




Greg Dunlevy to Retire as Part of Planned Succession






October 16, 2014 06:00 PM Eastern Daylight Time



DALLAS--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Kosmos Energy Ltd. (“Kosmos”) (NYSE: KOS) announced today that Thomas P. 
      Chambers will join the company as senior vice president and chief 
      financial officer effective November 5, 2014. Greg Dunlevy, who has 
      served as executive vice president and chief financial officer since 
      2003, will retire from the company at the end of June 2015 as part of a 
      mutually agreed succession plan. Mr. Dunlevy will serve in an advisory 
      role to the chairman and chief executive officer until his retirement to 
      ensure a smooth transition.
    


      Mr. Chambers, 59, has extensive executive experience in the 
      international exploration and production industry. He joins Kosmos most 
      recently from Apache Corporation, where he was executive vice president 
      and chief financial officer from November 2010 to February 2014.
    

      “Tom brings significant corporate finance and industry experience to 
      Kosmos, and is an excellent addition to our senior leadership team. He 
      joins Kosmos at a time of financial strength, with the company capable 
      of self-funding its world-class exploration program, as well as its 
      on-going development projects in Ghana,” said Andrew G. Inglis, Kosmos’ 
      chairman and chief executive officer. “We are pleased to welcome Tom to 
      Kosmos.”
    

      During his nearly 20 years at Apache, Mr. Chambers held a variety of 
      leadership roles in finance, corporate planning, and investor relations. 
      Prior to joining Apache, he served in the international business 
      development group at Pennzoil Exploration and Production Company, and 
      held a range of management positions with the BP plc group of companies. 
      Mr. Chambers earned his bachelor’s degree in chemical engineering from 
      University of Notre Dame. He is a member of the Society of Petroleum 
      Engineers.
    

      Commenting on his new position, Mr. Chambers said, “With Kosmos 
      preparing to test four potentially play-opening prospects over the next 
      18 months, this is an exciting time to join the company. I look forward 
      to working with the Kosmos team to continue creating value for 
      shareholders.”
    

      Mr. Inglis praised the significant and lasting contributions of Mr. 
      Dunlevy, an original founder of Kosmos. “Greg has been an exceptional 
      leader during his more than ten years at Kosmos, responsible for 
      securing start-up capital during the early days, growth capital 
      following the Jubilee discovery, and ultimately leading the company 
      through a successful initial public offering. From the beginning, Greg 
      has been an important member of the senior leadership team. He has 
      played a key role in building Kosmos into a self-funded explorer and we 
      are grateful for his immense contribution to the business.”
