We will apply the proceeds from the Offering to pay for accounting, legal and
professional fees associated with this Offering. Total estimated costs of this
Offering ($28,000) are less than the maximum amount of Offering proceeds
($60,000) providing us with approximately $32,000 in working capital. Total
estimated costs of the Offering, which principally relates to professional
costs, are expected to consist of the following:

          SEC Registration fee                              $      6.97
          NASD filing fee                                        100.00
          Accounting fees and expenses                         7,000.00
          Transfer agent fees                                  1,500.00
          Blue sky fees and expenses                           2,500.00
          Miscellaneous expenses                               1,893.03
          Legal fees and expenses(relating to the             
          preparation of our registration statement from      
          inception to effective date and related             
          documents)                                          15,000.00
          Total                                             $ 28,000.00

As funds are obtained from the sale of shares, offering costs will be paid in
the sequence listed in the table regardless of the amount of dollars collected.
If all of the registered shares are sold, all costs will be paid for in full
including legal fees which currently amount to $15,000. From the maximum
Offering proceeds received we will pay all expenses associated with this
Offering which include SEC registration fee, NASD filing fee, accounting and
auditing fees, transfer agent fees, blue sky fees, and other expenses which are
estimated to be $13,000, leaving approximately $32,000 of cash on hand for
general operating expenses.

Upon beginning our Form S-1 process, we paid our legal counsel $5,000. We owe
our legal counsel an additional $10,000 upon completion of this Offering. Our
plans will not change regardless of whether the maximum proceeds are achieved,
except to the extent indicated in MD&A “Liquidity” section.

Net proceeds from the sale of the maximum offering is estimated to be
approximately $32,000. We intend to utilize the estimated net proceeds following
this Offering for the following purposes, for which we have presented if we sold
25%, 50%, 75% and 100%:

                          1,500,000       3,000,000

Company Description
We are an internet portal-based, software-driven, cubicle panel and wall
covering business. The Company was incorporated under the laws of the State of
Nevada on December 15, 2014.
---

CubeScape is a progressive cubicle panel and wall covering business. CubeScape’s
coverings are designed to be a


 wrap-around one-piece with a panoramic
presentation of media art chosen by the user. These coverings can be made for
many uses besides office cubicles, currently our primary focus. Our product
offering, wrap-around coverings, run the gamut from scenes from nature, sports
and action-oriented themes, to fantasy-based, to game-related, and even current
and historical pop-art cultural themes. Our wrap-around coverings will be made
of non-permanent, high quality decorative materials designed to be easily
applied and removed with little or no damage to walls or other surfaces upon
which they are applied. Besides our vast array of stock photo art, customers can
create custom wrap-around coverings using a proprietary design website or portal
(currently under development).

We maintain a vast library of contemporary images that are both hip and cutting
edge. Contemporary themes developed primarily by our founder have become our
specialty: rock concerts, club scenes, inner-city, and urban themes to
fascinating industrial settings. We intend to produce our wrap-around covers
through a quality-focused manufacturer (made in America) specializing in vinyl,
durable coverings, drop shipped by selected U.S. partners, where the finished
product, a unique wrap-around covering (much like a poster, but superior in
quality and durability), arrives in a convenient cardboard tube, ready to apply
to your cubicle wall or other surface. Our strategy is to exploit what we
believe to be a growing market for non-permanent decal-based décor, targeting
the office cubicle environment and other work space environments. New materials
and adhesives reach the marketplace each and every month which may stimulate new
product-lines for us, such as automobile (graphic) wraps, life-size (or larger
than life) wall (vinyl posters) of sports figures, semi-permanent or other-use
wraps that provide protection from the elements of nature and provide a unique
personality to otherwise yet inanimate objects. Through our development and
recent growth, we have identified an untapped market that may contain more than
100 million cubicle-bound workers (or “cube jockeys”) in the United States
alone. We believe cube jockeys are ready for a change.  

We intend to develop the brand “CubeScape” for durable, high quality panoramic
vinyl wall graphics using an interactive design portal, all to be made in
America. Our design portal will provide our users with the ability to create
unique wall and cubicle panel art that enhances office and cubicle space with a
new approach to work space aesthetics. These products are intended to be high
resolution wall graphics depicting professional art, stock photos, or user
provided images blended in a unique and personal format, constructed of vinyl
and low-tack adhesive.

We believe our design portal will enable the creation of custom designs,
providing an environment reducing stress and fatigue of toiling in the modern
work-place environment, the “cubicle”. Corporate logos may be integrated in wall
graphics providing corporate sponsorship for uses in decorating work space at no
cost. In order to attract large user customers (employers with 49 or more
employees), we will seek to identify cost-saving opportunities and define
economic return for employers through increased employee productivity because of
our products. We believe our design portal will become an integral part of an
office design and layout with unique and lasting upgrades to what are utter drab
work space environments. Our design portal and graphics printing service is
intended to provide a three-step process providing customers with what we
believe to be a unique approach to integrating corporate office work space with
art. We believe this approach is necessary for breaking current office work
space decisions, creating a long-lasting consumer relationship and happy,
productive cube jockeys.

Through the assistance of a software development firm (whose services have been
solicited since early 2011) and the efforts of our founder, Mr. Estus, we
believe our design portal is taking shape and product design method is near
completion. We developed a durable and technical framework and program design
along with a sticky (“gooey” or graphical user interface, “GUI”) interface that
has been successful in the computer and video game industry. We have not yet
formed any meaningful industry relationships in the office furniture industry,
but we intend to. We will seek the assistance of established sales and marketing
consultants that focus on office furniture and design in order to develop a
sales and marketing strategy that capitalizes on our product.

CUBESCAPE,
INC. 

NOTES TO
THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

SEPTEMBER
30, 2016 (UNAUDITED)

 

NOTE 1
– SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

 

Organization

The
“Company” was incorporated on December 15, 2014 (date
of inception) under the laws of the State of Nevada, as CubeScape,
Inc.

 

The
Company filed a registration statement on Form S-1 which was
declared effective by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission
on October 14, 2015. The Form S-1 allowed the Company to solicit
investors for investment in a direct public offering of $60,000.
Twenty six (26) investors invested at a price of $0.01 per share
for the entire offering which closed on December 11,
2015.

 

Nature of
operations

The
Company is developing a branded product that utilizes panoramic
vinyl wall graphics generated on a proprietary interactive design
portal. The proprietary interactive portal is designed to assist
the consumer or end-user in creating wall or cubicle panel art,
upgrading and/or enhancing plain home, office and cubicle work
space with a new approach to workplace aesthetics. The
Company’s product will consist of high resolution wall
graphics made from professional art, designs, stock-photos and/or
user (consumer) provided images that are integrated into unique
backdrop. Graphics will be constructed of quality vinyl and
low-tack adhesive for ease of application and replacement but
durable. On June 9, 2016 a change in control occurred, a sixty
percent (60%) ownership interest was obtained by American Rebel,
Inc. from our former officer and director and founder. The Company
intends to continue with the CubeScape business as well as acquire
the business of its control shareholder.

 

Interim
financial statements (September 30, 2016 (unaudited)) and basis of
presentation

The
accompanying unaudited interim financial statements and related
notes have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S.
GAAP”) for interim financial information, and with the rules
and regulations of the United States Securities and Exchange
Commission (the “SEC”) set forth in Article 8 of
Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all of the
information and footnotes required by U.S. GAAP for complete
financial statements. The unaudited interim financial statements
furnished reflect all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring
accruals) which are, in the opinion of management, necessary to a
fair statement of the results for the interim periods presented.
Unaudited interim results are not necessarily indicative of the
results for the full fiscal year. These financial statements should
be read along with the Annual Report filed on Form 10-K of the
Company for the period ended December 31, 2015 and notes thereto
contained.

 

Year
end

The
Company’s year-end is December 31.

 

Cash and
cash equivalents

For the
purpose of the statements of cash flows, all highly liquid
investments with an original maturity of three months or less are
considered to be cash equivalents. The carrying value of these
investments approximates fair value.

 

Revenue
recognition

We
recognize revenue when all of the following conditions are
satisfied: (1) there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement;
(2) the product or service has been provided to the consumer;
(3) the amount of fees to be paid by the consumer is fixed or
determinable; and (4) the collection of our fees or product
revenue is probable.

 

The
Company will record revenue when it is realizable and earned and
product has been shipped to the consumers or that our service has
been rendered to the consumer.

 

Advertising
costs

Advertising
costs are anticipated to be expensed as incurred; however there
were no advertising costs for the three or nine months ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

 

Fair
value of financial instruments

Fair
value estimates discussed herein are based upon certain market
assumptions and pertinent information available to management as of
December 31, 2015 and September 30, 2016 (unaudited), respectively.
The respective carrying value of certain on-balance-sheet financial
instruments approximated their fair values. These financial
instruments include cash, deferred offering costs and accounts
payable. Fair values were assumed to approximate carrying values
for cash and payables because they are short term in nature and
their carrying amounts approximate fair values or they are payable
on demand.

Level 1:
  The preferred inputs to valuation efforts are
“quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or
liabilities,” with the caveat that the reporting entity must
have access to that market. Information at this level is based on
direct observations of transactions involving the same assets and
liabilities, not assumptions, and thus offers superior reliability.
However, relatively few items, especially physical assets, actually
trade in active markets.

 

Level 2:
FASB acknowledged that active markets for identical assets and
liabilities are relatively uncommon and, even when they do exist,
they may be too thin to provide reliable information. To deal with
this shortage of direct data, the board provided a second level of
inputs that can be applied in three situations.

 

Level 3:
If inputs from levels 1 and 2 are not available, the Financial
Accounting Standards Board (the “FASB”) acknowledges
that fair value measures of many assets and liabilities are less
precise. The board describes Level 3 inputs as
“unobservable,” and limits their use by saying they
“shall be used to measure fair value to the extent that
observable inputs are not available.” This category allows
“for situations in which there is little, if any, market
activity for the asset or liability at the measurement date”.
Earlier in the standard, FASB explains that “observable
inputs” are gathered from sources other than the reporting
company and that they are expected to reflect assumptions made by
market participants.

compensation

The
Company records stock based compensation in accordance with the
guidance in ASC Topic 505 and 718 which requires the Company to
recognize expense related to the fair value of its employee stock
option awards. This eliminates accounting for share-based
compensation transactions using the intrinsic value and requires
instead that such transactions be accounted for using a
fair-value-based method. The Company recognizes the cost of all
share-based awards on a graded vesting basis over the vesting
period of the award. 

 

The
Company accounts for equity instruments issued in exchange for the
receipt of goods or services from other than employees in
accordance with FASB ASC 718-10 and the conclusions reached by the
FASB ASC 505-50. Costs are measured at the estimated fair market
value of the consideration received or the estimated fair value of
the equity instruments issued, whichever is more reliably
measurable. The value of equity instruments issued for
consideration other than employee services is determined on the
earliest of a performance commitment or completion of performance
by the provider of goods or services as defined by FASB ASC
505-50.

 

Earnings
per share

The
Company follows ASC Topic 260 to account for earnings per share.
Basic earnings per common share (“EPS”) calculations
are determined by dividing net income by the weighted average
number of shares of common stock outstanding during the year.
Diluted earnings per common share calculations are determined by
dividing net income by the weighted average number of common shares
and dilutive common share equivalents outstanding. During periods
when common stock equivalents, if any, are anti-dilutive they are
not considered in the computation.

 

Income
taxes

The
Company follows ASC Topic 740 for recording provision for income
taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are computed based upon
the difference between the financial statement and income tax basis
of assets and liabilities using the enacted marginal tax rate
applicable when the related asset or liability is expected to be
realized or settled. Deferred income tax expense or benefit is
based on the changes in the asset or liability for each period. If
available evidence suggests that it is more likely than not that
some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized,
a valuation allowance is required to reduce the deferred tax asset
to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. Future
changes in such valuation allowance are included in the provision
for deferred income tax in the period of change.

 

Deferred
income tax may arise from temporary differences resulting from
income and expense items reported for financial accounting and tax
purposes in different periods. Deferred taxes are classified as
current or non-current, depending on the classification of assets
and liabilities to which they relate. Deferred taxes arising from
temporary differences that are not related to an asset or liability
are classified as current or non-current depending on the periods
in which the temporary differences are expected to
reverse.

 

The
Company applies a more-likely-than-not recognition threshold for
all tax uncertainties. ASC Topic 740 only allows the recognition of
tax benefits that have a greater than fifty percent likelihood of
being sustained upon examination by taxing authorities. As of
December 31, 2015 and September 30, 2016 (unaudited), the Company
reviewed its tax positions and determined there were no
outstanding, or retroactive tax positions with less than a 50%
likelihood of being sustained upon examination by the taxing
authorities, therefore this standard has not had a material effect
on the Company.

 

The
Company does not anticipate any significant changes to its total
unrecognized tax benefits within the next 12
months. 




7

 

  

 

The
Company classifies tax-related penalties and net interest as income
tax expense. For the nine month periods ended September 30, 2016
and 2015, respectively, no income tax expense has been
recorded.

 

Use of
estimates

The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of
assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and
liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the
reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting
period. Actual results could differ significantly from those
estimates.

 

Recent
pronouncements

The
Company evaluated recent accounting pronouncements through
September 30, 2016 and believes that none have a material effect on
the Company’s financial statements except for the
following.

 

In June
of 2014 FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”)
2014-10, “Elimination of Certain Financial Reporting
Requirements, Including an Amendment to Variable Interest Entities
Guidance in Topic 810, Consolidation ”. Amendments in ASU
2014-10 remove the definition of a development stage entity from
the master glossary of the Accounting Standards Codification,
thereby removing the financial reporting distinction between
development stage entities and other reporting entities from U.S.
GAAP. In addition, the amendments eliminate the requirements for
development stage entities to (1) present inception-to-date
information in the statements of income, cash flows, and
shareholder equity, (2) label the financial statements as those of
a development stage entity, (3) disclose a description of the
development stage activities in which the entity is engaged, and
(4) disclose in the first year in which the entity is no longer a
development stage entity that in prior years it had been in the
development stage. The Company adopted the provisions of ASU
2014-10 for the period ending September 30, 2016. The adoption of
ASU 2014-10 did not have an impact on our results of operations,
financial condition or cash flow.

 

In
August, 2014, FASB issued ASU No. 2014-15, Presentation of
Financial Statements - Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40): Disclosure
of Uncertainties about an Entities Ability to continue as a Going
Concern . The standard is intended to define management's
responsibility to decide whether there is substantial doubt about
an organization's ability to continue as a going concern and to
provide related footnote disclosures. The standard requires
management to decide whether there are conditions or events that
raise substantial doubt about the entity's ability to continue as a
going concern within one year after the date that the financial
statements are issued. The standard provides guidance to an
organization's management, with principles and definitions that are
intended to reduce diversity in the timing and content of
disclosures that are commonly provided by organizations in the
footnotes. The standard becomes effective for the annual period
ending after December 15, 2016, with early application permitted.
The adoption of this pronouncement is not expected to have a
material impact on our financial statements. Management's
evaluations regarding the events and conditions that raise
substantial doubt regarding the Company's ability to continue as a
going concern are disclosed in Note 2 below.

 

In August
2015, FASB issued ASU 2015-14, Revenue from Contracts with
Customers: Deferral of Effective Date . In 2014 FASB issued ASU
2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which
provided a framework for addressing revenue recognition issues and
replaces almost all existing revenue recognition guidance in
current U.S. GAAP. The core principle of ASU 2014-09 is for
companies to recognize revenue for the transfer of goods or
services to customers in amounts that reflect the consideration to
which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those
goods or services. ASU 2014-09 also resulted in enhanced
disclosures about revenue, provide guidance for transactions that
were not previously addressed comprehensively, and improve guidance
for multiple-element arrangements. The amendments in ASU 2015-14
defer the effective date of the new revenue recognition guidance to
annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017,
including interim periods within that reporting period. Early
adoption is permitted to the original effective date (December 15,
2016), including interim periods within that reporting period.
Management is evaluating the future impact of this guidance on the
Company’s financial statements and notes thereto.

 

In August
2015, FASB issued ASU 2015-15, Presentation and Subsequent
Measurement of Debt Issuance Costs Associated with Line-of-Credit
Arrangements . The Company previously reported that in April
2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-03, Simplifying the Presentation
of Debt Issuance Costs , which simplifies the presentation of
debt issuance costs by requiring that debt issuance costs related
to a recognized liability be presented in the balance sheet as a
direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability,
consistent with debt discounts. The amendments in ASU 2015-15
address the absence of authoritative guidance within ASU 2015-03
for debt issuance costs related to line-of-credit arrangements such
that the SEC staff would not object to an entity deferring and
presenting debt issuance costs as an asset and subsequently
amortizing the deferred debt issuance costs ratably over the term
of the line-of-credit arrangement, regardless of whether there are
any outstanding borrowings on the line-of-credit arrangement. ASU
2015-15 and ASU 2015-03 are effective for financial statements of
public business entities issued for fiscal years beginning after
December 15, 2015, and interim periods within those fiscal years.
Early adoption is permitted for financial statements that have not
been previously issued. The adoption of this guidance is not
expected to have a material impact on the Company's financial
position, results of operations or cash flows.

In
September 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-16, Business
Combinations: Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period
Adjustments . The amendments in this ASU require that an
acquirer recognize adjustments to provisional amounts that are
identified during the measurement period in the reporting period in
which the adjustment amounts are determined; calculated as if the
accounting had been completed at the acquisition date. For public
business entities, the amendments in this ASU are effective for
fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015, including interim
periods within those fiscal years. The amendments in this ASU
should be applied prospectively with earlier application permitted
for financial statements that have not been issued. The adoption of
this guidance is not expected to have a material impact on the
Company’s financial position, results of operations or cash
flows.

 

Amendments
clarifying guidance in Topic 205, Risks and Uncertainties, are
applicable to entities that have not commenced planned principal
operations, which we have commenced recently.

 

NOTE 2
– GOING CONCERN

 

The
accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that
the Company will continue as a going concern, which contemplates
the recoverability of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in
the normal course of business. As noted above, the Company is in
the development stage and, accordingly, has not yet generated
revenues from operations. Since inception, the Company has been
engaged in financing activities and executing its business plan of
operations and incurring costs and expenses related to its planned
direct public offering. As a result, the Company incurred net
income (losses) for the nine month period ended September 30, 2016
and 2015 of $10,735 and ($68,700), respectively. The Company
recognized a one-time debt forgiveness of $103,900. The
Company’s had an accumulated deficit of$106,766 as of
September 30, 2016 and $117,500 as of December 31, 2015.
Additionally, the Company’s development activities since
inception have been primarily sustained through debt financing and
the deferral of payments on accounts payable and other
expenses.

 

The
Company recently entered into a convertible debt instrument with a
shareholder of its largest shareholder in the amount of $425,000.
Of this amount, $395,562 was then loaned to the Company’s
largest shareholder as working capital to pay its operating
expenses including legal, accounting, product development, brand
expansion, and marketing costs. The majority shareholder also used
the proceeds of these loans to purchase inventory of its initial
product scheduled to launch second quarter of 2017.

 

The
ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent
upon its ability to raise capital from the sale of its equity and,
ultimately, the achievement of operating revenues. Management
believes sufficient funding can be secured through the obtaining of
loans, as well as future offerings of its preferred and common
stock to institutional and other financial sources. However, no
assurance can be given that the Company will obtain this additional
working capital, or if obtained, that such funding will not cause
substantial dilution its shareholders. If the Company is unable to
secure such additional funds from these sources, it may be forced
to change or delay its business plan rollout.

 

These
financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the
recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts, or
amounts and classification of liabilities that might result from
this uncertainty.

 

NOTE 3
– INTANGIBLE ASSETS

 

Intangible
assets with finite lives are amortized over their estimated useful
life. The Company monitors conditions related to these assets to
determine whether events and circumstances warrant a revision to
the remaining amortization period. The Company tests its intangible
assets with finite lives for potential impairment whenever
management concludes events or changes in circumstances indicate
that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. The original
estimate of an asset's useful life and the impact of an event or
circumstance on either an asset's useful life or carrying value
involve significant judgment.

 

In
January 2015 the Company acquired certain intangible assets from
its founder which consisted of a business plan, artistic designs,
stock photography to be used in its cubicle design business, along
with various costs related to the development of internal-use
software to be used in its operations. In addition the Company
acquired certain tangible assets from its founder which consisted
of network servers, computers and other computer components, a
graphic designer’s workstation and other office furniture
which both our founder and as-needed software developers and
designers will use in creating product and services for our
operations.

, 2015
(see Note 3 - Intangible Assets). We depreciate these assets over a
period of twenty-four (24) months which has been deemed their
useful life.

 

NOTE 5
– RELATED PARTY NOTE RECIEVABLE, RELATED PARTY CONVERTIBLE
DEBENTURE AND OTHER RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS

 

During
September 2016 the Company made net loans totaling $395,562 to
American Rebel, Inc., its control shareholder, a related party.
 American Rebel, Inc owns sixty percent (60%) of the
outstanding common stock of the Company.  The loans are not
interest bearing and are payable on demand.  

 

During
September 2016, the Company entered into a convertible debt
instrument with a shareholder of its largest shareholder in the
amount of $425,000. Of this amount, $395,562 was then loaned to the
Company’s largest shareholder as working capital to pay its
operating expenses including legal, accounting, product
development, brand expansion, and marketing costs. The majority
shareholder also used the proceeds of these loans to purchase
inventory of its initial product scheduled to launch second quarter
of 2017.

 

For the
period ended December 31, 2015, the Company executed a promissory
note with a related party in the amount of $4,500. The unsecured
note payable bears interest at 0% per annum and is due upon
demand. The Company amended this note payable to increase it
from $4,500 to $6,000 and $7,750 as of December 31, 2015 and March
31, 2016, respectively. During the three month ended June 30, 2016,
this note payable increased to $21,990 and was forgiven as of June
30, 2016. The Company recorded this forgiveness as additional
paid-in capital.

 

The
Company recorded rent expense of $3,000 and $4,500 (included in
Administrative and other costs) for the nine months ended September
30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The Company rented office space
from its founder on a month-to-month lease for $500 per month
through June 30, 2016. This included all utilities and other
incidental costs associated with operating the office space in
which to house the Company’s computing equipment and its
headquarters.

 

During
the year ended December 31, 2015 the Company recorded and
capitalized $24,000 of intangible and tangible assets purchased
from our founder. This transaction occurred on January 15, 2015
(see Note 3 - Intangible Assets).

NOTE 6
– DEBT FORGIVENESS FROM NON-RELATED PARTY

 

During
the year ended December 31, 2015 the company accrued $93,265 in
liabilities pursuing its intended technology.  During the six
months ended June 30, 2016 the company accrued an additional
$30,635 in additional liabilities.  As of June 30, 2016, these
vendors had agreed to forgive $103,900 of these
liabilities.

 

NOTE 7
– CONVERTIBLE DEBENTURE – RELATED PARTY

 

On
September 16, 2016, the Company sold a convertible debenture in the
amount of $600,000 in the form of a 12% three year convertible term
note. Interest is accrued at an annual rate of 12% and is payable
in common stock at maturity. Both principle and interest may be
converted into common stock at a price of $0.50 per share after the
passage of 181 days.  The Company may redeem the debenture at
its option or force conversion after common stock trades at a price
in excess of $1.00 per share for five days.  The Holder may
force redemption after the Company raised $3 million dollars in
equity. The holder of the convertible debenture was issued a three
year warrant to purchase 600,000 shares of the Company’s
common stock at $1.00 per share. As of September 30, 2016 the
Company received $425,000 under this convertible debenture.
 The Company received an additional $175,000 in October 2016
(see Note 12 – Subsequent Events).

 

The
convertible debenture holder, based on its agreement, with a
maturity of September 16, 2019 has the option to convert their
principal and interest into 1,200,000 (plus 432,000 for accrued
interest) shares of common stock. The fair value of the embedded
beneficial conversion feature resulted in no discount to the
convertible debenture – related party at September 30,
2016.

 

The
Company analyzed the conversion option for derivative accounting
consideration under ASC 815-15 "Derivatives and Hedging" and fair
value measurement under ASC 820 and determined that
the beneficial conversion feature under the convertible
denture should be recorded as a discount to debt if market was more
than the conversion feature.

 

The
convertible debenture - related party is measured at fair value at
the end of each reporting period or termination of
the debenture agreement with the change in fair value
recorded to earnings. The fair value of the embedded beneficial
conversion feature did not result in a discount to the convertible
debenture - related party. The discount if and when we have one
will be amortized over the term of agreement or
modification to the agreement to interest expense using
the straight-line method that approximates the effective interest
method.

 

The
Company used the eight steps to determine fair value under ASC 820.
(1) Identify the item to be valued and the unit of account.
(2)Determine the principal or most advantageous market and the
relevant market participants. (3)Select the valuation premise to be
used for asset measurements. (4) Consider the risk assumptions
applicable to liability measurements. (5) Identify available
inputs. (6) Select the appropriate valuation technique(s). (7) Make
the measurement. (8) Determine amounts to be recognized and
information to be disclosed.

 

Fair
value was determined by the market price of the Company's publicly
traded stock with no discount allowed. This was determined as of
the effective date of the agreement entered convertible debenture -
related party. The conversion price was then compared to fair
value, determined by market price and the difference between the
two multiplied by the number of shares that would be issued upon
conversion. The Company has not had any market activity within its
public market. Private transactions between willing buyers and
willing sellers have ranged from $0.02 to $0.15 per share. These
transactions were not conducted through a broker dealer
network.

 

As of
September 30, 2016, the outstanding balance due the convertible
debentures holders was $425,000, including $0 in original
issue discount or interest.

	AMERICAN REBEL HOLDINGS, INC.




	(Formerly CUBESCAPE, INC.)






	NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS




	MARCH 31, 2017 (UNAUDITED)







	NOTE 1  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES







	Organization






	The Company was incorporated on December 15, 2014 (date of inception) under the laws of the State of Nevada, as CubeScape, Inc. Effective January 5, 2017, the company amended its articles of incorporation and changed the company name to American Rebel Holdings, Inc. The Company anticipates a business combination with its majority shareholder, American Rebel, Inc.





	The Company filed a registration statement on Form S-1 which was declared effective by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on October 14, 2015. The Form S-1 allowed the Company to solicit investors for investment in a direct public offering of $60,000. Twenty six (26) investors invested at a price of $0.01 per share for the entire offering which closed on December 11, 2015.






	Nature of operations






	The Company is developing a branded product that utilizes panoramic vinyl wall graphics generated on a proprietary interactive design portal. The proprietary interactive portal is designed to assist the consumer or end-user in creating wall or cubicle panel art, upgrading and/or enhancing plain home, office and cubicle work space with a new approach to workplace aesthetics. The Companys product will consist of high resolution wall graphics made from professional art, designs, stock-photos and/or user (consumer) provided images that are integrated into unique backdrop. Graphics will be constructed of quality vinyl and low-tack adhesive for ease of application and replacement but durable. On June 9, 2016 a change in control occurred, a sixty percent (60%) ownership interest was obtained by American Rebel, Inc. from our former officer and director and founder. The Company intends to continue with the CubeScape business as well as acquire the business of its control shareholder.






	Interim financial statements (March 31, 2017 (unaudited)) and basis of presentation






	The accompanying unaudited interim financial statements and related notes have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP) for interim financial information, and with the rules and regulations of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC) set forth in Article 8 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by U.S. GAAP for complete financial statements. The unaudited interim financial statements furnished reflect all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) which are, in the opinion of management, necessary to a fair statement of the results for the interim periods presented. Unaudited interim results are not necessarily indicative of the results for the full fiscal year. These financial statements should be read along with the Annual Report filed on Form 10-K of the Company for the period ended December 31, 2016 and notes thereto contained.






	Year end






	The Companys year-end is December 31.






	Cash and cash equivalents






	For the purpose of the statements of cash flows, all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less are considered to be cash equivalents. The carrying value of these investments approximates fair value.






	Revenue recognition






	We recognize revenue when all of the following conditions are satisfied: (1) there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement; (2) the product or service has been provided to the consumer; (3) the amount of fees to be paid by the consumer is fixed or determinable; and (4) the collection of our fees or product revenue is probable.





	The Company will record revenue when it is realizable and earned and product have been shipped to the consumers or that our service has been rendered to the consumer.






	6













	 



	Advertising costs






	Advertising costs are anticipated to be expensed as incurred; however there were no advertising costs for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.


	 



	Fair value of financial instruments






	Fair value estimates discussed herein are based upon certain market assumptions and pertinent information available to management as of December 31, 2016 and March 31, 2017 (unaudited), respectively. The respective carrying value of certain on-balance-sheet financial instruments approximated their fair values. These financial instruments include cash, deferred offering costs and accounts payable. Fair values were assumed to approximate carrying values for cash and payables because they are short term in nature and their carrying amounts approximate fair values or they are payable on demand.





	Level 1:


	The preferred inputs to valuation efforts are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities, with the caveat that the reporting entity must have access to that market. Information at this level is based on direct observations of transactions involving the same assets and liabilities, not assumptions, and thus offers superior reliability. However, relatively few items, especially physical assets, actually trade in active markets.





	Level 2: FASB acknowledged that active markets for identical assets and liabilities are relatively uncommon and, even when they do exist, they may be too thin to provide reliable information. To deal with this shortage of direct data, the board provided a second level of inputs that can be applied in three situations.





	Level 3: If inputs from levels 1 and 2 are not available, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the FASB) acknowledges that fair value measures of many assets and liabilities are less precise. The board describes Level 3 inputs as unobservable, and limits their use by saying they shall be used to measure fair value to the extent that observable inputs are not available. This category allows for situations in which there is little, if any, market activity for the asset or liability at the measurement date. Earlier in the standard, FASB explains that observable inputs are gathered from sources other than the reporting company and that they are expected to reflect assumptions made by market participants.






	Stock-based compensation






	The Company records stock based compensation in accordance with the guidance in ASC Topic 505 and 718 which requires the Company to recognize expense related to the fair value of its employee stock option awards. This eliminates accounting for share-based compensation transactions using the intrinsic value and requires instead that such transactions be accounted for using a fair-value-based method. The Company recognizes the cost of all share-based awards on a graded vesting basis over the vesting period of the award.


	 


	The Company accounts for equity instruments issued in exchange for the receipt of goods or services from other than employees in accordance with FASB ASC 718-10 and the conclusions reached by the FASB ASC 505-50. Costs are measured at the estimated fair market value of the consideration received or the estimated fair value of the equity instruments issued, whichever is more reliably measurable. The value of equity instruments issued for consideration other than employee services is determined on the earliest of a performance commitment or completion of performance by the provider of goods or services as defined by FASB ASC 505-50.






	Earnings per share






	The Company follows ASC Topic 260 to account for earnings per share. Basic earnings per common share (EPS) calculations are determined by dividing net income by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the year. Diluted earnings per common share calculations are determined by dividing net income by the weighted average number of common shares and dilutive common share equivalents outstanding. During periods when common stock equivalents, if any, are anti-dilutive they are not considered in the computation.






	7

















	Income taxes






	The Company follows ASC Topic 740 for recording provision for income taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are computed based upon the difference between the financial statement and income tax basis of assets and liabilities using the enacted marginal tax rate applicable when the related asset or liability is expected to be realized or settled. Deferred income tax expense or benefit is based on the changes in the asset or liability for each period. If available evidence suggests that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized, a valuation allowance is required to reduce the deferred tax asset to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. Future changes in such valuation allowance are included in the provision for deferred income tax in the period of change.


	 


	Deferred income tax may arise from temporary differences resulting from income and expense items reported for financial accounting and tax purposes in different periods. Deferred taxes are classified as current or non-current, depending on the classification of assets and liabilities to which they relate. Deferred taxes arising from temporary differences that are not related to an asset or liability are classified as current or non-current depending on the periods in which the temporary differences are expected to reverse.





	The Company applies a more-likely-than-not recognition threshold for all tax uncertainties. ASC Topic 740 only allows the recognition of tax benefits that have a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being sustained upon examination by taxing authorities. As of December 31, 2016 and March 31, 2017 (unaudited), the Company reviewed its tax positions and determined there were no outstanding, or retroactive tax positions with less than a 50% likelihood of being sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities, therefore this standard has not had a material effect on the Company.


	 


	The Company does not anticipate any significant changes to its total unrecognized tax benefits within the next 12 months.





	The Company classifies tax-related penalties and net interest as income tax expense. For the three month periods ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, no income tax expense has been recorded.






	Use of estimates






	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates.






	Recent pronouncements






	The Company evaluated recent accounting pronouncements through March 31, 2017 and believes that none have a material effect on the Companys financial statements except for the following.





	In August, 2014, FASB issued ASU No. 2014-15,

	Presentation of Financial Statements - Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40): Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entities Ability to continue as a Going Concern

	. The standard is intended to define managements responsibility to decide whether there is substantial doubt about an organizations ability to continue as a going concern and to provide related footnote disclosures. The standard requires management to decide whether there are conditions or events that raise substantial doubt about the entitys ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued. The standard provides guidance to an organizations management, with principles and definitions that are intended to reduce diversity in the timing and content of disclosures that are commonly provided by organizations in the footnotes. The standard becomes effective for the annual period ending after December 15, 2016, with early application permitted. The adoption of this pronouncement is not expected to have a material impact on our financial statements. Managements evaluations regarding the events and conditions that raise substantial doubt regarding the Companys ability to continue as a going concern are disclosed in Note 2 below.






	8
















	In August 2015, FASB issued ASU 2015-14,

	Revenue from Contracts with Customers: Deferral of Effective Date

	. In 2014 FASB issued ASU 2014-09,

	Revenue from Contracts with Customers,

	which provided a framework for addressing revenue recognition issues and replaces almost all existing revenue recognition guidance in current U.S. GAAP. The core principle of ASU 2014-09 is for companies to recognize revenue for the transfer of goods or services to customers in amounts that reflect the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. ASU 2014-09 also resulted in enhanced disclosures about revenue, provide guidance for transactions that were not previously addressed comprehensively, and improve guidance for multiple-element arrangements. The amendments in ASU 2015-14 defer the effective date of the new revenue recognition guidance to annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within that reporting period. Early adoption is permitted to the original effective date (December 15, 2016), including interim periods within that reporting period. Management is evaluating the future impact of this guidance on the Companys financial statements and notes thereto.





	In August 2015, FASB issued ASU 2015-15,

	Presentation and Subsequent Measurement of Debt Issuance Costs Associated with Line-of-Credit Arrangements

	. The Company previously reported that in April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-03,

	Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs

	, which simplifies the presentation of debt issuance costs by requiring that debt issuance costs related to a recognized liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. The amendments in ASU 2015-15 address the absence of authoritative guidance within ASU 2015-03 for debt issuance costs related to line-of-credit arrangements such that the SEC staff would not object to an entity deferring and presenting debt issuance costs as an asset and subsequently amortizing the deferred debt issuance costs ratably over the term of the line-of-credit arrangement, regardless of whether there are any outstanding borrowings on the line-of-credit arrangement. ASU 2015-15 and ASU 2015-03 are effective for financial statements of public business entities issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted for financial statements that have not been previously issued. The adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material impact on the Companys financial position, results of operations or cash flows.





	In September 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-16,

	Business Combinations: Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments

	. The amendments in this ASU require that an acquirer recognize adjustments to provisional amounts that are identified during the measurement period in the reporting period in which the adjustment amounts are determined; calculated as if the accounting had been completed at the acquisition date. For public business entities, the amendments in this ASU are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The amendments in this ASU should be applied prospectively with earlier application permitted for financial statements that have not been issued. The adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material impact on the Companys financial position, results of operations or cash flows.





	In August 2016The FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15,

	Topic 230 Statement of Cash Flows  Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments Update No. 2016-15.

	. The amendments in the ASU address eight specific cash flow issues with the objective of reducing the existing diversity in practice, as the issues are either unclear or do not have specific guidance under current GAAP. ASU 2016-15 will be effective on January 1, 2018. The adoption of this standard is not expected to have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements.





	Amendments clarifying guidance in Topic 205, Risks and Uncertainties, are applicable to entities that have not commenced planned principal operations, which we have commenced recently.






	NOTE 2  GOING CONCERN



	 


	The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern, which contemplates the recoverability of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. As noted above, the Company is in the development stage and, accordingly, has not yet generated revenues from operations. Since inception, the Company has been engaged in financing activities and executing its business plan of operations and incurring costs and expenses related to its planned direct public offering. As a result, the Company incurred accumulated net losses for the three month periods ended March 31, 2017 and 2016 of ($37,337) and ($63,275), respectively. In addition, the Companys development activities since inception have been sustained through debt financing and the deferral of payments on accounts payable and other expenses.





	The Company recently entered into a convertible debt instrument with shareholders of its largest shareholder in the amount of $1,305,000. Of this amount, $1,147,687 was loaned to the Companys largest shareholder as a working capital loan to pay its operating expenses including legal, accounting, product development, brand expansion, and marketing costs. The majority shareholder also used the proceeds to purchase inventory for its product launch scheduled for the second quarter of 2017.






	9
















	The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to raise capital from the sale of its equity and, ultimately, the achievement of operating revenues. Management believes sufficient funding can be secured through the obtaining of loans, as well as future offerings of its preferred and common stock to institutional and other financial sources. However, no assurance can be given that the Company will obtain this additional working capital, or if obtained, that such funding will not cause substantial dilution its shareholders. If the Company is unable to secure such additional funds from these sources, it may be forced to change or delay its business plan rollout.





	These financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts, or amounts and classification of liabilities that might result from this uncertainty.






	NOTE 3  INTANGIBLE ASSETS






	Intangible assets with finite lives are amortized over their estimated useful life. The Company monitors conditions related to these assets to determine whether events and circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining amortization period. The Company tests its intangible assets with finite lives for potential impairment whenever management concludes events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. The original estimate of an assets useful life and the impact of an event or circumstance on either an assets useful life or carrying value involve significant judgment.





	During January 2015 the Company acquired certain intangible assets from our founder which consisted of a business plan, artistic designs, stock photography to be used in its cubicle design business, along with various costs related to the development of internal-use software to be used in its operations. In addition the Company acquired certain tangible assets from our founder which consisted of network servers, computers and other computer components, a graphic designers workstation and other office furniture which both our founder and as-needed software developers and designers will use in creating product and services for our operations.





	Intangible assets includes the following:

	NOTE 5 RELATED PARTY NOTE PAYABLE AND RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS






	During the three months ended March 31, 2017, the Company made net loans totaling $563,500, for a total of $1,147,687 to American Rebel, Inc., its control shareholder, a related party. American Rebel, Inc owns sixty percent (60%) of the outstanding common stock of the Company. The loans are not interest bearing and are payable on demand.





	During the three months ended March 31, 2017, the Company entered into convertible debt instruments with shareholders of its largest shareholder in the amount of $705,000, for a total of $1,305,000. The Company accrued interest expense on this convertible debt of $26,565, for a total of $45,077 at March 31, 2017. Of this amount borrowed under the convertible debt, $1,147,687 was loaned to the Companys largest shareholder as a working capital loan to pay its operating expenses including legal, accounting, product development, brand expansion, and marketing costs. The majority shareholder also used the proceeds of these loans to purchase inventory of its initial product scheduled to launch in the second quarter of 2017.





	For the period ended December 31, 2015, the Company executed a promissory note with a related party in the amount of $4,500. The unsecured note payable bears interest at 0% per annum and is due upon demand. The Company amended this note payable to increase it to $6,000 as of December 31, 2015.





	The Company recorded rent expense of $0 and $3,000 (included in Administrative and other costs) for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The Company rented office space from its founder on a month-to-month lease for $500 per month. This included all utilities and other incidental costs associated with operating the office space in which to house the Companys computing equipment and its headquarters. The Company stopped this lease in June, 2016.





	During the year ended December 31, 2015 the Company recorded and capitalized $24,000 of intangible and tangible assets purchased from our founder. This transaction occurred on January 15, 2015 (see Note 3 - Intangible Assets).





	During the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company recorded a contribution to capital of $21,990 as a result of cancellation of debt by related parties.






	NOTE 6- CONVERTIBLE DEBENTURE  RELATED PARTY






	Since September 16, 2016, the Company sold convertible debentures in the amount of $1,305,000 in the form of a 12% three year convertible term notes. Interest is accrued at an annual rate of 12% and is payable in common stock at maturity. Both principal and interest may be converted into common stock at a price of $0.50 per share after the passage of 181 days. The Company may redeem the debenture at its option or force conversion after common stock trades at a price in excess of $1.00 per share for five days. The Holder may force redemption after the Company raised $3 million dollars in equity. The holders of the convertible debentures were issued three year warrants to purchase 1,305,000 shares of the Companys common stock at $1.00 per share. As of March 31, 2017 the Company received $1,305,000 under this convertible debenture. The Company received an additional $100,000 in April 2017 (see Note 12  Subsequent Events).





	The convertible debenture holder, based on its agreement, with maturities beginning September 16, 2019 has the option to convert their principal and interest into 2,610,000 (plus 940,000 for accrued interest) shares of common stock. The fair value of the embedded beneficial conversion feature resulted in no discount to the convertible debenture  related party at March 31, 2017.





	The Company analyzed the conversion option for derivative accounting consideration under ASC 815-15 Derivatives and Hedging and fair value measurement under ASC 820 and determined that the beneficial conversion feature under the convertible denture should be recorded as a discount to debt if market was more than the conversion feature.





	The convertible debenture - related party is measured at fair value at the end of each reporting period or termination of the debenture agreement with the change in fair value recorded to earnings. The fair value of the embedded beneficial conversion feature did not result in a discount to the convertible debenture - related party. The discount if and when we have one will be amortized over the term of agreement or modification to the agreement to interest expense using the straight-line method that approximates the effective interest method.





	The Company used the eight steps to determine fair value under ASC 820. (1) Identify the item to be valued and the unit of account. (2) Determine the principal or most advantageous market and the relevant market participants. (3) Select the valuation premise to be used for asset measurements. (4) Consider the risk assumptions applicable to liability measurements. (5) Identify available inputs. (6) Select the appropriate valuation technique(s). (7) Make the measurement. (8) Determine amounts to be recognized and information to be disclosed.






	11
















	Fair value was determined by the market price of the Companys publicly traded stock with no discount allowed. This was determined as of the effective date of the agreement entered convertible debenture - related party. The conversion price was then compared to fair value, determined by market price and the difference between the two multiplied by the number of shares that would be issued upon conversion. The Company has not had any market activity within its public market. Private transactions between willing buyers and willing sellers have ranged from $0.02 to $0.15 per share. These transactions were not conducted through a broker dealer network.





	As of March 31, 2017, the outstanding balance due the convertible debentures holders was $1,305,000, including $0 in original issue discount or interest.






	NOTE 7  EMBEDDED DERIVATIVES  FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS






	Since September 2016 the Company entered into a financial instrument, which consists of a convertible debenture, containing a conversion feature. Generally financial instruments are convertible into shares of the Companys common stock; at prices that are either marked to the volume weighted average price of the Companys publicly traded stock or a static price determinative from each financial instrument agreement. These prices may be at a significant discount to market as determined overall by the volume weighted average price of the Companys publicly traded common stock. The Company for all intent and purposes considers these discounts to be fair market value as would be determined in an arms length transaction with a willing buyer and the restrictive nature of the common stock issued, unless issued pursuant to a registration or some other registered shares with the SEC.





	The Company accounts for the fair value of the conversion feature in accordance with ASC 815-15,

	Derivatives and Hedging; Embedded Derivatives

	, which requires the Company to bifurcate and separately account for the conversion features as an embedded derivative contained in the Companys convertible debt and original issue discount notes payable. The Company is required to carry the embedded derivative on its balance sheet at fair value and account for any unrealized change in fair value as a component in its results of operations. The Company valued the embedded derivatives using eight steps to determine fair value under ASC 820. (1) Identify the item to be valued and the unit of account. (2) Determine the principal or most advantageous market and the relevant market participants. (3) Select the valuation premise to be used for asset measurements. (4) Consider the risk assumptions applicable to liability measurements. (5) Identify available inputs. (6) Select the appropriate valuation technique(s). (7) Make the measurement. (8) Determine amounts to be recognized and information to be disclosed.





	The fair value of the conversion feature of the financial instrument as of March 31, 2017 was $0. The Company did not record any expense associated with the embedded derivatives at March 31, 2017. No embedded derivative expense was realized as there was no change in the conversion price. The conversion price for this financial instrument was $0.50 per share which is significantly higher than market.






	NOTE 8  INCOME TAXES






	At March 31, 2017 (unaudited), the Company had a net operating loss carryforward of $169,709, which begins to expire in 2034.





	Components of net deferred tax asset, including a valuation allowance, are as follows:

	Valuation allowance for deferred tax assets as of March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016 was $50,913 and $46,330, respectively. In assessing the recovery of the deferred tax asset, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. The ultimate realization of the deferred tax asset is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income in the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. Management considers the scheduled reversals of future deferred tax assets, projected future taxable income, and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. As a result, management determined it was more likely than not deferred tax assets will not be realized as of March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016 and recognized 100% valuation allowance for each period.

	The Company is authorized to issue 100,000,000 shares of its $0.001 par value common stock and 1,000,000 shares of its $0.001 par value preferred stock.






	Common stock



	On December 15, 2014, the Company issued to its founder, an officer and director of the Company, 6,000,000 shares of its $0.001 par value common stock at a price of $0.001 per share for services provided upon organization. The services were valued at $6,000.





	On January 15, 2015, the Company issued to its founder 3,000,000 shares of its $0.001 par value common stock at a price of $0.008 per share for certain intangible assets and tangible assets (see Note 3 - Intangible Assets).





	The Company filed a registration statement on Form S-1 which was declared effective by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on October 14, 2015. Form S-1 allowed the Company to solicit investors for investment in a direct public offering of $60,000. Twenty six (26) investors invested at a price of $0.01 per share for the entire offering which closed December 11, 2015.





	At March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, there were 15,000,000 shares of common stock issued and outstanding.






	NOTE 10  WARRANTS AND OPTIONS






	Since September 16, 2016, in connection with the convertible debenture related party (see Note 8  Convertible Debenture  Related Party) the Company issued three year warrants to purchase 1,305,000 shares of the Companys common stock at $1.00 per share. In conjunction with sales of convertible debt subsequent to March 31, 2017, the Company issued warrants to purchase an additional 100,000 shares on identical terms.





	As of March 31, 2017, there were 1,305,000 warrants issued and outstanding. As of December 31, 2016, there were 600,000 warrants outstanding to acquire any additional shares of common stock.





	The Company evaluates outstanding warrants as derivative liabilities and will recognize any changes in the fair value through earnings. The Company determined that the Warrants have an immaterial fair value at March 31, 2017. The warrants do not trade in a highly active securities market, and as such, the Company estimated the fair value of these common stock equivalents using Black-Scholes and the following assumptions:


	 


	Expected volatility was based primarily on historical volatility. Historical volatility was computed using daily pricing observations for recent periods. The Companys common stock has not traded so the volatility computation was based on other similarly situated companies. The Company believes this method produced an estimate that was representative of the Companys expectations of future volatility over the expected term which due to their maturity period as expiry, it was three years. The Company had no reason to believe future volatility over the expected remaining life of these common stock equivalents was likely to differ materially from historical volatility. Expected life was based on three years due to the expiry of maturity. The risk-free rate was based on the U.S. Treasury rate that corresponded to the expected term of the common stock equivalents.

	Operations






	We were incorporated on December 15, 2014 and soon thereafter acquired our business plan from our founder and president, Mr. David Estus. Most of the activity through May 4, 2017 involved the execution of our business plan, business development, development of programming language for use with our portal as well as most recently the preparation of the Companys financials and other corporate governance efforts in anticipation of the Companys direct public offering filed on Form S-1 declared effective October 14, 2015 (our Offering).





	On June 9, 2016 a change in control occurred, a sixty percent (60%) ownership interest was obtained by American Rebel, Inc. from our former officer and director and founder. The Company intends to continue with the CubeScape business as well as acquire the business of its control shareholder in a reverse merger transaction where our present majority shareholder will become a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company and we will distribute shares to the shareholders of American Rebel, Inc.





	We are a development stage company and have limited financial resources. We have not established a source of equity or debt financing. Our independent registered public accounting firm has included an explanatory paragraph in their report emphasizing the uncertainty of our ability to remain as a going concern. An investor or financial statement reader should read our Risk Factors in full.





	Our plan to continue as a going concern is to reach the point where we begin generating sufficient revenues from our web based business(s) or services to meet our obligations on a timely basis. The Company has not yet acquired or internally fully developed any services. We may not be able to acquire or internally develop any services in the future because of a lack of available funds or financing to do so. In order for us to develop or acquire any services, we must be able to secure the necessary financing, beyond just the proceeds of our recently completed direct public offering. In the early stages of our operations, we will continue to keep costs to a minimum. The cost to develop our business plan as currently outlined will be in excess of $100,000. We have no established current sources of funds to undertake the business plan as outlined. Until we obtain funding, if ever, we will keep our operating costs as low as possible with our founder, and CEO providing substantially all of the work on his own without any cash compensation. This methodology would result in our development stage extending for at least two to three years. If we are unable to obtain adequate funding or financing, the Company faces the ultimate likelihood of business failure. There are no assurances that we will be able to raise any funds or establish any financing program for the Companys growth.

	Business






	There is no way of accurately predicting when product development will progress to the point of generating any revenue. The timing of development is a function of having sufficient working capital. There is no way of knowing when or if we will be able to raise the funds necessary. If we do, services could be ready within three to nine months following when the necessary funds have been secured. If we do not raise sufficient financing, revenue producing activities of any kind will most likely not commence for at least 18 months, if ever.





	We are building a company that provides cubicle and office wall covering solutions. We are developing a proprietary website system (design portal) that provides customization of an extensive library of art and stock photography. Our design portal will enable consumers to create custom wall coverings that create an atmosphere that transcends the normal cubicle environment. The user will have access to diverse categories of art and they will be able to input their own cubicle dimension and layout, oriented the art to view points with precise fit to their cubicle walls.





	Our intended design portal, ecommerce system and drop ship services outline a three-step method for providing users with what we believe to be a comprehensive approach to office and cubicle design. We believe this approach will provide an experience in office design that will become the new way to empower cube jockeys with a sense of satisfaction from their work space, valued by both employees and management. We believe this acceptance in office work space will provide rapid growth and popularity. We will create a system that easy to use and promotes creativity. This approach will additionally help us in creating long-lasting return customer relationships.





	Our business operations is comprised of two segments: a) design portal for internet users; and b) integration services for the office furnishings market. We are developing the design portal, middleware and back-office framework with the assistance of an established software development firm. The software development firm with which the Company has been working with is utilized on an as needed basis.





	We developed the initial design portal framework and coding through both internal and outside sources. We have not yet formalized relationships with manufacturers of our product, drop ship partners or resellers that we intend to use. The Company intends to seek the help of outside sales representatives and marketing consultants to develop a professional sales and marketing strategy to capitalize on these technologies. We intend to pursue this strategy with further financing and hire an in-house web design and support group.





	The Company continues to work on the development of its design portal through the management and skills of its founder and CEO, as well as through a web development firm which has been working with us on an as needed basis and as our budget allows.





	To date no commercial website or services have been developed through these efforts.


	 


	The Company believes our customer will come primarily from social media advertising, word of mouth and specific technology conferences and conventions.





	Our plan to continue as a going concern is to reach the point where we begin generating sufficient revenues from our web based business(s) or services to meet our obligations on a timely basis. The Company has not yet acquired or internally fully developed any services. We may not be able to acquire or internally develop any services in the future because of a lack of available funds or financing to do so. In order for us to develop or acquire any services, we must be able to secure the necessary financing, beyond just the proceeds of this offering. In the early stages of our operations, we will continue to keep costs to a minimum. The cost to develop our business plan as currently outlined is in excess of $100,000. We have no established sources of funds to undertake the business plan as outlined. Until we obtain additional funding, if ever, we will keep our operating costs as low as possible with our founder, and CEO providing substantially all of the work on his own without any cash compensation. This methodology would result in our development stage extending for at least two to three years.





	We believe that our web based division (once developed, if at all) may begin to generate revenues earlier than the corporate direct sales (once developed, if at all). If we are unable to obtain adequate funding or financing, the Company faces the ultimate likelihood of business failure. There are no assurances that we will be able to raise any funds or establish any financing program for the Companys growth.

	Industry Overview






	Privacy-challenged office workers may find it hard to believe, but open-plan offices and cubicles were invented by architects and designers trying to make the work space world a better place; who thought that to break down the social walls that divide people, you had to break down the real walls, as well? Early 20th century modernist architects such as Frank Lloyd Wright saw walls and rooms as downright fascist in their presentation. The spaciousness and flexibility of an open plan, they thought, would liberate homeowners and office dwellers from the confines of their boxes. Businesses took up the idea less out of a democratic ideology than a desire to pack in as many workers as they could. The typical open-plan office during the first half of the 20th century contained long rows of desks occupied by office clerks in a white-collar assembly line.





	Cubicles were interior designers attempt to bring some soul back in to the office space. In the 1950s, a German design firm broke up the rows of desks (assembly line) into organic groupings with partitions for privacy -- what it called the Bürolandschaft, or office landscape. In 1964 famous furniture design company Herman Miller introduced the Action Office system. This offered such improvements as greater surfaces and multiple desk heights. In 1968 Herman Miller began to sell its system in modular components, with the unfortunate consequence of businesses cherry-picking the space-saving aspects of these designs, leaving out the humanizing touch. Herman Miller designer Robert Propst was tasked to find problems outside the furniture industry and conceive solutions for them. Probsts nickname, the Father of the Cubicle, is a misnomer. When Probst designed the Action Office system, cubicle farms or the very notion of it were not his intent. His own research into developing the action office philosophically was contrary to the actual cubicle in many ways. The Action Office system was designed to promote productivity, privacy, and health at the expense of inefficient use of space. Cubicles are now typically designed to maximize the efficient use of space.





	The efficient cubicle became popular in office design, mostly because of the movable wall in the Action Office II system. This saved money in construction and development costs. After their introduction into the marketplace, the Action Office II and other office furniture systems were modified to pack in as many employees as possible into an office space. This progression was contrary to Probsts vision. Probst stated that The cubiclizing of people in the modern corporation is monolithic insanity. During this era businesses began to shift their employees, not only clerks, but all into open-plan offices which maximized space. Today, companies are reverting to pre-cubicle rows of desks, now called pods to make them sound vaguely futuristic, which will still need our individualist wrap-around wall coverings.





	Although open plans foster ambient awareness and teamwork, an article published in a major Asian health journal found that open plans cause conflict, high blood pressure and increased staff turnover. The next wave of idealistic office furniture planning may strive to achieve aesthetically pleasing and healthy alternatives for cube jockeys who spend eight to ten work hours per day living in.





	Based on industry reports, online sales of graphic wall coverings (of which cubicle work spaces are a large part of) in the United States may surpass $10 million per annum. Over the next five years this represents more than $50 million in sales, which represents a significant increase to current spending of wall covering graphics and other by-products.





	Direct sales are hard to predict, year over year. We believe the confluence of a need for large non-permanent graphic art in combination with the recent advances of printing, printing substrates, adhesives and online customization present an opportunity for us to position our business to introduce our products and services to new consumers.





	Office space planning and design are vital components to achieving optimal office space plans. To achieve desired goals, most planners work with professionals that are both knowledgeable in the art and science of Computer Aided Design (CAD). These skills are an invaluable asset and an effective tool. Office space planning consultants with whom we plan to work with should be able to assist us in need and planning of our products to be integrated in successful office space projects which we will make available to them. This relationship building with office planning and design professionals should be helpful in suggesting our products and services for aesthetically pleasing cubicle design coverings.






	Competitive Focus






	We believe the following will assist us in exploiting the expected growth in custom designed wrap-around cubicle and wall covering market:





	(1)

	Scalability

	. We believe our design portal and services will become scalable, a solution designed to serve the underserved, fragmented office cubicle design market.





	(2)

	Sticky Consumer Relationships

	. Our business model will provide a solution that is designed to act as a competitive barrier and keep the user engaged with our design portal.






	17
















	(3)

	Expertise in Aesthetics

	. Our founder has extensive experience art and aesthetics which comes from his vast experience in the game development industry. We will seek to capitalize on that expertise.





	(4)

	Speed to Implementation

	. We believe that a

	fully-developed

	design portal and vertical distribution system will provide immediate insight into the usage (and behavior) of our customers assets.






	Growth Strategy






	Key elements of our growth strategy shall include:





	(1)

	Core Products

	. We plan to enhance our core products through user interface and functionality with our design portal as well as progressive and relevant new features and offerings as soon as reasonably practicable.





	(2)

	Focus

	. We intend to organically grow market penetration by: (a) securing contracts with office designers in various markets, (b) exploiting social networks, (c) leveraging development opportunities, and (d) adding solutions to professionals in the market.





	(3)

	Strategic Alliances

	. We plan to team with other businesses that have complementary features to our products, when fully developed, thereby reducing our development cost and introducing us to consumers and end-users.





	(4)

	International Expansion

	. We intend to expand internationally through partnerships and alliances.






	Business Objective






	Our objective is to become a provider of cubicle panel and non-permanent wall coverings. We are perusing the following strategies to achieve this object:





	(1) Initiating website development and ecommerce function, identifying service offerings, promoting, and advertising through social media campaigns.





	(2) Create a national media presence through social media  We will seek to create and enhance a national awareness and aggressively market our products through social media outlets.





	(3) Identify and develop strategic relations with our Drop Ship partners  utilize partners, high volume distribution facility to create highly efficient low cost production model.





	Aesthetically pleasing cubicle environments we believe contribute to an employees overall productivity and sense of well-being. Cubicle environments can convey a sense of mission reinforcing a business culture that an employer worked hard to develop. We will provide a comprehensive selection of coverings that can be themed oriented or business branded enhancing that culture and productivity. Every cubicle may not have a spectacular window view, but with CubeScapes product offerings we can provide a view to vistas for the occupant.





	CubeScape products can transform any neutral cubicle space into an inspirational space for all to enjoy, not just the occupants. We believe that clients and contractors visiting offices decked out in CubeScape products will instantly recognize our business mission. Depictions of communities are displayed in a variety of graphic form. Printed wall murals, large photographic panels, along with artistic window graphics, can reinforce what any business is all about.





	This report includes very limited market and industry data and forecasts that we obtained from internal research, publicly available information and industry publications and surveys. The industry in which we operate is subject to a high degree of uncertainty and risk due to a variety of factors, including those described in the section entitled Risk Factors.





	The following timeline outlines the steps that we intend to take. Each step outlines the metrics or performance that we must accomplish in order to move forward with our business plan.






	Step One (Q1/Q2) ($10,000 est. costs)






	Website development: Work with established webhosting businesses and web developer to stand up Cubescape.biz website. Test EDI functionality to drop ship partners and financial institutions.






	18

















	Step Two (Q2/Q3) ($5,000 est. costs)






	Ecommerce: Finalize strategic relations with ecommerce provide to integrate back office functionality between website selected ecommerce system servers.






	Step Three (Q3/Q4) ($5,000 est. costs)






	Drop ship partners: Establish ordering system between website and drop ship partners. Verify system functionality with ecommerce solution providers. Test entire order process through to shipment verification.






	Step Four (Q5) ($5,000 est. costs)






	Direct Sales: Develop direct sales strategy with consultants. Work with consultants to identify and approach manufacturers and corporate design specialist.





	As mentioned above, our steps are predicated upon the Company obtaining financing either through additional equity or debt beyond our recently completed direct public offering. If we are not able to obtain the financing as determined by the above steps, we will not be able to meet or achieve any of the time-line objectives. If we complete 75%, 50%, 25% or even 10% of our additional financing objectives, we will not be able to pursue any of our action steps. In that case the Company will be forced to proceed on a piecemeal basis using the services of our founder, and CEO and the very limited use of outside contractors when and if limited funds are obtained. Our founder and CEO currently devotes in excess of 20 hours a week to our continued business efforts. There is no realistic way to predict the timing or completion in that scenario.






	Without additional financing we will not be able to pursue our business plan or its time-line objectives, and the Company may fail entirely.






	It is our plan to seek additional financing from either equity financing or through debt instruments. Companys management has, through relationships and partnerships, begun the necessary work on some of our intended products. Our founder and CEO has primarily provided these services through the date of this report. Our business plan requires further completion of these tasks which require the hiring of employees and/or outside contractors. With the level of sophistication and expertise of our founder and CEO, as well as other various professionals that he knows, the Company should make progress in its development planned product, but currently no specific timeframe can be provided. Most if not all of these actions are predicated on the Company obtaining the necessary financing to accomplish these steps. If financing is not available on terms reasonable to the Company and its shareholders, then the progression steps of this business plan will not occur as planned and may never occur.





	We currently have no sources of financing and no commitments for financing. There are no assurances that we will obtain sufficient financing or the necessary resources to enter into contractual agreements with outside developers or sales or marketing firms. We currently do not have any cash or other resources to commence the use of outside service providers. If we do not receive any funding or financing, our business is likely to be maintained with limited operations for at least the next 12 months because our founder and CEO, will continue to provide his services without consideration. We have no formal agreement in place with our founder and CEO covering his services, our founders and CEOs plan is to do all of the administrative and planning work as well as programming and marketing work on his own without consideration while he continues to seek other sources of funding for the Company.






	Other






	As a corporate policy, we will not incur any cash obligations that we cannot satisfy with known resources, of which there are currently none except as described in Liquidity below or elsewhere in this report. We believe that the perception that many people have of a public company make it more likely that they will accept restricted securities from a public company as consideration for indebtedness to them than they would from a private company. We have not performed any studies of this matter. Our conclusion is based on our own observations. However, there can be no assurances that we will be successful in any of those efforts even if we become a public entity. Additionally, the issuance of restricted shares will dilute the percentage of ownership interest of our stockholders.

	Results of Operations for the three month period ended March 31, 2017







	Expenses






	Expenses for the three month period ended March 31, 2017 and 2016 were $37,337 and $63,275, respectively. Development costs for our internal-use software was $0 for the three month period ended March 31, 2017 compared to $14,000 for the three month period ended March 31, 2016. Public company expense was $10,101 for the three month period ended March 31, 2017 compared to $24,181 for the three month period ended March 31, 2016. Consulting expense related to business development was $0 for the three month period ended March 31, 2017 compared to $20,300 for the three month period ended March 31, 2016. Administrative costs and other expense was $170 for the three month period ended March 31, 2017 and $1,794 for the three month period ended March 31, 2016, which included rent expense. Amortization and depreciation expense was $500 and $3,000 for the three month periods ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Interest expense  related party was $26,565 and $0 for the three month periods ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.


	 



	Loss before provision for income taxes



	 


	Loss before provision for incomes taxes for the three month period ended March 31, 2017 was $37,337. Loss before provision for incomes taxes for the three month period ended March 31, 2016 was $63,275. We recorded no provision for federal or state income taxes. We have not generated any revenues.






	Liquidity






	We paid all costs related to our recently completed direct public offering which was approximately $22,000. Our operating expenses will be paid as and when necessary or otherwise accrued. Absent the ability to pay current obligations from available funds, we will need to seek out financial assistance from shareholders or various third parties who may agree to loan us the funds to cover outstanding professional and related fees. To the extent that such liabilities cannot be extended or satisfied in other ways we may seek outside financing or loans. If and when loaned, these loans most likely will be evidenced by non-interest-bearing unsecured notes treated as loans until repaid, if and when the Company has the financial ability to do so. No formal written arrangement exists with respect to anyones commitment to loan us funds for this purpose.





	Since acquiring our business plan, most of our resources and work have been devoted to executing the business plan, limited writing and testing of software code, testing and mock-up of our internet portal and smartphone app to be used with our intended product, implementing systems and controls, and completing the registration statement. With the registration statement completed, we our refocusing our work on product and service offerings as well as the development of our proprietary software for internal use. We believe the development work needed to initiate and complete software development, attract developers, and initiate our marketing plans, including the development of a saleable product, will range between $100,000 and $150,000 if outside contractors and experts are used. If we are able to secure funding to outsource these procedures, of which there can be no assurance, we can commence the launch of our intended product and services to the end user or consumer. If we are only able to use internal resources only (primarily consisting of the services of our founder, and CEO), the process will take much longer and our initial launch may be limited to a much smaller target market. If we are unable to raise any funds, the development costs would have to be provided by our founder and CEO to the extent that he is capable and willing to provide such funds. While we have engaged the services of a software development firm which we use on an as needed basis their function and assistance is limited. Our goal would be to have product and our internet portal available, sales channels and a comprehensive website up and running within one year, but there is no way of estimating what the likelihood of achieving that goal would be.





	Private capital will be solicited from business associates of our founder and CEO or through private investors referred to us by those same business associates. To date, we have not sought any funding source and have not authorized any person or entity to seek out funding on our behalf. If a market for our shares ever develops, of which there can be no assurances, we may use restricted shares of our common stock to compensate employees, consultants and independent contractors whenever possible. We cannot predict the likelihood or source of raising capital or funds needed to complete the development of our product and the stages as outlined above.






	20
















	We have embarked upon an effort to become a public company and, by doing so, have incurred and will continue to incur additional significant expenses for legal, accounting and related services. Once we become a public entity, subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act of 1934, we will incur ongoing expenses associated with professional fees for accounting, legal and a host of other expenses including annual reports and proxy statements, if required. We estimate these costs to be in excess of $75,000 per year and may be higher if our business volume or business activity increases significantly. Our current estimate of costs does not include the necessary expenses associated with compliance, documentation and specific reporting requirements of Section 404 as we will not be subject to the full reporting requirements of Section 404 until we exceed $75 million in market capitalization or we decide to opt-out of the emerging growth company as defined under the JOBS Act. This exemption is available to us under the JOBS Act or until we have been public for more than five years. These obligations we believe reduce our ability and resources to expand our business. We hope to be able to use our status as a public company to increase our ability to use noncash means of settling obligations (i.e. issuance of restricted shares of our common stock) and compensate independent contractors who provide professional services to us, although there can be no assurances that we can be successful in any of those efforts. We will reduce compensation paid to management (if and when we do compensate management which for the foreseeable future is limited) if there is insufficient cash generated from operations to satisfy these costs.





	We do not have any current plans to raise funds through the sale of securities except as set forth herein. We hope to be able to use our status as a public company to enable us to use non-cash means of settling obligations and compensate persons or firms providing services to us, although there can be no assurances that we can be successful in any of those efforts. We believe that the perception that many people have of a public company make it more likely that they will accept restricted securities from a public company as consideration for indebtedness to them than they would from a private company. We have not performed any studies of this matter. Our conclusion is based on our own beliefs and the advice that we have received from various business professionals. Issuing shares of common stock to such persons instead of paying cash to them may increase our chances to establish and expand our business and business opportunities. Having shares of our common stock may also give persons a greater feeling of identity with us which may result in referrals. However, these actions, if successful, will result in dilution of the ownership interests of existing shareholders, may further dilute common stock book value, and that dilution may be material. Such issuances may also serve to enhance existing managements ability to maintain control of CSI because the shares may be issued to parties or entities committed to supporting existing management. CSI may offer shares of its common stock to settle a portion of the professional fees incurred in connection with its registration statement. No negotiations have taken place with any professional and no assurances can be made as to the likelihood that any professional will accept shares in settlement of obligations due them.





	As of March 31, 2017, we owed approximately $20,000 in connection with software development costs incurred, consulting services and other expenses. We have not entered into any formal agreements, written or oral, with any vendors or other providers for payment of services or expenses. There are no other significant liabilities as of March 31, 2017.





	Since September 16, 2016, the company obtained financing in the amount of $1,305,000 in the form of a 12% three year convertible term note. The Note and accrued interest can be converted to common stock of the Company at the rate of $0.50 per share. The note holder was issued a three year warrant to purchase 1,305,000 shares of the Registrants common stock at $1.00 per share. At December 31, 2016, $600,000 had been received under this facility. An additional $170,000 was obtained through April 30, 2017 under like terms, including issue of a warrant to purchase 170,000 share.






	Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements










	The Company evaluated recent accounting pronouncements through March 31, 2017 and believes there are none that have a material effect on the Companys financial statements except for the following.





	In August, 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-15, Presentation of Financial Statements - Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40): Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entities Ability to continue as a Going Concern. The standard is intended to define managements responsibility to decide whether there is substantial doubt about an organizations ability to continue as a going concern and to provide related footnote disclosures. The standard requires management to decide whether there are conditions or events that raise substantial doubt about the entitys ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued. The standard provides guidance to an organizations management, with principles and definitions that are intended to reduce diversity in the timing and content of disclosures that are commonly provided by organizations in the footnotes. The standard becomes effective for the annual period ending after December 15, 2016, with early application permitted. The adoption of this pronouncement is not expected to have a material impact on our financial statements. Managements evaluations regarding the events and conditions that raise substantial doubt regarding the Companys ability to continue as a going concern have been disclosed in Note 2 below.






	21
















	In August 2015, FASB issued ASU 2015-14,

	Revenue from Contracts with Customers: Deferral of Effective Date

	. In 2014 FASB issued ASU 2014-09,

	Revenue from Contracts with Customers,

	which provided a framework for addressing revenue recognition issues and replaces almost all existing revenue recognition guidance in current U.S. GAAP. The core principle of ASU 2014-09 is for companies to recognize revenue for the transfer of goods or services to customers in amounts that reflect the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. ASU 2014-09 also resulted in enhanced disclosures about revenue, provide guidance for transactions that were not previously addressed comprehensively, and improve guidance for multiple-element arrangements. The amendments in ASU 2015-14 defer the effective date of the new revenue recognition guidance to annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within that reporting period. Early adoption is permitted to the original effective date (December 15, 2016), including interim periods within that reporting period. Management is evaluating the future impact of this guidance on the Companys financial statements and notes thereto.





	In August 2015, FASB issued ASU 2015-15,

	Presentation and Subsequent Measurement of Debt Issuance Costs Associated with Line-of-Credit Arrangements

	. The Company previously reported that in April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-03,

	Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs

	, which simplifies the presentation of debt issuance costs by requiring that debt issuance costs related to a recognized liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. The amendments in ASU 2015-15 address the absence of authoritative guidance within ASU 2015-03 for debt issuance costs related to line-of-credit arrangements such that the SEC staff would not object to an entity deferring and presenting debt issuance costs as an asset and subsequently amortizing the deferred debt issuance costs ratably over the term of the line-of-credit arrangement, regardless of whether there are any outstanding borrowings on the line-of-credit arrangement. ASU 2015-15 and ASU 2015-03 are effective for financial statements of public business entities issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted for financial statements that have not been previously issued. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the Companys financial position, results of operations or cash flows.





	In September 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-16,

	Business Combinations: Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments

	. The amendments in this ASU require that an acquirer recognize adjustments to provisional amounts that are identified during the measurement period in the reporting period in which the adjustment amounts are determined; calculated as if the accounting had been completed at the acquisition date. For public business entities, the amendments in this ASU are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The amendments in this ASU should be applied prospectively with earlier application permitted for financial statements that have not been issued. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the Companys financial position, results of operations or cash flows.





	In August 2016The FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15,

	Topic 230 Statement of Cash Flows  Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments Update No. 2016-15.

	. The amendments in the ASU address eight specific cash flow issues with the objective of reducing the existing diversity in practice, as the issues are either unclear or do not have specific guidance under current GAAP. ASU 2016-15 will be effective on January 1, 2018. The adoption of this standard is not expected to have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements.





	Amendments clarifying guidance in Topic 205, Risks and Uncertainties, are applicable to entities that have not commenced planned principal operations, which we have commenced recently.






	Other recent accounting pronouncements issued by the FASB, including its Emerging Issues Task Force, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, and the Securities and Exchange Commission did not or are not believed by management to have a material impact on our present or future financial statements.











	Critical Accounting Policies






	The preparation of financial statements and related footnotes requires us to make judgments, estimates, and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities.





	An accounting policy is considered to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made, and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used, or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically, could materially impact the financial statements.





	Financial Reporting Release No. 60 requires all companies to include a discussion of critical accounting policies or methods used in the preparation of financial statements. There are no critical policies or decisions that rely on judgments that are based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made. Note 1


	to the financial statements, included elsewhere in this report, includes a summary of the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our financial statements.

	Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk






	We are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and are not required to provide the information necessary under this item.









	Item 4. Controls and Procedures








	Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures







	Our Chief Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, Charles A. Ross, Jr., evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) as of the end of the period covered by this Report. Based on the evaluation, Mr. Ross concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective in timely alerting him to material information relating to us required to be included in our periodic SEC filings. The Company hired a financial expert with the experience in creating and managing internal control systems as well as continue to improve the effectiveness of our internal controls and financial disclosure controls.







	Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting







	There has been no change in the Companys internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during our last fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting.


	 


	Internal control systems, no matter how well designed and operated, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even a system which is determined to be effective cannot provide absolute assurance that all control issues have been detected or prevented. Our systems of internal controls are designed to provide reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation.






	Part II: Other Information











	Item 1 - Legal Proceedings
