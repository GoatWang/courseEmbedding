HAMILTON, Bermuda--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Global Atlantic Financial Group Limited (Global Atlantic), a multiline 
      insurance and reinsurance company, today announced that it has 
      successfully completed its acquisition of Houston-based Forethought 
      Financial Group, Inc. (Forethought). Forethought, a financial services 
      company with life insurance and annuity operations throughout the U.S., 
      is now a wholly owned subsidiary of Global Atlantic. The acquisition 
      includes Forethought’s products and designs, distribution, marketing, 
      intellectual capital and people, as well as all in-force business.
    


      “The closing of the Forethought acquisition brings Global Atlantic an 
      experienced and talented team, a diversified in-force block of life and 
      annuity business and significant distribution reach in both the annuity 
      and preneed life insurance markets,” said Allan Levine, Chairman and CEO 
      of Global Atlantic. “We are now well-positioned to provide a full range 
      of innovative life and annuity solutions to help individuals address 
      their financial needs. Combining these two organizations’ complementary 
      resources will help us drive steady, consistent growth.”
    

      Forethought will continue to operate its preneed life insurance and 
      annuity businesses under the Forethought name, and policyholders will 
      experience a seamless transition and continuity of service. The business 
      will be led by Michael Reardon, who joins Global Atlantic, retaining his 
      position as President of Forethought Life Insurance Company. He will 
      report to Levine.
    

      “This is an ideal fit for Forethought’s capabilities, and we look 
      forward to the growth opportunities this opens for our combined 
      organization,” said Reardon.
    

      John Graf, who had been Chairman, President and CEO of Forethought, will 
      join the board of Global Atlantic and become non-executive Vice Chairman 
      of the Life and Annuity Business. He will work with Levine and the 
      management team on an overall strategy for the combined organization. 
      Other key leaders of both Global Atlantic and Forethought’s management 
      will remain in place.
    

About Global Atlantic


      Global Atlantic Financial Group Limited, a multiline insurance and 
      reinsurance company, was founded at Goldman Sachs in 2004 and separated 
      as an independent company in April of 2013. In less than a decade, 
      Global Atlantic has established itself as an innovative insurance and 
      reinsurance provider. The company entered the Life & Annuity market in 
      2005 by acquiring Allmerica Life, renamed Commonwealth Annuity and Life 
      Insurance Company. It subsequently entered the Property & Casualty 
      market in 2006 through its Arrow companies in Bermuda, and in 2008 
      launched its syndicate at Lloyd’s of London. The business now operates 
      under the Ariel Re brand. In 2013, Global Atlantic acquired the Aviva 
      USA Life business, rebranded Accordia Life, and in 2014 added 
      Forethought Financial Group. Accordia Life and Forethought Financial 
      Group now form the foundation of a growing retail franchise to operate 
      alongside its leading reinsurance business. The combined organization 
      has over $30 billion in assets, 750 employees and 10 offices. Global 
      Atlantic’s success is driven by experienced leadership, a long-term 
      focus on policyholders, financial discipline and a culture that 
      emphasizes teamwork, innovation and excellence.

No other pros.ConsToo many managers without the relevant experience to manage, who blatantly mistreat employees. Inflated egos and too much "power" has created an unhealthy environment for anyone looking to grow their career or perform to their full capacity. There is a definite inner circle that you will not be able to get in to. In fact, you are purposely excluded from events and projects, or, if you were on a project you are routinely phased out of it so that the "managers" can receive the "glory" associated with a "job well done." I experienced more than one occasion where I was intentionally left out of meetings on projects I had been working on.Other cons:Expressly forbidden from speaking to upper management. Criticized for providing honest, diplomatic feedback about a project. Retaliated against for being ill. Given menial projects when requesting more work because I had capacity, while managers complained to everyone who would listen about how busy they were.The culture is horrible. You are made fun of, discriminated against and harassed, albeit quietly sometimes and more overtly at other times.I have never reviewed a former company before but feel so strongly that Global Atlantic is headed in the wrong direction (and opening themselves up to countless lawsuits with the way management speaks to employees -- with ZERO concern for HR rules and regulations) that I had to post.Advice to ManagementStop thinking you are the be all/end all of management. You have smart people working for you and you treat them like children. Get some management training. Get some sensitivity training. Don't threaten to take away a promotion because someone gets sick, and don't tell your employees you won't hire women anymore because all they do is get pregnant and go on maternity leave.Share on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on WhatsAppShare via EmailCopy LinkLink Copied!Flag as InappropriateFlag as InappropriateHelpful (5) Global Atlantic Financial Group Response seconds agoEdit • Delete Global Atlantic Financial Group 2016-09-09 12:27 PDT Jul 10, 2016 Helpful (7)"Difficult Environment"StarStarStarStarStarWork/Life BalanceCulture & ValuesCareer OpportunitiesComp & BenefitsSenior ManagementFormer Employee - Finance in Southborough, MAFormer Employee - Finance in Southborough, MADoesn't RecommendNeutral OutlookProsThe company pays well.

A.M. Best Co. has reported that they have assigned an issuer credit rating (ICR) of bbb- to Global Atlantic Financial Group (Global Atlantic), headquartered in Bermuda.The outlook, assigned by the insurance ratings company, is stable.The financial strength rating of A- (Excellent) and the ICRs of a- of the insurance operating entities of Global Atlantic are unchanged.Global Atlantic is a financial services holding company designed to to acquire and grow businesses in the insurance and reinsurance marketplace.A.M. Best said Global Atlantics ICR reflects its recent acquisition of AVIVA plcs US life insurance business from Athene Holding Ltd. and the recent announcement that Global Atlantic has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Forethought Financial Group, Inc. and its key subsidiary, Forethought Life Insurance Company. Both acquisitions will provide Global Atlantic with new sources of earnings diversification as well as enhance its product lines and distribution channels, states the Best press release.Global Atlantic will remain challenged with respect to integrating and branding these large transactions, Best said.The rating agency added that additional offsetting rating factors include the companys elevated, although declining, exposure to structured securities within its fixed income portfolio and the challenges of the low interest rate environment.Furthermore, said Best: Global Atlantics business plan is fairly new and remains untested.A.M. Best believes Global Atlantic will remain well positioned at its current rating level.Best warned: Negative rating actions could occur if the companys capitalisation, operating performance or both fall markedly short of A.M. Bests expectations. Negative rating actions also could occur should there be earnings pressure or a failure to successfully integrate current and future acquisitions.
