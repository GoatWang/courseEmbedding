(NYSE MKT: AIII) (the "Company") today announced that, after careful consideration of the available strategic alternatives for the Company presented by management and management's recommendation in favor of the liquidation and dissolution of the Company, the Company's Board of Directors has determined that it is in the best interests of the Company's shareholders for the Company to dissolve, liquidate and distribute to shareholders its available assets.








"After evaluating the Company's strategic options, the Board of Directors has reached the conclusion that it is in the best interests of the shareholders to dissolve and liquidate the Company," stated Edward Gellert, the Company's Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer and President. "The Board of Directors and management, together with the Company's advisors, devoted substantial time and effort in seeking, identifying and pursuing opportunities to enhance shareholder value; however, the process to date has not yielded any opportunities viewed by the Board as reasonably likely to provide greater realizable value to shareholders than the complete dissolution and liquidation of the Company," Mr. Gellert continued.
The Company's dissolution was unanimously approved by the Board of Directors but is subject to shareholder approval. The Company intends to present this proposal to its shareholders at a special meeting of shareholders at a time, date and location to be announced. The Company will file prescribed proxy materials with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") in advance of that meeting. If approved by the Company's shareholders, the Company intends to file a notice of intent to dissolve with the Georgia Secretary of State. After filing the notice of intent to dissolve, the Company will send or cause written notice of dissolution to be sent to each known claimant against the Company and will publish a notice of intent to dissolve in accordance with the requirements of Georgia law. 
In connection with the dissolution, the Company intends to liquidate the Company's assets and make adequate provision for all of the Company's existing and reasonably foreseeable debts, liabilities and obligations. The Company will, following notice and, if any claims are untimely or rejected in whole or part, the expiration of the deadline for filing suit by any claimant, distribute the remainder of any assets to its shareholders according to their respective rights and interests. 
As of June 27, 2017, the Company had one remaining land asset known as the Highway 20 property which is under contract to be sold for a price of $4,725,000, and no outstanding indebtedness. The Company expects the closing of the Highway 20 sale to occur on Wednesday, June 28, 2017. The Company expects that the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. will take immediate action to suspend trading in the Company's common stock on the NYSE MKT exchange following the closing of the Company's sale of the Highway 20 property and to initiate a de-listing of the Company's common stock from the NYSE MKT exchange.  As of May 31, 2017, in addition to the Highway 20 property, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $15,231,743.  While the Company cannot determine with certainty the amount of liquidating distributions it will make to its shareholders, the Company expects to distribute the remaining amount of such assets (which the Company expects to be substantial) after payment of all of its current and anticipated operating expenses, including expenses associated with the dissolution, and to conduct an orderly wind down of its operations. 
Important Additional Information will be filed with the SEC
This press release is for informational purposes only. It is not a solicitation of a proxy. In connection with the dissolution, the Company intends to file with the SEC a proxy statement and other relevant materials. The Company's shareholders are urged to read the proxy statement and the other relevant materials when they become available because they will contain important information about the dissolution of the Company. Shareholders may obtain a free copy of the proxy statement and the other relevant materials (when they become available), and any other documents filed by the company with the SEC, at the SEC's web site at http://www.sec.gov. In addition, the Company will make available or mail a copy of the definitive proxy statement to shareholders of record on the record date when it becomes available. Shareholders are urged to read the proxy statement and the other relevant materials when they become available before making any voting or investment decision with respect to the dissolution of the Company.
Participants in the Solicitation
The Company and its directors, executive officers and certain other members of its management and employees may be deemed to be participants in the solicitation of proxies from the Company's shareholders in connection with the proposed dissolution. Certain information regarding the interests of such directors and executive officers is included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on March 9, 2017 and will be included in the proxy statement relating to the proposed dissolution when it becomes available.
Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements
This press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the "safe harbor" provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are based on the current expectations and beliefs of the Company and are subject to a number of factors and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements. Such factors and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, the following: the ability of the Company to obtain shareholder approval of the proposed dissolution; the Company's ability to accurately estimate the amounts required to pay all operating expenses, as well as other known, non-contingent liabilities through the dissolution and winding up process; the Company's ability to settle, make adequate provision for or otherwise resolve its liabilities and obligations; the precise nature, amount and timing of any distributions to shareholders; the possibility that any distributions to shareholders could be diminished or delayed by, among other things, claims and unexpected or greater than expected expenses; and other statements contained in this press release regarding matters that are not historical facts. The Company undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statement in this press release.

NEW YORK, June 29, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- ACRE Realty Investors Inc. (NYSE MKT: AIII) (the "Company") today announced that, on June 28, 2017, it closed the previously announced sale of its Highway 20 land parcel for a sale price of $4,725,000. The Company also announced today that it has received notice that the NYSE MKT has determined to immediately suspend trading in the Company's common stock and commence proceedings to delist the Company's common stock. 








On October 13, 2016, the Company filed a Current Report on Form 8-K to report that, through the Company's operating partnership, ACRE Realty LP, the Company entered into a sales contract with Roberts Capital Partners, LLC, a Georgia limited liability company ("Roberts"), pursuant to which the Company agreed to sell, and Roberts agreed to purchase, subject to the conditions in the contract, the Company's Highway 20 land parcel consisting of approximately 37.693 acres of real property located in Cumming, Forsyth County, Georgia (the "Highway 20 Property").
The Highway 20 Property was the Company's sole remaining land asset. As a result of the closing of the sale of the Highway 20 Property, the Company's remaining assets consist entirely of cash.
In its decision to commence delisting proceedings, the NYSE MKT cited Section 1002(c) of the NYSE MKT Company Guide, which applies when a company has sold or otherwise disposed of its principal operating assets, or has ceased to be an operating company. The Company has a right to a review of the NYSE MKT's determination to delist the Company's common stock by a committee of the Board of Directors of the NYSE MKT. The Company does not intend to exercise this right at this time. 
As previously announced, the Company's Board of Directors has determined that it is in the best interests of the Company's shareholders for the Company to dissolve, liquidate and distribute to shareholders its available assets. The Company's dissolution was unanimously approved by the Board of Directors but is subject to shareholder approval. The Company intends to present this proposal to its shareholders at a special meeting of shareholders at a time, date and location to be announced. The Company will file prescribed proxy materials with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") in advance of that meeting. If approved by the Company's shareholders, the Company intends to file a notice of intent to dissolve with the Georgia Secretary of State. After filing the notice of intent to dissolve, the Company will send or cause written notice of dissolution to be sent to each known claimant against the Company and will publish a notice of intent to dissolve in accordance with the requirements of Georgia law. 
In connection with the dissolution, the Company intends to make adequate provision for all of the Company's existing and reasonably foreseeable debts, liabilities and obligations. The Company will, following notice and, if any claims are untimely or rejected in whole or part, the expiration of the deadline for filing suit by any claimant, distribute the remainder of any assets to its shareholders according to their respective rights and interests.
As of May 31, 2017, in addition to the Highway 20 Property, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $15.2 million. Today, as a result of the sale of the Highway 20 Property, the Company has approximately $19.8 million of cash and cash equivalents. While the Company cannot determine with certainty the amount of liquidating distributions it will make to its shareholders, the Company expects to distribute the remaining amount of such cash (which the Company expects to be substantial) after payment of all of its accrued and anticipated operating expenses, including expenses associated with the dissolution, and to conduct an orderly wind down of its operations.  In order to assist the Company in preserving cash for future distributions to the Company's shareholders, the Company's external manager, A-III Manager LLC (the "Manager"), has agreed, commencing June 27, 2017, and subject to approval by the Company's shareholders of the Plan of Dissolution that will be presented to the Company's shareholders for their approval at a special meeting of shareholders, to waive the management fees and certain expense reimbursements that the Manager is entitled to receive from the Company under the management agreement between the Company and the Manager.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
