SYKES Standards of Conduct


 



  




Our History
A Company of People Serving People
In 1977, John H. Sykes founded Sykes Enterprises, Incorporated. While engineering services were the firm’s initial offering, at the core of the company was a passion for providing clients with the best service possible while giving back to the community. Today, this drive to serve others remains part of our DNA, and we believe it is integral to our company’s success.



  




TAKING OUR SERVICE VIRTUE GLOBAL
Setting out on a new course, in 1992, SYKES acquired a small company in Sterling, Colorado. With the acquisition of Jones Technologies, Inc., we entered into the arena of inbound customer support. Having built a solid foundation with existing clients, we soon became very successful in outsourced customer care.
In 1996, SYKES went public and began trading on NASDAQ. This allowed us to grow globally. While we already had an international presence with the opening of our Amsterdam site in 1994, several other acquisitions expanded our European footprint from 1996-1997. These acquisitions included Datasvar Support AB of Sweden; Telcare of Germany, McQueen International Limited and more. We also entered a joint venture with HealthPlan Services Corporate – forming a new venture called SYKES Assistance Services – which took the company to Canada. Within the next few years, acquisitions and the opening of new customer support centers would cement our presence in Latin America. 
In 2010, SYKES acquired ICT Group, Inc and in 2012, we completed another significant acquisition — Alpine Access, Inc. The Alpine Access acquisition created differentiation for our organization in the categories of quality, speed to market, scalability and flexibility, by the integration of home-based agents.
In 2015, we acquired Qelp, a company whose self-service platform delivery model helps our clients create more of an effortless customer experience by serving customers in their channel of choice. Less than a year later, we acquired Clearlink, moving us deeper into digital marketing and in-bound demand generation. The additions of Qelp and Clearlink provide our clients with a unique and differentiated end-to-end global customer interaction management solution.








DEFINING OUR SUCCESS

Headquartered in Tampa, Florida, SYKES excels in delivering comprehensive inbound customer engagement services to Global 2000 companies, primarily in the communications, financial services, healthcare, technology, transportation and retail industries. Our customer service agents serve thousands of customers every day – via multiple channels – and have been recognized for their service excellence. We’re proud to have received awards such as:

SSPA STAR Hall of Fame, Software Support Professionals Association
Service Leader Award, CRM Magazine
Top 100 Most Trustworthy Companies in America, Audit Integrity

We’ve also been recognized for our innovation with such awards as the Recognized Innovator Award (Technology Services Industry Association – formerly SSPA) and 2011 Product of the Year (Customer Interaction Solution Magazine) for its Online Support Communities solution.
Since 1977, We have held fast to our steadfast client commitments and our passion for providing excellent service. And, while our industry recognitions and steady growth have provided solid benchmarks, our true measure of success lies in holding firm to our core principles of providing exceptional customer service and outstanding client value.
