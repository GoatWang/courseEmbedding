Are you compliant with ballast water quality standards?

Accession by Finland triggered ratification of The International Convention for the Control and Management of Ships' Ballast Water and Sediments (BWM 2004 Convention) and the Regulation will enter into force on 8th September 2017. But how do you test if your ballast water treatment system is performing according to the regulations?






Smarter, digital solutions to solve your needs

Introducing our first digital solution - the automated boiler water maintenance solution which constantly measures your boiler water condition and automatically doses chemicals when required, greatly reducing the risk of a boiler failure.








Dieselpower CFPP

Cold temperatures or climate pose a clear challenge of waxing of your onboard distillate fuels, thus leading to blocked fuel filters / pipelines / equipment or wax settling in fuel in tanks even at temperatures as high as 15°C. 




Industry Perspectives








Managing Ballast Water discharge in compliance within the International Convention

Accession by Finland triggered ratification of The International Convention for the Control and Management of Ships' Ballast Water and Sediments (BWM 2004 Convention). It will enter into force on 8th September 2017, marking a landmark step towards halting the spread of invasive aquatic species which can cause havoc for local ecosystems, affect biodiversity and lead to substantial economic loss.

Pioneering successful testing of R407f as R404A replacement

With the phase out of R404A refrigerant now gathering pace, due to its sky-high global warming potential (GWP), the search for an environmentally friendly alternative is more pressing than ever.

Preventing wax formations in marine diesel fuels

While distillate fuels will comfortably keep you within the latest sulphur emission limits all year round, when winter approaches and temperatures drop they can pose more problems than they actually solve.
