Ed StilesDec. 8, 2004Resources for the MediaVance D. CoffmanBrian D. LeskPeter W. SalterGeorge SarloJohn J. MariettiVance D. Coffman has been named the 2004 Technology & Management Executive of the Year by the University of Arizona's Eller College of Management and College of Engineering. Coffman was CEO of Lockheed Martin Corp. until his retirement in August. He will continue to serve as chairman of the board until April.
 He was honored at the annual Technology & Management Awards Luncheon (TMAL) on Thursday, Dec. 9. The luncheon was held in The Arizona Biltmore (Phoenix, Ariz.) and celebrates the contributions of high-tech enterprises and entrepreneurial ventures to the economic development of Arizona and the nation.
Coffman joined Lockheed's Space Systems Division as a guidance and control systems analyst in 1967. He led the development of several major space programs and data processing systems and was named president of the Space Systems Division in 1988, where he directed several of the corporation's large projects including the Hubble Space Telescope. In 1998 he was named chairman and CEO of Lockheed Martin and in 2002 was appointed chairman of the President's National Security Telecommunications Advisory Committee. He also was the chairman of the Aerospace Industries Assoc. for the year of 2003.
 Coffman earned his bachelor's degree at Iowa State University and master's and Ph.D. degrees at Stanford.
 He was selected to receive the Technology & Management Executive of the Year Award because of his leadership role in the aerospace industry, particularly as it relates to space systems.
 UA's business and engineering colleges also honored four other executives at TMAL. All are UA alumni.
 Peter W. Salter, Lifetime Achievement Award, Eller College  Peter W. Salter is chairman of the board, president, and CEO of Salter Labs in Arvin, Calif.. He founded Slater Labs in 1975. Since that time, the company has introduced more than 150 medical-care products and expanded operations from California to Georgia, New Hampshire, Texas, Wisconsin, and Juarez, Mexico. Under Salter's leadership, Salter Labs has risen to become a leader in several medical product categories, including respiratory care, anesthesia, and oral drug delivery. The company's products are used daily in acute care, extended care, rehabilitation, and home care worldwide. Salter graduated from UA in 1964 with a degree in history.
 George Sarlo, Lifetime Achievement Award, College of Engineering  Since 1974, George Sarlo has played a key role in building the Walden Group, a major, worldwide venture-capital organization. In addition to his current duties as a director of several public and private corporations, he also contributes extensive financial and technical knowledge to WaldenVC's investment portfolio. Sarlo also is chairman of Ashfield & Co., Inc., an investment management company in San Francisco that has approximately $2 billion under management. Sarlo is president of the Sarlo Family Foundation, a trustee of the San Francisco Conservatory of Music, a member of the University of California San Francisco Foundation, and chairman emeritus of KQED, Inc. He also is a director of Interplast, The International Rescue Committee, and the Joint Distribution Committee. Sarlo earned a bachelor's degree from UA in electrical engineering in 1960. He also has an MBA degree from Harvard Business School.
 Brian D. Lesk, Distinguished Service Award, Eller College  In 1996, Brian D. Lesk founded Diversified Human Resources, Inc. (DHR), which is based in Phoenix, Ariz. DHR is a professional outsource provider to small- and medium-sized businesses and handles much of the administrative paperwork associated with employees. This includes things such as payroll, payroll taxes, workers' compensation and employee benefit packages. The company also assists clients with risk management and human resource administration. Prior to founding DHR, Lesk succeeded in several entrepreneurial ventures in the restaurant, real estate, and investment industries. With his success in DHR, Ernst and Young named Lesk Arizona's Emerging Entrepreneur for 1999. As an active supporter of philanthropic causes, Lesk was recognized in 1999 as "One of Arizona's Finest" by the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation. Lesk graduated from UA in 1980 with a bachelor's degree in business administration.
 John J. Marietti, Distinguished Service Award, College of Engineering  Since 1993, John J. Marietti has served as chairman of the board of Cleaves-Bessmer-Marietti, Inc., a major electrical manufacturer's representative based in Kansas City, Mo. From 1983 to 2001, he also was the company's CEO. Marietti has served as president of the Electric League of Kansas and Missouri and as president of the Electrical Equipment Representatives Assoc. In 1997, he received the GEM Award from "Electrical Wholesale" magazine as the person contributing the most to the leadership, integrity, character and development of the electrical industry throughout the United States. Marietti graduated from UA in 1961 with a bachelor's degree in electrical engineering.

          . 
        


      ■ Vance D. Coffman was one of America's foremost
      astronautical engineers and business leaders. He developed new techniques
      for guiding satellites and was responsible for developing communications
      satellites for the Space-Based Infrared System that formed part of
      America's early-warning defense system. As a leader of Lockheed
      Martin, he pressed for openness in dealing with friendly nations and
      envisioned an age of cooperation among allies that would include sharing
      of defense technology and the cooperative development of defense systems
      so that all countries would be equally capable of participating in mutual
      military obligations.
    

      FROM AN IOWA FARM
    

      Coffman was raised on a soybean farm near Winthrop, Iowa, where the
      launching of Sputnik first inspired him to
       study science. He took five years to earn a bachelor's degree in
      aerospace engineering from Iowa State University in 1967 due to the lack
      of mathematics coursework available at his high school. In 1973 he
      received a doctorate in aeronautics and astronautics from Stanford
      University.
    

      In 1967 he took a job as an analyst of guidance and control systems for
      Lockheed Corporation's aircraft and spacecraft manufacturing. He
      established himself as worthy of upper management's attention by
      devising a way for satellites to precisely position themselves using
      distant stars as references. As his responsibilities increased, he studied
      books on management, turning himself into an engineer with business
      qualifications as well.
    

      SECRET OPERATIONS FOR THE MILITARY
    

      In 1988 Coffman was appointed president of Lockheed's Space Systems
      Division, where he was responsible for the development of the Hubble Space
      Telescope and the MILSTAR communications satellite. Coffman eventually
      became involved in secret defense projects such as the Space-Based
      Infrared System, and because he could not talk in public about much of his
      work he gained a reputation for being subdued. Meanwhile, he pushed
      Lockheed toward becoming more involved in commercial enterprises,
      especially telecommunications satellites.
    

      In March 1992 a new job was created specifically for Coffman: that of
      corporate executive vice president. In 1995 Lockheed merged with Martin
      Marietta Corporation, and during the reshuffling of management positions
      Coffman became president of the Space and Missiles division of the new
      Lockheed Martin. As part of the corporate consolidation, he closed two of
      Lockheed's missile manufacturing plants. On January 10, 1996, he
      was elected to the board of directors; on July 1, 1996, he was appointed
      president and chief operating officer. That year, Lockheed Martin amassed
      $27 billion in revenue.
    

      IN THE HOT SEAT
    

      On August 1, 1997, Coffman became chief executive officer and vice
      chairman of the board at Lockheed Martin. He was well liked because of his
      friendly, honest manner and had big plans for the company, wanting to
      boost space-systems and information-systems technology. He quickly became
      an outspoken advocate for his views. Yet, problems were brewing thanks to
      poor communication between Lockheed Martin's top management and its
      division leaders. The F-22 fighter aircraft under joint development with
      Boeing was $2.1 billion over budget, and Theater High Altitude Area
      Defense missiles being developed for the U.S. Army failed to function
      properly. In spite of these setbacks, Lockheed Martin netted $1.2 billion
      in 1998. That year, Coffman became chairman of the board.
    

      By the end of 1999 rumors were rife that Coffman was about to be replaced.
      Sales for the C-130J military transport aircraft were far below
      projections; defense projects were beset by overrunning costs; and Titan
      and Athena rockets exploded at launch, destroying three $100 million spy
      satellites. From January 1 to June 10, 1999, Lockheed Martin cut eight
      thousand jobs. From May to November, its stock value declined 55 percent;
      the company was $11 billion in debt. In June, Coffman was called to the
      Pentagon to explain Lockheed's failures. For the first time since
      the 1960s, Lockheed lost a spy-satellite contract; the $6 billion project
      instead went to Boeing.
    

      Not all news was bad news, however. Lockheed Martin quickly forged a
      partnership with Daimler Chrysler Aerospace (of Germany) and Alenia (of
      Italy) to build the Medium Extended Air Defense System (MEADS), designed
      to protect front-line troops. Coffman was an advocate of open cooperation
      among defense allies, and this project was a highlight of his efforts. The
      company netted $575 million and by the end of the year had $50 billion in
      back orders.
    

      In 2000 Coffman reorganized Lockheed Martin, consolidating its
      manufacturing into three divisions: electronic, aeronautical, and
      astronautical. He expanded his company's commercial operations by
      purchasing Comsat for $2.7 billion, the cost of which was largely
      responsible for Lockheed Martin's posting a net loss of $519
      million in 2000. On the positive side, Lockheed Martin's Patriot
      Advanced Capability–3 missile was chosen for MEADS, and the company
      added $39 billion in new orders. Throughout Lockheed Martin's
      successful business dealings, Coffman continued to be a passionate public
      advocate for his vision of a NATO alliance that offered equal access to
      all member nations' defense projects.
    

      In 2001 Lockheed Martin had 20 successful rocket launches, and it landed a
      $7 billion contract for 80 F-16s from the United Arab Emirates. That year
      Lockheed Martin also landed the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter contract for
      $200 billion, to be spent over the next two decades. In 2003 Lockheed
      Martin had a company-record $32 billion in revenue, 25 percent of which
      came from information technology. Yet, the company's stock declined
      by 11 percent, part of a worldwide decline in technology stocks. Although
      the board of directors wanted him to remain, Coffman planned to leave the
      CEO post on August 6, 2004, and he planned to retire as chairman of the
      board in April 2005, citing a desire to begin a new stage of his life.

      ■ Vance D. Coffman was one of America's foremost
      astronautical engineers and business leaders. He developed new techniques
      for guiding satellites and was responsible for developing communications
      satellites for the Space-Based Infrared System that formed part of
      America's early-warning defense system. As a leader of Lockheed
      Martin, he pressed for openness in dealing with friendly nations and
      envisioned an age of cooperation among allies that would include sharing
      of defense technology and the cooperative development of defense systems
      so that all countries would be equally capable of participating in mutual
      military obligations.
    

      FROM AN IOWA FARM
    

      Coffman was raised on a soybean farm near Winthrop, Iowa, where the
      launching of Sputnik first inspired him to
       study science. He took five years to earn a bachelor's degree in
      aerospace engineering from Iowa State University in 1967 due to the lack
      of mathematics coursework available at his high school. In 1973 he
      received a doctorate in aeronautics and astronautics from Stanford
      University.
    

      In 1967 he took a job as an analyst of guidance and control systems for
      Lockheed Corporation's aircraft and spacecraft manufacturing. He
      established himself as worthy of upper management's attention by
      devising a way for satellites to precisely position themselves using
      distant stars as references. As his responsibilities increased, he studied
      books on management, turning himself into an engineer with business
      qualifications as well.
    

      SECRET OPERATIONS FOR THE MILITARY
    

      In 1988 Coffman was appointed president of Lockheed's Space Systems
      Division, where he was responsible for the development of the Hubble Space
      Telescope and the MILSTAR communications satellite. Coffman eventually
      became involved in secret defense projects such as the Space-Based
      Infrared System, and because he could not talk in public about much of his
      work he gained a reputation for being subdued. Meanwhile, he pushed
      Lockheed toward becoming more involved in commercial enterprises,
      especially telecommunications satellites.
    

      In March 1992 a new job was created specifically for Coffman: that of
      corporate executive vice president. In 1995 Lockheed merged with Martin
      Marietta Corporation, and during the reshuffling of management positions
      Coffman became president of the Space and Missiles division of the new
      Lockheed Martin. As part of the corporate consolidation, he closed two of
      Lockheed's missile manufacturing plants. On January 10, 1996, he
      was elected to the board of directors; on July 1, 1996, he was appointed
      president and chief operating officer. That year, Lockheed Martin amassed
      $27 billion in revenue.
    

      IN THE HOT SEAT
    

      On August 1, 1997, Coffman became chief executive officer and vice
      chairman of the board at Lockheed Martin. He was well liked because of his
      friendly, honest manner and had big plans for the company, wanting to
      boost space-systems and information-systems technology. He quickly became
      an outspoken advocate for his views. Yet, problems were brewing thanks to
      poor communication between Lockheed Martin's top management and its
      division leaders. The F-22 fighter aircraft under joint development with
      Boeing was $2.1 billion over budget, and Theater High Altitude Area
      Defense missiles being developed for the U.S. Army failed to function
      properly. In spite of these setbacks, Lockheed Martin netted $1.2 billion
      in 1998. That year, Coffman became chairman of the board.
    

      By the end of 1999 rumors were rife that Coffman was about to be replaced.
      Sales for the C-130J military transport aircraft were far below
      projections; defense projects were beset by overrunning costs; and Titan
      and Athena rockets exploded at launch, destroying three $100 million spy
      satellites. From January 1 to June 10, 1999, Lockheed Martin cut eight
      thousand jobs. From May to November, its stock value declined 55 percent;
      the company was $11 billion in debt. In June, Coffman was called to the
      Pentagon to explain Lockheed's failures. For the first time since
      the 1960s, Lockheed lost a spy-satellite contract; the $6 billion project
      instead went to Boeing.
    

      Not all news was bad news, however. Lockheed Martin quickly forged a
      partnership with Daimler Chrysler Aerospace (of Germany) and Alenia (of
      Italy) to build the Medium Extended Air Defense System (MEADS), designed
      to protect front-line troops. Coffman was an advocate of open cooperation
      among defense allies, and this project was a highlight of his efforts. The
      company netted $575 million and by the end of the year had $50 billion in
      back orders.
    

      In 2000 Coffman reorganized Lockheed Martin, consolidating its
      manufacturing into three divisions: electronic, aeronautical, and
      astronautical. He expanded his company's commercial operations by
      purchasing Comsat for $2.7 billion, the cost of which was largely
      responsible for Lockheed Martin's posting a net loss of $519
      million in 2000. On the positive side, Lockheed Martin's Patriot
      Advanced Capability–3 missile was chosen for MEADS, and the company
      added $39 billion in new orders. Throughout Lockheed Martin's
      successful business dealings, Coffman continued to be a passionate public
      advocate for his vision of a NATO alliance that offered equal access to
      all member nations' defense projects.
    

      In 2001 Lockheed Martin had 20 successful rocket launches, and it landed a
      $7 billion contract for 80 F-16s from the United Arab Emirates. That year
      Lockheed Martin also landed the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter contract for
      $200 billion, to be spent over the next two decades. In 2003 Lockheed
      Martin had a company-record $32 billion in revenue, 25 percent of which
      came from information technology. Yet, the company's stock declined
      by 11 percent, part of a worldwide decline in technology stocks. Although
      the board of directors wanted him to remain, Coffman planned to leave the
      CEO post on August 6, 2004, and he planned to retire as chairman of the
      board in April 2005, citing a desire to begin a new stage of his life.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:
