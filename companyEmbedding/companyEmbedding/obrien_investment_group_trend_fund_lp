CHICAGO and NEW YORK, June 15, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- O'Brien Investment Group (OBIG) has launched the OBIG Discretionary Global Macro Fund, managed by Monica Fuentes, Ph.D. The hedge fund will be open to public participation starting July 1 and available to sophisticated market participants such as accredited institutional investors and large family offices. The Fund will offer a Founders Share Class for the first $100 million of assets under management (AUM), available with a $250,000 minimum investment.








A futures-only version of the strategy was launched last month, available exclusively in a managed futures separately managed account. The minimum for a futures-only managed account is $2 million.
John W. O'Brien, Jr., OBIG CEO, said: "A year and half ago, Monica joined the firm to build out our global macro trading team and operations. During that time, she has been managing proprietary capital in preparation of the launch.  We are thrilled to have someone with Monica's character and pedigree at the helm of our global macro group. She spent eight years in New York and London working at Goldman Sachs on its Global Macro Trading Desk and on the Global Markets Strategy Team. Monica also spent two years working for Comac Capital as a Portfolio Manager in London for its $6 billion Global Macro Fund. Her Ph.D. in Economics from Columbia University is an excellent educational background for a strategy that is discretionary and fundamentally based, focused on event-driven, thematic and relative value trades."
Fuentes, Portfolio Manager and Chief Investment Officer of OBIG, said: "For a global macro manager, 2016 proved to be a year in which events like Brexit and the U.S. Presidential election drove the markets. I believe this year and next will be similar, with event-driven trades dominating the type of trade we will be entering. We believe the German elections, Italian elections and the Trump agenda, just to name a few, will have a major impact on the global financial and commodity markets."
About O'Brien Investment GroupA member of the National Futures Association (NFA), O'Brien Investment Group is registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). The firm has offices in New York and Chicago. OBIG was founded by the O'Brien family, with roots in futures trading dating back to 1914 at R.J. O'Brien & Associates, now the oldest and largest independent futures brokerage and clearing firm and the last surviving founding member of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.  For additional information, please e-mail investor-relations@o-big.com.
Disclaimer*This press release does not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation with respect to the purchase or sale of an interest in any fund or any separately management account. Any offer or solicitation must only be made by the delivery of a confidential Offering Memorandum or managed account Client Information Brochure and Advisory Agreement, which will contain material information included therein. No investor's decision to invest in a fund or separate management account managed by the O'Brien investment Group should be based solely on this press release. No conclusion should be drawn with respect to any specifics of the activities of the Portfolio Manager while at Goldman Sachs and Comac Capital.
The Fund and separately managed accounts are intended for sophisticated investors who understand the risk. Derivative transactions in futures and options are complex and carry a risk of substantial losses. Past results are not indicative of future performance.
