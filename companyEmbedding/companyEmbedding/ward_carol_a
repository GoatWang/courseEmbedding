Exhibit B- Brendan Hawthorne 

						Set in a virtual museum, Exhibit B explores facets of memory and fantasy and how remnants of those memories can be illuminating or disorientating to our well-being as they are inputted and stored upon a hard drive of sub-consciousness.

It is written through the eyes of a seeker visiting influential halls of mirrors displayed on screen in temporary exhibition rooms before they are deleted or given a permanent space by the omni-present guide.

A Pocketful of Memories: War Memories (Recollections and Stories) – Gregg Stokes 

"This 'Fifth Column' apparently consisted of Nazi sympathizers who infiltrated anywhere where information could be gathered, hence the slogans that were invented, 'Careless talk costs lives' and 'Walls have ears.'
From My War Memories by Sylvia Thomas

SYLVIA THOMAS was born and brought up in the west end of Dudley. She originally wrote her war memories for younger members of her own family in attempt to show them what it was like to live through the conflict. However, she went on to present the piece in schools. My War Memories has been on the Kates Hill Press website for a few years now and is one of the most frequently visited items.
TOSSIE PATRICK, author of A Pocketful of Memories - Blackheath, continues bringing the past to life with her recollections of the war as it affected the town, and a young women in work.
EDNA MITCHELL lived out in Wilnecote near Tamworth, very much a rural setting on the fringes of the west midlands conurbation. Much has been written about evacuees from their viewpoint. Edna recalls the evacuees coming to her community.
GREG STOKES has written two stories to accompany these recollections.
Greg spent many hours round at author CLARICE HACKETT’s house. Her husband Wilf used to tell a tale of the time he had to work all weekend in the war. THE LONG SHIFT is based on that tale.
In May 2006 Greg took IRENE M DAVIES, author of A Pocketful of Memories Rowley, to Birmingham to appear on the Carl Chinn Show. On the way back she told him of her time at the Button during the war. The story is reproduced here as LOCK OUT.

A Pocketful of Memories: Coseley (An Unofficial History) – Raymond Smout 

"Hannah Johnson Cox... astounded the Officer on duty, PC Bailey, by confessing to him that she had just pushed her two infant daughters into the canal, at the tunnel."
From The Coseley Tunnel Tragedy.

In A Pocketful of Memories - Coseley, RAYMOND SMOUT indeed describes the Coseley of his youth. But first he takes the reader through his ‘unofficial history’; he charts its beginnings in the ancient Manor of Sedgley, the immense changes brought about by the industrial revolution, its heyday when it was governed by its own Urban District Council, and its eventual demise as Coseley was lost in urban reconfiguration to three different towns.
Raymond’s great grandfather was a founding member of Coseley UDC and it is a story he tells with pride, interspersing the history with anecdotes of people and events. Read about the wakes and of byegone pubs, of Dr Baker the local philanthropist, of Hannah Johnson Cox and the tragic Coseley Tunnel murder, of the 1912 coal strike and the building of the Brummagem New Road.…across which Coseley still stands. A POCKETFUL OF MEMORIES - COSELEY reminds how it got there.
Royalties from this book are being donated to Rowans Hospice, Waterlooville.
