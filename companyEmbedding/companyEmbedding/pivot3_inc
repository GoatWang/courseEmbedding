vSTAC OS  

vSTAC Hyperconverged SolutionsPerformance, Scale and Efficiency to Transform your BusinessPivot3 delivers hyperconverged infrastructure (HCI) solutions that maximize resource utilization, provide high availability that performs and offer flexible deployment options. Unlike conventional HCI solutions that strand critical resources on each node, Pivot3’s distributed scale-out architecture pools each HCI node’s compute and storage capacity for consumption by every VM and application. Pivot3’s patented Scalar Erasure Coding provides remarkably efficient high availability that maintains performance during degraded mode conditions. Start with what you need, and scale compute and storage to meet your specific application requirements.

Performance, Scale & Efficiency for the Modern DatacenterMost HCI solutions rely on replication for data protection, which sacrifices capacity for availability. Pivot3 provides the optimum combination of efficiency, protection, and performance that businesses need.
Maximum Infrastructure UtilizationPivot3’s distributed scale-out architecture aggregates all storage and compute resources into a common pool available to all virtual machines, which enables the platform to support four times the number of VMs as traditional infrastructures. Caching, bandwidth and IOPS, along with storage efficiency and capacity are scaled linearly simply by adding nodes to the cluster.
Efficient High AvailabilityMost HCI solutions rely on replication for data protection, which sacrifices capacity for availability. Pivot3 provides the optimum combination of efficiency, protection, and performance that businesses need. Pivot3’s advanced fault tolerance maintains performance during degraded mode conditions, and sustains business operations after up to five drive failures, or if a node and drive fail concurrently.
Lower TCO & Better ROIvSTAC OS consumes less than 10% overhead, leaving more system resources for VMs and applications. Pivot3’s interoperability with existing storage and application servers allows businesses to leverage their HCI with existing IT investments. In addition to reducing datacenter footprint, Pivot3 delivers maximum capacity utilization and availability with half the nodes and at lower costs than replication-based systems.
Simple, Intelligent ManagementBy converging compute, storage and VM management, Pivot3 automates systems management with capabilities including self-optimizing, self-healing, and self-monitoring. In addition to increasing end-user productivity, the Pivot3 vCenter plugin provides a single-pane-of-glass to simplify management of single and multi-site deployments.

Pivot3 Inc. Key Developments

Pivot3 Names Carlo Garbagnati as Vice President of Engineering
May 23 17
Pivot3 announced Carlo Garbagnati as vice president of engineering. Garbagnati will be responsible for leading the development efforts of company’s entire solution portfolio and driving roadmap execution to sustain the company’s exponential growth and evolution within the market. Garbagnati was most recently the vice president of hyperconverged and NAS engineering at Hitachi, where he led hundreds of engineers on multiple projects for enterprise-class storage solutions, big data and analytics, and hyperconverged and software-defined infrastructures. He has experience as a senior research and development leader in startups as well as large multinational companies, with a deep focus on software-defined storage and hyperconverged infrastructure technologies. Prior to Hitachi, Garbagnati led the engineering efforts at BlueArc. Garbagnati has also held senior leadership positions at several emerging technology companies, including Quantum, Meridian, Parallan and Olivetti.


Pivot3 Announces the Release of Acuity
Apr 25 17
Pivot3 announced the release of Acuity, the industry’s first priority-aware HCI software platform that enables IT to confidently consolidate multiple mixed-application workloads onto a single infrastructure while also delivering breakthrough performance. Pivot3’s new Acuity software platform delivers greater performance, scale and efficiency across a wider range of applications to overcome these limitations. Acuity simplifies workload management with Pivot3’s fifth-generation policy-based management engine and comprehensive data services. As a priority-aware software platform, Acuity intelligently and automatically applies resources to mission-critical applications for guaranteed performance and predictable results. Acuity’s advanced policy-based management engine has been optimized to make the most efficient use of NVMe PCIe flash to deliver six times the performance of conventional HCI solutions. This means IT can improve response times for databases, enterprise applications, business analytics and VDI. Acuity also delivers increased density, enabling IT to run two to three times more virtual machines per HCI node, resulting in a smaller datacenter footprint and significant reductions in OPEX and CAPEX. Acuity is architected for performance, fully leveraging the acceleration of ultra-low-latency NVMe PCIe flash. With NVMe PCIe flash data path performance, under control of Pivot3’s advanced policy-based Quality of Service (QoS) engine, organizations can consolidate performance- and latency-sensitive applications onto HCI with flash that is 450% faster than SATA SSD and 119% faster than SAS SSD.


Pivot3 and Intelligent Security Systems Announces Original Equipment Manufacturer Agreement
Apr 4 17
Pivot3 announced a strategic original equipment manufacturer relationship with Intelligent Security Systems (ISS). Under the agreement, ISS will license the Pivot3 hyperconverged infrastructure (HCI) platform and integrate it with ISS video management software (VMS) to supply more robust security intelligence and video storage options to customers. The addition of Pivot3 HCI solutions, which are optimized for the write-intensive demands of video surveillance workloads, is a natural complement to ISS video surveillance technologies. The ISS framework manages and monitors an unlimited number of cameras and devices, applies intelligent video analytics and integrates a variety of disparate systems into one centralized interface. This approach allows users to leverage video data to achieve new levels of security intelligence and situational awareness. Through its partnership with Pivot3, ISS will provide tailor made solutions as well as enterprise-class video analytics in a scalable architecture that is easy to deploy and simple to manage. The platform's architecture is optimized for IP video to prevent video loss and image quality degradation. Pivot3's highly available software-defined storage technology ensures previously recorded video remains accessible even if entire appliances go offline. This extreme resiliency ensures critical data is protected and available for security, liability, business intelligence and risk management requirements. Additionally, systems can easily be expanded as needs grow without disrupting operations, while other applications, such as access control, visitor management and video analytics, can be consolidated on the Pivot3 system to further reduce costs and improve reliability.
