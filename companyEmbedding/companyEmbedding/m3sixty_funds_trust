Relentless innovation in metal wall panels
Dri-Design is a 100 % recyclable, pressure equalized rain-screen, architectural metal wall panel system that attaches to nearly any substrate without the use of clips or extrusions. It is not laminated, nor a composite material, so panels will never delaminate. Dri-Design does not require joint sealants, gaskets, or butyl tape, and therefore eliminates the staining and maintenance associated with them. It is manufactured efficiently and installs faster than any comparable product, saving time and money.
Additionally, Dri-Design’s patented design has passed the most stringent air, water and structural testing requirements in the industry, including the AAMA 508-07 test for pressure equalized rain-screens, as well as Miami Dade County Hurricane testing.
All of this in a system that provides endless design possibilities, with an unlimited palate of colors, finishes, materials, textures and custom perforations including imaging.
Dri-Design hits the mark where both form and function meet.
