Optimism and Opportunity on a Global Scale for Industrial REITs






9/22/2014 | By Michele LernerAs the global economy continues to regain its footing, the industrial REITs that are so vital to the flow of commerce are seeing some positive tailwinds in their favor. In particular, the emergence of a middle class in China and Brazil and the rise of e-commerce in Europe and Japan are creating an environment for success for industrial REITs with a global presence. Industrial REITs are also benefitting from the demand for facilities that can meet growing demand for quick—even same-day—retail deliveries to consumers.
“There are advantages to being a global player,” says Chris Caton, vice president and head of research at U.S.-based industrial REIT Prologis (NYSE: PLD). “First, our customers are global, so we need to provide them with services everywhere they are. We can help them grow their business, too, because we can do things like work with a Japanese retailer in France or vice-versa.”
Global companies also can ratchet up or down development, acquisition, disposition and operational strategies by market, instead of being tied to one locale, Caton says.
As an asset class, the industrial sector is focused around distribution centers whose tenants are global, such as Amazon, says Scott Crowe, managing director and global portfolio manager for Resource Real Estate.
“Right now, these industrial REITs are responding to the redesigned supply chain and the need for more efficient assets and automation,” he says. “We came out of this recession with a different economy, with technologies emerging that change where people work and how they live. We haven’t had a change on the supply side for 20 years, so the industrial sector is in the midst of addressing that.”

Demand Drivers in the Industrial Sector
Given the lack of modern facilities, there is huge potential to improve the efficiency of logistics in China, Japan and Brazil, says Jeffrey Schwartz, co-founder and chairman of the executive committee of Singapore-based industrial REIT Global Logistic Properties (SGX: GLP).
“The demands of domestic consumption are not being adequately met by the logistics infrastructure in China and Brazil, resulting in logistics costs as a percentage of GDP twice as high as developed countries,” he says.
Caton says the industrial sector is impacted most by consumers and retail performance. Globally there are opportunities in countries with an emerging consumer class. In Japan, where the economy doesn’t grow as rapidly, there are opportunities because of the reconfiguration of the supply chain, he says.
“The primary demand driver in the U.S. and on a global basis in this sector is the need for state-of-the-art space for tenants,” says John W. Guinee, III, managing director with Stifel Nicolaus. “Just a decade ago everyone wanted a bigger centralized distribution center, but now people want e-commerce facilities to be more automated than a typical distribution center, taller and to have parking for trailers and for the people who work there. They’re still centralized, but now they’re centralized in areas with tight demographics so they can reach more people faster.”
Schwartz says that domestic consumption is a key driver of demand for his company. More than 80 percent of its portfolio caters to that segment of the market.
“In China, continuing urbanization and rising household incomes continue to drive domestic consumption,” Schwartz says. “In Japan and Brazil, demand for our facilities is driven by systematic supply chain modernization as companies move towards outsourcing logistics and shift from a strategy of owning warehouses to leasing them.”
Schwartz says space leased by e-commerce customers in China has increased at a compound annual growth rate of 105 percent, while its share of total logistics-leased area has increased from 4 percent in 2010 to 25 percent today. Transportation/express delivery clients driven by e-commerce have also expanded rapidly within the firm’s platform, up from nearly zero in 2010 to 8 percent today. In Japan and Brazil, e-commerce-related customers make up 11 percent and 21 percent of Global Logistics’ leased area, respectively, he says.

Supply Constraints in the Industrial Sector
Caton says the transition to a more global economy over the past 30 years has changed the industrial property sector.
“The location of warehouses used to be driven by taxes, but now there’s a demographic shift to be closer to larger numbers of consumers because of the emphasis among retailers of next-day delivery,” says Jon Petersen, vice president of equity research at MLV & Co. “This is not only in the U.S., but also in Europe, Singapore, Hong Kong and Tokyo.”
Right now, industrial REITs are benefitting from a lack of supply, so they’re enjoying above-average rent growth and above-average occupancy rates, according to Petersen.
“In Asia, lack of supply means there’s not much opportunity for acquisitions, so everything is ground-up development,” Petersen says. “In Europe, there’s mostly older product with a high rate of obsolescence, which gives companies an opportunity to buy up existing warehouses and redevelop them.”
In Europe, just like in the U.S., Caton says everything’s on the table in the industrial sector: acquisitions, redevelopment and development.
“Europe is a different case than Asia and Latin America, although it’s a growth market for logistics, too,” Caton says. “The European market is only about 15 years old, in part because it wasn’t a unified market until the rise of the euro and the decline of trade barriers. Now that it’s emerging as one market, there’s a role for us in solving supply-chain issues.”

Challenges for Global Industrial REITs
The basic challenges of working with customers who are located in different time zones and speak a variety of languages are relatively easy to overcome, according to Guinee. Yet, he says industrial REITs that invest overseas face other challenges, too, such as access to land in convenient locations near highways and ports. In his experience, favorable infrastructure features are the exception rather than the rule in less-developed countries.
Caton points to a handful of other potential roadblocks in international markets.
“There are some local challenges, such as in Brazil, where the hilly topography means we have to level mountains to build,” he says. “In Japan, we have to build seismic-resistant buildings due to the threat of natural disasters and multi-story buildings because of the expensive land there.”
Guinee also notes that industrial real estate companies face two other significant challenges: legal issues and taxes.
“In the U.S., we work under the rule of law for things like zoning, permits and approvals,” Guinee says. “Overseas, most REITs need a joint-venture partner or to hire exceptionally knowledgeable and senior local people. Also, when U.S. REITs go overseas they’re subject to the tax laws of that particular country, so those developments are far less attractive from a tax perspective.”

Expectations Remain High for the Near Term
The industrial sector needs a recovering economy to thrive, and that has only recently started to take hold, according to Caton.
“People are underestimating the strength of this real estate market,” Caton says. “I think a constrained recovery is a good thing for the industrial sector. Rental growth should be good for the next 12 to 24 months.”
Petersen also says he expects the industrial sector to outperform for another year or longer. He says Asia’s relative strength during the recession suggests that while there will still be growth there, it’s likely to be at a more moderate rate. In Europe, he anticipates a longer period of rent growth because the region is still near the beginning of the recovery.
For many companies in the space, like Global Logistics, growth is likely to be accompanied by more building.
“Given the compelling opportunities we see across all of our markets, we remain confident in our ability to accelerate growth and target to initiate $2.7 billion of development starts in China, Japan and Brazil in [2015], up 38 percent year-on-year,” Schwartz says. Those projects include annual increases in development expenditures in China on the order of 30 percent to 40 percent for the next three to five years.

MapletreeLog to raise some S$607m through rights issue
Mapletree Logistics Trust is planning to raise nearly S$607 million through a renounceable rights issue.
It is issuing about 831 million rights units at 73 Singapore cents each, representing a 21.4 per cent discount to MapletreeLog’s volume weighted average price on June 24.
Unit holders will get three rights units for every four units held.
The net proceeds will be used to finance or refinance the acquisition of certain properties by MapletreeLog, to repay bank borrowings and for working capital.
MapletreeLog said the rights issue will strengthen its balance sheet, reduce its aggregate leverage significantly to about 38 per cent and give it flexibility to pursue yield-accretive acquisitions.
Mapletree Investments, the sponsor of the trust, said it will take up its full entitlement of 30.16 per cent of the rights issue. – CNA/vm

MP REIT secures nearly 20% rent rise for 226,000sf of Ngee Ann City space
Macquarie Prime Real Estate Investment Trust (MP REIT) has secured 19.75 percent higher rent from its tenant Toshin Development.
But when contacted, MP REIT declined to reveal details of the rent, saying it is confidential.
Toshin is the master lessee for about 226,000 square feet of retail space in Ngee Ann City.
The new rent will be locked in for three years from June 8 this year.
MP REIT says this is expected to account for a 7.2% increase in its annualised distribution per unit.
As at 31 March 2008, the Toshin master lease made up a quarter of the gross rent of MP REIT’s portfolio.
MP REIT owns about 27 percent of the strata title interest in Ngee Ann City, comprising 256,000 square feet of retail net lettable area and 141,000 square feet in office net lettable area.
The Toshin area is occupied by luxury retailers such as Louis Vuitton, Chanel, Piaget and Burberry. – CNA/ir

Indiabulls raises S$262m after pricing IPO units at S$1
Indiabulls Properties Investment Trust has raised S$262 million from its initial public offering after pricing its units at S$1 each.
This is at the lower end of its indicative range of S$1.00 to S$1.10. Analysts said the lower pricing could be a sign of a subdued IPO market.
Indiabulls had offered 262 million units to investors. It also extended the closing date for its IPO to Friday, June 6.
Based on the offer price of S$1 per unit, the trust has a forecast distribution per unit of 5.12 Singapore cents in 2009 and 9.82 Singapore cents in 2010.
Indiabulls is India’s third-largest property developer and is listed on the Bombay Stock Exchange and the National Stock Exchange of India.
Its main businesses span from project management, construction services and IT parks to hotels and resorts.

Singapore-listed REITs trading below 12-month price targets set by analysts
Amid the market turmoil in the past half year, Singapore-listed real estate investment trusts, or REITs, have been under pressure.
They are now trading below their 12-month price targets set by analysts.
But market-watchers said that they’re optimistic REITs have not lost their appeal among investors and they expect the REITs sector to keep growing.
It’s been a honeymoon period since the first REIT was launched in Asia in 2001. Investors in the region, including Singapore caught on, seeing these trusts as a good play on the property sector.
But now, some investors said that REITs may have had their day in the sun, having sold off more than 15 per cent in value since last year.
Still, there are others who argue that the selling was overdone.
Todd Canter, CEO, LaSalle Investment Management Securities, said: “We think the sector traded off more than was justified. And in fact today, if you look at overall borrowing costs, which was the main concern for the stocks trading off, borrowing costs for the REITs remain essentially unchanged from the beginning of 2007.”
Some market-watchers said that a combination of a correction in the REITs market, plus the impact of the sub-prime crisis in the US, is unlikely to affect the performance of REITs in the long run.
They are positive that fundamentals continue to be relatively good for most real estate companies around the world.
But industry watchers said they’re confident REITs will continue to be attractive to investors despite the current cyclical correction in the REITs market.
Chris Reilly, Director of Property, Asia, Henderson Global Investors, said: “Even though it’s seen less interest than it has in the last couple of years when the market was healthier, it still has been very defensive. It’s been more defensive than property stocks in the last year to date. So, I think, obviously that still has a place within investor portfolios.”
Their advice to investors when considering REITs is to look at the quality of the management and underlying assets.
Peter Mitchell, CEO, Asian Public Real Estate Association, said: “The thing we have to remember about REITs is that they are a proxy for holding real estate directly. And the underlying real estate markets throughout Asia, the fundamentals of those markets remain very strong.”
Among the REITs in Singapore seen holding up well are those tied to the office property sector.
Some industry watchers said rising office rentals will continue to boost the performance of these trusts.
Retail and logistics REITs are also expected to perform well. – CNA/vm

One of the homes is located in Yokohama City, Kanagawa Prefecture and the other is in Ibaraki City, Osaka.
The vendor of both properties is nursing home operator ZECS Community Co.
Under the sale and leaseback agreements, ZECS CC will lease back 100% of the space at each property for 15 years, with an option to extend the leases for an additional five years.
Parkway says demand for high-quality nursing homes is expected to soar in a country where more than a quarter of all Japanese will be at least 65 years old by 2025.
It expects to fund both investments by debt, which will increase the REIT’s gearing from 8% to 11%.
The investments are expected to be completed on 30 May this year. – CNA/ir

CapitaMall Trust buys The Atrium@Orchard development for S$840m
CapitaMall Trust (CMT) has bought The Atrium@Orchard office development for about S$840 million.
CMT said the purchase from the Singapore Land Authority (SLA) will be funded by a mix of debt and convertible bonds.
Describing the acquisition as yield-accretive, the Trust plans to issue at least S$650 million worth of bonds.
The Atrium@Orchard is a commercial development comprising two Grade A office towers and some ground floor retail space.
CMT plans to integrate the development with the Plaza Singapura shopping mall next door which it also owns.
Deputy Chairman of CapitaMall Trust Management Liew Mun Leong said the proposed merger of the two properties will create one of the largest integrated developments along Orchard Road.
The combined property will have about 170m of prime retail frontage and over 900,000 sq ft of net lettable space.
The acquisition will also grow CMT’s asset size by 15 percent to some S$6.9 billion.
With the latest purchase, CMT has revised its local target asset size from S$8 billion to S$9 billion by 2010.

Frasers Centrepoint Trust plans to refurbish suburban malls
Following the S$13 million makeover of Anchorpoint Shopping Centre, Frasers Centrepoint Trust has plans to turn its attention to other suburban malls under its stable.
Anchorpoint’s new look appears to be getting the thumbs up from retailers.
Lee Hsien Yang, chairman of Fraser & Neave, said: “Anchorpoint used to be occupied by furniture shops, but I think we felt there was a niche in the market for this kind of concept, so we mixed it with food and beverage. We think people will come and try, and we think we have some interesting restaurants here.”
Rents have gone up by 40 percent following the makeover to as much as S$7.50 psf.
Since refurbishments were completed in March this year, the mall has seen a jump of almost 20 percent in shopper traffic and Frasers expects this to increase substantially going forward.
Frasers’ next step is an almost S$40 million expansion of Northpoint, which is due to complete in mid-2009. This will be followed by works on Yew Tee Mall, which comes under its wing next year, and Bedok Mall by 2011.
The REIT said it is continuing to look for overseas potential.
Christopher Tang, CEO of Frasers Centrepoint Trust, said: “We are looking into the emerging market of Vietnam. We are looking at some of the malls there and other than that, we already have two malls in China that are under development. We will be launching a smaller suburban mall in Australia soon.”
Despite the anticipated global economic slowdown, Frasers said it remains bullish about Singapore’s retail and urban mall sector.
The latest numbers show that retail sales rose by a better-than-expected 5.6 percent in March, compared to a year ago. – CNA/so

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
