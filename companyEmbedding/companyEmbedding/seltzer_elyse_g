Dr William Prince appointed to role of Senior Vice President, Clinical Science

Vienna / Philadelphia, 21 May 2015: Nabriva Therapeutics AG, a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company engaged in the research and development of novel anti-infective agents to treat serious infections, with a focus on the pleuromutilin class of antibiotics, today announced the appointment of Elyse Seltzer, MD, as Chief Medical Officer. Dr Seltzer assumes the role from Dr William Prince, who will transition to Senior Vice President, Clinical Science.  

Based in Philadelphia, Dr Seltzer will supervise medical and regulatory aspects of clinical development and medical affairs for Nabriva and contribute to the company’s clinical development strategy. She will work closely with Dr Steven Gelone, the recently appointed Chief Development Officer at Nabriva, as well as the clinical operations team, to execute Nabriva’s clinical development program, including the planned Phase 3 clinical trials of lefamulin for the treatment of community-acquired bacterial pneumonia (CABP). Dr Prince will be responsible for the Phase 1 and scientific programs required to support the lefamulin development program for CABP and additional indications.   

Dr Colin Broom, Chief Executive Officer of Nabriva, commented on the appointment: “We are very pleased to welcome Elyse to Nabriva. Her extensive experience in the anti-infective therapeutic area, and in leading international clinical development programs will enable us to efficiently advance our lead product, lefamulin, into late stage development for the treatment of CABP. We have established a world class clinical development leadership team to advance our pipeline with a sense of urgency to address an area of significant medical need.”

Elyse Seltzer, newly appointed Chief Medical Officer of Nabriva, added: “I am thrilled to join Nabriva. I am excited to have the opportunity to advance a novel class of antibacterials, particularly given the current and evolving challenges around resistance to currently available antibiotics.  I look forward to working with the highly experienced clinical team to fulfil this goal."

Dr Seltzer has a strong track record in clinical development within the pharmaceutical industry. She joins Nabriva from GlaxoSmithKline (GSK), where she was Vice President of Global Clinical Sciences and Operations. Prior to joining GSK, Dr Seltzer was Chief Medical Officer at Tengion, a regenerative medicine company. She has also held roles at Centocor and Vicuron, where she led the dalbavancin clinical development program. Dr Seltzer began her industry career in Anti-Infectives Clinical Research and Development at SmithKline Beecham (now GSK). Before joining the pharmaceutical industry, she practiced clinical Infectious Diseases medicine.

Notes to editors
About Nabriva Therapeutics AG 
Nabriva Therapeutics is a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company engaged in the research and development of novel anti-infective agents to treat serious infections, with a focus on the pleuromutilin class of antibiotics.  

Nabriva’s lead pleuromutilin product candidate, lefamulin, is prepared to enter two international Phase 3 clinical trials for the treatment of community-acquired bacterial pneumonia (CABP). Nabriva believes that lefamulin is well suited for use as a first-line empiric monotherapy for the treatment of CABP because of  its novel mechanism of action, spectrum of activity, including against multi-drug resistant pathogens, achievement of substantial drug concentrations in lung tissue and fluids, availability as both an intravenous (IV) and oral formulation and favorable safety and tolerability profile.  The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has designated the IV formulation of lefamulin as a qualified infectious disease product (QIDP) and granted fast track designation to this formulation of lefamulin. 
Additional potential opportunities for lefamulin include use in pediatric patients and for the treatment of ventilator-associated bacterial pneumonia (VABP), hospital-acquired bacterial pneumonia (HABP), acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections (ABSSSI), sexually transmitted infections (STIs), osteomyelitis and prosthetic joint infections.

Nabriva has also identified a topical pleuromutilin product candidate, BC-7013, which has completed a Phase 1 clinical trial, and has an ongoing preclinical research program focused on evaluating pleuromutilin compounds with enhanced activity against Gram-negative bacteria, referred to as extended-spectrum pleuromutilins (ESPs).

Boxed Wholesale app: Warehouse shopping without the annual fee - CNET











Boxed Wholesale app: Warehouse shopping without the annual fee
Love to buy in bulk? Boxed brings big-box club shopping to your phone or tablet. But are the savings really there?

                                                    Screenshot by Rick Broida/CNET
                                                Wholesale clubs promise to save you money on popular household goods, provided you're willing to pay an annual membership fee, buy items in (often comically large) bulk sizes, and devote half your Saturday to crowded aisles and slow-moving lines.Boxed Wholesale brings bulk shopping to your mobile device -- it's available for Android and iOS -- the idea being to give you the same savings as a big-box store, but without the membership fee. Or the long drive. Or the exhausting Saturday afternoon. (Also not included: free food samples. Which, considering my impulsive nature, is maybe a good thing.)A quick perusal of the Boxed app reveals many of the same things I find at my local Costco: a two-pack of Multi-Grain Cheerios ($7.99), a 54-count box of Keurig Starbucks House Blend K-Cups ($39.99), Milk-Bone Flavor Snacks (8 pounds, $11.99), and so on.These are all dry goods, of course -- there's no produce in the mix, nor anywhere near the selection of a Costco or even your local grocery. But Boxed does have a growing selection of organic products, and most orders ship free. The first one does, anyway, though there's a minimum purchase on subsequent orders if you want to bag free shipping. (The amount of that minimum varies by state, according to Boxed's FAQ.)

 The app lets you browse various categories (Household, Grocery, Kids and Diapers, and so on) or search for specific items. There's also a Stuff on Sale section where you can hunt the deepest price cuts.

 I will note that it's a little tough to comparison-shop unless you're actually strolling through, say, a Costco while looking at Boxed. I do know that the aforementioned box of K-Cups, for example, sells for $31.99 at Costco, and in fact was on sale for $28.99 just this past weekend. But Boxed sells a 250 square foot roll of Reynold's Wrap tinfoil for $7.99; a two-pack of the same from Amazon would run you close to $20.In other words, there are savings to be had, even if not every item is available at the absolute lowest price. Ultimately you're getting the convenience of bulk shopping from the comfort of a handheld app. I'm not saying you'll want to give up your Costco membership, merely that Boxed can save you a lot of time stocking up on things you use regularly.
