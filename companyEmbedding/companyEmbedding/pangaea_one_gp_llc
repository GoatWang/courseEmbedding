ESCROW AGREEMENT

 

ESCROW AGREEMENT
(“Agreement”) dated __________ 2014 by and among
QUARTET HOLDCO LTD., a Bermuda company (“Holdco”),
GREGORY MONAHAN (the “Representative”), as the
representative of the former stockholders of QUARTET MERGER CORP.,
a Delaware corporation (“Quartet”), EDWARD COLL,
ANTHONY LAURA, LAGOA INVESTMENTS, PANGAEA ONE, L.P., PANGAEA ONE
PARALLEL FUND (B), L.P. and PANGAEA ONE PARALLEL FUND, L.P.
(together the “Stockholders”) and CONTINENTAL STOCK
TRANSFER & TRUST COMPANY, as escrow agent (the “Escrow
Agent”).

 

Holdco, Quartet, Quartet Merger Sub,
Ltd., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Holdco (“Merger
Sub”), Pangaea Logistics Solutions Ltd.
(“Company”) and the Stockholders as the former
securityholders of the Company are the parties to an Agreement and
Plan of Reorganization dated as of
                             
, 2014 (the “Merger Agreement”) pursuant to which (i)
Quartet has merged with and into Holdco, with Holdco being the
surviving entity of such merger and (ii) Merger Sub has merged with
and into the Company, with the Company being the surviving entity
of such merger and remaining a wholly-owned subsidiary of Holdco.
Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, Holdco is to be indemnified in
certain respects. The parties desire to establish an escrow fund as
the sole remedy for the indemnification obligations set forth in
Article VII of the Merger Agreement. The Stockholders, together
with their permitted transferees, are referred to herein as the
“Owners”. Capitalized terms used herein that are not
otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings ascribed to them
in the Merger Agreement.

 

The parties agree as
follows:

 

1.                 
(a)      Concurrently with the execution
hereof, each of the Stockholders (or Holdco, on their behalf) is
delivering to the Escrow Agent, to be held in escrow pursuant to
the terms of this Agreement, stock certificates in the amounts set
forth in Schedule A hereto issued in the name of such Stockholder
representing a portion of the shares of Holdco Shares issued to
such Stockholder in the Transaction Merger. The Holdco Shares
represented by the stock certificates so delivered by the
Stockholders to the Escrow Agent are herein referred to in the
aggregate as the “Escrow Fund.” The Escrow Agent shall
maintain a separate account for each Stockholder’s, and,
subsequent to any transfer permitted pursuant to Paragraph 1(d)
hereof, each Owner’s, portion of the Escrow Fund.

 

(a)               
The Escrow Agent hereby agrees to act as escrow agent and to hold,
safeguard and disburse the Escrow Fund pursuant to the terms and
conditions hereof. It shall treat the Escrow Fund as a trust fund
in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and not as the
property of Holdco. The Escrow Agent’s duties hereunder shall
terminate upon its distribution of the entire Escrow Fund in
accordance with this Agreement.

 

(b)              
Except as herein provided, the Owners shall retain all of their
rights as shareholders of Holdco with respect to shares of Holdco
Stock constituting the Escrow Fund during the period the Escrow
Fund is held by the Escrow Agent (the “Escrow Period”),
including, without limitation, the right to vote their shares of
Holdco Stock included in the Escrow Fund.

 





 








 




  

(c)               
During the Escrow Period, all dividends payable in cash with
respect to the shares of Holdco Stock included in the Escrow Fund
shall be paid to the Owners, but all dividends payable in stock or
other non-cash property (“Non-Cash Dividends”) shall be
delivered to the Escrow Agent to hold in accordance with the terms
hereof. As used herein, the term “Escrow Fund” shall be
deemed to include the Non-Cash Dividends distributed thereon, if
any.

 

(d)              
During the Escrow Period, no sale, transfer or other disposition
may be made of any or all of the shares of Holdco Stock in the
Escrow Fund except (i) to a “Permitted Transferee” (as
hereinafter defined), (ii) by virtue of the laws of descent and
distribution upon death of any Owner, or (iii) pursuant to a
qualified domestic relations order; provided, however, that such
permissive transfers may be implemented only upon the respective
transferee’s written agreement to be bound by the terms and
conditions of this Agreement. As used in this Agreement, the term
“Permitted Transferee” shall include: (1) members of a
Stockholder’s “Immediate Family” (as hereinafter
defined); (2) an entity in which (A) a Stockholder and/or members
of a Stockholder’s Immediate Family beneficially own 100% of
such entity’s voting and non-voting equity securities, or (B)
a Stockholder and/or a member of such Stockholder’s Immediate
Family is a general partner and in which such Stockholder and/or
members of such Stockholder’s Immediate Family beneficially
own 100% of all capital accounts of such entity; (3) a revocable
trust established by a Stockholder during his lifetime for the
benefit of such Stockholder or for the exclusive benefit of all or
any of such Stockholder’s Immediate Family; and (4) any
Affiliate. As used in this Agreement, the term “Immediate
Family” means, with respect to any Stockholder, a spouse,
parent, lineal descendants, the spouse of any lineal descendant,
and brothers and sisters (or a trust, all of whose current
beneficiaries are members of an Immediate Family of the
Stockholder). As used in this Agreement, “Affiliate”
means, as applied to any Person, any other Person directly or
indirectly controlling, controlled by or under direct or indirect
common control with, such Person. For purposes of this definition,
“control” (including with correlative meanings, the
terms “controlling,” “controlled by” and
“under common control with”), as applied to any Person,
means the possession, directly or indirectly, of the power to
direct or cause the direction of the management and policies of
such Person, whether through the ownership of voting securities, by
contract or otherwise. As used in this Agreement,
“Person” means any individual, corporation (including
any non-profit corporation), general partnership, limited
partnership, limited liability partnership, joint venture, estate,
trust, company (including any limited liability company or joint
stock company), firm or other enterprise, association,
organization, entity or governmental entity. In connection with and
as a condition to each permitted transfer, the Permitted Transferee
shall agree in writing to be bound by the terms and conditions of
this Agreement. Upon receipt of such agreement, the Escrow Agent
shall deliver to Holdco’s transfer agent the original stock
certificate out of which the assigned shares are to be transferred,
and shall request that Holdco issue new certificates representing
(m) the number of shares, if any, that continue to be owned by the
transferring Stockholder, and (n) the number of shares owned by the
Permitted Transferee as the result of such transfer. Holdco, the
transferring Stockholder and the Permitted Transferee shall
cooperate in all respects with the Escrow Agent in documenting each
such transfer and in effectuating the result intended to be
accomplished thereby. During the Escrow Period, no Owner shall
pledge or grant a security interest in such Owner’s shares of
Holdco Stock included in the Escrow Fund or grant a security
interest in such Owner’s rights under this
Agreement.

2.                 
(a)      Holdco, acting through the
Representative, may make a claim for indemnification pursuant to
the Merger Agreement (“Indemnification Claim”) against
the Escrow Fund by giving notice (a “Notice”) to the
Stockholder Nominee (defined below), with a copy to the Escrow
Agent, specifying (i) the covenant, representation, warranty,
agreement, undertaking or obligation contained in the Merger
Agreement which it asserts has been breached or otherwise entitles
Holdco to indemnification, (ii) in reasonable detail, the nature
and dollar amount of any Indemnification Claim, (iii) whether the
Indemnification Claim is a Basic Indemnification Claim or an
Environmental Indemnification Claim, and (iv) whether the
Indemnification Claim results from a Third Party Claim against
Holdco or the Company. The Representative also shall deliver to the
Escrow Agent (with a copy to the Stockholder Nominee), concurrently
with its delivery to the Escrow Agent of the Notice, a
certification as to the date on which the Notice was delivered to
the Stockholders. As used herein, “Basic Indemnification
Claim” means an Indemnification Claim other than an
Environmental Indemnification Claim.

 

(b)              
If the Stockholder Nominee shall give a notice to the
Representative (with a copy to the Escrow Agent and Holdco) (a
“Counter Notice”), within 30 days following the date of
receipt (as specified in the Representative’s certification)
by the Stockholder Nominee of a copy of the Notice, disputing
whether the Indemnification Claim is indemnifiable under the Merger
Agreement, the Representative and Stockholder Nominee shall attempt
to resolve such dispute by voluntary settlement as provided in
paragraph 2(c) below. If no Counter Notice with respect to an
Indemnification Claim is received by the Escrow Agent from the
Stockholder Nominee within such 30-day period, the Indemnification
Claim shall be deemed to be an Established Claim (as hereinafter
defined) for purposes of this Agreement.

 

(c)               
If the Stockholder Nominee delivers a Counter Notice to the
Representative and the Escrow Agent, the Representative and
Stockholder Nominee shall, during the period of 60 days following
the delivery of such Counter Notice or such greater period of time
as the parties may agree to in writing (with a copy to the Escrow
Agent), attempt to resolve the dispute with respect to which the
Counter Notice was given. If the Representative and Stockholder
Nominee shall reach a settlement with respect to any such dispute,
they shall jointly deliver written notice of such settlement to the
Escrow Agent specifying the terms thereof. If the Representative
and Stockholder Nominee shall be unable to reach a settlement with
respect to a dispute, such dispute shall be resolved by arbitration
pursuant to paragraph 2(d) below.

 

(d)              
If the Representative and Stockholder Nominee cannot resolve a
dispute prior to expiration of the 60-day period referred to in
paragraph 2(c) above (or such longer period as the parties may have
agreed to in writing), then such dispute shall be submitted (and
either party may submit such dispute) for arbitration in accordance
with Section 8.

 

(e)               
As used in this Agreement, “Established Claim” means
any (i) Indemnification Claim deemed established pursuant to the
last sentence of paragraph 2(b) above, (ii) Indemnification Claim
resolved in favor of Holdco by settlement pursuant to paragraph
2(c) above, resulting in an award to Holdco, (iii) Indemnification
Claim established by the decision of an arbitrator pursuant to
paragraph 2(d) above, resulting in a dollar award to Holdco, (iv)
Third Party Claim that has been sustained by a final determination
(after exhaustion of any appeals) of a court of competent
jurisdiction, or (v) Third Party Claim that the Representative and
Stockholder Nominee have jointly notified the Escrow Agent has been
settled in accordance with the provisions of the Merger Agreement;
provided that, subject to the terms of the Merger Agreement,
notwithstanding anything herein, no Indemnification Claim by Holdco
shall become an Established Claim unless and until the aggregate
amount of indemnification Losses exceeds (i) $2,000,000 (the
“ Deductible ”), in which event only the amount
of such Established Claim(s) in excess of the Deductible shall be
payable. The aggregate liability for Losses shall not in any event
exceed the Escrow Shares in the case of Basic Indemnity Claims or
the Environmental Indemnity Shares in the case of Environmental
Indemnity Claims.

 





-3-








 




  

(f)               
(i)        Promptly after an
Indemnification Claim becomes an Established Claim, the
Representative and Stockholder Nominee shall jointly deliver a
notice to the Escrow Agent (a “Joint Notice”) directing
the Escrow Agent to pay to Holdco, and the Escrow Agent promptly
shall deliver Escrow Shares to Holdco, the dollar amount of which
shall equal the Loss (as defined in the Merger Agreement) resulting
from the Established Claim (or, if at such time there remains in
the Escrow Fund less than the full amount so payable, the full
amount remaining in the Escrow Fund).

 

(ii)              
Payment of an Established Claim shall be made from Escrow Shares
pro rata from the account maintained on behalf of each Owner. For
purposes of each payment, such shares shall be valued at the
“Fair Market Value” (as defined below). However, in no
event shall the Escrow Agent be required to calculate Fair Market
Value or make a determination of the number of shares to be
delivered to Holdco in satisfaction of any Established Claim;
rather, such calculation shall be included in and made part of the
Joint Notice. The Escrow Agent shall transfer to Holdco out of the
Escrow Fund that number of shares of Holdco Stock necessary to
satisfy each Established Claim, as set out in the Joint Notice. Any
dispute between the Representative and Stockholder Nominee
concerning the calculation of Fair Market Value or the number of
shares necessary to satisfy any Established Claim, or any other
dispute regarding a Joint Notice, shall be resolved between the
Representative and Stockholder Nominee in accordance with the
procedures specified in paragraph 2(d) above, and shall not involve
the Escrow Agent. Each transfer of shares in satisfaction of an
Established Claim shall be made by the Escrow Agent delivering to
Holdco one or more stock certificates held in each Owner’s
account evidencing not less than such Owner’s pro rata
portion of the aggregate number of shares specified in the Joint
Notice, together with assignments separate from certificate
executed in blank by such Owner and completed by the Escrow Agent
in accordance with instructions included in the Joint Notice. Upon
receipt of the stock certificates and assignments, Holdco shall
deliver to the Escrow Agent new certificates representing the
number of shares owned by each Owner after such payment. The
parties hereto (other than the Escrow Agent) agree that the
foregoing
