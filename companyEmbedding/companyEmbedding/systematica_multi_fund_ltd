Information for investors in Switzerland: Any distribution of interests in the Funds in Switzerland is exclusively made to, and directed at, qualified investors (“Qualified Investors”), as defined in the Swiss Collective Investment Schemes Act of 23 June 2006, as amended, and its implementing ordinance. Any Funds which are Delaware limited partnerships are not being distributed in Switzerland and are not available for subscription by investors in Switzerland. Accordingly, the Funds have not been and will not be registered with the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority. If a Swiss representative has been appointed in respect of a Fund, offering materials relating to interests in that Fund may be made available to Qualified Investors in Switzerland solely by the Swiss representative and/or authorised distributors. Swiss representative (where appointed): Mont-Fort Funds AG, 63 Chemin Plan-Pra, 1936 Verbier, Switzerland.

Information for investors in Australia: To the extent that this document is issued by SISPL, this document has been prepared without taking into account the objectives, financial situation or needs of Australian persons who receive this document.  Before making an investment decision, Australian persons who receive this document should consider the offering memorandum and assess whether the product is appropriate given your objectives, financial situation or needs. This document is only to be made available to 'wholesale investors' under the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth).
Information for investors in Singapore: The Funds are not authorised or recognised by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (“MAS”) and interests in any Funds are not allowed to be offered to the retail public. This communication and any other communication or material in connection with the offer, sale, invitation for subscription or purchase of interests in any Fund may not be circulated or distributed, nor may interests in any Fund be offered, sold or be made the subject of an invitation for subscription or purchase, whether directly or indirectly, to the public or any member of the public in Singapore other than a person who is an accredited investor or an institutional investor (each as defined under the Securities and Futures Act (Chapter 289) of Singapore) (“SFA”) or unless otherwise permitted under any applicable exemption. This communication and any other communication or material issued in connection with the offer or sale is not a prospectus as defined in the SFA and has not been registered as a prospectus with the MAS. Accordingly, statutory liability under the SFA in relation to the content of prospectuses would not apply. Each prospective investor should consider carefully whether the investment is suitable for him.
SIL, as general partner of SILP (SIL together with SILP and each of their subsidiaries and affiliates, the “Systematica Group”), was appointed as investment manager of the Funds on 1 January 2015 upon the “spin-out” of the Systematica Group. Any Fund performance information in this communication relating to dates prior to 1 January 2015 illustrates the performance of the Funds whilst its predecessors were appointed as investment manager to the Funds. There is no guarantee that past performance of the Funds will be replicated under the management of the Systematica Group.
This communication is not intended to constitute, and should not be construed as, investment advice, investment recommendations or investment research. Potential investors in the Funds should seek their own independent financial, tax, legal and other advice. This communication has been provided to you for informational purposes only and may not be relied upon by you in evaluating the merits of investing in any securities or interests referred to herein or for any other purpose. This communication is not intended as and is not to be taken as an offer or solicitation with respect to the purchase or sale of any security or interest, nor does it constitute an offer or solicitation in any jurisdiction, including those in which such an offer or solicitation is not authorised or to any person to whom it is unlawful to make such a solicitation or offer. Before making any investment decision you should obtain independent legal, tax, accounting or other professional advice, as appropriate, none of which is offered to you by SIL, SISL or any of their affiliates. None of SIL, SISL or any of their affiliates accepts any duty of care to you in relation to any investment in the Funds.
The terms of investment in any of the Funds described herein or any other Fund are solely as set out in the relevant Fund's prospectus or private placement memorandum (including any supplements thereto), as the case may be, application forms and/or memorandum and articles of association or limited partnership agreement, as the case may be (collectively, the “Fund Documents“). Before acquiring an interest in any Fund, each prospective investor is required to confirm that it has carefully reviewed the various risks of an investment in the Fund, as set out in the Fund Documents, and is required to acknowledge and agree to the existence of any actual and potential conflicts of interests described in the Fund Documents and waive, to the fullest extent permitted by any applicable law, any claim with respect to the existence of any such conflicts.
This communication may contain simulated performance results achieved by means of the retroactive application of the adviser’s investment methodology, or the real-time application of a hypothetical capital allocation to such strategy. Hypothetical performance results have many inherent limitations, some of which are described below. No representation is being made that any particular trading program will or is likely to achieve profits or losses similar to those shown. In fact, there are frequently sharp differences between hypothetical performance results and the actual results subsequently achieved by any particular trading program. One of the limitations of hypothetical performance results is that they are generally prepared with the benefit of hindsight. In addition, hypothetical trading does not involve financial risk, and no hypothetical trading record can completely account for the impact of financial risk in actual trading. For example, the ability to withstand losses or to adhere to a particular trading program in spite of trading losses are material points which can also adversely affect actual trading results. There are numerous other factors related to the markets in general or to the implementation of any specific trading program which cannot be fully accounted for in the preparation of hypothetical performance results and all of which can adversely affect actual trading results.
Although the information in this communication is believed to be materially correct as at the date of issue, no representation or warranty is given as to the accuracy of any of the information provided. Furthermore no representation or warranty is given in respect of the correctness of the information contained herein as at any future date. Certain information included in this communication is based on information obtained from third-party sources considered to be reliable. Any projections or analysis provided to assist the recipient of this communication in evaluating the matters described herein may be based on subjective assessments and assumptions and may use one among alternative methodologies that produce different results. Accordingly, any projections or analysis should not be viewed as factual and should not be relied upon as an accurate prediction of future results. Furthermore, to the extent permitted by law, SISL, SIL, SILP, the Funds, and their affiliates, agents, service providers and professional advisers assume no liability or responsibility and owe no duty of care for any consequences of any person acting or refraining to act in reliance on the information contained in this communication or for any decision based on it.
PAST PERFORMANCE IS NOT NECESSARILY INDICATIVE OF FUTURE RESULTS. The actual performance realised by any given investor will depend on numerous factors and circumstances. This communication may include returns for various indices. These indices are not intended to be direct benchmarks for a particular Fund, nor are they intended to be indicative of the type of assets in which a particular Fund may invest. The assets invested in by any of the Funds will likely be materially different from the assets underlying these indices, and will likely have a significantly different risk profile. Target returns, volatility and Sharpe ratio figures quoted are targets only and are based over the long term on the performance projections of the investment strategy and market interest rates at time of modelling and therefore may change.
Interests in the Funds and other investments and investment services to which this communication relates are only available to the persons referred to in the relevant paragraphs above, and other persons should not act on the information contained herein.
Any decision to purchase securities or interests with respect to any of the Funds described herein must be based solely upon the information contained in the Fund Documents, which must be received and reviewed prior to any investment decision. Any person subscribing for an investment must be able to bear the risks involved (including the risk of a total loss of capital) and must meet the suitability requirements relating to such investments. Some or all alternative investment programs may not be suitable for certain investors.
Among the risks we wish to call to the particular attention of prospective investors are the following: (1) each Fund's investment programme is speculative in nature and entails substantial risks; (2) the investments of each Fund may be subject to sudden and large falls in price or value and there could be a large loss upon realisation of a holder’s investment, which could equal the total amount invested; (3) as there is no recognised market for many of the investments of the Funds, it may be difficult or impossible for a Fund to obtain complete and/or reliable information about the value of such investments or the extent of the risks to which such investments are exposed; (4) the use of a single adviser group could mean a lack of diversification and, consequently, higher risk, and may depend upon the services of key personnel, and if certain or all of them become unavailable, the Funds may prematurely terminate; (5) an investment in a Fund is illiquid and there is no secondary market for the sale of interests in a Fund and none is expected to develop; (6) there are restrictions on transferring interests in a Fund; (7) SIL and its affiliates may receive performance-based compensation, which may result in riskier investments, and the Funds’ fees may offset trading profits; (8) the Funds are subject to certain conflicts of interest; (9) certain securities and instruments in which the Funds may invest can be highly volatile; (10) the Funds may be leveraged; (11) a substantial portion of the trades executed for the Funds take place on non-U.S. exchanges; (12) changes in rates of exchange may also have an adverse effect on the value, price or income of the investments of each Fund; and (13) the Funds are not mutual funds pursuant to and therefore not subject to regulation under the Investment Company Act.

One of the limitations of hypothetical performance results is that they are generally prepared with the benefit of hindsight. In addition, hypothetical trading does not involve financial risk, and no hypothetical trading record can completely account for the impact of financial risk in actual trading. For example, the ability to withstand losses or to adhere to a particular trading program in spite of trading losses are material points which can also adversely affect actual trading results. There are numerous other factors related to the markets in general or to the implementation of any specific trading program which cannot be fully accounted for in the preparation of hypothetical performance results and all of which can adversely affect actual trading results.
Although the information in this communication is believed to be materially correct as at the date of issue, no representation or warranty is given as to the accuracy of any of the information provided. Furthermore no representation or warranty is given in respect of the correctness of the information contained herein as at any future date. Certain information included in this communication is based on information obtained from third-party sources considered to be reliable. Any projections or analysis provided to assist the recipient of this communication in evaluating the matters described herein may be based on subjective assessments and assumptions and may use one among alternative methodologies that produce different results. Accordingly, any projections or analysis should not be viewed as factual and should not be relied upon as an accurate prediction of future results. Furthermore, to the extent permitted by law, SISL, SIL, SILP, the Funds, and their affiliates, agents, service providers and professional advisers assume no liability or responsibility and owe no duty of care for any consequences of any person acting or refraining to act in reliance on the information contained in this communication or for any decision based on it.
PAST PERFORMANCE IS NOT NECESSARILY INDICATIVE OF FUTURE RESULTS. The actual performance realised by any given investor will depend on numerous factors and circumstances. This communication may include returns for various indices. These indices are not intended to be direct benchmarks for a particular Fund, nor are they intended to be indicative of the type of assets in which a particular Fund may invest. The assets invested in by any of the Funds will likely be materially different from the assets underlying these indices, and will likely have a significantly different risk profile. Target returns, volatility and Sharpe ratio figures quoted are targets only and are based over the long term on the performance projections of the investment strategy and market interest rates at time of modelling and therefore may change.
Interests in the Funds and other investments and investment services to which this communication relates are only available to the persons referred to in the relevant paragraphs above, and other persons should not act on the information contained herein.
Any decision to purchase securities or interests with respect to any of the Funds described herein must be based solely upon the information contained in the Fund Documents, which must be received and reviewed prior to any investment decision. Any person subscribing for an investment must be able to bear the risks involved (including the risk of a total loss of capital) and must meet the suitability requirements relating to such investments. Some or all alternative investment programs may not be suitable for certain investors.
Among the risks we wish to call to the particular attention of prospective investors are the following: (1) each Fund's investment programme is speculative in nature and entails substantial risks; (2) the investments of each Fund may be subject to sudden and large falls in price or value and there could be a large loss upon realisation of a holder’s investment, which could equal the total amount invested; (3) as there is no recognised market for many of the investments of the Funds, it may be difficult or impossible for a Fund to obtain complete and/or reliable information about the value of such investments or the extent of the risks to which such investments are exposed; (4) the use of a single adviser group could mean a lack of diversification and, consequently, higher risk, and may depend upon the services of key personnel, and if certain or all of them become unavailable, the Funds may prematurely terminate; (5) an investment in a Fund is illiquid and there is no secondary market for the sale of interests in a Fund and none is expected to develop; (6) there are restrictions on transferring interests in a Fund; (7) SIL and its affiliates may receive performance-based compensation, which may result in riskier investments, and the Funds’ fees may offset trading profits; (8) the Funds are subject to certain conflicts of interest; (9) certain securities and instruments in which the Funds may invest can be highly volatile; (10) the Funds may be leveraged; (11) a substantial portion of the trades executed for the Funds take place on non-U.S. exchanges; (12) changes in rates of exchange may also have an adverse effect on the value, price or income of the investments of each Fund; and (13) the Funds are not mutual funds pursuant to and therefore not subject to regulation under the Investment Company Act.

DISCLOSURE
Deutsche Bank Securities Inc.
On August 26, 2004, in connection with the 2002 industry-wide governmental and
	regulatory investigations into research and analysts practices, Deutsche Bank
	Securities Inc. ("DBSI") reached a settlement agreement with the Securities and
	Exchange Commission, the National Association of Securities Dealers, the New York
	Stock Exchange and the New York Attorney General, and with other state regulators
	arising from an investigation of research analyst independence. Under the terms of
	the settlement, DBSI agreed to pay $87.5 million.
On June 3, 2009, DBSI settled proceedings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange
	Commission, the New Jersey Department of Securities and the New York Attorney
	General in connection with various claims under the federal securities laws and
	state common law arising out of the sale of auction rate preferred securities and
	auction rate securities (together, "ARS"). Under the terms of the settlements, DBSI
	was required to, among other things, offer to buy back ARS purchased by certain
	customers from DBSI, reimburse certain customers who took out loans secured by ARS
	and compensate eligible customers who sold their ARS below par value. In connection
	with the settlements, a number of state securities commissions issued final orders
	against DBSI.

Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Inc.
On December 6, 2016, a final judgment (“Judgment”) was entered against Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Inc. (“Stifel Nicolaus”) by the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin (Civil Action No. 2:11-cv-00755) resolving a civil lawsuit filed by the U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) in 2011 involving violations of several antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws in connection with the sale of synthetic collateralized debt obligations (“CDOs”) to five Wisconsin school districts in 2006.
As a result of the Order:
- Stifel is required to cease and desist from committing or causing any violations and any future violations of Section 17(a)(2) and 17(a)(3) of the Securities Act; and
- Stifel and David Noack, a former employee, are jointly liable to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest of $2.44 million. Stifel was also required to pay a civil penalty of $22.5 million. The Judgment also required Stifel to distribute $12.5 million of the ordered disgorgement and civil penalty to the school districts involved in this matter.
Simultaneously with the entry of the Judgment, the SEC issued an order granting Stifel waivers from the application of the disqualification provisions of Rule 506(d)(1)(iv) of Regulation D and Rule 262(b)(2) of Regulation A under the Securities Act (the “Securities Act Waivers”) and a no-action letter granting relief from the disqualification provisions of Rule 206(4)-3 under the Advisers Act (the “Advisers Act Waiver”). The SEC also exempted Choice Financial Partners, Inc., 1919 Investment Counsel, LLC and Ziegler Capital Management, LLC (“Stifel Affiliates”) from section 9(a) of the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the “Investment Company Act Exemption”) through the issuance of a temporary order. Unless the SEC orders a hearing, a permanent order will be issued in 2017 and will be posted to the SEC’s EDGAR database.
Copies of the Judgment, Securities Act Waiver, Advisers Act Waiver and ’40 Act Exemption are available on the SEC’s website:
- Judgment: https://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2016/lr23700-final-judgment.pdf

DISCLAIMER
This communication is issued: (i) for all purposes, except for issue into the United States or issue to U.S. persons or issue into Australia or to Australia persons, by Systematica Investments Services Limited (“SISL”); (ii) only for the purposes of issue   into the United States or issue to U.S. persons, by Systematica Investments Limited (“SIL”) acting solely in its capacity as general partner of Systematica Investments LP (“SILP”); and (iii) only for the purposes of issue into Australia or to Australian persons, by Systematica Investments Singapore Pte. Limited ("SISPL"). SISL is authorised and regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority of the United Kingdom (the “FCA”). SIL is registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission as an investment adviser under the U.S. Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended, and with the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission as a commodity trading advisor and a commodity pool operator and is a member of the U.S. National Futures Association in such capacity. SIL as general partner of SILP is licensed and regulated by the Jersey Financial Services Commission (the “JFSC”) under the Financial Services (Jersey) Law 1998 (the “FSJL”) to conduct fund services business in and from within Jersey. The JFSC does not take any responsibility for the financial soundness of the Funds (as defined below) or for the correctness of any statements made or expressed herein. The JFSC is protected by the FSJL against liability arising from the discharge of its functions under that law.  SISPL is exempt from the requirement to hold an Australian financial services licence in respect of the financial services it provides to 'wholesale investors' in Australia (as that term is defined in the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth)) and is regulated by the Monetary Authority of Singapore under the laws of Singapore which differ from Australian laws.
To the extent that this communication is issued by SISL, the following applies. This communication is issued in the United Kingdom by SISL on the basis that it is issued by an exempt person in accordance with Article 16 of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (Financial Promotion) Order 2005. None of the funds described herein or any other fund in respect of which SIL acts as investment manager (each, a “Fund” and together the “Funds”) is a recognised collective investment scheme for the purposes of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 of the United Kingdom (the “Act”). The promotion of each of the Funds and the distribution of this communication in the United Kingdom is accordingly restricted by law. This communication is being issued inside and outside the United Kingdom only to and/or is directed only at persons who are professional clients or eligible counterparties for the purposes of the FCA’s Conduct of Business Sourcebook. SISL is not acting for, or advising, investors in the Funds and is not responsible for providing such investors with the protections available under the UK regulatory system.
To the extent that this communication is issued by SIL, this communication has been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the FSJL and any other legislation, regulations and orders which may be applicable from time to time, together with the requirements of any relevant codes of practice and guidance issued by the JFSC from time to time (the “JFSC Regulatory Requirements”). The information contained herein is directed by SIL exclusively at persons who are professional clients or eligible counterparties for the purposes of the JFSC Regulatory Requirements, or, if to U.S. persons (as defined under Regulation S promulgated under the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”)), to U.S. persons who are both accredited investors (as defined under Regulation D promulgated under the Securities Act) and qualified purchasers (as defined in the U.S. Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “Investment Company Act”)).
The interests in the Funds have not been filed with or approved or disapproved by any regulatory authority of the United States or any state thereof, nor has any such regulatory authority passed upon or endorsed the merits of an offering of a Fund or the accuracy or adequacy of this communication. Any representation to the contrary is unlawful.

Any dissemination or other unauthorised use of this information by any person or entity is strictly prohibited.

Information for investors in Switzerland: Any distribution of interests in the Funds in Switzerland is exclusively made to, and directed at, qualified investors (“Qualified Investors”), as defined in the Swiss Collective Investment Schemes Act of 23 June 2006, as amended, and its implementing ordinance. Any Funds which are Delaware limited partnerships are not being distributed in Switzerland and are not available for subscription by investors in Switzerland. Accordingly, the Funds have not been and will not be registered with the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority. If a Swiss representative has been appointed in respect of a Fund, offering materials relating to interests in that Fund may be made available to Qualified Investors in Switzerland solely by the Swiss representative and/or authorised distributors. Swiss representative (where appointed): Mont-Fort Funds AG, 63 Chemin Plan-Pra, 1936 Verbier, Switzerland. Swiss paying agent (where appointed): Neue Helvetische Bank AG, Seefeldstrasse 215, CH-8008 Zurich, Switzerland. In respect of the distribution of interests in the Funds in and from Switzerland, the place of performance and jurisdiction is the registered office of the Swiss representative.
Information for investors in Australia: To the extent that this document is issued by SISPL, this document has been prepared without taking into account the objectives, financial situation or needs of Australian persons who receive this document.  Before making an investment decision, Australian persons who receive this document should consider the offering memorandum and assess whether the product is appropriate given your objectives, financial situation or needs. This document is only to be made available to 'wholesale investors' under the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth).
Information for investors in Singapore: The Funds are not authorised or recognised by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (“MAS”) and interests in any Funds are not allowed to be offered to the retail public. This communication and any other communication or material in connection with the offer, sale, invitation for subscription or purchase of interests in any Fund may not be circulated or distributed, nor may interests in any Fund be offered, sold or be made the subject of an invitation for subscription or purchase, whether directly or indirectly, to the public or any member of the public in Singapore other than a person who is an accredited investor or an institutional investor (each as defined under the Securities and Futures Act (Chapter 289) of Singapore) (“SFA”) or unless otherwise permitted under any applicable exemption. This communication and any other communication or material issued in connection with the offer or sale is not a prospectus as defined in the SFA and has not been registered as a prospectus with the MAS. Accordingly, statutory liability under the SFA in relation to the content of prospectuses would not apply. Each prospective investor should consider carefully whether the investment is suitable for him.
SIL, as general partner of SILP (SIL together with SILP and each of their subsidiaries and affiliates, the “Systematica Group”), was appointed as investment manager of the Funds on 1 January 2015 upon the “spin-out” of the Systematica Group. Any Fund performance information in this communication relating to dates prior to 1 January 2015 illustrates the performance of the Funds whilst its predecessors were appointed as investment manager to the Funds. There is no guarantee that past performance of the Funds will be replicated under the management of the Systematica Group.
This communication is not intended to constitute, and should not be construed as, investment advice, investment recommendations or investment research. Potential investors in the Funds should seek their own independent financial, tax, legal and other advice. This communication has been provided to you for informational purposes only and may not be relied upon by you in evaluating the merits of investing in any securities or interests referred to herein or for any other purpose. This communication is not intended as and is not to be taken as an offer or solicitation with respect to the purchase or sale of any security or interest, nor does it constitute an offer or solicitation in any jurisdiction, including those in which such an offer or solicitation is not authorised or to any person to whom it is unlawful to make such a solicitation or offer. Before making any investment decision you should obtain independent legal, tax, accounting or other professional advice, as appropriate, none of which is offered to you by SIL, SISL or any of their affiliates. None of SIL, SISL or any of their affiliates accepts any duty of care to you in relation to any investment in the Funds.
The terms of investment in any of the Funds described herein or any other Fund are solely as set out in the relevant Fund's prospectus or private placement memorandum (including any supplements thereto), as the case may be, application forms and/or memorandum and articles of association or limited partnership agreement, as the case may be (collectively, the “Fund Documents“). Before acquiring an interest in any Fund, each prospective investor is required to confirm that it has carefully reviewed the various risks of an investment in the Fund, as set out in the Fund Documents, and is required to acknowledge and agree to the existence of any actual and potential conflicts of interests described in the Fund Documents and waive, to the fullest extent permitted by any applicable law, any claim with respect to the existence of any such conflicts.
This communication may contain simulated performance results achieved by means of the retroactive application of the adviser’s investment methodology, or the real-time application of a hypothetical capital allocation to such strategy. Hypothetical performance results have many inherent limitations, some of which are described below. No representation is being made that any particular trading program will or is likely to achieve profits or losses similar to those shown. In fact, there are frequently sharp differences between hypothetical performance results and the actual results subsequently achieved by any particular trading program. One of the limitations of hypothetical performance results is that they are generally prepared with the benefit of hindsight. In addition, hypothetical trading does not involve financial risk, and no hypothetical trading record can completely account for the impact of financial risk in actual trading. For example, the ability to withstand losses or to adhere to a particular trading program in spite of trading losses are material points which can also adversely affect actual trading results. There are numerous other factors related to the markets in general or to the implementation of any specific trading program which cannot be fully accounted for in the preparation of hypothetical performance results and all of which can adversely affect actual trading results.
Although the information in this communication is believed to be materially correct as at the date of issue, no representation or warranty is given as to the accuracy of any of the information provided. Furthermore no representation or warranty is given in respect of the correctness of the information contained herein as at any future date. Certain information included in this communication is based on information obtained from third-party sources considered to be reliable. Any projections or analysis provided to assist the recipient of this communication in evaluating the matters described herein may be based on subjective assessments and assumptions and may use one among alternative methodologies that produce different results. Accordingly, any projections or analysis should not be viewed as factual and should not be relied upon as an accurate prediction of future results. Furthermore, to the extent permitted by law, SISL, SIL, SILP, the Funds, and their affiliates, agents, service providers and professional advisers assume no liability or responsibility and owe no duty of care for any consequences of any person acting or refraining to act in reliance on the information contained in this communication or for any decision based on it.
PAST PERFORMANCE IS NOT NECESSARILY INDICATIVE OF FUTURE RESULTS. The actual performance realised by any given investor will depend on numerous factors and circumstances. This communication may include returns for various indices. These indices are not intended to be direct benchmarks for a particular Fund, nor are they intended to be indicative of the type of assets in which a particular Fund may invest. The assets invested in by any of the Funds will likely be materially different from the assets underlying these indices, and will likely have a significantly different risk profile. Target returns, volatility and Sharpe ratio figures quoted are targets only and are based over the long term on the performance projections of the investment strategy and market interest rates at time of modelling and therefore may change.
Interests in the Funds and other investments and investment services to which this communication relates are only available to the persons referred to in the relevant paragraphs above, and other persons should not act on the information contained herein.
Any decision to purchase securities or interests with respect to any of the Funds described herein must be based solely upon the information contained in the Fund Documents, which must be received and reviewed prior to any investment decision. Any person subscribing for an investment must be able to bear the risks involved (including the risk of a total loss of capital) and must meet the suitability requirements relating to such investments. Some or all alternative investment programs may not be suitable for certain investors.
Among the risks we wish to call to the particular attention of prospective investors are the following: (1) each Fund's investment programme is speculative in nature and entails substantial risks; (2) the investments of each Fund may be subject to sudden and large falls in price or value and there could be a large loss upon realisation of a holder’s investment, which could equal the total amount invested; (3) as there is no recognised market for many of the investments of the Funds, it may be difficult or impossible for a Fund to obtain complete and/or reliable information about the value of such investments or the extent of the risks to which such investments are exposed; (4) the use of a single adviser group could mean a lack of diversification and, consequently, higher risk, and may depend upon the services of key personnel, and if certain or all of them become unavailable, the Funds may prematurely terminate; (5) an investment in a Fund is illiquid and there is no secondary market for the sale of interests in a Fund and none is expected to develop; (6) there are restrictions on transferring interests in a Fund; (7) SIL and its affiliates may receive performance-based compensation, which may result in riskier investments, and the Funds’ fees may offset trading profits; (8) the Funds are subject to certain conflicts of interest; (9) certain securities and instruments in which the Funds may invest can be highly volatile; (10) the Funds may be leveraged; (11) a substantial portion of the trades executed for the Funds take place on non-U.S. exchanges; (12) changes in rates of exchange may also have an adverse effect on the value, price or income of the investments of each Fund; and (13) the Funds are not mutual funds pursuant to and therefore not subject to regulation under the Investment Company Act.

This communication is issued in the United Kingdom by SISL on the basis that it is issued by an exempt person in accordance with Article 16 of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (Financial Promotion) Order 2005. None of the funds described herein or any other fund in respect of which SIL acts as investment manager (each, a “Fund” and together the “Funds”) is a recognised collective investment scheme for the purposes of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 of the United Kingdom (the “Act”). The promotion of each of the Funds and the distribution of this communication in the United Kingdom is accordingly restricted by law. This communication is being issued inside and outside the United Kingdom only to and/or is directed only at persons who are professional clients or eligible counterparties for the purposes of the FCA’s Conduct of Business Sourcebook.

The information contained herein is directed by SIL exclusively at persons who are professional clients or eligible counterparties for the purposes of the JFSC Regulatory Requirements, or, if to U.S. persons (as defined under Regulation S promulgated under the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”)), to U.S. persons who are both accredited investors (as defined under Regulation D promulgated under the Securities Act) and qualified purchasers (as defined in the U.S. Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “Investment Company Act”)).
The interests in the Funds have not been filed with or approved or disapproved by any regulatory authority of the United States or any state thereof, nor has any such regulatory authority passed upon or endorsed the merits of an offering of a Fund or the accuracy or adequacy of this communication. Any representation to the contrary is unlawful.

THE COMMODITY FUTURES TRADING COMMISSION DOES NOT PASS UPON THE MERITS OF PARTICIPATING IN A TRADING PROGRAM OR UPON THE ADEQUACY OR ACCURACY OF COMMODITY TRADING ADVISOR DISCLOSURE. CONSEQUENTLY, THE COMMODITY FUTURES TRADING COMMISSION HAS NOT REVIEWED OR APPROVED THIS TRADING PROGRAM OR THIS BROCHURE OR ACCOUNT DOCUMENT.

Any Funds which are Delaware limited partnerships are not being distributed in Switzerland and are not available for subscription by investors in Switzerland. Accordingly, the Funds have not been and will not be registered with the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority.

DISCLOSURE
Deutsche Bank Securities Inc.
On August 26, 2004, in connection with the 2002 industry-wide governmental and
	regulatory investigations into research and analysts practices, Deutsche Bank
	Securities Inc. ("DBSI") reached a settlement agreement with the Securities and
	Exchange Commission, the National Association of Securities Dealers, the New York
	Stock Exchange and the New York Attorney General, and with other state regulators
	arising from an investigation of research analyst independence. Under the terms of
	the settlement, DBSI agreed to pay $87.5 million.
On June 3, 2009, DBSI settled proceedings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange
	Commission, the New Jersey Department of Securities and the New York Attorney
	General in connection with various claims under the federal securities laws and
	state common law arising out of the sale of auction rate preferred securities and
	auction rate securities (together, "ARS"). Under the terms of the settlements, DBSI
	was required to, among other things, offer to buy back ARS purchased by certain
	customers from DBSI, reimburse certain customers who took out loans secured by ARS
	and compensate eligible customers who sold their ARS below par value. In connection
	with the settlements, a number of state securities commissions issued final orders
	against DBSI.

Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Inc.
On December 6, 2016, a final judgment (“Judgment”) was entered against Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Inc. (“Stifel Nicolaus”) by the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin (Civil Action No. 2:11-cv-00755) resolving a civil lawsuit filed by the U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) in 2011 involving violations of several antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws in connection with the sale of synthetic collateralized debt obligations (“CDOs”) to five Wisconsin school districts in 2006.
As a result of the Order:
- Stifel is required to cease and desist from committing or causing any violations and any future violations of Section 17(a)(2) and 17(a)(3) of the Securities Act; and
- Stifel and David Noack, a former employee, are jointly liable to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest of $2.44 million. Stifel was also required to pay a civil penalty of $22.5 million. The Judgment also required Stifel to distribute $12.5 million of the ordered disgorgement and civil penalty to the school districts involved in this matter.
Simultaneously with the entry of the Judgment, the SEC issued an order granting Stifel waivers from the application of the disqualification provisions of Rule 506(d)(1)(iv) of Regulation D and Rule 262(b)(2) of Regulation A under the Securities Act (the “Securities Act Waivers”) and a no-action letter granting relief from the disqualification provisions of Rule 206(4)-3 under the Advisers Act (the “Advisers Act Waiver”). The SEC also exempted Choice Financial Partners, Inc., 1919 Investment Counsel, LLC and Ziegler Capital Management, LLC (“Stifel Affiliates”) from section 9(a) of the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the “Investment Company Act Exemption”) through the issuance of a temporary order. Unless the SEC orders a hearing, a permanent order will be issued in 2017 and will be posted to the SEC’s EDGAR database.
Copies of the Judgment, Securities Act Waiver, Advisers Act Waiver and ’40 Act Exemption are available on the SEC’s website:
- Judgment: https://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2016/lr23700-final-judgment.pdf

Summary







 


Overall Rating

2 out of 5 Stars

Morningstar has awarded this fund 2 stars based on its risk-adjusted performance compared to the 91 funds within its Morningstar Category.



How is it determined?


The Overall Morningstar RatingTM for a fund is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its 3-, 5-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics, which are based on risk-adjusted returns, as of the date stated.





3 Yrs





                         Out of
91
 funds
                     	




What does it mean?


A fund's Morningstar Rating is a quantitative assessment of a fund's past performance that accounts for both risk and return, with funds earning between 1 and 5 stars. As always, this rating system is designed to be used as a first step in the fund evaluation process. A high rating alone is not sufficient basis upon which to make an investment decision.











 


Returns


LOW
AVG
HIGH


Below Average


This fund scores Below Average because it delivered returns that were in the bottom 22.5% when compared to other funds within its Morningstar category.





How is it calculated?



This rating is based on a fund's Morningstar Return (its annualized return in excess to the return of the 90-day U.S. Treasury bill over a three-, five-, or ten-year period). The Morningstar Returns in each category are then scored against each other on a bell curve. In each Morningstar Category: top 10% - High next 22.5% - Above Average middle 35% - Average next 22.5% - Below Average bottom 10% - Low




What does it mean?



While past performance is no guarantee of future results, the Morningstar Return shows how the fund has done in the past in comparison to similar funds in its peer group. It does not, however, show the effects of risk.Therefore, the Morningstar Return is most helpful when used in conjunction with the Morningstar Risk Score. For example, an investor could use these two scores when comparing between funds that have the same Morningstar Star Rating and similar Morningstar Risk Adjusted Returns but different levels of risk.










 


Expenses


LOW
AVG
HIGH


Low


This fund's expenses are rated as Low because they are below the 20th percentile when compared with other funds in the category.





How is it calculated?


This Morningstar data point compares the fund's net expense ratio to the net expense ratio of all the other funds within its Morningstar Category grouping.





What does it mean?


Excessive expenses can detract from overall returns and can be a drain on performance. While you should not base any investment decision entirely on expenses or expense ratios, a fund's expense structure may be one factor to consider.











 


Risk of this Type of Fund


LOWER
HIGHER





Morningstar assigns a risk level to each of its mutual fund categories. These risk levels range from 1 for those funds with least amount of risk to 10 for those with the greatest amount of risk.






How is it calculated?



Morningstar calculates these risk levels by looking at the Morningstar Risk of the funds in the Category over the previous 5-year period. Morningstar Risk is the difference between the Morningstar Return, based on fund total returns, and the Morningstar Risk Adjusted Return, based on fund total returns adjusted for performance volatility. The Category Risk Level is based on the equal weighted average Morningstar Risk of the funds in the category.  Morningstar's Research Committee evaluates the Category Morningstar Risk and assigns the Category Risk Level after further qualitative judgment.




What does it mean?



This score can help you understand the risk involved with a particular Morningstar category of funds, which may be helpful in evaluating the risk associated with a specific investment. The Category Risk Level is based on the equal weighted average performance of the funds in the category. It does not reflect the risk associated with any individual fund or the relative risk of a fund within a particular Morningstar category.  Because the score is based on past performance, it may not reflect the future risk of the category. In addition to risk, you should evaluate a fund's investment objective, strategy, fees and other characteristics before making your investment decision.Learn more

Fund Overview




Objective



The investment seeks to achieve long-term capital appreciation.




Strategy



The fund seeks to pursue its investment objective by making a combination of investments (i) directly in an actively managed fixed-income portfolio and (ii) indirectly through its wholly-owned subsidiary in one or more trading companies that provide exposure to a managed futures program of Systematica Investments Limited acting solely in its capacity as general partner of Systematica Investments LP ("Systematica"). It is non-diversified.


Risk



The fund can invest in securities that may have a leveraging effect (such as derivatives and forward-settling securities) which may increase market exposure, magnify investment risks, and cause losses to be realized more quickly. The fund may invest in options. Options trading entails significant risk and is not appropriate for all investors. The fund may invest in commodity-linked investments, which may be more volatile and less liquid than the underlying instruments or measures. In addition, their value may be affected by the performance of the overall commodities markets as well as by weather, disease, and regulatory developments. The commodities industry can be significantly affected by commodity prices, world events, import controls, worldwide competition, government regulations, and economic conditions. The risk of loss in trading foreign currency can be substantial and may be magnified if trading on margin. Customers should therefore carefully consider whether such trading is suitable for them in light of their financial condition, risk tolerance and understanding of foreign markets. These risks include foreign currency risk and liquidation risk. Stock markets, especially foreign markets, are volatile and can decline significantly in response to adverse issuer, political, regulatory, market, or economic developments. Foreign securities are subject to interest rate, currency exchange rate, economic, and political risks. Short positions pose a risk because they lose value as a security's price increases; therefore, the loss on a short sale is theoretically unlimited. May not be suitable for all investors. Additional risk information for this product may be found in the prospectus or other product materials, if available.

Risk


LOW
AVG
HIGH


Above Average

This fund scores Above Average because Morningstar has rated its risk between the 60th and 80th percentiles when compared to other funds within its Morningstar category.




How is it calculated?


Risk is calculated using the Sharpe ratio, which compares portfolio returns to a rate comparable to U.S. Treasury bonds, relative to the fund's overall volatility. For this measure, Morningstar has compared the Sharpe ratio of this fund against all other funds that invest in it's Morningstar Category.




What does it mean?


A higher Sharpe implies better risk-adjusted returns. Therefore, if a fund has a Sharpe ratio higher than its category average, it's returns relative to it's risk were better than other similar funds. If its Sharpe ratio is lower, that's usually a sign that the risk-adjusted returns were lower than other similar funds.










 


Returns


LOW
AVG
HIGH


Below Average


This fund scores Below Average because it delivered returns that were in the bottom 22.5% when compared to other funds within its Morningstar category.





How is it calculated?



This rating is based on a fund's Morningstar Return (its annualized return in excess to the return of the 90-day U.S. Treasury bill over a three-, five-, or ten-year period). The Morningstar Returns in each category are then scored against each other on a bell curve. In each Morningstar Category: top 10% - High next 22.5% - Above Average middle 35% - Average next 22.5% - Below Average bottom 10% - Low




What does it mean?



While past performance is no guarantee of future results, the Morningstar Return shows how the fund has done in the past in comparison to similar funds in its peer group. It does not, however, show the effects of risk.Therefore, the Morningstar Return is most helpful when used in conjunction with the Morningstar Risk Score. For example, an investor could use these two scores when comparing between funds that have the same Morningstar Star Rating and similar Morningstar Risk Adjusted Returns but different levels of risk.










 


Risk of this Type of Fund


LOWER
HIGHER





Morningstar assigns a risk level to each of its mutual fund categories. These risk levels range from 1 for those funds with least amount of risk to 10 for those with the greatest amount of risk.






How is it calculated?



Morningstar calculates these risk levels by looking at the Morningstar Risk of the funds in the Category over the previous 5-year period. Morningstar Risk is the difference between the Morningstar Return, based on fund total returns, and the Morningstar Risk Adjusted Return, based on fund total returns adjusted for performance volatility. The Category Risk Level is based on the equal weighted average Morningstar Risk of the funds in the category.  Morningstar's Research Committee evaluates the Category Morningstar Risk and assigns the Category Risk Level after further qualitative judgment.




What does it mean?



This score can help you understand the risk involved with a particular Morningstar category of funds, which may be helpful in evaluating the risk associated with a specific investment. The Category Risk Level is based on the equal weighted average performance of the funds in the category. It does not reflect the risk associated with any individual fund or the relative risk of a fund within a particular Morningstar category.  Because the score is based on past performance, it may not reflect the future risk of the category. In addition to risk, you should evaluate a fund's investment objective, strategy, fees and other characteristics before making your investment decision.Learn more

Risk



The fund can invest in securities that may have a leveraging effect (such as derivatives and forward-settling securities) which may increase market exposure, magnify investment risks, and cause losses to be realized more quickly. The fund may invest in options. Options trading entails significant risk and is not appropriate for all investors. The fund may invest in commodity-linked investments, which may be more volatile and less liquid than the underlying instruments or measures. In addition, their value may be affected by the performance of the overall commodities markets as well as by weather, disease, and regulatory developments. The commodities industry can be significantly affected by commodity prices, world events, import controls, worldwide competition, government regulations, and economic conditions. The risk of loss in trading foreign currency can be substantial and may be magnified if trading on margin. Customers should therefore carefully consider whether such trading is suitable for them in light of their financial condition, risk tolerance and understanding of foreign markets. These risks include foreign currency risk and liquidation risk. Stock markets, especially foreign markets, are volatile and can decline significantly in response to adverse issuer, political, regulatory, market, or economic developments. Foreign securities are subject to interest rate, currency exchange rate, economic, and political risks. Short positions pose a risk because they lose value as a security's price increases; therefore, the loss on a short sale is theoretically unlimited. May not be suitable for all investors. Additional risk information for this product may be found in the prospectus or other product materials, if available.

The Morningstar RatingTM for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for funds with at least a three-year history. (Exchange-traded funds and open-end mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes.) It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a fund's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of  funds in each fund category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star.

Neither Morningstar nor its content providers are responsible for any damages or losses arising from any use of this information. Fidelity does not review the Morningstar data and, for fund performance, you should check the fund's current prospectus or other product materials for the most up-to-date information concerning applicable loads, fees and expenses.

The "Mutual Funds" area at the top of each page allows access to mutual fund holdings with individual and joint Fidelity non-retirement accounts. Individual stock positions, ETFs and 529 funds are not available through this view. For the full list of your holdings visit Portfolio Summary.Mutual Funds are priced as of the previous business day's market close when the market is open. Mutual fund positions are priced as of the official market close (typically 4p.m.) and prices are generally available between 5 p.m. and 6p.m.

The performance data featured represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results.  Investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate; therefore, you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares.  Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance data quoted.











1. Transaction Fee:A transaction fee is similar to a  brokerage fee or commission which you pay when you buy or sell a stock. For some funds available through Fidelity you are required to pay a transaction fee. However, you will not pay a sales load on Transaction Fee (TF) funds. You will only be charged a transaction fee when you buy a FundsNetwork TF fund, not when you sell one. All other fees and expenses described in a fund's prospectus still apply. You can choose to buy or sell shares directly from the fund itself or its principal underwriter or distributor without paying a transaction fee to Fidelity.Online Transaction Fees:  $49.95 for most funds.  Certain funds will have a transaction fee of $75. To identify any applicable transaction fees associated with the purchase of a given fund, please refer to the "Fees and Distributions" tab.Fidelity Automated Service Telephone (FAST): 25% off representative-assisted rates, Maximum: $187.50, Minimum:$75Representative-Assisted: 0.75% of principal, Maximum: $250, Minimum: $100Automatic Investment: $5 per transaction, after the initial investment.Sales load:A sales charge added to the price of the fund.  Funds have different sales charge structures, including front-end loads, back-end loads (deferred), and no loads. Sales loads can either be charged when a fund is purchased, commonly known as a front-end load, or when a fund is sold, known as a deferred load. Not  all funds charge a load. Refer to the Loads, Expense and Minimums section of the fund's prospectus for details on these amounts. Although no load funds do not have a front-end or deferred load, they may incur other fees, such as a 12b-1 fee.
2. Total returns are historical and include change in share value and reinvestment of dividends and capital gains, if any. Cumulative total returns are reported as of the period indicated.  Life of fund figures are reported as of the commencement date to the period indicated and are cumulative if the fund is less than one year old. Total returns do not reflect the fund's [%] sales charge. If sales charges were included, total returns would have been lower.
3. The Morningstar Category Average is the average return for the peer group based on the returns of each individual fund within the group, for the period shown. This average assumes reinvestment of dividends.
4. This chart illustrates the performance of a hypothetical $10,000 investment made in this investment product (and a benchmark or category average, if shown) from the beginning date shown or on the inception date of the product (whichever is later).  The inception date used for products with underlying funds, or multiple shares classes, or are offered as a separate account, strategy or sub account, may be the inception date of the underlying fund, the earliest share class of the product, or the date composite performance for the product was first made available. The product's returns may not reflect all its expenses. Any fees not reflected would lower the returns. Benchmark returns include reinvestment of capital gains and dividends, if any, but do not reflect any fees or expenses. It is not possible to invest in an index. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. This chart is not intended to imply any future performance of the investment product.
5. Initial minimum investments into group retirement accounts such as Fidelity Simplified Employee Pension-IRA, Keogh, Self-Employed 401(k), and Non-Fidelity Prototype Retirement accounts are $500 or higher. Additional investments into Regular, IRA, and Group accounts are $250 or higher.
6. Any holdings, asset allocation, diversification breakdowns or other composition data shown are as of the date indicated and are subject to change at any time. They may not be representative of the fund's current or future investments. Some breakdowns may be intentionally limited to a particular asset class or other subset of the fund's entire portfolio, particularly in multi-asset class funds where the attributes of the equity and fixed income portions are different. Under the asset allocation section, international (or foreign) assets may be reported differently depending on how an investment options reports its holdings.  Some do not report international (or foreign) holdings here, but instead report them in a "Regional Diversification" section.  Some report them in this section as an to the equity, bond and other allocation shown.  Others report international (or foreign) holding as a subset of the equity and bond allocations shown.  If the allocation without the foreign component (or round to) 100%, then international (or foreign) is a subset of the equity and bond percentage shown.
7. Percent Rank in Category is the fund's total-return percentile rank relative to all funds that have the same Morningstar Category.  The highest (or most favorable) percentile rank is 1 and the lowest (or least favorable) percentile rank is 100. The top-performing fund in a category will always receive a rank of 1. % Rank in Category is based on total returns which include reinvested dividends and capital gains, if any, and exclude sales charges.
8. Expense caps and waivers are limits that the fund company has placed on the level of the expenses borne by the fund until 7/31/2017 and indicates the maximum level of expenses (with certain exceptions) that the fund would be paying until that time. After the expiration date, the expense cap and/or waiver may be terminated or revised, which may lower the fund's yield and return.
