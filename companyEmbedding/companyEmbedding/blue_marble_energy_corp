Blue Marble Energy, founded in 2007, is a U.S. based company which utilizes hybridized bacterial consortia to produce specialty biochemicals and renewable biogas. The company's mission is to provide sustainable, drop in replacement chemicals and solutions to targeted upstream and downstream stakeholders. They develop and generate these biochemicals from diverse, non-virgin cellulosic biomass streams. Blue Marble Biomaterials is a wholly owned subsidiary of Blue Marble Energy.

Facilities[edit]
On August 25, 2011, Blue Marble Energy held their grand opening for their new Small Commercial Biorefinery located in Missoula, Montana. Missoula was chosen in part due to its rail transportation corridor, readily available green-collar workforce, and proximity to the University of Montana.[citation needed]. Blue Marble opened their Large Commercial Biorefinery (also in Missoula, MT) in September 2013 with a capacity of 1,000 metric tons (input) and 10,000 to 15,000 kg (final product output) per month. Blue Marble has publicly announced that they are working with several Fortune 500 companies to design and build a constellation of co-located facilities.
Technology[edit]
Blue Marble’s patented conversion system, Acid, Gas, and Ammonia Targeted Extraction (AGATE) uses non-genetically modified bacteria. It can process a wide variety of organic biomass feedstocks. A single fermentation contains multiple strains of bacteria which specialise in the breakdown of different feedstocks. The resulting consortia of different bacteria "perform well in high nitrogen environments and can withstand shocks to the system (such as changes in pH, temperature, and feedstock). This allows AGATE to process nearly any organic biomass: food waste, yard waste, spent brewery grain, algae, milfoil, corn silage, etc. AGATE can handle both fresh and wet feedstock, and can be adjusted to meet changing economic opportunities and market needs.".[1] Through anaerobic digestion and fermentation, the AGATE platform manipulates microbial environments to produce esters, amides, anhydrous ammonia, and rich biogas.[2]
Algae Harvesting[edit]
In the past, Blue Marble Energy participated in aquatic remediation efforts for the Puget Sound and other waterways around Seattle in an effort to repair damaged ocean ecology damaged by harmful algae blooms and invasive species. This water cleanup may be extended to sewage treatment plants and mine sites in the future.[3]

Facilities[edit]
On August 25, 2011, Blue Marble Energy held their grand opening for their new Small Commercial Biorefinery located in Missoula, Montana. Missoula was chosen in part due to its rail transportation corridor, readily available green-collar workforce, and proximity to the University of Montana.[citation needed]. Blue Marble opened their Large Commercial Biorefinery (also in Missoula, MT) in September 2013 with a capacity of 1,000 metric tons (input) and 10,000 to 15,000 kg (final product output) per month. Blue Marble has publicly announced that they are working with several Fortune 500 companies to design and build a constellation of co-located facilities.
Technology[edit]
Blue Marble’s patented conversion system, Acid, Gas, and Ammonia Targeted Extraction (AGATE) uses non-genetically modified bacteria. It can process a wide variety of organic biomass feedstocks. A single fermentation contains multiple strains of bacteria which specialise in the breakdown of different feedstocks. The resulting consortia of different bacteria "perform well in high nitrogen environments and can withstand shocks to the system (such as changes in pH, temperature, and feedstock). This allows AGATE to process nearly any organic biomass: food waste, yard waste, spent brewery grain, algae, milfoil, corn silage, etc. AGATE can handle both fresh and wet feedstock, and can be adjusted to meet changing economic opportunities and market needs.".[1] Through anaerobic digestion and fermentation, the AGATE platform manipulates microbial environments to produce esters, amides, anhydrous ammonia, and rich biogas.[2]
Algae Harvesting[edit]
In the past, Blue Marble Energy participated in aquatic remediation efforts for the Puget Sound and other waterways around Seattle in an effort to repair damaged ocean ecology damaged by harmful algae blooms and invasive species. This water cleanup may be extended to sewage treatment plants and mine sites in the future.[3]

Facilities[edit]
On August 25, 2011, Blue Marble Energy held their grand opening for their new Small Commercial Biorefinery located in Missoula, Montana. Missoula was chosen in part due to its rail transportation corridor, readily available green-collar workforce, and proximity to the University of Montana.[citation needed]. Blue Marble opened their Large Commercial Biorefinery (also in Missoula, MT) in September 2013 with a capacity of 1,000 metric tons (input) and 10,000 to 15,000 kg (final product output) per month. Blue Marble has publicly announced that they are working with several Fortune 500 companies to design and build a constellation of co-located facilities.
Technology[edit]
Blue Marble’s patented conversion system, Acid, Gas, and Ammonia Targeted Extraction (AGATE) uses non-genetically modified bacteria. It can process a wide variety of organic biomass feedstocks. A single fermentation contains multiple strains of bacteria which specialise in the breakdown of different feedstocks. The resulting consortia of different bacteria "perform well in high nitrogen environments and can withstand shocks to the system (such as changes in pH, temperature, and feedstock). This allows AGATE to process nearly any organic biomass: food waste, yard waste, spent brewery grain, algae, milfoil, corn silage, etc. AGATE can handle both fresh and wet feedstock, and can be adjusted to meet changing economic opportunities and market needs.".[1] Through anaerobic digestion and fermentation, the AGATE platform manipulates microbial environments to produce esters, amides, anhydrous ammonia, and rich biogas.[2]
Algae Harvesting[edit]
In the past, Blue Marble Energy participated in aquatic remediation efforts for the Puget Sound and other waterways around Seattle in an effort to repair damaged ocean ecology damaged by harmful algae blooms and invasive species. This water cleanup may be extended to sewage treatment plants and mine sites in the future.[3]

Blue Marble Energy, founded in 2007, is a U.S. based company which utilizes hybridized bacterial consortia to produce specialty biochemicals and renewable biogas. The company's mission is to provide sustainable, drop in replacement chemicals and solutions to targeted upstream and downstream stakeholders. They develop and generate these biochemicals from diverse, non-virgin cellulosic biomass streams. Blue Marble Biomaterials is a wholly owned subsidiary of Blue Marble Energy.

Facilities[edit]
On August 25, 2011, Blue Marble Energy held their grand opening for their new Small Commercial Biorefinery located in Missoula, Montana. Missoula was chosen in part due to its rail transportation corridor, readily available green-collar workforce, and proximity to the University of Montana.[citation needed]. Blue Marble opened their Large Commercial Biorefinery (also in Missoula, MT) in September 2013 with a capacity of 1,000 metric tons (input) and 10,000 to 15,000 kg (final product output) per month. Blue Marble has publicly announced that they are working with several Fortune 500 companies to design and build a constellation of co-located facilities.
Technology[edit]
Blue Marble’s patented conversion system, Acid, Gas, and Ammonia Targeted Extraction (AGATE) uses non-genetically modified bacteria. It can process a wide variety of organic biomass feedstocks. A single fermentation contains multiple strains of bacteria which specialise in the breakdown of different feedstocks. The resulting consortia of different bacteria "perform well in high nitrogen environments and can withstand shocks to the system (such as changes in pH, temperature, and feedstock). This allows AGATE to process nearly any organic biomass: food waste, yard waste, spent brewery grain, algae, milfoil, corn silage, etc. AGATE can handle both fresh and wet feedstock, and can be adjusted to meet changing economic opportunities and market needs.".[1] Through anaerobic digestion and fermentation, the AGATE platform manipulates microbial environments to produce esters, amides, anhydrous ammonia, and rich biogas.[2]
Algae Harvesting[edit]
In the past, Blue Marble Energy participated in aquatic remediation efforts for the Puget Sound and other waterways around Seattle in an effort to repair damaged ocean ecology damaged by harmful algae blooms and invasive species. This water cleanup may be extended to sewage treatment plants and mine sites in the future.[3]
History[edit]
