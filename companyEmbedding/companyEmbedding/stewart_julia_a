In a few decades' time, she would be doing exactly that.As the CEO, Stewart breathed new life into the beleaguered chain. One strategy she employed was selling IHOP restaurants to franchisees, which upped the company's free cash flow.Other, smaller changes she instituted include selling orange juice not made from concentrate, introducing new menu items like cream-cheese stuffed French toast, and introducing better coffee. As a result, the Glendale, Calif.-based company reported $45 million in profits in 2006, and its stock price has as much as doubled since Stewart took the reins.In 2001, IHOP announced its acquisition of Applebee's International Inc. The product of the buyout is DineEquity Inc., which runs over 3,300 Applebee's and IHOP restaurants. Since the deal, Stewart has focused on resuscitating the grill-and-bar brand.Stewart earned her bachelor's degree in communications at San Diego State University. After stints at restaurant chains Carl's Jr., Burger King, Taco Bell, Stuart Anderson's Black Angus and Applebee's, the San Diego native joined IHOP in 2001 and became its CEO in 2002.FACEBOOKShare on FacebookTWITTERShare on TwitterShare on LinkedinShare by emailShow CommentsSubscribe to the Marketplacenewsletter.Follow the Podcastsupport usCorporate profile: DineEquity Inc.

Deer Resistant Products We Have Tried That Work 


An article by Julia Stewart with 734 words and 1383 views
 









								   Are you frustrated with deer defoliating your prized plants overnight? Are you ready to learn about some products that others have used that really do work ?
This summer we have tested some products that our local garden center and some catalogs offered to see which deer resistant products worked and which ones didn't. The following are the deer deterrents that we tried and the results.
The first product we used was Liquid Fence. This is a natural deer and rabbit repellent. It is true what the cover states... "It really works." Clark Kaskie , the inventor of Liquid Fence, developed this product out of frustration of having his plants eaten by all types of critters. After trying many different kinds of homemade remedies and expensive over the counter products, he decided to make his own repellent. Being a chemical engineer for over 60 years gave him a good idea of where to start. He knew he wanted it to be both environmentally safe and safe for the animals. After a few years of experimenting, he came up with this solution. His friends and wife tried it and told him that it worked "just like a liquid fence," so that's what he named it. All you do is spray the liquid liberally onto plants and their perimeter during a dry period. Repeat the process 1 week later and then approximately once per month thereafter. If areas where feeding pressure from deer and rabbits is intense, he suggests spraying it once a week for 3 weeks and then about once per month after that. You are really "training" the deer and rabbits to stay away. We found that this product smells pretty bad when you first apply it, but it really does work. We had some coneflowers that the rabbits where nipping at the stems. After applying this as directed, the nibbling stopped. We also had success with using it on our hibiscus trees and other annuals, perennials, as well as our gourds.
The second product we tested was The Wireless Deer Fence. It works like a baited electric fence but without the wires. Instead, it contains individual posts, 19 inches tall and weighing 6 ounces, that are positioned around plants that deer like and on deer paths into your yard or garden. The deer in your yard are attracted by a sweet smell to touch a post, then the post will deliver a harmless shock which frightens them from the area. It is recommended to use this product along with a deer resistant spray while you are "training" the deer. The idea is to put the post between 5 and 25+ feet apart where the deer will find them. The distance varies widely depending on terrain existing barriers, landscaping, etc.
We used this product mainly to keep the deer away from my new Pinky-Winkie hydrangeas. We still had a little damage while the deer were being trained, but I hadn't used a deer detterent spray on them at the time. The directions suggest this just while you are "training" the deer. With this product it helps to read all of the directions! I liked The Wireless Deer Fence. My Pinky-Winkies still haven't been eaten. It gives an added protection to using the Liquid Fence.
We tested these products in our 5 acre garden with a variety of deer resistant perennials, such as coneflowers, grasses, and hellebores. Plant as many of these types of plants as possible. That is your first tactic when gardening with deer. For more information on plants that deer don't like, visit http://www.flowers-plants-gardening-advice.com/deer-resistant-plants/. Even after you have planted several deer proof plants, you will still need to protect your other vegetation with some type of product.
As reported in the book Deerproofing Your Yard and Garden, by Rhonda Hart, if you take a look at state agricultural reports, you will see that deer do millions of dollars of damage each year. It's not surprising when you realize that one acre of a healthy environment can support 18-24 deer per square mile. These deer can consume 6 to 10 pounds of greenery per day. This equates to about half a ton of plants over the growing season. So, there goes your yard!
With Liquid Fence and The Wireless Deer Fence, along with planting deer resistant plants, you can at least learn to coexist with the deer and make the damage minimal. Both of these products have a money back guarantee.

Meet the Chefs of “Baking with Julia”
May 18, 2012



In her classic program Baking with Julia, Julia Child shares the kitchen with some of the most well-known and respected chefs of our time. She believed in watching and learning from practiced chefs, gathering ideas from what they demonstrate, and adapting them to our own home kitchens. These master chefs take pride in teaching real, basic techniques that everyday cooks can use successfully in their own kitchens. Learn more about the master chefs and their unique contributions to American cooking in the following biographies.

Meet the Featured Chefs

Charlotte Akoto

Charlotte Akoto’s elaborate pastries at The Old Williamsburg Company are as pleasing to the eye as they are to the palate. Taught by her grandmother in Ghana as a young girl, Charlotte took on the role as the family chef. Moving to New York in the early ’80s, she began to focus on pastries and worked on broadening her baking range at the Drake Swissotel. Although she was only required to prepare simple pastries, Charlotte exercised her creativity and began developing elegant desserts that drew the attention of food lovers, her peers, and New York’s famed Algonquin Hotel. Later moving to The Pierre Hotel and The Old Williamsburg Company, Charlotte’s culinary skills didn’t remain a family secret for long. In the show BAKING WITH JULIA, Charlotte Akoto creates white meringue sandwiches with chocolate cream centers, chocolate meringues with caramel cream filling, and a meringue Napoleon with whipped cream and fruit.

After first striking gold with a fan base of fitness-conscious foodies in L.A., he then cleared a path for his next three restaurants, all named Citronelle, in Santa Barbara, California, Washington D.C., and Baltimore, Maryland.
Nancy Silverton

When loaves of soft white bread stocked bakery shelves and bagels were the biggest breakthrough in breads, Nancy Silverton brought our culinary attention to the soul-satisfying pleasures of artisan baking. She and her chef-husband opened the doors to La Brea Bakery in conjunction with their restaurant Campanile in 1989 after finding no one in the Los Angeles area capable of supplying them with the flavorful crusty loaves that they had sampled in Europe.
Trained at Le Cordon Bleu, Ecole Lenotre, and some of L.A.’s most reputable kitchens, Nancy had become head pastry chef at Spago in the late ’80s, but still yearned to make good bread.
Nancy immersed herself into starters, yeasts, and doughs, and quickly became L.A.’s leading lady of bread baking.
