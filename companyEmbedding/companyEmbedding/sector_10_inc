SECTOR 10 INC RELEASES NEWEST MRU-MOBILE RESPONSE KITCHENS CAPABLE OF FEEDING 2,000 PEOPLE PER UNIT





 View video http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvDdnYXhYzkSector 10, INC. Bellevue Washington, March 3, 2010. OTC Bulletin Board: SECI Frankfurt 4SR1 Sector 10, Inc. announced today the release of its new mobile integration product the Mobile Response Unit or MRU that is available and equipped as a mobile cafeteria-style kitchen. Specially designed for post disaster response the MRU - Kitchen units can be air-dropped or flown in by helicopter and within minutes be set–up with no or minimal instruction to feed up to 2,000 people within minutes. The Mobile Response Unit (MRU - Kitchen) – as a Mobile Kitchen standard list includes the following items: 1-40X40 Shelters (tent providing a 1,600 shelter enclosure) 3-Gas stove tops (6 burners for cooking) (gas not included) 12-(13 liter each) Cooking buckets Stainless with lids 15 -Sets of Serving/cooking tools 2,000 Plates (Reusable washable plastic)  2,000 Knives (Reusable plastic) 2,000 Forks (Reusable plastic)  2,000 Spoons (Reusable plastic)  Water dispenser (with purification) 800 pounds of food mix in each MRU .             Lighting strung on a cord 2,500W portable generator First Aid Kits   Sector 10 CEO, Pericles DeAvila stated, “Mobile Kitchens are needed on the ground after disasters in areas such as Haiti and Chile. As part of the recovery process, food is being delivered by various entities in bulk and Kitchens are a real need on the ground to process the bulk bags and cans that arrive at the disaster. Sector 10’s MRU-Kitchen fills this need. Sector 10 is working with relief organizations in determining how we can best serve the needs of the affected” Sector 10, Inc has received inquires about sending these units to Haiti and now Chile. As we have all seen, the news and the lack of coordination in a disaster environment is still an issue but a packaged solution such as the MRU’s provide a new level of logistics management. “ The Future” Company CEO Pericles DeAvila issued this statement or challenge this morning:  “We are young company bent on making a difference. Due to our current capital position, we are unable to donate the product outright to people in need. We will not use this as an excuse to help people in need. Therefore, we will work with any person, entity or organization that believes making a difference on the ground around the world is essential, be it Chile or Haiti or anywhere in need. We at Sector 10, Inc. commit to you that we will place the product on the ground wherever needed at our cost to you.” To see this MRU model and other models just released go to: http://sector10inc.blogspot.com About Sector 10, Inc.

SECTOR 10 INC RELEASES NEWEST MRU-MOBILE RESPONSE KITCHENS CAPABLE OF FEEDING 2,000 PEOPLE PER UNIT





 View video http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvDdnYXhYzkSector 10, INC. Bellevue Washington, March 3, 2010. OTC Bulletin Board: SECI Frankfurt 4SR1 Sector 10, Inc. announced today the release of its new mobile integration product the Mobile Response Unit or MRU that is available and equipped as a mobile cafeteria-style kitchen. Specially designed for post disaster response the MRU - Kitchen units can be air-dropped or flown in by helicopter and within minutes be set–up with no or minimal instruction to feed up to 2,000 people within minutes. The Mobile Response Unit (MRU - Kitchen) – as a Mobile Kitchen standard list includes the following items: 1-40X40 Shelters (tent providing a 1,600 shelter enclosure) 3-Gas stove tops (6 burners for cooking) (gas not included) 12-(13 liter each) Cooking buckets Stainless with lids 15 -Sets of Serving/cooking tools 2,000 Plates (Reusable washable plastic)  2,000 Knives (Reusable plastic) 2,000 Forks (Reusable plastic)  2,000 Spoons (Reusable plastic)  Water dispenser (with purification) 800 pounds of food mix in each MRU .             Lighting strung on a cord 2,500W portable generator First Aid Kits   Sector 10 CEO, Pericles DeAvila stated, “Mobile Kitchens are needed on the ground after disasters in areas such as Haiti and Chile. As part of the recovery process, food is being delivered by various entities in bulk and Kitchens are a real need on the ground to process the bulk bags and cans that arrive at the disaster. Sector 10’s MRU-Kitchen fills this need. Sector 10 is working with relief organizations in determining how we can best serve the needs of the affected” Sector 10, Inc has received inquires about sending these units to Haiti and now Chile. As we have all seen, the news and the lack of coordination in a disaster environment is still an issue but a packaged solution such as the MRU’s provide a new level of logistics management. “ The Future” Company CEO Pericles DeAvila issued this statement or challenge this morning:  “We are young company bent on making a difference. Due to our current capital position, we are unable to donate the product outright to people in need. We will not use this as an excuse to help people in need. Therefore, we will work with any person, entity or organization that believes making a difference on the ground around the world is essential, be it Chile or Haiti or anywhere in need. We at Sector 10, Inc. commit to you that we will place the product on the ground wherever needed at our cost to you.” To see this MRU model and other models just released go to: http://sector10inc.blogspot.com About Sector 10, Inc. Sector 10, Inc. is redefining the emergency response paradigm from centralized equipment staging to onsite pre-deployed resources. Sector 10 is the only emergency response systems company so strongly emphasizing pre-deployed resources as the way to save lives, avert injuries, reduce liability and to “Bridge the Survival Gap.” Sector 10 has developed the most leading edge emergency response integration equipment available today.

SECTOR 10, Inc. Files Form 10-K to Report Annual Results




















July 15, 2009 07:00 ET

 | Source: Sector 10, Inc.





BELLEVUE, Wash., July 15, 2009 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- SECTOR 10, Inc. (OTCBB:SECI) (Frankfurt:4SR) announced today that it had filed Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2009. The Form 10-K was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on July 14, 2009.


During the fiscal year, the Company continued to reorganize and brought a minimal amount of product to market, carefully testing vertical market opportunities. This testing better positioned the Company for the pending regulations recently released for the new National and International Fire Life Safety Codes. The Company's products and services are compliant with the new code and regulations for high rise buildings. The new code and regulations impact a $196 billion market in the United States alone. The Company is at the end of its development phase and has begun the process to implement its sales and growth strategy.


The Form 10-K includes discussion regarding the following:


Financial results:




 * Generated $532,775 net loss in the final full year of the development 
   phase.
 * Acquired full rights and ownership to $1 Million Network
   Communication System that will administer the PLX-3D system
   nationally.
 * Invested an additional $147,995 in the National Network
   Communication System to enhance Sector 10 products and solutions.
 * Restructured prior year debt and generated gain of $517,200.
 * Negotiated $451,000 in financing at approximately 7.5% per annum.
 * Reported $1,009,008 in paid-in capital in 2009 compared to a
   deficit of ($704,580) in 2008.
 * Reported the total shareholder equity $358,845 in 2009 compared to
   a deficit of ($824,380) in 2008.


Highlights:




 * Continued product testing through initial sales.
 * Successfully completed web conference to demonstrate the benefits
   of the PLX-3D software.
 * Presented demonstrations to potential customers regarding the use
   of the Sector 10 products and solutions including the PLX-3D system.
   Generated prospects for significant unit sales.
 * Development stage is projected to be completed in the 2nd quarter
   of fiscal year ended 2010.  Sales and marketing plan will begin
   implementation.
 * The Company's products and solutions are now in demand for
   buildings around the world due to the recently released fire and life
   safety regulations (code) including the 2009 NFPA Fire Code, 2009
   NFPA Life Safety Code and 2009 International Fire Codes.  Company
   products are compliant with the new code as well as OSHA and other
   regulatory bodies.
 * The Company is seeking new funding in the amount of $5M to $7M to
   assist in the delivery on contracts currently being negotiated.
 * The Company is creating a new Board of Advisors to assist in the
   implementation of the sales and marketing strategy for the next
   fiscal year.
 * The Company is developing a network where they will work in
   connection with charitable humanitarian efforts to provide MRU-
   Clinics to 3rd world countries as a way to save lives, avert
   injuries, reduce liability and to "Bridge the Survival Gap."


Sector 10 CEO Pericles DeAvila stated: "The new regulations are opening up a multi-billion dollar market which represents an opportunity that Sector 10 has championed and pioneered. Now that we ending our development phase, I can only say that management and our investors can look towards prosperous years ahead."
