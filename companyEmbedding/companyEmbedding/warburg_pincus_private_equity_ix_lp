Warburg Pincus Exits Inspire Pharmaceuticals


April 5, 2011







Merck will acquire specialty pharmaceutical company Inspire Pharmaceuticals Inc. in a deal valued at roughly $430 million. Private equity fund Warburg Pincus Private Equity IX, L.P., which owns approximately 28% of the outstanding shares of Inspire, has agreed to tender all of its shares into the offer. Merck will pay $5 per share for Inspire Pharmaceuticals, representing a 26% over the company’s April 4 closing price.
PRESS RELEASE
Merck (NYSE:MRK), known as MSD outside the United States and Canada, and Inspire Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ: ISPH) today announced that they have entered into a definitive agreement under which Merck will acquire Inspire, a specialty pharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing ophthalmic products.
Under the terms of the agreement, Merck, through a subsidiary, will commence a tender offer for all outstanding common stock of Inspire at a price of $5.00 per share in cash, a 26 percent premium to the closing price of Inspire’s common stock on April 4, 2011. The transaction has a total cash value of approximately $430 million. The transaction has been unanimously approved by the boards of directors of both companies and Inspire’s board recommended that the company’s shareholders tender their shares pursuant to the tender offer. In addition, Warburg Pincus Private Equity IX, L.P., which owns approximately 28 percent of the outstanding shares of Inspire, has agreed to tender all of its shares into the offer. 





“Merck continues to build upon its long-term commitment to improving therapeutic options for the treatment of eye diseases,” said Beverly Lybrand, senior vice president and general manager, neuroscience and ophthalmology, Merck. “This acquisition combines the talented commercialization organization at Inspire with the excellent team already in place at Merck thereby strengthening our ophthalmology business and positioning us for future growth with an expanded portfolio. This deal helps address the needs of patients and customers in ophthalmology and creates value for both companies.”
In March, 2011, Merck announced that the New Drug Application (NDA) for SAFLUTAN(R) (tafluprost), an investigational preservative-free prostaglandin analogue ophthalmic solution, had been accepted for standard review by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). SAFLUTAN is the proposed trade name for tafluprost in the United States.
“As one of the world’s leading healthcare companies, Merck is the ideal partner to enhance the long-term potential of Inspire’s portfolio of ophthalmic assets. We are delighted that Merck recognized the strength of an integrated platform leveraging the growing AZASITE(R) (azithromycin ophthalmic solution) 1% product opportunity and the strong relationships within the ophthalmic community cultivated by our high quality, specialty eye care sales force in the U.S.,” said Adrian Adams, president and CEO of Inspire. “Based upon an extensive analysis of various strategic options, as I have outlined since we announced the results of the TIGER-2 Phase 3 clinical trial, we believe this combination provides a compelling and timely opportunity for our shareholders to realize the value of their investment in Inspire.” 





The closing of the tender offer will be subject to certain conditions, including the tender of a number of Inspire shares that, together with shares owned by Merck, represent at least a majority of the total number of Inspire’s outstanding shares (assuming the exercise of all options and vesting of restricted stock units), the expiration of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act and other customary conditions. Upon the completion of the tender offer, Merck will acquire all remaining shares through a second-step merger.
About AZASITE
Indication: AZASITE(R) (azithromycin ophthalmic solution) 1% is indicated for the treatment of bacterial conjunctivitis in patients one year and older caused by the following organisms: CDC coryneform group G*, Haemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus mitis group, and Streptococcus pneumoniae.
Important Selected Safety Information: AZASITE should not be administered systemically, injected subconjunctivally, or introduced directly into the anterior chamber of the eye. In patients receiving systemically administered azithromycin, serious allergic reactions, including angioedema, anaphylaxis, Stevens Johnson Syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis have been reported rarely. Although rare, fatalities have been reported.
As with other anti-infectives, prolonged use may result in overgrowth of non-susceptible organisms, including fungi. If super-infection occurs, discontinue use and institute alternative therapy. Patients should not wear contact lenses if they have signs or symptoms of bacterial conjunctivitis. 





Azithromycin should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed.
The most frequently reported ocular adverse event reported in clinical trials was eye irritation which occurred in 1-2 percent of patients. Other adverse events reported in <1 percent of patients included: ocular reactions (blurred vision, burning, stinging and irritation upon instillation, contact dermatitis, corneal erosion, dry eye, eye pain, itching, ocular discharge, punctate keratitis, visual acuity reduction) and non-ocular reactions (dysgeusia, facial swelling, hives, nasal congestion, periocular swelling, rash, sinusitis, urticaria).

*Efficacy for this organism was studied in fewer than 10 infections.

Inspire's specialty eye care sales force generates revenue from the promotion of AZASITE(R) (azithromycin ophthalmic solution) 1% for bacterial conjunctivitis.

Warburg, Pincus Ventures, L.P. Selling Lifecore Biomedical, Inc. (LCBM) to Landec Corporation (LNDC) for $54 Million  











Tweet








5/3/2010 9:29:33 AM


MENLO PARK, Calif., May 03, 2010 (BUSINESS WIRE) -- Landec Corporation, a materials science company that develops and markets patented polymer products for food, agriculture, personal care and drug delivery applications, today announced that it has acquired Lifecore Biomedical, Inc. from Warburg Pincus Private Equity IX, LP ("Warburg Pincus"). When acquired by Warburg Pincus in March 2008, Lifecore was comprised of two divisions, the Dental Division and the Hyaluronan Division. The Dental Division was merged into a Warburg Pincus portfolio company. The Hyaluronan Division, now Lifecore, based in Chaska, MN, is a leading supplier of premium hyaluronan-based biomaterials for the medical and veterinary markets. Lifecore hyaluronan biopolymers are used in a wide and ever-growing range of therapeutic treatments, including cataract surgery, degenerative joint disease, spinal defect filling, medical device coatings, cosmetic soft tissue enhancement and equine osteoarthritis, as well as in numerous research initiatives. 

"The acquisition of Lifecore significantly advances our stated strategy to acquire a company that expands our capabilities in materials science, specifically in the area of biomaterials," said Gary Steele, Chairman and CEO of Landec. "Hyaluronic acid (HA) is naturally present in the skin, cartilage and fluid of humans and provides lubricating, connective and shock absorbing functions in both joints and soft tissue. Demand for premium, fermented hyaluronan in biomaterial applications is growing. We view Lifecore's hyaluronan biopolymers as a technology platform that can provide unique HA product innovations, as well as new products from potential synergies with Landec's existing Intelimer(R) polymers."

Lifecore's President and CEO, Dennis J. Allingham, added, "We welcome the strategic acquisition of Lifecore by Landec, which strengthens our commitment to the development of technically advanced hyaluronan-based specialty medical products that can offer treatment advantages and compatibility within the human body. We are excited about the potential opportunities to apply Landec's knowledge of polymer technology to our new product concepts as a means to expand our product offerings, bring greater value to our customers and attract market-leading partners."

Under the agreement, Landec acquired the stock of Lifecore for $40.0 million in cash and assumed debt of approximately $4.0 million. In addition, the agreement includes a future cash earn-out potential for Warburg Pincus of up to $10.0 million based on Lifecore achieving certain financial targets during calendar years 2011 and 2012. In conjunction with the acquisition, Landec secured bank financing of $20.0 million. The financing has a five year term with a fixed interest rate of approximately 4.2%. After the acquisition, Landec's cash and marketable securities balance will be approximately $50.0 million. As a result of this transaction, Landec will record approximately $2.9 million of acquisition related expenses during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2010.

For Landec's fiscal year 2011, which begins May 31, 2010, Lifecore's revenues are projected to be in the range of $26 million to $28 million. Before the impact on cost of sales from having to step-up inventory to fair market value and from any incentive stock compensation, Lifecore is expected to realize an average gross margin of approximately 50% and an EBITDA margin of approximately 27%, generating EBITDA in the range of $7.0 million to $8.0 million. Under accounting guidance for business combinations, inventory must be recorded at its fair market value and thus the value of finished goods inventory, and in some instances work in process inventory, is stepped-up to fair market value. The increase in the recorded value of the inventory results in lower margins upon the sale of the specific stepped-up inventory until that inventory is completely sold. Landec is currently in the process of valuing the finished goods inventory and will know the amount of the step-up within the next 30 days.

"The acquisition of Lifecore is consistent with our stated strategy to acquire a company that expands our capabilities in materials science, and advances three additional stated objectives, which are (1) to invest in areas of growth outside of our food technology business, (2) to invest in areas of biomaterials that have potential synergies with Landec's Intelimer polymers and (3) to make an acquisition that is accretive now and going forward. Lifecore represents an important investment for Landec's future innovation in the area of biomaterials. Landec's focus on profitable growth and positive cash generation allows us to selectively pursue and take advantage of growth opportunities that meet or exceed our criteria for achieving attractive returns on our investment," stated Steele.

About Lifecore Biomedical

Lifecore Biomedical, based in Chaska, MN, develops, manufactures, and markets hyaluronan-based biomaterials in the form of compounds and several finished products for biomedical applications targeting both joints and soft tissue in ophthalmic, orthopedic and veterinary markets. The compounds, used as components in medical devices, veterinary products and drugs, are available as sodium salts and as a viscous solution available in syringes, vials or bulk sterile containers. The finished products include: (1) Lurocoat(R) Ophthalmic Viscoelastic for use in ophthalmic surgical procedures including cataract extraction and intraocular lens implantation, (2) Ortholure(TM) Orthopedic Viscosupplement for use in pain and restricted mobility indications due to degenerative and traumatic changes in synovial joints such as the knee, and (3) Corgel(TM) BioHydrogel research kits, a hyaluronan-based biocompatible hydrogel, initially developed at the Cleveland Clinic and now under an exclusive license agreement for numerous biomedical applications. Lifecore primarily conducts its business through partnerships with strategic market leaders in various medical fields and through contract manufacturing alliances.

Except for the historical information contained herein, the matters discussed in this news release are forward-looking statements that involve certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially, including such factors among others, as the timing and expenses associated with expanding operations, the ability to achieve acceptance of the Company's new products in the market place, the severity of the current economic slowdown, weather conditions that can affect the supply and price of produce, the amount and timing of research and development funding and license fees from the Company's collaborative partners, the timing of regulatory approvals, new product introductions, the mix between domestic and international sales, and the risk factors listed in the Company's Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2009 (See item 1A: Risk Factors). As a result of these and other factors, the Company expects to continue to experience significant fluctuations in quarterly operating results and there can be no assurance that the Company will remain consistently profitable. The Company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements whether as a result of new developments or otherwise.

The fundraising comes as other private equity firms such as Blackstone Group LP and Silver Lake Partners LP take between four to six years on average to spend their investors' money in global funds of similar size.  Private equity investors, which usually include public pension funds, insurance firms and sovereign wealth funds, prefer their money to be deployed quickly, assuming it's invested wisely. The sources asked not to be identified because the fundraising process is confidential. Warburg Pincus declined to comment.  Warburg differs from most of its rivals because, in addition to investing in leveraged buyouts, which use debt to boost returns in acquired companies, it also makes venture capital and growth equity investments. These investments, requiring little or no debt, help it deploy capital when leveraged buyouts are too expensive. Leveraged buyouts have become pricier in recent years, partly because of the strong equity and debt markets, but also because of competition from buyout firms to spend the capital they have raised. Undeployed capital reached an industry record of $1.2 trillion in 2014, according to market research firm Preqin. Warburg Pincus focuses more on venture capital and growth equity deals, which are typically smaller and less expensive, because they tend to be less visible and attract fewer rivals. No other fund of Warburg's size combines leveraged buyouts with venture capital investing. The strategy requires Warburg to do more deals to put its funds to work. Warburg Pincus Private Equity XI, the $11.2 billion fund that Warburg finished raising in 2013, has carried out more than 50 deals to date, with the average equity commitment at between $100 million and $200 million, according to the sources. By comparison, the average deal of private equity funds sized between $8 billion and $12 billion has a value of $1.8 billion, according to Preqin. Fund Returns  Private equity funds have a typical lifespan of ten years, and so it takes longer than two years to judge one's performance. Yet Warburg Pincus Private Equity XI's results so far have been encouraging. Warburg Pincus Private Equity XI reported a net internal rate of return of 18.5 percent as of the end of September, according to State of Hawaii Employees' Retirement System, a public pension fund investor. This compares to a 9.3 percent net internal rate of return for that public pension fund's entire private equity and venture capital portfolio.  The fund has invested in companies that include Venari Resources, a start-up focused on deepwater oil exploration and production in the Gulf of Mexico; China Auto Rental, a car rental company in China; and InComm, a global prepaid product, services and transaction technologies company. To be sure, not all Warburg Pincus funds have done as well. The previous fund, the $15 billion Warburg Pincus Private Equity X, had a net internal rate of return of 9 percent as of the end of September. The $8 billion Warburg Pincus Private Equity IX had a net internal rate of return of 15.7 percent. Warburg Pincus funds typically charge a management fee of 1.5 percent or less of the investor's capital and a performance fee of 20 percent of the fund's profits, according to the sources.

Founding and early history[edit]
In 1939 Eric Warburg of the Warburg banking family founded a company under the name E.M. Warburg & Co. Its first address was 52 William Street, New York, the Kuhn Loeb building. Throughout the early post-war period, the firm was a small office of 20 employees. In 1966, E.M. Warburg merged with Lionel I. Pincus & Co, forming a new company that eventually became known as E.M. Warburg, Pincus & Co.[11] In 1965, when Eric Warburg retired to Germany, control was handed to Lionel Pincus, a partner in the Ladenburg Thalmann investment bank, and the working language of the office switched from German to English. Lionel ran the company from 1966 to 2002, and died in 2009. [12]
Warburg Pincus began investing in Europe in 1983 and opened its first office in Asia in 1994. It has invested more than $5 billion in Europe; more than $3 billion in India[13] and more than $3.3 billion in China. The firm is headquartered in New York and has offices in Beijing, Hong Kong, London, Mumbai, San Francisco, São Paulo, Shanghai and Singapore, with administrative offices in Amsterdam, Luxembourg and Mauritius.[14]
The firm is structured as a global partnership led by co-presidents Charles Kaye and Joseph Landy.[15] Kaye has been with Warburg Pincus since 1986 and worked to launch the Asian operations. Landy has been with the firm since 1985, focusing on investments in information technology, communications applications and structured investments. Approximately 35% of the firm’s investments are outside of the U.S.[16]
Initial public offerings[edit]
Warburg Pincus has completed more initial public offerings with its companies than any other global private equity firm.[17] More than 140 Warburg Pincus companies have listed on exchanges, raising approximately $30 billion in public markets.[18] In each of these IPOs, the firm was the principal financial investor in the portfolio company. The companies have listed on 13 exchanges, including at least 30 IPOs outside the U.S. In August 2010, a six-year partnership between management and Warburg Pincus led to MEG Energy’s successful IPO.[19]
Venture capital[edit]
Warburg Pincus has a history of venture capital investing. The firm is a founding member of the venture capital associations in the U.S. and China, and offers a global entrepreneur in residence program to help start up new businesses.[citation needed]
In October 2014, Reuters reported that Warburg Pincus had raised $4 billion for its first energy-focused private equity fund.[20]
Growth capital[edit]
Warburg Pincus has invested in companies such as Harbin Pharmaceutical in China,[21] Bharti Telecommunications in India, AmRest in Poland[22] and Nuance Communications in the U.S.[23] In Bharti Airtel, Warburg Pincus had invested $292 million across multiple tranches and exited with $1.9 billion in 2005, which is considered to be the largest Private Equity exit in India.[24]
Fight over the Warburg name[edit]
During the post-war period, Eric Warburg vied with his cousin Siegmund Warburg, founder of S.G. Warburg, over the use of the Warburg name in New York. Siegmund wished to expand the S.G. Warburg franchise into New York but was blocked by the existence of E.M. Warburg & Co. Following the effective sale of the business to Pincus, Siegmund Warburg accused Eric of prostituting the Warburg name. "Complicating matters was that Siegmund thought Pincus the wrong kind of Jew - of Eastern European ancestry, with a garment-district background. Professionally, he thought Pincus well below haute banque stature in the venture capital world."[25]
In January 1970, Siegmund finally got the name changed to E.M. Warburg, Pincus & Company to differentiate it from S.G. Warburg & Company. "In the end, however, Lionel Pincus had the last laugh on Siegmund. He expanded Eric's tiny firm into a giant, thriving business, with three and a half billion dollars of venture capital partnerships."[25]
In 1999, they attempted to purchase English Premier League football (soccer) team Everton.[26]

Founding and early history[edit]
In 1939 Eric Warburg of the Warburg banking family founded a company under the name E.M. Warburg & Co. Its first address was 52 William Street, New York, the Kuhn Loeb building. Throughout the early post-war period, the firm was a small office of 20 employees. In 1966, E.M. Warburg merged with Lionel I. Pincus & Co, forming a new company that eventually became known as E.M. Warburg, Pincus & Co.[11] In 1965, when Eric Warburg retired to Germany, control was handed to Lionel Pincus, a partner in the Ladenburg Thalmann investment bank, and the working language of the office switched from German to English. Lionel ran the company from 1966 to 2002, and died in 2009. [12]
Warburg Pincus began investing in Europe in 1983 and opened its first office in Asia in 1994. It has invested more than $5 billion in Europe; more than $3 billion in India[13] and more than $3.3 billion in China. The firm is headquartered in New York and has offices in Beijing, Hong Kong, London, Mumbai, San Francisco, São Paulo, Shanghai and Singapore, with administrative offices in Amsterdam, Luxembourg and Mauritius.[14]
The firm is structured as a global partnership led by co-presidents Charles Kaye and Joseph Landy.[15] Kaye has been with Warburg Pincus since 1986 and worked to launch the Asian operations. Landy has been with the firm since 1985, focusing on investments in information technology, communications applications and structured investments. Approximately 35% of the firm’s investments are outside of the U.S.[16]
Initial public offerings[edit]
Warburg Pincus has completed more initial public offerings with its companies than any other global private equity firm.[17] More than 140 Warburg Pincus companies have listed on exchanges, raising approximately $30 billion in public markets.[18] In each of these IPOs, the firm was the principal financial investor in the portfolio company. The companies have listed on 13 exchanges, including at least 30 IPOs outside the U.S. In August 2010, a six-year partnership between management and Warburg Pincus led to MEG Energy’s successful IPO.[19]
Venture capital[edit]
Warburg Pincus has a history of venture capital investing. The firm is a founding member of the venture capital associations in the U.S. and China, and offers a global entrepreneur in residence program to help start up new businesses.[citation needed]
In October 2014, Reuters reported that Warburg Pincus had raised $4 billion for its first energy-focused private equity fund.[20]
Growth capital[edit]
Warburg Pincus has invested in companies such as Harbin Pharmaceutical in China,[21] Bharti Telecommunications in India, AmRest in Poland[22] and Nuance Communications in the U.S.[23] In Bharti Airtel, Warburg Pincus had invested $292 million across multiple tranches and exited with $1.9 billion in 2005, which is considered to be the largest Private Equity exit in India.[24]
Fight over the Warburg name[edit]
During the post-war period, Eric Warburg vied with his cousin Siegmund Warburg, founder of S.G. Warburg, over the use of the Warburg name in New York. Siegmund wished to expand the S.G. Warburg franchise into New York but was blocked by the existence of E.M. Warburg & Co. Following the effective sale of the business to Pincus, Siegmund Warburg accused Eric of prostituting the Warburg name. "Complicating matters was that Siegmund thought Pincus the wrong kind of Jew - of Eastern European ancestry, with a garment-district background. Professionally, he thought Pincus well below haute banque stature in the venture capital world."[25]
In January 1970, Siegmund finally got the name changed to E.M. Warburg, Pincus & Company to differentiate it from S.G. Warburg & Company. "In the end, however, Lionel Pincus had the last laugh on Siegmund. He expanded Eric's tiny firm into a giant, thriving business, with three and a half billion dollars of venture capital partnerships."[25]
In 1999, they attempted to purchase English Premier League football (soccer) team Everton.[26]

Fight over the Warburg name[edit]
During the post-war period, Eric Warburg vied with his cousin Siegmund Warburg, founder of S.G. Warburg, over the use of the Warburg name in New York. Siegmund wished to expand the S.G. Warburg franchise into New York but was blocked by the existence of E.M. Warburg & Co. Following the effective sale of the business to Pincus, Siegmund Warburg accused Eric of prostituting the Warburg name. "Complicating matters was that Siegmund thought Pincus the wrong kind of Jew - of Eastern European ancestry, with a garment-district background. Professionally, he thought Pincus well below haute banque stature in the venture capital world."[25]
In January 1970, Siegmund finally got the name changed to E.M. Warburg, Pincus & Company to differentiate it from S.G. Warburg & Company. "In the end, however, Lionel Pincus had the last laugh on Siegmund. He expanded Eric's tiny firm into a giant, thriving business, with three and a half billion dollars of venture capital partnerships."[25]
In 1999, they attempted to purchase English Premier League football (soccer) team Everton.[26]

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
