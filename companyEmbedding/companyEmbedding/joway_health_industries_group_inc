(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation.  The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and with Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 31, 2017.  FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS:  Certain statements made in this report may constitute "forward-looking statements on our current expectations and projections about future events." These forward-looking statements involve known or unknown risks, uncertainties, and other factors that may cause our actual results, performance, or achievements to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. In some cases you can identify forward-looking statements by some words such as "may," "should," "potential," "continue," "expects," "anticipates," "intends," "plans," "believes," "estimates," and similar expressions. These statements are based on our current beliefs, expectations, and assumptions, and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee future results, levels of activity, performance or achievements. These forward-looking statements are made as of the date of this report, and we assume no obligation to update these forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise, other than as required by law. In light of these assumptions, risks, and uncertainties, the forward-looking events discussed in this report might not occur and actual results and events may vary significantly from those discussed in the forward-looking statements.  Overview  General  We develop, manufacture, market, distribute, and sell products, including knit goods, daily healthcare and personal care products, and wellness house and activated water machine products, that are coated, embedded or filled with tourmaline. Most of our products, such as clothing, bedding, and mattresses are purchased as finished products which we then coat and/or infuse with liquid or granular tourmaline using one or more of our manufacturing techniques. We conduct all of our operations in Tianjin City, China and distribute most of our products to more than 100 franchisees in China. Our franchisees, in turn, sell the products to their customers. All of our revenues to date have been generated by sales to customers located in the PRC.  Beginning in 2009, we began to develop a franchise network to distribute our healthcare knit goods, daily healthcare products and personal care products. Through these franchisees, we were able to significantly increase sales of our healthcare knit goods segment and daily healthcare and personal care segment. In 2010, we began distributing our wellness house and activated water machine products through our franchise network.  We are a holding company with no material operations of our own. All of our operations are conducted through Joway Shengshi and its three subsidiaries, Joway Technology, Joway Decoration and Shengtang Trading. Joway Shengshi engages in the manufacture and distribution of tourmaline health-related products such as knit goods, and daily healthcare and personal care products. Joway Technology and Joway Decoration engage in the manufacture and distribution of activated water machines and wellness houses. We utilize our Shengtang Trading subsidiary to purchase raw materials, which are then sold to Joway Shengshi and Joway Decoration.  As a holding company, our ability to pay dividends and other cash distributions to our shareholders depends in part upon dividends and other distributions paid to us by our PRC subsidiaries. The amount of dividends paid by our PRC subsidiaries to us primarily depends on the service fees paid to our PRC subsidiaries from Joway Shengshi and its subsidiaries, and, to a lesser degree, our PRC subsidiaries' retained earnings. Conducting our operations through contractual arrangements with Joway Shengshi and its subsidiaries has a risk that we may lose the power to direct the activities that most significantly affect the economic performance of Joway Shengshi and its subsidiaries, which may result in our being unable to consolidate their financial results with our results and may impair our access to their cash flow from operations and thereby reduce our liquidity.  Description of Selected Income Statement Items  Revenues. We generate revenue from sales of our Healthcare Knit Goods Series, Daily Healthcare and Personal Care Series and Wellness House and Activated Water Machine Series.  Cost of goods sold. Cost of goods sold consists of costs directly attributable to production, including the cost of raw materials, salaries for staff engaged in production activity, electricity, depreciation, packing materials, and related expenses.  Operating expenses. Our total operating expenses consist of sales and marketing expenses and general and administrative expenses. Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries and traveling expenses of our marketing department employees, transportation expenses, and advertising expenses. General and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries of our administrative department employees, payroll taxes and benefits, general office expenses and depreciation.  Other income. Our other income consists primarily of interest income, investment income and bank service fee.  Income taxes. According to the revised Enterprise Income Tax Law effective as of January 1, 2008, the income tax rate of our PRC subsidiaries is generally 25%.

The agreements also require franchisees to adhere to certain standards of product merchandising, promotion, and presentment. The agreements do not require the franchisees to purchase any minimum levels of product, but do require that they make at least one purchase during each year.

The Agreements are cancelable at our discretion if franchisees violate the terms of the agreements.

This increase was mainly due to cash flow in for our operating activities. On March 31, 2017, we had net working capital of $1,430,792, a decrease of $70,218 from $1,501,010 on December 31, 2016.

As of March 31, 2017, the total unpaid principal balance due to Mr. Jinghe Zhang for advances made to Joway Shengshi was $127,500.  STATUTORY RESERVES  Pursuant to the laws and regulations of the PRC, the Company's PRC subsidiaries are required to allocate a portion of their after-tax income to statutory reserves funds. The minimum statutory reserves allocation is 10% of after-tax income until the reserves reach 50% of the entities' registered capital or members' equity. The reserve funds are not transferable to the Company in the form of cash dividends, loans or advances. Thus, the reserve funds are not available for distribution except in liquidation. As of March 31, 2017, the Company had allocated $354,052 to statutory reserves.  Off Balance Sheet Items  Under SEC regulations, we are required to disclose off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, such as changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors. An off-balance sheet arrangement means a transaction, agreement or contractual arrangement to which any entity that is not consolidated with us is a party, under which we have:  ? any obligation under certain guarantee contracts,  ? any retained or contingent interest in assets transferred to an unconsolidated entity or similar arrangement that serves as credit, liquidity or market risk support to that entity for such assets,  ? any obligation under a contract that would be accounted for as a derivative instrument, except that it is both indexed to our stock and classified in shareholder equity in our statement of financial position, and  ? any obligation arising out of a material variable interest held by us in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing, liquidity, market risk or credit risk support to us, or engages in leasing, hedging or research and development services with us.  We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that we are required to disclose pursuant to these regulations. In the ordinary course of business, we enter into operating lease commitments, purchase commitments and other contractual obligations. These transactions are recognized in our financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States.  Critical Accounting Policies  Management's discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Our financial statements reflect the selection and application of accounting policies which require management to make significant estimates and judgments. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We believe that the following reflect the more critical accounting policies that currently affect our financial condition and results of operations.  Basis of Consolidation  The accompanying consolidated financial statements include Joway Health and its wholly owned subsidiaries and controlled VIEs. All significant inter-company accounts and transactions have been eliminated in the consolidation.  Pursuant to Accounting Standards Codification Topic 810 "Consolidation" ("ASC 810"), the Company is required to include in its consolidated financial statements the financial statements of its variable interest entities ("VIEs"). ASC 810 requires a VIE to be consolidated by a company if that company is subject to a majority of the risk of loss for the VIE or is entitled to receive a majority of the VIE's residual returns. VIEs are those entities in which a company, through contractual arrangements, bears the risk of, and enjoys the rewards normally associated with ownership of the entity, and therefore the company is the primary beneficiary of the entity.  Based on the various Contractual Agreements, we believe we are able to exercise control over the VIEs, and to obtain the full economic benefits. We believe that the terms of the exclusive option agreement are currently exercisable and legally enforceable under PRC laws and regulations. We also believe that the minimum amount of consideration permitted by the applicable PRC law to exercise the option does not represent a financial barrier or disincentive for us to exercise our rights under the exclusive option agreement. A simple majority vote of our board of directors is required to pass a resolution to exercise our rights under the exclusive option agreement, for which consent of the shareholder of VIEs is not required. Therefore, we believe this gives us the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact VIEs' economic performance. T We believe that our ability to exercise effective control, together with the consulting service agreements and the equity pledge agreements, give us the rights to receive substantially all of the economic benefits from VIEs in consideration for the services provided by its wholly owned subsidiaries in China. Accordingly, as the primary beneficiary of VIEs and in accordance with U.S. GAAP, Joway Shengshi, Joway Technology, Joway Decoration, and Shengtang Trading, as VIEs of Junhe Consulting, has been consolidated in the Company's financial statements. Sales from Joway Shengshi, Joway Technology, Joway Decoration, and Shengtang Trading are included in our total sales, their incomes or losses from operations are consolidated with ours, and our net income or loss includes net income or loss from Joway Shengshi, Joway Technology, Joway Decoration, and Shengtang Trading.  Revenue Recognition  We recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, the purchase price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured.  With respect to sales of product to both franchisee and non-franchisee customers, we prepare product shipment upon the receipt of a customer's purchase order. Sales prices are based on fixed price lists that are different depending on whether the price list is for franchisee customers or for non-franchisee customers. We recognize revenue when the product is shipped. We do not sell product to any customers with a right of return as defined in ASC 605-15-25-4. Sales are presented net of value added tax (VAT).  We recognize revenue on the sale of our wellness houses under the completed . . .  May 15, 2017  (c) 1995-2017 Cybernet Data Systems, Inc. All Rights Reserved

Key Stock Data     ?    P/E Ratio (TTM) The Price to Earnings (P/E) ratio, a key valuation measure, is calculated by dividing the stock's most recent closing price by the sum of the diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the trailing 12 month period.  Earnings Per Share (TTM) A company's net income for the trailing twelve month period expressed as a dollar amount per fully diluted shares outstanding. Market Capitalization Reflects the total market value of a company. Market Cap is calculated by multiplying the number of shares outstanding by the stock's price. For companies with multiple common share classes, market capitalization includes both classes. Shares Outstanding Number of shares that are currently held by investors, including restricted shares owned by the company's officers and insiders as well as those held by the public. Public Float The number of shares in the hands of public investors and available to trade. To calculate, start with total shares outstanding and subtract the number of restricted shares. Restricted stock typically is that issued to company insiders with limits on when it may be traded. Dividend Yield A company's dividend expressed as a percentage of its current stock price.

Money Flow Uptick/Downtick Ratio Money flow measures the relative buying and selling pressure on a stock, based on the value of trades made on an "uptick" in price and the value of trades made on a "downtick" in price. The up/down ratio is calculated by dividing the value of uptick trades by the value of downtick trades. Net money flow is the value of uptick trades minus the value of downtick trades.
