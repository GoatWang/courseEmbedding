	                      "I wanted to 
	                      thank you for getting the new telephone batteries to us so soon!. We 
	                      were having phone problems and the quick service was appreciated. I 
	                      purchase many things from websites and once many of them have the order 
	                      they don't seem to worry about how long it takes for the products to 
	                      arrive... I really appreciate the follow-up to my status request email 
	                      and that the batteries arrived even sooner than we had planned."

Product Details

				Offering a full set of rear horizontals and heavy-duty internal spreaders, this stepladder is ideal for the homeowner or the professional. It has a lock-in system to secure tools from falling while keeping them right at hand. The bracing system helps protect the rails from damage. Each knee-braced step is slip resistant and double riveted. The fiberglass rails are nonconductive for working near electricity. Back-up plates reinforce all top connectors.

 3 ft. 300 lb. Load Capacity Fiberglass Stepladder is rated    5.0 out of    5 by    1.               Rated 5 out of            5  by        FrankB from         Nice ladder, light but sturdy and accepts the optional Bucket accessory for tools and such while you're carrying it around. Nice height for most purposes and looks to last a long time.Only wish it were a little wider at the base for our larger guy (me) but otherwise perfect for rest of our shop!

The Werner® 3 Foot Type 1A Fiberglass Step Ladder is both durable and compact to fit the needs of a wide range of jobs and projects. It comes with a HolsterTop which includes a lock-in system to keep tools and supplies in place and convenient. The top is secured to each front rail with four rivets. All the steps of the slip-resistant step ladder have knee bracing as well as foot pads. The foot pads are part of the ladder's EDGE® bracing system, which prevents damage and wear and tear on the rail.
