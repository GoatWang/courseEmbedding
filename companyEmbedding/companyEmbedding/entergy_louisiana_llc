        HARAHAN, La. - The heat index is hitting the triple digits on a regular basis and driving increased electricity use as Louisianians try to stay cool. And that means many elderly and disabled Entergy Louisiana customers will need extra help with energy costs in the coming weeks.
      

        Thanks to the generosity of customers, Entergy employees and shareholders, those elderly and disabled Louisiana customers who need help with their utility bills have a place to turn - The Power to Care.
      

        Entergy Louisiana teams with the Salvation Army and Councils on Aging statewide to provide the program.
      

        Entergy Louisiana President and CEO Phillip May presented a $920,000 check for the program during a Tuesday ceremony at the Harahan Senior Center.  The money will be distributed through local councils on aging and Salvation Army locations to help qualifying customers pay their utility bills.
      

        'For many of our disabled and elderly customers, meeting everyday financial needs is a struggle. It frequently comes down to having to make decisions whether they can pay their medical bills, buy food or buy medicine,' May said. 'The Power to Care exists to help ensure the most vulnerable among us don't have to face that choice.'
      

        May presented the ceremonial check to customers who received help through The Power to Care program. They used the opportunity to express their appreciation for the assistance.
      

        'I am so thankful for the help provided by The Power to Care,' said Joan Bradley of River Ridge. 'I had a medical emergency and needed help paying my utility bill. I am very grateful for the assistance I received through the program.'
      

        To Derricka Griffin, the program is an important emergency lifeline for senior citizens like her mother Alita Griffin of River Ridge.
      

        'The Power to Care is much needed, especially for seniors like my mother who live on a fixed income and can find themselves short on bills. The cost of living keeps increasing, but it seems like the fixed incomes seniors receive are staying the same. If there is an unexpected expense it puts them in a real bind,' Derricka Griffin said.
      

        On hand for the event were state Sen. Conrad Appel, R-Metairie; state Rep. Kirk Talbot, R- River Ridge; state Rep. Polly Thomas, R-Metairie; Jefferson Parish Councilman Paul Johnson, Harahan Mayor Tina Miceli, and members of the Jefferson Council on Aging board of directors.
      

        The Power to Care program is funded by contributions from customers, employees, and shareholders. To donate to The Power to Care or for more information, click here.
      

        One of the ways to help fund the program is by participating in the annual The Power to Care charity golf tournament. This year's golf tournament is scheduled for Oct. 30 at the University Club of Baton Rouge. Sponsorships and teams are still available. Please contact Nicole Grille at 225-381-5854 for information.
      

        Entergy Louisiana, LLC provides electric service to more than 1 million customers and natural gas service to more than 93,000 customers in the greater Baton Rouge area. With operations in southern, central and northeastern Louisiana, the company is a subsidiary of Entergy Corporation.

BBB Accreditation





                BBB Accredited Since 05/05/1966
            

                BBB has determined that Entergy Louisiana, LLC meets Standards of BBB Accreditation, which include a commitment to make a good faith effort to resolve any consumer complaints. BBB Accredited Businesses pay a fee for accreditation review/monitoring and for support of BBB services to the public.
            

                BBB accreditation does not mean that the business's products or services have been evaluated or endorsed by BBB, or that BBB has made a determination as to the business's product quality or competency in performing services.

BBB Accreditation Reviews

BBB routinely monitors its files on all Accredited Businesses to affirm that they continue to meet all BBB Accreditation Standards











BBB Accreditation Process


        Not every business is eligible for BBB Accreditation. Businesses must meet, commit to and maintain the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards) 
        in order to be eligible for and maintain BBB Accreditation. The BBB Code of Business Practices represents sound advertising, selling and customer
        service practices that enhance customer trust and confidence in business. The Code is built on the BBB Standards for Trust, eight principles that
        summarize important elements of creating and maintaining trust in business.
    

        In order to be eligible for Accreditation a business must complete an Accreditation application.        
    

        Upon receipt of a fully completed BBB Application for Accreditation, BBB staff:        
        
Reviews the application
Researches the business
Verifies the information presented in the application 
May request additional information
May request proof of specific information on the application

        After the review and verification process, BBB will then evaluate if the business meets the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards)..
    
    
        Once BBB has finished its evaluation, the application for BBB Accreditation is either approved or denied. If the applicant is found in compliance with the BBB Code of Business Practices it will be presented to the BBB Board of Directors, or a committee of that board, for final approval. If the application is denied, BBB will contact the applicant, indicating the BBB Standard(s) that were not met and any recourse available to the applicant.

Instant discounts. Long-term savings. Now even easier.

					local and online retailers to offer discounts on everything 
					from LED light bulbs to Advanced Power Strips. You'll get 
					instant savings at these
					participating stores. 
					Start shopping and saving now while supplies last.

Advanced Power Strips+


Advanced Power Strips

Click here for the $10 APS Mail-in Rebate!

Reduce Phantom Power in your house! This is energy that is used by appliances when they are turned off, but still using a small amount of electricity -- and can add up to large impacts. An Advanced Power Strip (APS) is a surge protector that will turn off phantom power when your appliances are plugged in to it, with an energy savings of 85 kWh per year, on average. 


The $10 mail-in rebate applies to these models of APS, which can be purchased on-line. Models on this list use less than 1 watt of power in Stand-by mode and have electrical and coax surge protection where applicable.

Pool Pumps+


ENERGY STAR® Pool Pump Rebates

Click here for the Mail-in Rebate Application! 


Pool pump energy use can be costly. Pool pump speeds vary based on the pool's operation. Filtration, for example, only requires half the flow rate of running a pool cleaner. Conventional pool pumps, with only one speed, are set to run at the higher speeds required of the pool cleaner and waste energy during filtration operation by running faster than necessary. An ENERGY STAR certified pool pump can run at different speeds and be programmed to match the pool operation with its appropriate pool pump speed. The energy saved is considerable; reducing pump speed by one-half allows the pump to use just one-eighth as much energy. Entergy Solutions offers a $200 rebate for a newly-installed Variable Speed Pool Pump. 


Click here for a $200 Pool Pump Rebate Application Form!


Any residential Entergy Louisiana customer is eligible to receive a rebate for an ENERGY STAR rated pool pump installed in an in-ground pool. 
Contact a Pool Professional to purchase and install an ENERGY STAR Pool Pumps. Apply for the Entergy Solutions Rebate here.




Window A/Cs+


ENERGY STAR® Window Air Conditioner Program
Click here for the Mail-in Rebate Application!


Increase your home's comfort while reducing monthly energy bills by installing a new, high efficiency window air conditioner (A/C). Entergy Solutions provides mail-in rebates for the purchase and installation of energy efficient window units. 





Any residential Entergy Louisiana customer is eligible to receive rebates for ENERGY STAR qualified units purchased from a participating retailer. Each customer can receive rebates for up to four window units. 


Visit any of the Entergy Solutions Retail Partners to purchase a new ENERGY STAR Window Unit, or any retailer who sells ENERGY STAR window units. 


At the time of sale, you will receive a rebate application. Please complete the application and send to Entergy Solutions within 45 days of the purchase. If not available from the retailer, applications can be downloaded here. The installation will then be confirmed and the rebate will be mailed to you within three weeks. 


Rebates are offered on a first-come, first-served basis, and funding is limited. Additional eligible tax credits or rebates may be available. 



All ENERGY STAR Qualified Window units are eligible for a $25 mail-in rebate.




LED Light Bulbs+


Save up to $3 per bulb on LED Light Bulbs

Emitting very little heat and averaging 22 years in lifespan, highly-efficient LED bulbs use as little as six watts of energy -- compared to 40 watts with a traditional incandescent bulb. LED bulbs can be expensive, but for a limited time, you will receive instant savings of up to $8 per bulb when you buy LEDs at participating retailers. 



CFL Bulbs+


Save up to $1.00 per bulb on general-purpose (spiral) CFL Bulbs

Compact fluorescent light bulbs (CFLs) use about 75% less energy than standard incandescent bulbs and last up to 10 times longer -- saving you more than $40 in electricity costs over each CFL bulb's lifetime. Look for in-store discounts on ENERGY STAR spiral CFLs at participating retailers.

        The Louisiana Public Service Commission voted today to approve a multi-year plan to install advanced meters at homes and businesses served by Entergy Louisiana.
      
      
      
        'The commission's action lays the foundation for grid modernization technologies that will create a smarter energy future for Louisiana and offer a wide-range of benefits to our customers,' said Phillip May, president and CEO of Entergy Louisiana, LLC.  
      
      
        Upgrading to advanced meters has numerous benefits:
      
      

          Customers can get timely and more detailed information on their energy use, so they can manage their power consumption, which can lead to lower bills.
        

          Entergy Louisiana will have a clearer real-time picture of the power grid and how it is operating. Outages can be identified more accurately, so crews can arrive on the scene more quickly to make repairs.
        

          With better information, we can answer customers' billing and service questions more quickly and effectively, improving customer service.
        

      
        Over the next 18 months, Entergy Louisiana will build and deploy the systems and infrastructure needed for the technology and installation of the advanced meters. This timeline is based on experiences from other utilities that have modernized their power grids. Meter installation will begin in early 2019, and by the end of 2021, homes and businesses in the Entergy Louisiana service area can be part of a smarter energy future.

        Entergy Louisiana's more than 93,000 natural gas customers in the greater Baton Rouge area also will have their gas meters upgraded with new technology that will provide customers with data needed to better manage gas usage and help lower bills.
