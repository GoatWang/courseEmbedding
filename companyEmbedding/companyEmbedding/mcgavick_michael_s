Professional life[edit]
McGavick is the CEO of Ireland-based XL Group plc,[4] and former Chairman/President/CEO of the insurance company Safeco. McGavick has been recognized as the Bermuda Insurance Institute’s (Re)insurance Person of the Year, the Review Magazine’s Industry Personality of the Year and Reactions Magazine’s Insurance CEO of the Year.[5] He is currently the Chairman of the Association of Bermuda Insurers & Reinsurers,[6] The Geneva Association, and of the Global Reinsurance Forum.[7]
He served as Chief of Staff to U.S. Senator Slade Gorton and manager of Gorton's campaign in 1988. He later served as Director of the American Insurance Association's Superfund Improvement Project in Washington, D.C., where he was the American Insurance Association's lead negotiator in working to transform the nation's Superfund environmental laws. He was also a staff member of the Seattle-based Washington Roundtable, a non-partisan policy research group composed of the chief executive officers of the state's largest corporations.[8]
McGavick was Senior Financial Officer for Continental Casualty Company (CNA)'s Commercial Lines Group, Vice President of CNA's New Ventures group, and President and Chief Operating Officer of CNA's largest operating department. The department, with $3.5 billion in annual revenues, provided the majority of CNA's commercial insurance products.[9] It also was responsible for managing CNA's relationship with its independent agent distribution system.[9]
Safeco[edit]
McGavick was named "CEO of the Year" by the Puget Sound Business Journal in 2002.[10] On July 18, 2005, McGavick announced that effective August 31 he would step down as CEO of Safeco, but would remain on as Chairman until the end of 2005. McGavick explained that he expected "to give full consideration to the possibility of public service". On July 19, 2005, McGavick announced that he was forming an exploratory committee for a 2006 bid for the Washington United States Senate seat held by Maria Cantwell.
Family life[edit]
Born in 1958, McGavick grew up in Seattle's Wallingford neighborhood with two sisters, Molly and Meaghan. His parents, Joe and Carole, were active in local civics. He attended Seattle Preparatory School, an elite college prep school and graduated from the University of Washington with a degree in Political Science. He was also a key member of the Rugby team there. His father, Joe, served both in the State Legislature and on the State Liquor Control Board. Joe McGavick was the last Republican to serve the Wallingford neighborhood since the Great Depression.[11] McGavick has credited his father for sparking his interest in politics.[11]
McGavick's wife, Gaelynn, is an attorney by training who has experience in the arena of health care policy, at one point working as a liaison to the White House for the American Hospital Association. The McGavicks have one son, Jack, who graduated from the University of Virginia with a master's degree in English and Education and played rugby. He also has two younger sons, Gates and Marco. Gates attends the University of Notre Dame, and Marco attends the Groton School. Both boys play rugby at the international and club level.
Gates represented Bermuda's Youth national teams, and was one of 45 American players called to the US Olympic Training Center in Chula Vista, California in anticipation of the 2014 Youth Olympics in Nanjing, China. He intends on graduating from Notre Dame with degrees in Political Science and English.
Senate campaign[edit]
Main article: Washington United States Senate election, 2006
McGavick makes "civility" a central campaign theme[edit]
In early January 2006, McGavick began his campaign full-time for the U.S. Senate, saying he would bring a "Northwestern voice of civility" to what he described as a culture of infighting in the nation's capital.[12]
For most of July, the McGavick campaigned traveled around the state in an RV, making stops in: Seattle, Sedro-Woolley, Oak Harbor, Anacortes, Bellingham, Friday Harbor, Port Angeles, Forks, Clallam Bay, Bremerton, Belfair, Satsop, Aberdeen, Raymond, South Bend, Seaview, Naselle, Cathlamet, Vancouver, Goldendale, Pateros, Brewster, Republic, Colville, Spokane, Pullman, Clarkston, Pomeroy, Dayton, Prosser, Ritzville, Moses Lake, Leavenworth, and Yakima, among others.[13]
Schwartzman v. McGavick[edit]
In August 2006, Safeco Insurance Co. shareholder Emma Schwartzman, the great, great granddaughter of one of the Safeco Corporation founders, filed a lawsuit[14] against him and the Safeco corporation, claiming that his $28 million salary upon leaving his job was fraudulent and wasteful.[15]
Knoll Lowney, a Seattle lawyer, represented Schwartzman.
Supported teaching intelligent design[edit]
In an August 2006 interview, McGavick said intelligent design should be taught in public schools and that it is appropriate to be taught in science class despite the 2005 court ruling prohibiting it.[16]
Timeline of 2006 Senate race[edit]
On October 26, 2005, McGavick announced on KIRO Radio that he was an official candidate in the 2006 Senate race.
In the May 2006 edition of the Weekly Standard, McGavick made the argument that Iran should be banned from the FIFA World Cup due to its nuclear weapons research program and statements by Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad that deny the truthfulness of the holocaust (which is a criminal offense in the 2006 World Cup host country, Germany).[17]
On April 26, 2006, the Washington State Democratic Party filed a complaint with the Federal Elections Commission alleging that the $17 million severance in cash and accelerated stock options given to him by Safeco amounted to an illegal campaign contribution to his Senate campaign. The FEC dismissed the case, stating, "The commission concluded that these payments were ordinary employment-related compensation made irrespective of Mr. McGavick's candidacy."[18]

Senate campaign[edit]
Main article: Washington United States Senate election, 2006
McGavick makes "civility" a central campaign theme[edit]
In early January 2006, McGavick began his campaign full-time for the U.S. Senate, saying he would bring a "Northwestern voice of civility" to what he described as a culture of infighting in the nation's capital.[12]
For most of July, the McGavick campaigned traveled around the state in an RV, making stops in: Seattle, Sedro-Woolley, Oak Harbor, Anacortes, Bellingham, Friday Harbor, Port Angeles, Forks, Clallam Bay, Bremerton, Belfair, Satsop, Aberdeen, Raymond, South Bend, Seaview, Naselle, Cathlamet, Vancouver, Goldendale, Pateros, Brewster, Republic, Colville, Spokane, Pullman, Clarkston, Pomeroy, Dayton, Prosser, Ritzville, Moses Lake, Leavenworth, and Yakima, among others.[13]
Schwartzman v. McGavick[edit]
In August 2006, Safeco Insurance Co. shareholder Emma Schwartzman, the great, great granddaughter of one of the Safeco Corporation founders, filed a lawsuit[14] against him and the Safeco corporation, claiming that his $28 million salary upon leaving his job was fraudulent and wasteful.[15]
Knoll Lowney, a Seattle lawyer, represented Schwartzman.
Supported teaching intelligent design[edit]
In an August 2006 interview, McGavick said intelligent design should be taught in public schools and that it is appropriate to be taught in science class despite the 2005 court ruling prohibiting it.[16]
Timeline of 2006 Senate race[edit]
On October 26, 2005, McGavick announced on KIRO Radio that he was an official candidate in the 2006 Senate race.
In the May 2006 edition of the Weekly Standard, McGavick made the argument that Iran should be banned from the FIFA World Cup due to its nuclear weapons research program and statements by Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad that deny the truthfulness of the holocaust (which is a criminal offense in the 2006 World Cup host country, Germany).[17]
On April 26, 2006, the Washington State Democratic Party filed a complaint with the Federal Elections Commission alleging that the $17 million severance in cash and accelerated stock options given to him by Safeco amounted to an illegal campaign contribution to his Senate campaign. The FEC dismissed the case, stating, "The commission concluded that these payments were ordinary employment-related compensation made irrespective of Mr. McGavick's candidacy."[18]

Professional life[edit]
McGavick is the CEO of Ireland-based XL Group plc,[4] and former Chairman/President/CEO of the insurance company Safeco. McGavick has been recognized as the Bermuda Insurance Institute’s (Re)insurance Person of the Year, the Review Magazine’s Industry Personality of the Year and Reactions Magazine’s Insurance CEO of the Year.[5] He is currently the Chairman of the Association of Bermuda Insurers & Reinsurers,[6] The Geneva Association, and of the Global Reinsurance Forum.[7]
He served as Chief of Staff to U.S. Senator Slade Gorton and manager of Gorton's campaign in 1988. He later served as Director of the American Insurance Association's Superfund Improvement Project in Washington, D.C., where he was the American Insurance Association's lead negotiator in working to transform the nation's Superfund environmental laws. He was also a staff member of the Seattle-based Washington Roundtable, a non-partisan policy research group composed of the chief executive officers of the state's largest corporations.[8]
McGavick was Senior Financial Officer for Continental Casualty Company (CNA)'s Commercial Lines Group, Vice President of CNA's New Ventures group, and President and Chief Operating Officer of CNA's largest operating department. The department, with $3.5 billion in annual revenues, provided the majority of CNA's commercial insurance products.[9] It also was responsible for managing CNA's relationship with its independent agent distribution system.[9]
Safeco[edit]
McGavick was named "CEO of the Year" by the Puget Sound Business Journal in 2002.[10] On July 18, 2005, McGavick announced that effective August 31 he would step down as CEO of Safeco, but would remain on as Chairman until the end of 2005. McGavick explained that he expected "to give full consideration to the possibility of public service". On July 19, 2005, McGavick announced that he was forming an exploratory committee for a 2006 bid for the Washington United States Senate seat held by Maria Cantwell.
Family life[edit]
Born in 1958, McGavick grew up in Seattle's Wallingford neighborhood with two sisters, Molly and Meaghan. His parents, Joe and Carole, were active in local civics. He attended Seattle Preparatory School, an elite college prep school and graduated from the University of Washington with a degree in Political Science. He was also a key member of the Rugby team there. His father, Joe, served both in the State Legislature and on the State Liquor Control Board. Joe McGavick was the last Republican to serve the Wallingford neighborhood since the Great Depression.[11] McGavick has credited his father for sparking his interest in politics.[11]
McGavick's wife, Gaelynn, is an attorney by training who has experience in the arena of health care policy, at one point working as a liaison to the White House for the American Hospital Association. The McGavicks have one son, Jack, who graduated from the University of Virginia with a master's degree in English and Education and played rugby. He also has two younger sons, Gates and Marco. Gates attends the University of Notre Dame, and Marco attends the Groton School. Both boys play rugby at the international and club level.
Gates represented Bermuda's Youth national teams, and was one of 45 American players called to the US Olympic Training Center in Chula Vista, California in anticipation of the 2014 Youth Olympics in Nanjing, China. He intends on graduating from Notre Dame with degrees in Political Science and English.

      Mike McGavick

      Address: Safeco Corporation, Safeco Plaza, 4333 Brooklyn Avenue Northeast,
      Seattle, Washington 98185; http://www.safeco.com.
    

      ■ In 2004 the insurance and financial-services company executive
      Michael S. (Mike) McGavick was president, chief executive officer, and
      chairman of the board of directors of the Seattle, Washington–based
      Safeco Corporation—the second-largest commercial insurance
      operation in the United States. When McGavick was selected as
      Safeco's new leader, the company was sinking rapidly due to severe
      operational and management problems. Safeco was in need of major
      retrenching—as phrased by technical analysts—and McGavick
      said of the company and its employees on the Safeco Web site,
      "I'm going to reach out to people throughout the company.
      Our employees' creative ideas and innovative thinking will unlock
      the full potential of Safeco, providing shareholders with the returns they
      deserve" (January 30, 2001). McGavick proved able to do just what
      he said he would do—but not without making many tough decisions,
      many of which were not well received. However, those decisions ultimately
      helped to bring Safeco back to its traditionally successful role as a
      major multiline insurance company in the United States.
    

      INSURANCE THE SAFECO WAY
    

      Safeco, a Fortune 500 company with annual revenues of about $7.36 billion
      as of 2003, sold a comprehensive array of insurance and financial
      investment products and services through a U.S. network of over 17,000
      independent agents, brokers, and financial advisors. Its family of
      companies provided products that included auto, business, casualty, home,
      life, and property insurance; investments such as life-insurance
      annuities, mutual funds, and stock purchase plans; group excess-loss
      medical and retirement plans and services for businesses; and asset
      management, surety bonds, and trust services.
    

      PUBLIC AFFAIRS STARTS CAREER
    

      McGavick became vice president of The Rockey Company, the Seattle,
      Washington–based public-affairs firm in 1983. Through his early
      professional career, McGavick held a number of public-affairs positions,
      including, from 1986 to 1988, vice president of the Seattle-based
      Washington Round Table, a nonpartisan policy-research group composed of
      the top executives (including chief executive officers) of
      Washington's largest corporations; campaign manager for U.S.
      Senator Slade Gorton's successful reelection campaign in 1988;
      chief of staff for Gorton from 1989 to 1991; and partner with The Gallatin
      Group, the Seattle-based public affairs firm, from 1991 to 1992.
    

      INSURING HIS PROFESSION
    

      McGavick began his insurance career in 1992, spending three years as
      director of the Superfund Improvement Project for the American Insurance
      Association in Washington, D.C. In that position he worked as a prime
      negotiator for the insurance industry with the U.S. Congress, federal
      agencies, and groups concerned about reforming the country's
      superfund environmental laws.
    

      Before joining Safeco, McGavick held a number of executive positions at
      the Chicago, Illinois–based CNA Financial Corporation starting in
      1995. During this time he was responsible for managing and improving
      CNA's relationship with its independent-agent distribution system
      and engineering CNA's e-commerce strategy. McGavick served from
      1995 to 1996 as vice president of New Ventures; from 1996 to late
       1997 as senior financial officer of Commercial Lines Group; and from 1997
      to 2001 as president and chief operating officer of Financial Corporation.
      As president and chief operating officer of CNA Financial, the
      company's largest operating unit, McGavick was responsible for the
      majority of the company's commercial insurance business. He began a
      successful turnaround of CNA's commercial operation when he
      reformulated the workforce distribution and implemented a completely new
      underwriting technique.
    

      BEFORE MCGAVICK CAME ON BOARD
    

      Unable to deal with the results of Safeco's traditional-business
      acquisitions, stock analysts, shareholders, and independent agents
      criticized company management, especially beginning in 1999 and throughout
      2000. In particular, after Safeco announced in January 2001 that earnings
      were below expectations for the fifth consecutive quarter, Standard
      & Poor's removed the ratings of Safeco and its related
      entities from CreditWatch (S&P's service highlighting the
      potential direction of a rating). It lowered Safeco's credit rating
      and senior unsecured-debt rating from "A-" to
      "BBB+"; financial security was downgraded from
      "strong" to "good"; and the company was judged
      as having become much more likely to be negatively affected by adverse
      business conditions.
    

      TAKING OVER AT A CRITICAL JUNCTION
    

      The global management-search firm Russell Reynolds Associates, based in
      New York City, performed an extensive hiring process with Safeco in which
      the members of the board of directors reviewed over one hundred candidates
      for the position of chief executive officer; McGavick eventually won out.
      He took over the position of president and chief executive officer in
      January 2001 from William G. Reed Jr., who assumed the chairmanship of the
      board of directors. As found on the company Web site, Reed said of
      McGavick upon his appointment, "Mike understands the prestige
      Safeco has always enjoyed, and he has demonstrated the capacity to build
      and lead a strong team of executives" (January 30, 2001); Reed went
      on to say, "Mike's ideas, energy, and leadership ability
      clearly stood out among this field of proven business leaders."
    

      McGavick joined Safeco at a difficult time in the company's
      history. In 1997 Safeco made a major acquisition when it bought the large
      property-casualty insurer American States. Instead of helping Safeco to
      become a more diversified, well-rounded financial-services leader, the
      acquisition nearly bankrupted the company, as the purchase was made for
      too much money and at the top of the underwriting cycle (such that Safeco
      had to reduce rates in order to maintain market share in an already
      unprofitable business climate). Operating earnings dropped throughout the
      next year, and by the end of 1999 Safeco's combined expense ratio
      of 108.4 percent was for the first time in its history worse than the
      industry average of 106.9 percent.
    

      MANAGEMENT TEAM FORMED
    

      McGavick assembled an outstanding management team in order to counter
      Safeco's problems and turn the company around for the benefit of
      shareholders, customers, and distribution partners alike. One of the most
      important members of his management team was Michael LaRocco, who was
      formerly GEICO's vice president. LaRocco was hired by McGavick to
      become the president and chief operating officer of Safeco's
      personal-lines business. LaRocco ultimately performed critical actions to
      help McGavick reverse Safeco's plummeting position.
    

      RETURNING TO EXCELLENCE
    

      From the start McGavick assured Safeco's independent agents that
      the company's primary distribution focus—that of an
      independent-agency brand—would remain as it had in the past; on the
      other hand, he implied that the company might eliminate its homeowners
      market due to tremendous losses.
    

      McGavick immediately launched a series of initiatives to return Safeco to
      its long tradition of excellence. His first action was to reduce the
      company's stock dividend by about half in order to redirect the
      money toward the company's growth. His second move was to write off
      $1.2 billion ($911 million after taxes) in goodwill obtained from the
      American States acquisition. The huge one-time charge succeeded in
      clearing the balance sheet of negativity. Thirdly, McGavick sold the
      profitable Safeco Credit Company to GE Capital in order to reduce debt.
    

      With short-term debt cut by 50 percent, McGavick began a series of layoffs
      and consolidations in order to reduce corporate expenses. He downsized
      Safeco's workforce by about 10 percent, or around 1,200 jobs.
      McGavick's next concern was the homeowners business, which was
      losing enormous amounts of money. McGavick told his troops that he did not
      intend to exit the market entirely but would if he were forced to do so.
      With McGavick guiding analysis and research, management members eventually
      decided to raise prices for all homeowner accounts. Another problem spot
      seen by McGavick was the property-casualty business unit. He assigned
      LaRocco to reorganize Safeco's direct-marketing strategy; LaRocco
      modeled the new strategy after GEICO's operations, resulting in
      lower business-model costs particularly with respect to distribution
      expenses.
    

      McGavick also invested in technology during Safeco's turnaround. He
      directed Safeco management to install a common technology platform to
      handle homeowners, automobile, and
       small commercial businesses. McGavick rationalized this additional
      expense by assuming that once the company had recovered from its downturn
      it would be able to significantly reduce expenses associated with the new
      investment.
    

      POSITIVE RESULTS WITHIN 11 MONTHS
    

      Under McGavick's leadership, management at Safeco took strong
      actions to improve the performance of core business lines, strengthen the
      balance sheet with a noticeable turnaround in market capitalization, and
      reduce core distribution expenses, meanwhile investing in training and new
      technologies that were aimed at improving customer service and product
      distribution, respectively. McGavick accomplished this feat with five core
      directives in mind: to focus on the qualities that made an organization
      unique in its industry; to do whatever might be necessary, even if it
      involved performing "radical surgery," as phrased by
      McGavick; to "take the pain" earlier rather than later; to
      invest in new systems and infrastructures; and to communicate so that
      actions backed up words.
    

      Safeco turned its financial performance around in 2002, generating net
      income of more than $300 million, the company's best results in
      four years.

In March 2008, global insurance company XL Group plc (NYSE: XL) – formerly XL Capital Ltd prior to officially changing its name and domicile in 2010[1] – announced that McGavick would take over as CEO beginning on May 1, 2008. With 4,000 employees, XL Group is headquartered in Ireland with executive offices in Bermuda and Stamford, Connecticut,[2] and about 60 offices in more than 20 countries.[3]Contents1 Professional life1.1 Safeco2 Family life3 Senate campaign3.1 McGavick makes "civility" a central campaign theme3.1.1 Schwartzman v. McGavick3.2 Supported teaching intelligent design3.3 Timeline of 2006 Senate race4 References5 External linksProfessional lifeMcGavick is the CEO of Ireland-based XL Group plc,[4] and former Chairman/President/CEO of the insurance company Safeco. McGavick has been recognized as the Bermuda Insurance Institute’s (Re)insurance Person of the Year, the Review Magazine’s Industry Personality of the Year and Reactions Magazine’s Insurance CEO of the Year.[5] He is currently the Chairman of the Association of Bermuda Insurers & Reinsurers,[6] The Geneva Association, and of the Global Reinsurance Forum.[7]He served as Chief of Staff to U.S. Senator Slade Gorton and manager of Gorton's campaign in 1988. He later served as Director of the American Insurance Association's Superfund Improvement Project in Washington, D.C., where he was the American Insurance Association's lead negotiator in working to transform the nation's Superfund environmental laws. He was also a staff member of the Seattle-based Washington Roundtable, a non-partisan policy research group composed of the chief executive officers of the state's largest corporations.[8]McGavick was Senior Financial Officer for Continental Casualty Company (CNA)'s Commercial Lines Group, Vice President of CNA's New Ventures group, and President and Chief Operating Officer of CNA's largest operating department. The department, with $3.5 billion in annual revenues, provided the majority of CNA's commercial insurance products.[9] It also was responsible for managing CNA's relationship with its independent agent distribution system.[9]SafecoMcGavick was named "CEO of the Year" by the Puget Sound Business Journal in 2002.[10] On July 18, 2005, McGavick announced that effective August 31 he would step down as CEO of Safeco, but would remain on as Chairman until the end of 2005. McGavick explained that he expected "to give full consideration to the possibility of public service". On July 19, 2005, McGavick announced that he was forming an exploratory committee for a 2006 bid for the Washington United States Senate seat held by Maria Cantwell.Family lifeBorn in 1958, McGavick grew up in Seattle's Wallingford neighborhood with two sisters, Molly and Meaghan. His parents, Joe and Carole, were active in local civics. He attended Seattle Preparatory School, an elite college prep school and graduated from the University of Washington with a degree in Political Science. He was also a key member of the Rugby team there. His father, Joe, served both in the State Legislature and on the State Liquor Control Board. Joe McGavick was the last Republican to serve the Wallingford neighborhood since the Great Depression.[11] McGavick has credited his father for sparking his interest in politics.[11]McGavick's wife, Gaelynn, is an attorney by training who has experience in the arena of health care policy, at one point working as a liaison to the White House for the American Hospital Association. The McGavicks have one son, Jack, who graduated from the University of Virginia with a master's degree in English and Education and played rugby. He also has two younger sons, Gates and Marco. Gates attends the University of Notre Dame, and Marco attends the Groton School. Both boys play rugby at the international and club level.Gates represented Bermuda's Youth national teams, and was one of 45 American players called to the US Olympic Training Center in Chula Vista, California in anticipation of the 2014 Youth Olympics in Nanjing, China. He intends on graduating from Notre Dame with degrees in Political Science and English.Senate campaignMain article: Washington United States Senate election, 2006McGavick makes "civility" a central campaign themeIn early January 2006, McGavick began his campaign full-time for the U.S. Senate, saying he would bring a "Northwestern voice of civility" to what he described as a culture of infighting in the nation's capital.[12]For most of July, the McGavick campaigned traveled around the state in an RV, making stops in: Seattle, Sedro-Woolley, Oak Harbor, Anacortes, Bellingham, Friday Harbor, Port Angeles, Forks, Clallam Bay, Bremerton, Belfair, Satsop, Aberdeen, Raymond, South Bend, Seaview, Naselle, Cathlamet, Vancouver, Goldendale, Pateros, Brewster, Republic, Colville, Spokane, Pullman, Clarkston, Pomeroy, Dayton, Prosser, Ritzville, Moses Lake, Leavenworth, and Yakima, among others.[13]Schwartzman v. McGavickIn August 2006, Safeco Insurance Co. shareholder Emma Schwartzman, the great, great granddaughter of one of the Safeco Corporation founders, filed a lawsuit[14] against him and the Safeco corporation, claiming that his $28 million salary upon leaving his job was fraudulent and wasteful.[15]Knoll Lowney, a Seattle lawyer, represented Schwartzman.Supported teaching intelligent designIn an August 2006 interview, McGavick said intelligent design should be taught in public schools and that it is appropriate to be taught in science class despite the 2005 court ruling prohibiting it.[16]Timeline of 2006 Senate raceOn October 26, 2005, McGavick announced on KIRO Radio that he was an official candidate in the 2006 Senate race.In the May 2006 edition of the Weekly Standard, McGavick made the argument that Iran should be banned from the FIFA World Cup due to its nuclear weapons research program and statements by Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad that deny the truthfulness of the holocaust (which is a criminal offense in the 2006 World Cup host country, Germany).[17]On April 26, 2006, the Washington State Democratic Party filed a complaint with the Federal Elections Commission alleging that the $17 million severance in cash and accelerated stock options given to him by Safeco amounted to an illegal campaign contribution to his Senate campaign. The FEC dismissed the case, stating, "The commission concluded that these payments were ordinary employment-related compensation made irrespective of Mr. McGavick's candidacy."[18]References^ Wallace Witkowski (April 30, 2010).

Michael S. McGavick Chief Executive OfficerXL Capital Ltd.Hamilton, BermudaHIS ROLE: Michael S. McGavick took over the reins at XL Capital Ltd. in May with hopes of turning the struggling Bermuda-based insurer and reinsurer around. Previously, Mr. McGavick was credited with reviving the ailing Seattle-based SAFECO Corp.ówhere he was president and CEO from 2001 to 2005. In 2006, the longtime insurance industry executive unsuccessfully ran as a Republican candidate for U.S. Senate in Washington state.WHAT'S AHEAD: Enormous challenges. The hard-hit insurer announced recently that it is reviewing ways to enhance shareholder value and is being assisted in that effort by Goldman Sachs & Co. The announcement came after speculation that XL is seeking to sell some or all of its operations. Analysts say the company could struggle to find potential buyers. In addition, XL recently issued guidance on fourth-quarter investment losses, saying the company expects market value losses in its investment portfolio to be largely in line with the $1.12 billion unrealized and realized losses the company reported for 2008's third quarter.XL also expects to report approximately $200 million to $220 million in net investment fund affiliate losses from its alternative investment portfolio for its fourth quarter. The news resulted in ratings downgrades by Standard & Poor's Corp. and Fitch Ratings.WHAT TO WATCH: All eyes will be on Mr. McGavick as he tries to steer XL through turbulent economic conditions and plot a course for the future. Some observers say market turbulence means the company would be more readily sold in pieces. One possible scenario would be for XL to sell its reinsurance business for cash and parlay that capital into its insurance business, analysts say.Despite the ratings downgrade, S&P said XL still has a strong financial position with $7.2 billion in cash and short-term investments as of Sept. 30. In a statement, Mr. McGavick said XL does not intend to seek additional capital at this time.
