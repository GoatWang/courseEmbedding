Chart Definitions
Income-oriented closed-end funds make payouts largely from interest	and dividends.
Income and capital appreciation funds seek regular cash	flow made up of interest and dividends, with the remainder from capital appreciation or, if necessary, return of capital.
Capital appreciation and income closed-end funds seek cash flow mainly from capital appreciation.
Single-asset-class funds invest primarily in one asset class, which can be used as components in a well-diversified income portfolio.
Pre-packaged combinations are funds featuring multiple asset types, which are designed to work together to diversify fund cash flow risks.

Closed the Income Gap®
with Nuveen Closed-End Funds



Closed-End Funds Offer Attractive Income Potential
In the search for increased income opportunities, closed-end funds can be a smart choice. Designed and built for income, closed-end funds seek to provide regular, stable cash flow over time and can serve as a compelling tool for optimizing an income portfolio.
Consider closed-end funds if you’re seeking to:1


1


Enhance Income and Cash Flow
Because of their unique closed structure and ability to use leverage,2 closed-end funds offer potentially higher distributions3 than traditional income investments.4


2


Manage Interest Rate Risk 
Floating rate, shorter duration or equity closed-end funds may help reduce a portfolio’s interest rate sensitivity.


3


Protect Purchasing Power
Closed-end funds that invest in real assets and dividend-paying stocks, which typically increase their payments with rising inflation, may help buffer the effects of rising inflation.


4


Maximize After-Tax Efficiency
Nuveen offers a wide array of national, state specific and AMT-free municipal closed-end funds that may help reduce your tax liability on investment income.5


5


Improve Diversification
With strategies that provide access to specialized asset classes, including alternatives, Nuveen closed-end funds may enhance portfolio diversification.

There is no guarantee that any of the funds will achieve their stated objectives. For detailed information on the specific risks associated with each fund, please view the fund overview by clicking on the fund name above.
1 Goal classifications represent common investor concerns when evaluating portfolio needs, are provided for informational purposes only, and are not intended to be relied upon as investment advice or recommendations.
2 Leverage typically magnifies the total return of a fund’s portfolio, whether that return is positive or negative, and creates an opportunity for increased common share net income as well as higher volatility of net asset value, market price, and distributions. There is no assurance that a fund’s leveraging strategy will be successful.
3 Potential distribution sources include net investment income, realized gains and return of capital.  
4 Different types of asset investments have different types of risks, which may provide higher returns but also greater volatility. In general, equity securities tend to be more volatile that fixed income securities. The value of, and income generated by, debt securities will decrease or increase based on changes in market interest rates. As interest rates risk, bond prices fall. In general, below investment grade (high-yield) debt securities tend to be more volatile than investment grade securities. Preferred securities are subordinated to bonds and other debt instruments in a company's capital structure, and therefore are subject to greater credit risk. The interest and principal payments of U.S. Treasury securities are guaranteed.
5 Income may be subject to state and local income taxes and the alternative minimum tax. Capital gains, if any, will be subject to capital gains tax.

LIMITED LIABILITY COMPANY AGREEMENT


 


                                       
OF


 


                    
GE EQUIPMENT MIDTICKET LLC, SERIES 2006-1


 


      
               
(A DELAWARE LIMITED LIABILITY COMPANY)


 


                             
Dated December 14, 2006


 


 


 


                    
GE EQUIPMENT MIDTICKET LLC, SERIES 2006-1


 


          
LIMITED LIABILITY COMPANY AGREEMENT dated as of December 14, 2006,


adopted by CEF Equipment Holding, L.L.C., as a member (the "Initial
Member").


 


                              
Preliminary Statement


 


          
The Initial Member desires to form a limited liability company
under


the Delaware Limited Liability Company Act (currently Chapter 18 of
Title 6 of


the Delaware Code), as amended from time to time (the "Act").


 


          
Accordingly, the Initial Member hereby adopts the following as the


"Limited Liability Company Agreement" of the Company within the
meaning of


Section 18-101(7) of the Act.


 


                                    
ARTICLE I


 


          
SECTION 1.1 Definitions. Capitalized terms used in this Agreement
and


not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings assigned to
such terms in


the "Definitions Addendum" attached to this Agreement and
incorporated herein


and shall otherwise have the meanings assigned to such terms in the
Act.


 


                                   
ARTICLE II


 


          
SECTION 2.1 Formation. The Company was formed as a limited
liability


company pursuant to the provisions of the Act on August 25, 2006 by
entry into


this Agreement and by the filing of the Certificate of Formation
with the office


of the Secretary of State of Delaware. The Initial Member hereby
adopts,


confirms and ratifies said Certificate of Formation and all acts
taken in


connection therewith. Yuli Rudin is hereby designated as an
"authorized person"


within the meaning of the Act, and has executed, delivered and
filed the


Certificate of Formation of the Company with the Secretary of State
of the State


of Delaware. Upon the filing of the Certificate of Formation with
the Secretary


of State of the State of Delaware, his powers as an "authorized
person" ceased,


and the Member thereupon became the designated "authorized person"
and shall


continue as the designated "authorized person" within the meaning
of the Act.


The Member shall execute, deliver and file any other certificates
(and any


amendments and/or restatements thereof) necessary for the Company
to qualify to


do business any other jurisdiction in which the Company may wish to
conduct


business. The existence of the Company as a separate legal entity
shall continue


until cancellation of the Certificate of Formation as provided in
the Act.


 


                                   
ARTICLE III


 


          
SECTION 3.1 Name. The name of the Company is GE Equipment Midticket


LLC, Series 2006-1.


 


 


 


                                   
ARTICLE IV


 


          
SECTION 4.1 Purpose and Limitations on Activities. The Company
shall


limit its purposes and activities to (i) the issuance and sale of
Membership


Interests, on the terms and conditions set forth herein; (ii)

(ix) the Company may sell or assign assets only as specified in the

other agreements on behalf of the Company.

CEF EQUIPMENT HOLDING LLC - S-3/A - 20030402 - SECURITIES_DESCRIPTION


	     


	Satisfaction and Discharge of
	Indenture.



	An indenture may be
	discharged with respect to the collateral securing the related
	notes upon the delivery to the related indenture trustee for
	cancellation of all of the related notes or upon deposit with
	the indenture trustee of funds sufficient for the payment in
	full of the notes.







	DESCRIPTION OF THE CERTIFICATES



	     

	Each issuer will issue one or more classes of
	certificates representing ownership interests in the issuer
	pursuant to a trust agreement or limited liability company
	agreement, as applicable. We have filed a form of the trust
	agreement or limited liability company agreement, as applicable,
	to be used as an exhibit to the registration statement of which
	this prospectus is a part. An issuers certificates may be
	offered by this prospectus or may be issued in transactions
	exempt from registration under the Securities Act or retained by
	us or our affiliates. We summarize the material terms of the
	certificates below. This summary does not include all of the
	terms of the certificates and is qualified by reference to the
	actual certificates.


	     

	We will describe the timing and priority of
	distribution, seniority, redeemability, allocations of losses,
	and amount of or method of determining distributions on invested
	amounts or distributions of the invested amounts on each class
	of certificates of a series in the related prospectus
	supplement. Certificateholders rights to receive
	distributions on their certificates will be subordinate to the
	payment rights of noteholders in the same series to the extent
	described in the applicable prospectus supplement. In addition,
	the right of holders of any class of certificates to receive
	distributions of invested amounts or distributions on the
	invested amounts may be senior or subordinate to the rights of
	holders of any other class or classes of certificates of the
	same series.





	ADMINISTRATIVE INFORMATION ABOUT THE
	SECURITIES






	Denominations



	     

	We will identify minimum denominations for
	purchase of securities in the related prospectus supplement. If
	we do not specify any denomination, then the securities will be
	available for purchase in minimum denominations of $250,000 and
	in greater $1,000 denominations.





	Fixed Rate Securities



	     

	Each class of securities may bear interest at a
	fixed rate per annum. We will identify the applicable interest
	rate for each class of fixed rate securities in the applicable
	prospectus supplement. Interest on each class of fixed rate
	securities will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year of
	twelve 30-day months, unless we specify a different computation
	basis in the applicable prospectus supplement.





	Floating Rate Securities



	     

	Each class of securities may bear interest for
	interest periods specified in the applicable prospectus
	supplement at a floating rate per annum equal to:













	 



	 




	a specified base interest rate, which will be
	based upon the London interbank offered rate (commonly known as
	LIBOR), commercial paper rates, federal funds rates,
	U.S. Government treasury securities rates, negotiable
	certificates of deposit rates or another index rate we specify
	in the applicable prospectus supplement;





	 




	 



	 




	plus or minus a spread of a number of
	basis points (

	i.e.

	, one-hundredths of a percentage point)
	we will specify in the applicable prospectus supplement;





	 




	 



	 




	or multiplied by a spread multiplier,
	which is a percentage that we will specify in the applicable
	prospectus supplement.






	23







	 



	     

	In the prospectus supplement for any floating
	rate securities we may also specify either or both of the
	following for any class:













	 



	 




	a maximum, or ceiling, on the rate at which
	interest may accrue during any interest period; and





	 




	 



	 




	a minimum, or floor, on the rate at which
	interest may accrue during any interest period.





	     

	In addition to any maximum interest rate
	specified in the applicable prospectus supplement, the interest
	rate applicable to any class of floating rate securities will in
	no event be higher than the maximum rate permitted by applicable
	law.


	     

	Each issuer that issues floating rate securities
	will appoint a calculation agent to calculate interest rates on
	each class of its floating rate securities. The applicable
	prospectus supplement will identify the calculation agent for
	each class of floating rate securities in the offered series.
	Determinations of interest by a calculation agent will be
	binding on the holders of the related floating rate securities,
	in the absence of manifest error. All percentages resulting from
	any calculation of the rate of interest on a floating rate
	security will be rounded, if necessary, to the nearest 1/100,000
	of 1% (.0000001), with five one-millionths of a percentage point
	rounded upward, unless we specify a different rounding rule in
	the related prospectus supplement.





	Indexed Securities



	     

	We may also specify in any prospectus supplement
	that any class of securities of the related series will be
	indexed securities. In that case, the principal
	amount payable at the maturity date for that class would be
	determined by reference to an index related to:













	 



	 




	the difference in the rate of exchange between
	United States dollars and a currency or composite currency
	specified in the prospectus supplement;





	 




	 



	 




	the difference in the price of a specified
	commodity on specified dates;





	 




	 



	 




	the difference in the level of a specified stock
	index, which may be based on U.S. or foreign stocks on
	specified dates; or





	 




	 



	 




	another objective price or economic measure
	described in the prospectus supplement.





	     

	We will disclose the manner of determining the
	principal amount payable on any indexed security and historical
	and other information concerning the index used in that
	determination in the applicable prospectus supplement, together
	with information concerning tax consequences to the holders of
	the indexed securities. This may include alternate means to
	calculate an index if a third party that initially calculates or
	announces the index ceases to do so or changes the basis upon
	which the index is calculated.


	     

	Unless we specify otherwise in the applicable
	prospectus supplement, interest on an indexed security will be
	payable based on the amount designated in the prospectus
	supplement as the face amount of the indexed
	security. We will also specify in the applicable prospectus
	supplement whether the principal amount of any indexed security
	that would be payable upon redemption or repayment prior to the
	applicable maturity date would be its face amount, its principal
	amount based on the applicable index at the time of redemption
	or repayment or some other amount.





	Book-Entry Registration



	     


	The Clearing
	Organizations.



	We will specify in the
	related prospectus supplement whether or not investors may hold
	their securities in book-entry form, directly or indirectly,
	through one of three major securities clearing organizations:













	 



	 




	in the United States, The Depository Trust
	Company (commonly known as

	DTC

	); or





	 




	 



	 




	in Europe, either Clearstream Banking,
	société anonyme (commonly known as

	Clearstream

	) or Euroclear Bank S.A./N.V., as
	operator (the

	Euroclear Operator

	) of the
	Euroclear system

	(Euroclear)

	.






	24







	 



	     

	Each of these issuers holds securities for its
	participating organizations and facilitates the clearance and
	settlement of securities transactions between its participants
	through electronic book-entry changes in the participants
	accounts. This eliminates the need for physical movement of
	certificates representing the securities.


	     

	DTC is a limited-purpose trust company organized
	under the New York Banking Law, a banking
	organization within the meaning of the New York Banking
	Law, a member of the Federal Reserve System, a clearing
	corporation within the meaning of the New York Uniform
	Commercial Code, and a clearing agency registered
	pursuant to Section 17A of the Securities Exchange Act. DTC
	participants include securities brokers and dealers, banks,
	trust companies, clearing corporations and certain other
	organizations. Indirect access to the DTC system is also
	available to others, such as securities brokers and dealers,
	banks, and trust companies that clear through or maintain a
	custodial relationship with a DTC participant, either directly
	or indirectly. The rules applicable to DTC and its participants
	are on file with the SEC.


	     

	Clearstream is a limited liability company
	organized under the laws of Luxembourg as a professional
	depository. It settles transactions in a number of currencies,
	including United States dollars. Clearstream provides its
	participants, among other things, services for safekeeping,
	administration, clearance and settlement of internationally
	traded securities and securities lending and borrowing.
	Clearstream interfaces with domestic markets in several
	countries. As a professional depository, Clearstream is subject
	to regulation by the Luxembourg Monetary Institute.
	Clearstreams participants are recognized financial
	institutions around the world, including underwriters,
	securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies, clearing
	corporations and certain other organizations and may include the
	underwriters of any series of securities. Indirect access to
	Clearstream is also available to others, such as banks, brokers,
	dealers and trust companies that clear through or maintain a
	custodial relationship with a Clearstream participant, either
	directly or indirectly.


	     

	Euroclear was created in 1968. It settles
	transactions in a number of currencies, including United States
	dollars. Euroclear includes various other services, including
	securities lending and borrowing. Euroclear interfaces with
	domestic markets in many countries generally similar to the
	arrangements for cross-market transfers with DTC described
	below. Euroclear is operated by the Euroclear Operator, and all
	Euroclear securities clearance accounts and Euroclear cash
	accounts are accounts with the Euroclear Operator, not the
	cooperative. The board of the cooperative establishes policy for
	Euroclear. Euroclear participants include banks (including
	central banks), securities brokers and dealers and other
	professional financial intermediaries and may include the
	underwriters of any series of securities. Indirect access to
	Euroclear is also available to other firms that maintain a
	custodial relationship with a Euroclear participant, either
	directly or indirectly.


	     

	The Euroclear Operator was granted a banking
	license by the Belgian Banking and Finance Commission in 2000,
	authorizing it to carry out banking activities on a global
	basis. It took over operation of Euroclear from the Brussels,
	Belgium office of Morgan Guaranty Trust Company of New York on
	December 31, 2000.


	     

	Securities clearance accounts and cash accounts
	with the Euroclear Operator are governed by the Terms and
	Conditions Governing Use of Euroclear and the related operating
	procedures of Euroclear. These Terms and Conditions govern
	transfers of securities and cash within Euroclear, withdrawal of
	securities and cash from Euroclear, and receipts of payments
	with respect to securities in Euroclear. All securities in
	Euroclear are held on a fungible basis without attribution of
	specific certificates to specific securities clearance accounts.
	The Euroclear Operator acts under the Terms and Conditions only
	on behalf of Euroclear participants and has no record of or
	relationship with persons holding through Euroclear participants.

	If book-entry arrangements
	are made, then a nominee for DTC will hold global certificates
	representing the securities. Clearstream and Euroclear will hold
	omnibus positions on behalf of their respective participants,
	through customers securities accounts in
	Clearstreams and Euroclears names on the books of
	their respective depositaries, which in turn will hold positions
	in customers securities accounts in the depositaries
	names on the books of DTC.


	     

	Transfers between DTCs participants will
	occur in accordance with DTC rules. Transfers between
	Clearstreams participants and Euroclears
	participants will occur in the ordinary way in accordance with
	their applicable rules and operating procedures.



	25







	 



	     

	Cross-market transfers between persons holding
	directly or indirectly through DTC, on the one hand, and
	directly or indirectly through Clearstream participants or
	Euroclear participants, on the other, will be effected in DTC in
	accordance with DTC rules on behalf of the relevant European
	international clearing system by its depositary. However, such
	cross-market transactions will require delivery of instructions
	to the relevant European international clearing system by the
	counterparty in such system in accordance with its rules and
	procedures and within its established deadlines (European time).
	The relevant European international clearing system will, if the
	transaction meets its settlement requirements, deliver
	instructions to its depositary to take action to effect final
	settlement on its behalf by delivering or receiving securities
	in DTC, and making or receiving payment in accordance with
	normal procedures for same-day funds settlement applicable to
	DTC. Clearstream participants and Euroclear participants may not
	deliver instructions directly to Clearstreams and
	Euroclears depositaries.


	     

	Because of time-zone differences, credits of
	securities in Clearstream or Euroclear as a result of a
	transaction with a DTC participant will be made during the
	subsequent securities settlement processing, dated the business
	day following the DTC settlement date. Credits or other
	transactions in securities settled during any processing will be
	reported to the relevant Clearstream participant or Euroclear
	participant on that business day. Cash received in Clearstream
	or Euroclear as a result of sales of securities by or through a
	Clearstream participant or a Euroclear participant to a DTC
	participant will be received with value on the DTC settlement
	date but will be available in the relevant Clearstream or
	Euroclear cash account only as of the business day following
	settlement in DTC.


	     

	Purchases of securities under the DTC system must
	be made by or through DTC participants, which will receive a
	credit for the securities on DTCs records. The ownership
	interest of each actual securityholder is in turn to be recorded
	on the DTC participants and indirect participants
	records.


	     

	Securityholders will not receive written
	confirmation from DTC of their purchase, but securityholders are
	expected to receive written confirmations providing details of
	the transaction, as well as periodic statements of their
	holdings, from the DTC participant or indirect participant
	through which the securityholder entered into the transaction.
	Transfers of ownership interests in the securities are to be
	accomplished by entries made on the books of DTC participants
	acting on behalf of securityholders. Securityholders will not
	receive certificates representing their ownership interest in
	securities, unless the book-entry system for the securities is
	discontinued. Because of this, unless and until definitive
	securities for such series are issued, securityholders will not
	be recognized by the applicable indenture trustee or trustee or
	managing member, as applicable, as noteholders,
	certificateholders or securityholders,
	as the case may be. Hence, unless and until definitive
	securities are issued, securityholders will only be able to
	exercise their rights as securityholders indirectly through DTC
	and its participating organizations.


	     

	To facilitate subsequent transfers, all
	securities deposited by DTC participants with DTC are registered
	in the name of DTCs nominee. The deposit of securities
	with DTC and their registration in the name of its nominee
	effects no change in beneficial ownership. DTC has no knowledge
	of the actual securityholders of the securities. Its records
	reflect only the issuer of the DTC participants to whose
	accounts such securities are credited, which may or may not be
	the securityholders. The DTC participants are responsible for
	keeping account of their holdings on behalf of their customers.


	     

	Notices and other communications conveyed by DTC
	to DTC participants, by DTC participants to indirect
	participants, and by DTC participants and indirect participants
	to securityholders are governed by arrangements among them and
	any statutory or regulatory requirements that are in effect from
	time to time.


	     

	Neither DTC nor its nominee will consent or vote
	with respect to securities. Under its usual procedures, DTC
	mails an omnibus proxy to the issuer as soon as possible after
	the record date, which assigns its nominees consenting or
	voting rights to those DTC participants to whose accounts the
	securities are credited on the record date (identified in a
	listing attached thereto).


	     

	Principal and interest payments on securities
	cleared through DTC will be made to DTC. DTCs practice is
	to credit participants accounts on the applicable payment
	date in accordance with their respective holdings shown on
	DTCs records unless DTC has reason to believe that it will
	not receive payment on the payment



	26







	 




	date. Payments by DTC participants to
	securityholders will be governed by standing instructions and
	customary practices, as is the case with securities held for the
	accounts of customers in bearer form or registered in
	street name and will be the responsibility of the
	DTC participant and not of DTC, the indenture trustee or the
	issuer, subject to any statutory or regulatory requirements that
	are in effect from time to time. Payment of principal and
	interest to DTC is the responsibility of the indenture trustee,
	disbursement of those payments to DTC participants is the
	responsibility of DTC, and disbursement of the payments to
	securityholders is the responsibility of DTC participants and
	indirect participants.



	     

	Principal and interest payments on securities
	held through Clearstream or Euroclear will be credited to the
	cash accounts of Clearstream participants or Euroclear
	participants in accordance with the relevant systems rules
	and procedures, to the extent received by its depositary. Those
	payments will be subject to tax reporting in accordance with
	relevant United States tax laws and regulations, as described
	below in U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences.
	Clearstream or the Euroclear operator, as the case may be, will
	take any other action permitted to be taken by a securityholder
	under a related agreement on behalf of a Clearstream participant
	or Euroclear participant only in accordance with its relevant
	rules and procedures and subject to its depositarys
	ability to effect such actions on its behalf through DTC.


	     

	Although DTC, Clearstream and Euroclear have
	agreed to the foregoing procedures in order to facilitate
	transfers of securities among participants of DTC, Clearstream
	and Euroclear, they are under no obligation to perform or
	continue to perform such procedures and such procedures may be
	discontinued at any time.


	     

	We obtained the information in this section
	concerning DTC, Clearstream and Euroclear and their respective
	book-entry systems from sources that we believe to be reliable,
	but we take no responsibility for its accuracy.





	Definitive Securities



	     

	Notes or certificates that are initially cleared
	through DTC will be issued in definitive, fully registered,
	certificated form to investors or their respective nominees,
	rather than to DTC or its nominee, only if:













	 



	 




	the administrator for any issuer advises the
	related indenture trustee or the related trustee or managing
	member, as applicable, in writing that DTC is no longer willing
	or able to discharge properly its responsibilities as depository
	with respect to such securities, and the administrator is unable
	to locate a qualified successor;





	 




	 



	 




	the administrator for any issuer, at its option,
	advises the indenture trustee in writing that it elects to
	terminate the book-entry system through DTC; or





	 




	 



	 




	after the occurrence of an event of default or a
	servicer default with respect to a series of securities,
	securityholders representing at least a majority of the
	outstanding principal amount of the notes or the certificates,
	as the case may be, in that series advise the applicable trustee
	or managing member, as applicable through DTC in writing that
	the continuation of a book-entry system through DTC (or a
	successor thereto) with respect to the notes or certificates is
	no longer in the best interest of their holders.





	     

	If any of these events occur, the applicable
	indenture trustee will be required to notify all holders of the
	securities in the affected series through clearing organization
	participants of the availability of definitive securities. Upon
	surrender by DTC of the definitive certificates representing the
	corresponding securities and receipt of instructions for
	re-registration, the applicable indenture trustee will reissue
	the securities to the securityholders as definitive securities.


	     

	Principal and interest payments on all definitive
	securities will be made by the applicable indenture trustee in
	accordance with the procedures set forth in the related
	indenture or the related servicing agreement directly to holders
	of definitive securities in whose names the definitive
	securities were registered at the close of business on the
	applicable record date specified for the securities in the
	related prospectus supplement. Those payments will be made by
	check mailed to the address of each holder as it appears on the
	register maintained by the applicable indenture trustee. The
	final payment on any definitive security, however, will be



	27







	 




	made only upon presentation and surrender of the
	definitive security at the office or agency specified in the
	notice of final distribution to the applicable securityholders.



	     

	Definitive securities will be transferable and
	exchangeable at the offices of the applicable indenture trustee
	or of a registrar named in a notice delivered to holders of
	definitive securities. No service charge will be imposed for any
	registration of transfer or exchange, but the applicable
	indenture trustee may require payment of a sum sufficient to
	cover any tax or other governmental charge imposed in connection
	with a transfer or exchange.





	List of Securityholders



	     

	Three or more holders of the notes of any series
	or one or more holders of notes evidencing at least 25% of the
	aggregate outstanding principal balance of the notes of a series
	may, by written request to the related indenture trustee, obtain
	access to the list of all noteholders maintained by the
	indenture trustee for the purpose of communicating with other
	noteholders with respect to their rights under the related
	indenture or the notes. The indenture trustee may elect not to
	afford the requesting noteholders access to the list of
	noteholders if it agrees to mail the desired communication or
	proxy, on behalf of and at the expense of the requesting
	noteholders, to all noteholders of their series.


	     

	Three or more holders of the certificates of any
	series or one or more holders of certificates evidencing at
	least 25% of the aggregate outstanding balance of the
	certificates of a series may, by written request to the related
	indenture trustee, obtain access to the list of all
	certificateholders maintained by the indenture trustee for the
	purpose of communicating with other certificateholders with
	respect to their rights under the related trust agreement or
	limited liability company agreement or the certificates.





	Reports to Securityholders



	     

	On or prior to each payment date for the
	securities of an issuer, the issuer shall or shall cause the
	servicer to, prepare and provide to the issuers indenture
	trustee (with a copy to the rating agencies) a statement to be
	delivered to the related noteholders and provide to the trustee
	or managing member, as applicable, a statement to be delivered
	to the related certificateholders on the payment date. Each of
	these statements will include, to the extent applicable to the
	particular series or class of securities, the following
	information (and any other information specified in the related
	prospectus supplement) with respect to the payment date or the
	period since the previous payment date:











	 


	     

	(1) the amount of any principal payment on
	each class of notes;





	 




	 


	     

	(2) the amount of any interest payment on
	each class of notes;





	 




	 


	     

	(3) the certificateholders
	distribution on invested amount on each class of certificates;





	 




	 


	     

	(4) the certificateholders
	distributable invested amount of each class of certificates;





	 




	 


	     

	(5) the pool balance as of the opening of
	business on the first day of the collection period in which such
	determination date occurs;





	 




	 


	     

	(6) the aggregate outstanding principal
	balance and the note pool factor for each class of notes after
	giving effect to all payments reported under clause
	(1) above, and the aggregate outstanding invested amount
	and the certificate pool factor for each class of such
	certificates, after giving effect to all distributions reported
	under clause (3) above;





	 




	 


	     

	(7) the amount of the servicing fee paid to
	the servicer for the prior calendar month;





	 




	 


	     

	(8) the aggregate realized losses, if any,
	for the prior calendar month;





	 




	 


	     

	(9) the amount of the administration fee
	paid to the administrator for the prior calendar month;





	 




	 


	     

	(10) the amount of outstanding servicer
	advances, if any, made by the servicer on such payment date, the
	amount of advances, if any, reimbursed on such payment date and
	the amount of advances, if any, which remain unreimbursed as of
	the end of such payment date;






	28







	 












	 


	     

	(11) the amount of the net losses on
	receivables, if any, during the prior calendar month; and





	 




	 


	     

	(12) the aggregate purchase price paid for
	receivables, if any, that were purchased or repurchased by us or
	the servicer during the prior calendar month.





	     

	Each amount described in subclauses (1), (2),
	(3), (4), (7) and (9) will be expressed as a dollar
	amount per $1,000 of the initial principal balance of the
	related notes or certificates.


	     

	The note pool factor for each class of notes will
	be a seven-digit decimal indicating the remaining outstanding
	principal balance of such class of notes, as of each payment
	date (after giving effect to payments to be made on such payment
	date), as a percentage of the initial outstanding principal
	balance of such class of notes. Similarly, the certificate pool
	factor for each class of certificates will be a seven-digit
	decimal indicating the remaining invested amount of such class
	of certificates, as of each payment date (after giving effect to
	distributions to be made on such payment date), as a fraction of
	the initial outstanding balance of such class of certificates.
	Each note pool factor and each certificate pool factor will
	initially be 1.0000000 and will decline over time to reflect
	reductions in the outstanding balance of the applicable class of
	notes or the remaining invested amount of the applicable class
	of certificates.


	     

	A noteholders portion of the aggregate
	outstanding principal balance of the related class of notes is
	the product of (i) the original denomination of the
	noteholders note and (ii) the applicable note pool
	factor. A certificateholders portion of the aggregate
	remaining invested amount of the related class of certificates
	is the product of (a) the original denomination of such
	certificateholders certificate and (b) the applicable
	certificate pool factor.


	     

	Within the prescribed period of time for tax
	reporting purposes after the end of each calendar year during
	the term of each issuer, the applicable indenture trustee will
	mail to each person who at any time during such calendar year
	has been a noteholder with respect to such issuer and received
	any payment thereon, a statement containing certain information
	for the purposes of such noteholders preparation of
	Federal income tax returns and the applicable administrator will
	mail to each person who at any time during such calendar year
	has been a certificateholder with respect to such issuer, a
	statement containing certain information for the preparation of
	such certificateholders preparation of Federal income tax
	returns.





	DESCRIPTION OF THE TRANSACTION
	AGREEMENTS



	     

	We summarize below the material terms of the
	agreements under which the finance companies will, directly or
	indirectly, sell receivables to us, and we will transfer them to
	each issuer, and under which GE Capital or any other
	finance company will agree to service the issuers
	receivables and administer the issuer. We will disclose any
	additional material terms relating to a particular issuers
	agreements in the related prospectus supplement. We have filed
	forms of these agreements as exhibits to the registration
	statement of which this prospectus is a part. The following
	summary does not include all of the terms of the agreements and
	is qualified by reference to the actual agreements.





	Regular Sales of Receivables



	     

	We buy receivables without recourse to the
	finance company for defaults by the obligors. However, such
	finance company represents and warrants to us on each purchase
	date as to the receivables being sold on that date, among other
	things, that each of the receivables meets our eligibility
	requirements and the information such finance company has
	provided to us about the receivables is correct in all material
	respects. The receivables we buy under these purchase agreements
	are originated by the finance companies or may have been
	acquired by the finance company from an unaffiliated seller in a
	portfolio or other acquisition. The finance companies may also
	sell receivables to another one of their subsidiaries, and we
	may buy the receivables from that subsidiary on substantially
	the same terms as our purchases from the finance companies.


	     

	We then sell receivables that we have acquired as
	described above to one of the issuers, pursuant to a sale
	agreement. These sales are also made without recourse. If the
	issuer will issue notes, it will pledge the receivables to
	secure the notes issued pursuant to the related indenture. The
	issuer will, concurrently with this



	29







	 




	sale, execute and deliver the related notes and
	certificates to us as consideration for the receivables sold by
	us to the issuer. We will apply the net proceeds received from
	the issuance of its notes and certificates to pay the finance
	companies for the related receivables, and, to the extent
	specified in the related prospectus supplement, to make a
	deposit in a pre-funding account and initial deposits in other
	trust accounts. If there is a pre-funding account, the finance
	companies will sell, directly or indirectly, additional
	receivables to us, and we will in turn sell them to the issuer
	from time to time during a pre-funding period, as described
	further in the related prospectus supplement.



	     

	If we breach any of our representations or
	warranties made in a sale agreement, and our breach is not cured
	by the last day of the second (or, if we elect, the first) month
	following the discovery by or notice to the indenture trustee of
	the breach, as liquidated damages, upon request of the issuer,
	we will be obligated to repurchase any receivable materially and
	adversely affected by our breach as of such last day at a price
	equal to the loan value of the receivable, as specified in the
	related prospectus supplement. Upon our request, the applicable
	finance company will have a corresponding repurchase obligation
	with respect to its transfer to us, of the receivables.


	     

	The obligors on the receivables are not notified
	that their receivables have been transferred by the finance
	companies to us or by us to the issuer. However, each finance
	company marks its accounting records to reflect these sales, and
	Uniform Commercial Code financing statements reflecting the
	sales are filed.


	     

	We have an option to purchase all of the
	remaining receivables owned by the issuer after their aggregate
	loan values fall below 10% of the sum of the loan values of all
	of the issuers receivables, measured for each receivable
	at the time of its sale to the issuer.





	Accounts



	     

	The issuer will establish and maintain the
	following bank accounts:













	 



	 




	a collection account, into which all payments
	made on or with respect to the related receivables will be
	deposited;





	 




	 



	 




	a note distribution account, into which amounts
	available for payment to the noteholders will be deposited and
	from which those payments will be made;





	 




	 



	 




	a certificate distribution account, into which
	amounts available for distribution to the certificateholders
	will be deposited and from which those distributions will be
	made; and





	 




	 



	 




	if so specified in the prospectus supplement, a
	pre-funding account.





	     

	We will describe any other accounts to be
	established for an issuer in the related prospectus supplement.


	     

	Funds held in an issuers bank accounts will
	be invested in the following types of investments (the

	Permitted Investments

	):











	 


	     

	(a) obligations of, or guaranteed as to the
	full and timely payment of principal and interest by, the United
	States or obligations of any agency or instrumentality thereof,
	when such obligations are backed by the full faith and credit of
	the United States;





	 




	 


	     

	(b) repurchase agreements on obligations
	specified in clause (a);

	provided

	, that the
	short-term debt obligations of the party agreeing to repurchase
	are rated in the highest rating category by the applicable
	rating agency;





	 




	 


	     

	(c) federal funds, certificates of deposit,
	time deposits and bankers acceptances (which shall each
	have an original maturity of not more than 90 days or, in
	the case of bankers acceptances, shall in no event have an
	original maturity of more than 365 days) of any United
	States depository institution or trust company incorporated
	under the laws of the United States or any State thereof or of
	any United States branch or agency of a foreign commercial bank;

	provided

	that the short-term debt obligations of such
	depository institution or trust company are rated in the highest
	rating category by the applicable rating agency;






	30







	 












	 


	     

	(d) commercial paper (having original
	maturities of not more than 30 days) which on the date of
	acquisition are rated in the highest rating category by the
	applicable rating agency;





	 




	 


	     

	(e) securities of money market funds rated
	in the highest rating category by the applicable rating agency;
	and





	 




	 


	     

	(f) any other investment permitted by each
	of the applicable rating agencies as set forth in writing
	delivered to the indenture trustee.





	     

	Permitted Investments described in clauses
	(e) and (f) will be made only so long as making such
	investments will not require the issuer to register as an
	investment company, in accordance with the Investment Company
	Act of 1940. During any pre-funding period, no investments in
	money market funds will be made with funds in any account other
	than the collection account. Also, so long as they meet the
	criteria listed above, these investments may include securities
	issued by us or our affiliates. Except as described below with
	respect to spread accounts, the investments made in each
	issuers bank accounts are limited to obligations or
	securities that mature on or before the business day preceding
	the next payment date.


	     

	In the event of defaults on investments made in
	an issuers bank accounts, investors in the securities
	could experience losses or payment delays. Earnings from these
	investments, net of losses and investment expenses, will be
	deposited in the applicable collection account on each payment
	date and treated as collections on the related receivables.


	     

	Each issuers bank accounts will be
	maintained in one of the following forms:













	 



	 




	a segregated deposit account maintained with a
	depository institution or trust company whose short-term
	unsecured debt obligations are rated in the highest rating
	category from each applicable rating agency;





	 




	 



	 




	a segregated account which may be an account
	maintained in the corporate trust department of the Indenture
	Trustee, which is maintained with a depository institution or
	trust company whose long term unsecured debt obligations have a
	credit rating from each applicable rating agency in one of its
	generic rating categories which signifies investment grade;





	 




	 



	 




	a segregated trust account or similar account
	maintained with a federally or state chartered depository
	institution whose long term unsecured debt obligations have a
	credit rating from each applicable rating agency in one of its
	generic rating categories which signifies investment
	grades subject to regulations regarding fiduciary funds on
	deposit substantially similar to 12 C.F.R.
	§ 9.10(b) in effect on the closing date; or





	 




	 



	 




	as any other segregated account the deposit of
	funds in which has been approved by the applicable rating
	agencies.








	Servicing Procedures



	     

	The servicer will agree to conduct the servicing,
	administration and collection and take, or cause to be taken,
	all actions that may be necessary or advisable to collect all
	payments on the receivables owned by each issuer, that it would
	take if the receivables were owned by it and that are consistent
	with the issuers credit and collection policies. These
	procedures may vary in some respects between receivables
	originated by finance companies other than GE Capital and other
	receivables. The servicer on behalf of the issuer may, in its
	discretion, arrange with the obligor on a receivable to extend
	or modify the payment schedule. However, no such arrangement
	will be permitted to extend the final payment date of any
	receivable beyond the maturity date specified for the related
	securities in the applicable prospectus supplement.


	     

	If the servicer forecloses on the collateral for
	a receivable, the servicer, on behalf of the issuer, may sell
	the collateral at public or private sale, or take any other
	action permitted by applicable law.



	31







	 






	Collections



	     

	The issuer will deposit, or cause to be deposited
	by the servicer, all payments received on an issuers
	receivables during a calendar month into the related collection
	account within two business days after receipt. However, at any
	time when there exists no servicer default and each other
	condition to making deposits less frequently than daily as may
	be specified by the applicable rating agencies or set forth in
	the related prospectus supplement is satisfied, the issuer will
	not be required to deposit payments into the collection account
	until on or before the business day preceding the applicable
	payment date. Pending deposit into the collection account, the
	issuer may or may cause the servicer to, invest collections at
	such issuers, or servicers, own risk, as applicable,
	and for such issuers, or servicers, own benefit, as
	applicable, and the collections will not be segregated from such
	issuers, or servicers, own funds, as applicable. If
	the issuer or the servicer acting at the request of the issuer
	were unable to remit such funds, securityholders might incur a
	loss. To the extent described in the related prospectus
	supplement, the servicer may, in order to satisfy the
	requirements described above, obtain a letter of credit or other
	security for the benefit of the related issuer to secure timely
	remittances of collections on the related receivables.


	     

	At any time when the issuer is permitted to remit
	collections once a month, the issuer will be permitted to make
	that deposit net of distributions to be made to the servicer
	with respect to the same calendar month.





	Servicing Compensation



	     

	With respect to each issuer, the servicer will be
	entitled to receive a servicing fee for each calendar month in
	an amount equal to a percentage per annum specified in the
	related prospectus supplement of the aggregate loan value of the
	issuers receivables as of the first day of the applicable
	calendar month. The servicing fee will be paid solely from the
	sources, and at the priority, specified in the related
	prospectus supplement including, but not limited to, late fees,
	prepayment charges, modification fees and other ancillary
	amounts. Any fees agreed to between the servicer, and the
	subservicer, shall be paid solely by the servicer.





	Servicing Advances



	     

	The servicer may, but shall have no obligation
	to, make a servicer advance in the manner and to the extent
	provided in the servicing agreement, but only to the extent the
	servicer, in its sole discretion, expects to be reimbursed for
	such advance. If the servicer elects to make a servicer advance,
	prior to the close of business on each determination date, the
	servicer will determine the amount of the advance that it has
	elected to make on the related transfer date. The servicer shall
	include information as to such determination in the
	servicers certificate furnished by it and will transfer to
	the collection account on the transfer date in next day funds
	the amounts applicable to such determinations appearing in such
	servicers certificate. The servicer shall be reimbursed
	for outstanding servicer advances as provided in your prospectus
	supplement and interest will accrue on such advance as provided
	in your prospectus supplement.





	Evidence as to Compliance



	     

	Each servicing agreement will require that a firm
	of independent public accountants furnish to the issuer and
	indenture trustee annually a statement as to compliance by the
	servicer during the preceding twelve months (or in the case of
	the first such certificate, from the applicable closing date)
	with specified standards relating to the servicing of the
	applicable receivables, the servicers accounting records
	and computer files and certain other matters.


	     

	Each servicing agreement will also require that
	an officer of the servicer deliver to the related issuer,
	substantially simultaneously with the delivery of the
	accountants statement, a certificate stating that the
	servicer has fulfilled its obligations under the servicing
	agreement throughout the preceding twelve months (or, in the
	case of the first such certificate, from the closing date) or,
	if there has been a default in the fulfillment of any such
	obligation, describing each such default. The indenture will
	require the issuer to deliver a copy of such accountants
	statement to the indenture trustee.



	32







	 



	     

	Securityholders may obtain copies of such
	statements and certificates by written request addressed to the
	owner trustee or managing member, as applicable.





	Appointment of Subservicers



	     

	The servicer may at any time appoint a
	subservicer to perform all or any portion of its obligations as
	servicer. The servicer shall remain obligated and be liable to
	the issuer for the servicing of the receivables in accordance
	with the applicable servicing agreement without diminution of
	those obligations and liabilities by virtue of the appointment
	of any subservicer and to the same extent and under the same
	terms and conditions as if the servicer itself were servicing
	and administering the receivables. The fees and expenses of each
	subservicer shall be as agreed between the servicer and its
	subservicer from time to time and the issuer shall not have any
	responsibility therefor.





	Resignation, Liability and Successors of the
	Servicer



	     

	The servicer will not be permitted to resign from
	its obligations and duties as servicer for any issuer, except as
	provided under the relevant servicing agreement. No resignation
	will become effective until a successor servicer has assumed
	such servicers servicing obligations and duties.


	     

	Neither the servicer nor any of its directors,
	officers, employees and agents will be under any liability to
	any issuer for taking any action or for refraining from taking
	any action under the applicable servicing agreement or for
	errors in judgment. However, the servicer will not be protected
	against any liability that would otherwise be imposed by reason
	of willful misfeasance, bad faith or negligence in the
	performance of the servicers duties thereunder or by
	reason of reckless disregard of its obligations and duties
	thereunder. In addition, the servicer will not be under any
	obligation to appear in, prosecute or defend any legal action
	that is not incidental to the servicers servicing
	responsibilities under the related servicing agreement and that,
	in its opinion, may cause it to incur any expense or liability.


	     

	Upon compliance with procedural requirements
	specified in the related servicing agreement, any of the
	following will be the successor of the servicer under that
	servicing agreement:













	 



	 




	any entity into which the servicer may be merged
	or consolidated, or any entity resulting from any merger or
	consolidation to which the servicer is a party,





	 




	 



	 




	any entity succeeding to the business of the
	servicer, or





	 




	 



	 




	any corporation 50% or more of the voting stock
	of which is owned, directly or indirectly, by General Electric
	Capital Services, Inc., which assumes the obligations of the
	servicer.







	Servicer Default



	     

	The following events will constitute
	servicer defaults under each servicing agreement
	unless otherwise provided in your prospectus supplement:













	 



	 




	the servicer fails to make required deposits or
	to direct the indenture trustee to make required distributions,
	subject to a three business day cure period after discovery or
	notice;





	 




	 



	 




	the servicer breaches its obligations under the
	servicing agreement, subject to materiality limitations and a
	60 day cure period after notice; and





	 




	 



	 




	bankruptcy or insolvency of the servicer.








	Rights Upon Servicer Default



	     

	If a default under a servicing agreement occurs
	and remains unremedied with respect to a servicer default, the
	indenture provides that the related issuer will promptly
	exercise its rights to terminate the servicer with respect to
	certain servicer defaults set forth in your prospectus
	supplement and if any other servicer default occurs under the
	servicing agreement, prior to terminating the servicer, the
	indenture requires the issuer to obtain the consent of holders
	of notes of the related series evidencing at least 50% in
	outstanding



	33







	 




	principal amount of such notes (or of one or more
	particular classes of such notes, if specified in the related
	prospectus supplement). In that event, a successor servicer
	appointed by the issuer will succeed to all the
	responsibilities, duties and liabilities of the servicer under
	the servicing agreement and will be entitled to similar
	compensation arrangements.



	     

	If a successor servicer has not been appointed
	and accepted its appointment at the time when the servicer
	ceases to act as servicer, the indenture trustee will
	automatically be appointed as the successor servicer. If the
	indenture trustee is unwilling or unable to act as successor
	servicer, it may resign, after which the issuer will appoint a
	successor with a net worth of at least $50,000,000 and whose
	regular business includes the servicing of aircraft or aircraft
	related equipment receivables.





	Waiver of Past Defaults



	     

	With respect to each issuer, unless otherwise
	provided in the related prospectus supplement, such issuer may,
	upon obtaining the consent of the holders of notes of such
	series evidencing at least 50% in outstanding principal amount
	of such notes, waive any default by the servicer in the
	performance of its obligations under the related servicing
	agreement and its consequences, except a default in making any
	required deposits to or payments from any of the trust accounts.
	Therefore, the issuer, with the consent of the requisite
	noteholders, has the ability to waive defaults by the servicer
	which could materially adversely affect the certificateholders.
	None of these waivers will impair the issuers rights with
	respect to subsequent defaults.





	Amendment



	     

	Unless otherwise provided in the related
	prospectus supplement, each of an issuers transaction
	agreements may be amended by the parties to the agreement,
	without the consent of the related noteholders or
	certificateholders, upon prior written notice to the rating
	agencies. In addition, unless otherwise provided in the related
	prospectus supplement, each of an issuers transaction
	agreements may be amended by the parties to the agreement,
	without the consent of the related noteholders or
	certificateholders, to substitute or add credit enhancement for
	any class of securities, so long as the applicable rating
	agencies confirm in writing that such substitution or addition
	will not result in a reduction or withdrawal of the rating of
	any class of securities in the related series.


	     

	Unless otherwise specified in the related
	prospectus supplement, each of an issuers transaction
	agreements may be amended by the parties to the agreement, with
	the consent of the indenture trustee, the holders of notes
	evidencing at least a majority in principal amount of then
	outstanding notes of the related series and the holders of
	certificates of such series evidencing at least a majority of
	the invested amount of the certificates. However, no such
	amendment may (a) increase or reduce in any manner the
	amount of, or accelerate or delay the timing of, collections of
	payments on the related receivables or distributions that are
	required to be made for the benefit of such noteholders or
	certificateholders or (b) reduce the required percentage of
	the notes or certificates that are required to consent to any
	such amendment, without the consent of the holders of all the
	outstanding notes or certificates, as the case may be, of such
	series.





	Termination



	     

	With respect to each issuer, our obligations and
	the obligations of the servicer, the related owner trustee or
	managing member, as applicable, and the related indenture
	trustee pursuant to the issuers transaction agreements
	will terminate upon (a) the maturity or other liquidation
	of the last related receivables and the disposition of any
	amounts received upon liquidation of any such remaining
	receivables and (b) the payment to noteholders and
	certificateholders of the related series of all amounts required
	to be paid to them pursuant to the transaction agreements. The
	servicer will provide notice of any termination of such
	obligations to the owner trustee or managing member, as
	applicable. Following receipt of notice from the servicer, the
	owner trustee or managing member, as applicable, will mail
	notice of such termination to the certificateholders. The issuer
	will mail notice of any such termination to the indenture
	trustee and the noteholders.



	34







	 






	Administration Agreement



	     

	GE Capital or any other finance company will
	enter into an administration agreement with each issuer under
	which such finance company will act as administrator for the
	issuer. The administrator will perform, on behalf of the issuer,
	administrative obligations required by the related indenture.





	Swap Agreements



	     

	If specified in your prospectus supplement, the
	related issuer will, on or prior to closing date, enter into one
	or more swap agreements with one or more swap counterparties for
	purposes of managing the issuers interest rate risk
	exposure relating to differences in the basis upon which
	interest accrues on the Aircraft Loans and the basis upon which
	interest accrues on the notes and distributions on the invested
	amount which are made on any certificates.





	CREDIT AND CASH FLOW ENHANCEMENT



	     

	We will describe the amounts and types of credit
	enhancement arrangements and the provider of the credit
	enhancements, if applicable, with respect to each class of
	securities of a given series in the related prospectus
	supplement. Credit enhancement may be in the form of
	subordination of one or more classes of securities, spread
	accounts, over-collateralization, demand notes, letters of
	credit, credit or liquidity facilities, surety bonds, guaranteed
	investment contracts, swaps or other interest rate protection
	agreements, repurchase obligations, other agreements with
	respect to third party payments or other support, cash deposits
	or such other arrangements as may be described in the related
	prospectus supplement or any combination of two or more of the
	foregoing. Credit enhancement for a class of securities may
	cover one or more other classes of securities of the same
	series, and credit enhancement for a series of securities may
	cover one or more other series of securities. Any credit
	enhancement that constitutes a guarantee of the applicable
	securities will be separately registered under the Securities
	Act unless exempt from such registration.


	     

	The presence of a spread account and other forms
	of credit enhancement for the benefit of any class or series of
	securities is intended to enhance the likelihood of receipt by
	the securityholders of the full amount of payments on the notes
	or distributions in respect of certificates and to decrease the
	likelihood that the securityholders will experience losses. The
	credit enhancement for a class or series of securities generally
	will not provide protection against all risks of loss and will
	not guarantee repayment of the entire principal balance, with
	interest on the notes, or all distributions on certificate
	invested amounts and distributions of certificate invested
	amounts. If losses occur which exceed the amount covered by any
	credit enhancement or which are not covered by any credit
	enhancement, securityholders of any class or series will bear
	their allocable share of deficiencies, as described in the
	related prospectus supplement. In addition, if a form of credit
	enhancement covers more than one class or series of securities,
	securityholders of any one class or series will be subject to
	the risk that the credit enhancement will be exhausted by the
	claims of securityholders of other classes or series.


	     

	The issuer may replace the credit enhancement for
	any class of securities with another form of credit enhancement
	without the consent of securityholders, if the applicable rating
	agencies confirm in writing that the substitution will not
	result in the reduction or withdrawal of their rating of any
	class of securities of the related series.


	     


	Spread Account.



	If
	so provided in the related prospectus supplement, the issuer
	will establish for a series or class of securities a spread
	account. The issuer may initially fund any spread account by a
	deposit on the applicable closing date in an amount set forth in
	the related prospectus supplement. As further described in the
	related prospectus supplement, the amount on deposit in the
	spread account may be increased on each payment date up to a
	balance specified in the related prospectus supplement by the
	deposit of collections on the related receivables remaining
	after all higher priority payments on that payment date. We will
	describe in the related prospectus supplement the circumstances
	and manner under which distributions may be made out of the
	spread account to holders of securities, to the issuer or to any
	of the issuers transferees or assignees.



	35







	 



	     

	To the extent permitted by the applicable rating
	agencies, funds in an issuer spread account may be invested in
	securities that will not mature prior to the next payment date.
	As a result, the amount of cash in a spread account at any time
	may be less than the balance of the spread account. If the
	amount required to be withdrawn from any spread account to cover
	shortfalls in collections on the related receivables (as
	provided in the related prospectus supplement) exceeds the
	amount of cash in the spread account, a temporary shortfall in
	the amounts paid or distributed to the related noteholders or
	certificateholders could result, which could, in turn, increase
	the average life of the related securities.


	     

	The issuer may at any time, without consent of
	the securityholders, sell or otherwise transfer its rights to
	any spread account, if (a) the applicable rating agencies
	confirm in writing that doing so will not result in a reduction
	or withdrawal of the rating of any class of securities,
	(b) the issuer provides to the owner trustee or managing
	member, as applicable, and the indenture trustee a written
	opinion from independent counsel to the effect that the transfer
	will not cause the issuer to be treated as an association or
	publicly traded partnership taxable as a corporation for Federal
	income tax purposes and (c) the transferee or assignee
	agrees in writing to take positions for tax purposes consistent
	with the tax positions agreed to be taken by the issuer.





	LEGAL ASPECTS OF THE RECEIVABLES






	Bankruptcy Considerations Relating to the
	Finance Companies



	     

	We and the finance companies will take steps in
	structuring the transactions described in this prospectus that
	are intended to ensure that the voluntary or involuntary
	application for relief by any of the finance companies under the
	United States Bankruptcy Code or other insolvency laws will not
	result in consolidation of our assets and liabilities or the
	assets and liabilities of the issuer with those of GE Capital or
	any other finance company. These steps include the creation of
	the issuer as a separate, limited-purpose subsidiary pursuant to
	an operating agreement or trust agreement containing
	restrictions on the nature of the issuers business. Our
	operating agreement also contains such restrictions as well as a
	restriction on our ability to commence a voluntary case or
	proceeding under any insolvency law without the unanimous
	affirmative vote of all our directors. However, there can be no
	assurance that our activities would not result in a court
	concluding that our assets and liabilities or the issuers
	assets and liabilities should be consolidated with those of GE
	Capital or any other finance company in a proceeding under any
	insolvency law.


	     

	Each finance company that sells receivables to us
	will warrant that each sale of receivables by it to us is a
	valid sale. If a finance company were to become a debtor in a
	bankruptcy case, and a creditor or trustee-in-bankruptcy or the
	debtor itself were to take the position that either or both of
	the transfers of receivables should instead be treated as a
	pledge of receivables to secure a borrowing, then delays in
	payments of collections of receivables to the issuer (and in
	payments on the notes and distributions on the certificates)
	could occur. If the court ruled in favor of the creditor, owner
	trustee or managing member, as applicable, or a finance company,
	reductions in the amount of such payments could result.


	     

	If any transfer of receivables referred to above,
	or any of our transfers of receivables to the issuer, were
	treated as a pledge instead of a sale, a tax or government lien
	on the property of the transferor arising before the sale of the
	receivable may have priority over the issuers interest in
	the receivable. If those transfers are treated as sales, the
	receivables would not be part of the transferors
	bankruptcy estate and would not be available to the
	transferors creditors, except under limited circumstances.
	In addition, cash collections on the receivables may, under some
	circumstances, be commingled with the funds of the servicer and,
	in the event of the bankruptcy of the servicer, an issuer may
	not have a perfected interest in those collections.





	Perfection and Priority With Respect to
	Receivables



	     

	A purchaser of Aircraft Loans who gives new value
	and takes possession of the chattel paper or obtains control of
	the chattel paper that evidences the Aircraft Loans in good
	faith, in the ordinary course of the purchasers business
	and without knowledge that the purchase violates the rights of
	an issuer as secured party, may have priority over the interest
	of the related issuer in the Aircraft Loans. Any sale by a
	finance company



	36







	 




	of Aircraft Loans that had been sold to an issuer
	would be a violation of the finance companies contractual
	obligations.






	Security Interests in Financed
	Equipment



	     

	In some states, receivables like the ones that
	may be included in your issuer, evidence the credit sale of
	aircraft and aircraft related equipment. In those states, the
	receivables also constitute personal property security
	agreements and include grants of security interests in the
	aircraft or aircraft related receivables under the applicable
	Uniform Commercial Code. Perfection of security interests in
	aircraft related equipment such as engines, propellers or spares
	is generally governed by the Uniform Commercial Code. However,
	perfection of security interests in aircraft registered in the
	United States of America is governed by Title 49 of the United
	States Code (49 U.S.C.§§44101-44112).


	     

	Each of the finance companies takes appropriate
	action under the laws of each state in which the obligor is
	located to perfect its security interest in the aircraft with
	respect to the aircraft related equipment that may be perfected
	by the filing of financing statements under the applicable
	Uniform Commercial Code. Each of the finance companies will make
	the appropriate filings with the Federal Aviation Administration
	in the case of the aircraft.


	     

	Although recordation with the Federal Aviation
	Administration serves to notify third parties of conveyances and
	security interests, state law governs other legal issues.
	Compliance with recordation requirements does not validate a
	contract which is otherwise lacking in validity, such as a
	mortgage or conveyance obtained by fraud or without
	consideration, or executed by an incompetent party. In addition,
	the validity of title documents affecting aircraft, actual
	notice, good faith purchaser status and similar issues is
	determined by state rather than federal law.


	     

	Although federal recordation is required to
	perfect a security interest before that security interest can
	obtain priority, state law determines the order of such
	priorities. For example, Section 9-317(a) of Revised
	Article 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code governs whether
	the holder of a duly perfected security interest in an aircraft
	takes priority over a lien creditor with respect to
	such aircraft, whereas proper federal recordation merely enables
	such holder to perfect its security interest.


	     

	As liquidated damages, upon request of the
	issuer, we are required to purchase from each issuer any
	Aircraft Loan as to which necessary perfection actions have not
	been taken prior to the time of sale to the issuer, if the
	failure to take those actions will materially adversely affect
	the interest of the issuer in the receivable and the failure is
	not cured within a specified grace period. Similarly, upon our
	request, each finance company that sells receivables to us is
	required to purchase any such receivable if the failure occurred
	prior to its transfer of the receivable to us. In addition, the
	servicer is required to take appropriate steps to maintain
	perfection of security interests in the financed equipment.


	     

	In addition, under the laws of most states, liens
	for repairs performed on the aircraft and liens for unpaid taxes
	take priority over even a perfected security interest in
	equipment. We will represent to each issuer that, as of the date
	the related receivable is sold to such issuer, each security
	interest in financed aircraft or aircraft related equipment is
	or will be prior to all other present liens on and security
	interests in the financed equipment. However, liens and other
	charges giving rise to similar rights of detention are likely to
	arise in the normal course of operation of an aircraft for items
	such as airport taxes, customs duties, storage, air navigation
	charges, landing charges, fuel, crew wages, repairers
	charges or salvage. Also, error, fraud or forgery by the
	aircraft owner or the servicer or administrative error by state
	or local agencies could impair an issuers security
	interest. Neither we nor the servicer must repurchase a
	receivable if any of the occurrences described above, other than
	any action by the servicer, result in the issuers losing
	the priority of its security interest or its security interest
	in the financed aircraft or aircraft related equipment after the
	date the security interest was assigned to the issuer.

	Security Interests in Leased
	Equipment



	     

	When we sell leases to an issuer, we also assign
	to the issuer any security or ownership interest that we hold in
	the leased equipment. Each lease will be a lease intended for
	security (often referred to as a finance lease)
	rather than a true lease.




	true
	lease



	= the lessor (

	i.e

	.,
	the originating dealer and its assigns) is deemed to be the
	beneficial owner of the leased equipment.




	finance
	lease



	(not a true lease) = the
	lessee is deemed to be the beneficial owner, and the lessor (or
	its assignee) is deemed to hold a security interest in the
	leased equipment.


	     

	All leases that will be transferred to an issuer
	will have either bargain purchase options or be conditional sale
	contracts, which under applicable state law standards should be
	deemed to be finance leases. Each of the finance companies will
	obtain a first priority perfected security interest in the
	leased equipment. As a result of these actions, for the finance
	leases, the applicable finance company and its assigns will have
	a very similar position to the one described above with respect
	to loans, and the same repurchase obligations apply if there is
	no first priority perfected security interest.


	     

	In the event that a finance company were to
	become a debtor in a bankruptcy case, a bankruptcy trustee might
	attempt to characterize the finance leases as true leases and if
	successful, would have the ability to reject such leases,
	resulting in cancellation of the remaining scheduled payments
	under the leases.


	     

	State laws differ as to whether anyone suffering
	injury to person or property involving leased aircraft or other
	related aircraft equipment may bring an action upon which relief
	may be granted against the owner of the aircraft or aircraft
	related equipment by virtue of that ownership. To the extent the
	leases are deemed to be true leases and the issuer is deemed to
	be the owner of such equipment, the applicable state law may
	permit such an action and if such action is successful, the
	related issuer and its assets may be subject to liability to the
	injured party. If vicarious liability were imposed on an issuer
	as owner of leased equipment, and the coverage provided by any
	available insurance is insufficient to cover the loss, you could
	incur a loss on your investment.


	     

	Title 49 of the United States Code provides for a
	statutory limitation of liability for owners, lessors and
	secured parties of aircraft who are not in the actual possession
	or control of such aircraft.


	     

	Under Title 49 of the United States Code, a
	lessor, owner or secured party is liable for personal injury,
	death, or property loss or damage only when a civil aircraft,
	aircraft engine, or propeller is in the actual possession or
	control of the lessor, owner or secured party, and the personal
	injury, death, or property loss or damage occurs because of:
	(1) the aircraft, engine, or propeller; or (2) the
	flight of, or an object falling from, the aircraft, engine, or
	propeller.


	     

	Although neither we nor the issuer operate or
	control any aircraft, both the issuer and ourselves may be named
	as a defendant in a lawsuit resulting from any incident
	involving an obligors aircraft and be required to bear any
	consequences, costs and expenses.





	Repossession



	     

	Upon a default by an aircraft or aircraft related
	equipment purchaser, the holder of an Aircraft Loan that is
	treated as a personal property security interest, has all the
	remedies of a secured party under the Uniform Commercial Code,
	except where specifically limited by other state laws. Under
	those remedies, the secured party may perform self-help
	repossession unless it would constitute a breach of the peace.
	Self-help is accomplished simply by retaking possession of the
	financed or leased equipment. Some jurisdictions require that
	the obligor be notified of the default and be given time to cure
	the default prior to repossession. Generally, the right of
	reinstatement may be exercised on a limited number of occasions
	in any one-year period. In cases where the obligor objects or
	raises a defense to repossession, or if otherwise required by
	applicable state law, a court order must be obtained from the
	appropriate state court, and the aircraft or aircraft related
	equipment must then be repossessed in accordance with that
	order. Although self help is an available remedy it is rarely
	used. In most cases, a notice of default is sent to the obligor
	and legal counsel is instructed to commence legal proceedings to
	recover the equipment.



	38







	 






	Notice of Sale; Redemption Rights



	     

	The Uniform Commercial Code and other state laws
	require a secured party to provide an obligor with reasonable
	notice of the date, time and place of any public sale and/or the
	date after which any private sale of collateral may be held. The
	obligor has the right to redeem the collateral prior to actual
	sale by paying the secured party the unpaid principal balance of
	the obligation plus reasonable expenses for repossessing,
	holding and preparing the collateral for disposition and
	arranging for its sale, plus, in some jurisdictions, reasonable
	attorneys fees, or, in some states, by payment of
	delinquent installments or the unpaid balance.





	Uniform Commercial Code
	Considerations



	     

	Many states have adopted a version of
	Article 2A of the Uniform Commercial Code that purports to
	codify many provisions of existing common law. Although there is
	little precedent regarding how Article 2A will be
	interpreted, it may, among other things, limit the
	enforceability of any unconscionable lease or
	unconscionable provision in a lease, provide a
	lessee with remedies, including the right to cancel the lease,
	for certain lessor breaches or defaults and leases where the
	lessee is a merchant lessee. However, each finance
	company that sells a lease will represent that, to the best of
	their knowledge, each lessee has accepted the aircraft or
	aircraft related equipmentleased to it and, after reasonable
	opportunity to inspect and test, has not notified the applicable
	finance company of any defects. Article 2A does, however,
	recognize typical commercial lease hell or high
	water rental payment clauses and validates reasonable
	liquidated damages provisions in the event of lessor or lessee
	defaults. Article 2A also recognizes the concept of freedom
	of contract and permits the parties in a commercial context a
	wide degree of latitude to vary provisions of the law.





	Deficiency Judgments and Excess Proceeds;
	Other Limitations



	     

	The proceeds of resale of aircraft or aircraft
	related equipment generally will be applied first to the
	expenses of resale and repossession and then to the satisfaction
	of the indebtedness. Some states impose prohibitions or
	limitations on deficiency judgments if the net proceeds from
	resale do not cover the full amount of the indebtedness. In
	other states, a deficiency judgment against the debtor can be
	sought for the shortfall. However, because a defaulting obligor
	may have very little capital or sources of income available
	following repossession, in many cases it may not be useful to
	seek a deficiency judgment. If one is obtained, it may be
	uncollectible or settled at a significant discount.


	     

	Occasionally, after resale of the aircraft or
	aircraft related equipment and payment of all expenses and all
	indebtedness, there is a surplus of funds. In that case, the
	Uniform Commercial Code requires the creditor to remit the
	surplus to any holder of a lien on the aircraft or aircraft
	related equipment or, if no such lienholder exists, to the
	former owner of the equipment.


	     

	Courts have applied general equitable principles
	to secured parties pursuing repossession and litigation
	involving deficiency balances. These equitable principles may
	have the effect of relieving an obligor from some or all of the
	legal consequences of a default.


	     

	In several cases, obligors have asserted that the
	self-help remedies of secured parties under the Uniform
	Commercial Code and related laws violate the due process
	protections provided under the 14th Amendment to the
	Constitution of the United States. Courts have generally upheld
	the notice provisions of the Uniform Commercial Code and related
	laws as reasonable or have found that the repossession and
	resale by the creditor do not involve sufficient state action to
	afford constitutional protection to borrowers. As to leases,
	some jurisdictions require that a lessee be notified of a
	default and given a time period within which to cure the default
	prior to repossession of leased equipment.


	     

	In addition to the laws limiting or prohibiting
	deficiency judgments, numerous other statutory provisions,
	including federal bankruptcy laws and related state laws, may
	interfere with or affect the ability of a secured party to
	realize upon collateral or to enforce a deficiency judgment. For
	example, in a Chapter 11, 12 or 13 proceeding under the
	federal bankruptcy law, a court may prevent a creditor from
	repossessing equipment, and, as part of the rehabilitation plan,
	reduce the amount of the secured indebtedness to the market
	value of



	39







	 




	the aircraft or aircraft related equipment at the
	time of bankruptcy (as determined by the court), leaving the
	creditor as a general unsecured creditor for the remainder of
	the indebtedness. A bankruptcy court may also reduce the monthly
	payments due under a contract or change the rate of interest and
	time of repayment of the indebtedness.






	U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES



	     

	The following is a summary of the material
	U.S. Federal income tax consequences of the purchase,
	ownership and disposition of the notes and certificates. This
	summary is based upon current provisions of the Internal Revenue
	Code of 1986, called the

	Code

	, proposed,
	temporary and final Treasury regulations thereunder, and
	published rulings and court decisions currently in effect. The
	current tax laws and the current regulations, rulings and court
	decisions may be changed, possibly retroactively. The portions
	of this summary which relate to matters of law or legal
	conclusions represent the opinion of Mayer, Brown, Rowe &
	Maw, special Federal tax counsel for each issuer, as qualified
	in this summary. Mayer, Brown, Rowe & Maw have prepared or
	reviewed the statements in this prospectus under the heading
	U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences, and are
	of the opinion that they are correct in all material respects.


	     

	The following summary does not furnish
	information in the level of detail or with the attention to an
	investors specific tax circumstances that would be
	provided by an investors own tax advisor. For example, it
	does not discuss the tax consequences of the purchase, ownership
	and disposition of the notes and certificates by investors that
	are subject to special treatment under the Federal income tax
	laws, including banks and thrifts, insurance companies,
	regulated investment companies, dealers in securities, holders
	that will hold the notes or certificates as a position in a
	straddle for tax purposes or as a part of a
	synthetic security or conversion
	transaction or other integrated investment comprised of
	the notes or certificates and one or more other investments,
	trusts and estates and pass-through issuers, the equity holders
	of which are any of these specified investors. In addition, the
	discussion regarding the notes and certificates is limited to
	the Federal income tax consequences of the initial investors and
	not a purchaser in the secondary market and to investors who
	have purchased notes and who hold those notes as capital assets
	within the meaning of Section 1221 of the Code.


	     

	Each issuer will be provided with an opinion of
	Mayer, Brown, Rowe & Maw regarding certain Federal income
	tax matters discussed below. An opinion of Mayer, Brown, Rowe
	& Maw, however, is not binding on the Internal Revenue
	Service, called the

	IRS,

	or the courts.
	Moreover, there are no cases or IRS rulings on similar
	transactions involving both debt and equity interests issued by
	an issuer with terms similar to those of the notes and the
	certificates. As a result, the IRS may disagree with all or a
	part of the discussion below. No ruling on any of the issues
	discussed below will be sought from the IRS. For purposes of the
	following summary, references to the issuer, the notes, the
	certificates and related terms, parties and documents refer,
	unless otherwise specified, to each issuer and the notes,
	certificates and related terms, parties and documents applicable
	to that issuer.





	Tax Characterization of the Issuer



	     

	Mayer, Brown, Rowe & Maw is of the opinion
	that the issuer will not be an association (or publicly traded
	partnership) taxable as a corporation for Federal income tax
	purposes. This opinion is based on the assumption of compliance
	by all parties with the terms of the issuer agreement and
	related documents.


	     

	If the issuer were taxable as a corporation for
	Federal income tax purposes, the issuer would be subject to
	corporate income tax on its taxable income. The issuers
	taxable income would include all its income on the receivables,
	possibly reduced by its interest expense on the notes. Any
	corporate income tax imposed on the issuer could materially
	reduce cash available to make payments on the notes and
	distributions on the certificates, and certificateholders could
	be liable for any tax that is unpaid by the issuer.

	Tax Consequences to Holders of the
	Notes



	     


	Treatment of the Notes as Indebtedness.



	The issuer will agree, and if you
	purchase notes, you will agree by your purchase of the notes, to
	treat the notes as debt for Federal, state and local income and
	franchise tax purposes. Mayer, Brown, Rowe & Maw is of the
	opinion that the notes will be classified as debt for Federal
	income tax purposes. The discussion below assumes the notes are
	classified as debt for Federal income tax purposes.


	     


	OID, Indexed Securities, etc.



	The discussion below assumes that all
	payments on the notes are denominated in U.S. dollars, and that
	the notes are not indexed securities or strip notes.
	Additionally, the discussion assumes that the interest formula
	for the notes meets the requirements for qualified stated
	interest under Treasury regulations, called the

	OID Regulations,

	relating to original issue
	discount, or

	OID.

	This discussion assumes
	that any OID on the notes is a

	de minimis

	amount, within
	the meaning of the OID Regulations. Under the OID Regulations,
	the notes will have OID to the extent the principal amount of
	the notes exceeds their issue price. Further, if the notes have
	any OID, it will be

	de minimis

	if it is less
	than  1/4% of the principal amount of the notes multiplied
	by the number of full years included in their term. If these
	conditions are not satisfied for any given series of notes and
	as a result the notes are treated as issued with OID, additional
	tax considerations for these notes will be disclosed in the
	applicable prospectus supplement.


	     


	Interest Income on the Notes.



	Based on the above assumptions, except
	as discussed below, the notes will not be considered issued with
	OID. If you buy notes, you will be required to report as
	ordinary interest income the stated interest on the notes when
	received or accrued in accordance with your method of tax
	accounting. Under the OID Regulations, if you hold a note issued
	with a

	de minimis

	amount of OID, you must include this
	OID in income, on a pro rata basis, as principal payments are
	made on the note. If you purchase a note in the secondary market
	for more or less than its principal amount, you will generally
	be subject, respectively, to the premium amortization or market
	discount rules of the Code.


	     

	If you have purchased a note that has a fixed
	maturity date of not more than one year from the issue date of
	the note, called a

	Short-Term Note

	, you may
	be subject to special rules. Under the OID Regulations, all
	stated interest on a Short-Term Note will be treated as OID. If
	you are an accrual basis holder of a Short-Term Note or a cash
	basis holder specified in Section 1281 of the Code,
	including regulated investment companies, you will generally be
	required to report interest income as OID accrues on a
	straight-line basis over the term of each interest period. If
	you are a cash basis holder of a Short-Term Note other than
	those specified in Section 1281, you will, in general, be
	required to report interest income as interest is paid, or, if
	earlier, upon the taxable disposition of the Short-Term Note.
	However, if you are a cash basis holder of a Short-Term Note
	reporting interest income as it is paid, you may be required to
	defer a portion of any interest expense otherwise deductible on
	indebtedness incurred to purchase or carry the Short-Term Note.
	This interest expense would be deferred until the taxable
	disposition of the Short-Term Note. If you are a cash basis
	taxpayer, you may elect under Section 1281 of the Code to
	accrue interest income on all nongovernment debt obligations
	with a term of one year or less. If you have so elected, you
	would include OID on the Short-Term Note in income as it
	accrues, but you would not be subject to the interest expense
	deferral rule. Special rules not discussed in this summary apply
	to a Short-Term Note purchased for more or less than its
	principal amount.


	     


	Sale or Other Disposition.



	If you sell a note, you will recognize
	gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference between the
	amount realized on the sale and your adjusted tax basis in the
	note. The adjusted tax basis of a note will equal your cost for
	the note, increased by any market discount, OID and gain
	previously included in your income with respect to the note and
	decreased by the amount of premium, if any, previously amortized
	and by the amount of principal payments you have previously
	received on the note. Any gain or loss will be capital gain or
	loss, except for gain representing accrued interest and accrued
	market discount not previously included in income. Capital
	losses generally may be used by a corporate taxpayer only to
	offset capital gains, and by an individual taxpayer only to the
	extent of capital gains plus $3,000 of other income. In the case
	of an individual taxpayer, any capital gain on the sale of a
	note will be taxed at the taxpayers ordinary income tax
	rate if the note is held for not more than 12 months and at
	a maximum rate of 20% if the note is held for more than
	12 months.



	41







	 



	     


	Foreign Holders.



	If
	you are a nonresident alien, foreign corporation or other
	non-United States person, called a

	foreign
	person

	, any interest paid to or accrued by you
	(including OID) generally will be considered portfolio
	interest and generally will not be subject to U.S. Federal
	income tax and withholding tax provided that: the income is
	effectively connected with your conduct of a trade or business
	carried on in the United States and:


	     

	(i) you do not actually or constructively
	own 10% or more of the total combined voting power of all
	classes of stock of us (or of a profits or capital interest in
	the issuer if characterized as a partnership);


	     

	(ii) you are not a controlled foreign
	corporation that is related to us (or the issuer if treated as a
	partnership) through stock ownership;


	     

	(iii) you are not a bank whose receipt of
	interest on a note is described in Section 881(c)(3)(A) of
	the Code; and


	     

	(iv) the interest is not contingent interest
	described in Section 871(h)(4) of the Code.


	     

	To qualify for this exemption from taxation, you,
	or a financial institution holding the note on your behalf, must
	provide, in accordance with specified procedures, a paying agent
	of the issuer with a statement to the effect that you are not a
	U.S. person. Currently these requirements will be met if
	you provide your name and address, and certify, under penalties
	of perjury, that you are not a U.S. person (which
	certification may be made on an IRS Form W-8BEN), or if a
	financial institution holding the note on your behalf certifies,
	under penalties of perjury, that the required statement has been
	received by it and furnishes a paying agent with a copy of the
	statement.


	     

	If you are a foreign person and interest paid or
	accrued to you is not portfolio interest, then it
	will be subject to a 30% withholding tax unless you provide the
	issuer or its paying agent, as the case may be, with a properly
	executed:













	 



	 




	IRS Form W-8BEN, claiming an exemption from
	withholding tax or a reduction in withholding tax under the
	benefit of a tax treaty, or





	 




	 



	 




	IRS Form W-8ECI, stating that interest paid
	on the note is not subject to withholding tax because it is
	effectively connected with your conduct of a trade or business
	in the United States.





	     

	If you are a foreign person engaged in a trade or
	business in the United States and interest on the note is
	effectively connected with the conduct of the trade or business,
	although you will be exempt from the withholding tax discussed
	above, you will be subject to United States Federal income tax
	on your interest on a net income basis in the same manner as if
	you were a United States person. In addition, if you are a
	foreign corporation, you may be subject to a branch profits tax
	equal to 30%, or lower treaty rate, of your effectively
	connected earnings and profits for the taxable year, subject to
	adjustments.


	     

	If you are a foreign person, any capital gain
	realized by you on the sale, redemption, retirement or other
	taxable disposition of a note by you will be exempt from United
	States Federal income and withholding tax;

	provided

	that:













	 



	 




	the gain is not effectively connected with the
	conduct of a trade or business in the United States by you, and





	 




	 



	 




	if you are an individual foreign person, you have
	not been present in the United States for 183 days or more
	in the taxable year.





	     


	Backup Withholding.



	If you are not an exempt holder, including a corporation,
	tax-exempt organization, qualified pension and profit-sharing
	issuer, individual retirement account or nonresident alien who
	provides certification as to status as a nonresident, you will
	be required to provide, under penalties of perjury, a
	certificate containing your name, address, correct federal
	taxpayer identification number and a statement that you are not
	subject to backup withholding. If you are not an exempt holder
	and you fail to provide the required certification, the issuer
	will be required to withhold a percentage of the amount
	otherwise payable to you, and remit the withheld amount to the
	IRS as a credit against your Federal income tax liability.
	Pursuant to the



	42







	 




	Economic Growth and Tax Reconciliation Act of
	2001, a backup withholding rate of 30% is in effect for the
	taxable years 2002 and 2003, is reduced to 29% for the taxable
	years 2004 and 2005 and is further reduced to 28% for the
	taxable years 2006 and thereafter. Under current law, the backup
	withholding rate will be increased to 31% for payments made
	after the taxable year 2010. Information returns will be sent
	annually to the IRS and to each note holder setting forth the
	amount of interest paid on the notes owned by that note holder
	and the amount of tax withheld on those payments.



	     


	Possible Alternative Treatments of the
	Notes.



	If, contrary to the opinion of
	Mayer, Brown, Rowe & Maw, the IRS successfully asserted that
	one or more of the notes did not represent debt for Federal
	income tax purposes, the notes might be treated as equity
	interests in the issuer. In this case, the issuer would be
	treated as a partnership. This partnership would not, however,
	be treated as a publicly traded partnership taxable as a
	corporation because it would meet certain qualifying income
	tests. Nonetheless, treatment of the notes as equity interests
	in a partnership could have adverse tax consequences to you. For
	example, if you are a foreign person, income to you might be
	subject to U.S. tax and U.S. tax return filing and withholding
	requirements, and if you are an individual holder, you might be
	subject to certain limitations on your ability to deduct your
	share of issuer expenses.





	Tax Consequences to Holders of the
	Certificates



	     

	The following discussion applies only to the
	extent certificates are offered in a related prospectus
	supplement. Until that time, because the certificates will be
	held solely by us or one of our affiliates, under current
	Treasury regulations, an issuer of certificates will be
	disregarded as an entity separate from us or one of our
	affiliates, for Federal income tax purposes.


	     


	Treatment of the Issuer as a
	Partnership.



	We will agree, and you
	will agree by your purchase of certificates, to treat the issuer
	as a partnership for purposes of Federal and state income tax,
	franchise tax and any other tax measured in whole or in part by
	income. The assets of the partnership will be the assets held by
	the issuer, the partners of the partnership will be the
	certificateholders, including us in our capacity as recipient of
	distributions from any account specified in the related
	prospectus supplement in which we have an interest, and the
	notes will be debt of the partnership. However, the proper
	characterization of the arrangement involving the issuer, the
	certificates, the notes and us is not clear because there is no
	authority on transactions closely comparable to this arrangement.


	     

	A variety of alternative characterizations are
	possible. For example, because the certificates have certain
	features characteristic of debt, the certificates might be
	considered our debt or debt of the issuer. This characterization
	should not result in materially adverse tax consequences to
	certificateholders compared to the consequences from treatment
	of the certificates as equity in a partnership, described below.
	The following discussion assumes that the certificates represent
	equity interests in a partnership.


	     


	Indexed Securities, etc.



	The following discussion assumes that
	all payments on the certificates are denominated in
	U.S. dollars, none of the certificates are indexed
	securities or strip certificates and a series of securities
	includes a single class of certificates. If these conditions are
	not satisfied with respect to any given series of certificates,
	additional tax considerations for those certificates will be
	disclosed in the applicable prospectus supplement.


	     


	Partnership
	Taxation.



	As a partnership, the issuer
	will not be subject to Federal income tax. Rather, you will be
	required to separately take into account your accruals of
	guaranteed payments from the issuer and your allocated share of
	other income, gains, losses, deductions and credits of the
	issuer. The issuers income will consist primarily of
	interest and finance charges earned on the receivables,
	including appropriate adjustments as necessary for market
	discount, OID and premium, and any gain upon collection or
	disposition of receivables. The issuers deductions will
	consist primarily of interest accruing on the notes, guaranteed
	payments on the certificates, servicing and other fees, and
	losses or deductions upon collection or disposition of
	receivables.


	     

	Under the trust agreement or limited liability
	company agreement, as applicable, interest payments on the
	certificates, including interest on amounts previously due on
	the certificates but not yet distributed, will be



	43







	 




	treated as guaranteed payments under
	Section 707(c) of the Code. Guaranteed payments are
	payments to partners for the use of their capital and, in the
	present circumstances, are treated as deductible to the issuer
	and as ordinary income to you. The issuer will have a calendar
	year tax year and will deduct the guaranteed payments under the
	accrual method of accounting. If you use a calendar year tax
	year, you will be required to include the accruals of guaranteed
	payments in income in your taxable year that corresponds to the
	year in which the issuer deducts the payments. If you use a
	taxable year other than a calendar year, you will be required to
	include the payments in income in your taxable year that
	includes the December 31 of the calendar year in which the
	issuer deducts the payments. It is possible that guaranteed
	payments will not be treated as interest for all purposes of the
	Code.



	     

	In addition, the trust agreement or limited
	liability company agreement, as applicable, will provide, in
	general, that you will be allocated taxable income of the issuer
	for each calendar month equal to the sum of:













	 



	 




	any issuer income attributable to discount on the
	receivables that corresponds to any excess of the principal
	amount of the certificates over their initial issue price;





	 




	 



	 




	prepayment premium, if any, payable to you for
	such month; and





	 




	 



	 




	any other amounts of income payable to you for
	the month.





	     

	This allocation will be reduced by any
	amortization by the issuer of premium on receivables
	corresponding to any excess of the issue price of certificates
	over their principal amount. All remaining items of income,
	gain, loss and deduction of the issuer will be allocated to us.


	     

	Based upon the economic arrangement of the
	parties, this approach for accruing guaranteed payments and
	allocating issuer income should be permissible under applicable
	Treasury regulations. However, no assurance can be given that
	the IRS would not require a greater amount of income to be
	allocated to you. Moreover, even under the method of allocation
	described above, you may be subject to tax on income equal to
	the interest rate on the certificates

	plus

	the other
	items described above even though the issuer might not have
	sufficient cash to make current cash distributions of this
	amount. Thus, if you are a cash basis taxpayer, you will in
	effect be required to report income from the certificates on the
	accrual basis and you may become liable for taxes on issuer
	income even if you have not received cash from the issuer to pay
	those taxes. In addition, because tax allocations and tax
	reporting will be done on a uniform basis for all
	certificateholders but certificateholders may be purchasing
	certificates at different times and at different prices, you may
	be required to report on your tax returns taxable income that is
	greater or less than the amount reported to you by the issuer.


	     

	Most of the guaranteed payments and taxable
	income allocated to a certificateholder that is a pension,
	profit-sharing or employee benefit plan or other tax-exempt
	issuer, including an individual retirement account, will
	constitute unrelated debt-financed income generally
	taxable to the holder under the Code.


	     

	Your share of expenses of the issuer, including
	fees to the servicer but not interest expense, would be
	miscellaneous itemized deductions. These deductions might be
	disallowed to you in whole or in part and, as a result, you
	might be taxed on an amount of income that exceeds the amount of
	cash actually distributed to you over the life of the issuer. It
	is not clear if these rules would apply to a certificateholder
	who accrues guaranteed payments.


	     

	The issuer intends to make all tax calculations
	for income and allocations to certificateholders on an aggregate
	basis. If the IRS were to require that these calculations be
	made separately for each receivable, the issuer might be
	required to incur additional expense, but it is believed that
	there would not be a material adverse effect to you.


	     


	Discount and
	Premium.



	The purchase price paid by
	the issuer for the receivables may be greater or less than the
	remaining principal balance of the receivables at the time of
	purchase. If so, the receivables will have been acquired at a
	premium or discount, respectively. As indicated above, the
	issuer will make this calculation on an aggregate basis, but
	might be required to recompute it on a receivable-by-receivable
	basis.



	44







	 



	     

	If the issuer acquires the receivables at a
	market discount or premium, the issuer will elect to include any
	discount in income currently as it accrues over the life of the
	receivables or to offset any premium against interest income on
	the receivables. As indicated above, a portion of any market
	discount income or premium deduction may be allocated to you.


	     


	Section 708
	Termination.



	Under Section 708 of
	the Code, the issuer will be deemed to terminate for Federal
	income tax purposes if 50% or more of the capital and profits
	interests in the issuer are sold or exchanged within a 12-month
	period. Under current Treasury regulations, if a termination
	occurs, the issuer will be considered to have contributed the
	assets of the issuer, constituting the old partnership, to a new
	partnership in exchange for interests in the new partnership.
	Such interest would be deemed distributed to the partners of the
	old partnership in liquidation thereof. The issuer will not
	comply with certain technical requirements that might apply if a
	constructive termination occurs. As a result, the issuer may be
	subject to certain tax penalties and may incur additional
	expenses if it is required to comply with those requirements.
	Furthermore, the issuer might not be able to comply due to lack
	of data.


	     


	Disposition of
	Certificates.



	Generally, you will
	recognize capital gain or loss on a sale of certificates in an
	amount equal to the difference between the amount realized and
	your tax basis in the certificates sold. Your tax basis in a
	certificate will generally equal your cost for the certificate
	increased by your share of issuer income and accruals of
	guaranteed payments (includible in income) and decreased by any
	distributions received by you with respect to the certificate.
	In addition, both the tax basis in the certificates and the
	amount realized on a sale of a certificate would include your
	share of the notes and other liabilities of the issuer. If you
	acquire certificates at different prices, you may be required to
	maintain a single aggregate adjusted tax basis in the
	certificates, and, upon sale or other disposition of some of the
	certificates, allocate a pro rata portion of the aggregate tax
	basis to the certificates sold rather than maintaining a
	separate tax basis in each certificate for purposes of computing
	gain or loss on a sale of that certificate.


	     

	Any gain on the sale of a certificate
	attributable to your share of unrecognized accrued market
	discount on the receivables would generally be treated as
	ordinary income to you and would give rise to special tax
	reporting requirements. The issuer does not expect to have any
	other assets that would give rise to these special reporting
	requirements. Thus, to avoid those special reporting
	requirements, the issuer will elect to include market discount
	in income as it accrues.


	     

	If you are required to recognize an aggregate
	amount of income, not including income attributable to
	disallowed itemized deductions described above, over the life of
	the certificates that exceeds the aggregate cash distributions
	paid to you on the certificates, this excess will generally give
	rise to a capital loss upon the retirement of the certificates.


	     


	Allocations Between Transferors and
	Transferees.



	In general, the
	issuers taxable income and losses will be determined
	monthly and the tax items and accruals of guaranteed payments
	for a particular calendar month will be apportioned among the
	certificateholders in proportion to the principal amount of
	certificates owned by them as of the close of the last day of
	the month. As a result, you may be allocated tax items and
	accruals of guaranteed payments, which will affect your tax
	liability and tax basis, attributable to periods before you
	purchased your certificates.


	     

	The use of a monthly convention may not be
	permitted by existing regulations. If a monthly convention is
	not allowed, or only applies to transfers of less than all of
	the partners interest, taxable income or losses and
	accruals of guaranteed payments of the issuer might be
	reallocated among the certificateholders. We are authorized to
	revise the issuers method of allocation between
	transferors and transferees to conform to a method permitted by
	future Treasury regulations.


	     


	Section 754
	Election.



	If a certificateholder sells
	its certificates at a profit (loss), the purchasing
	certificateholder will have a higher (lower) basis in the
	certificates than the selling certificateholder had. The tax
	basis of the issuers assets will not be adjusted to
	reflect that higher (or lower) basis unless the issuer were to
	file an election under Section 754 of the Code. In order to
	avoid the administrative complexities that would be involved in
	keeping accurate accounting records, as well as potentially
	onerous information reporting



	45







	 




	requirements, the issuer will not make this
	election. As a result, you might be allocated a greater or
	lesser amount of issuer income than would be appropriate based
	upon your own purchase price for certificates.



	     


	Administrative
	Matters.



	The trustee or managing
	member, as applicable, is required to keep or have kept complete
	and accurate books of the issuer. These books will be maintained
	for financial reporting and tax purposes on an accrual basis and
	the fiscal year of the issuer will be the calendar year. The
	trustee or managing member, as applicable, will file a
	partnership information return on IRS Form 1065 with the
	IRS for each taxable year of the issuer and will report each
	certificateholders accruals of guaranteed payments and
	allocable share of items of issuer income and expense to
	certificateholders and the IRS on Schedule K-1. The issuer
	will provide the Schedule K-1 information to nominees that
	fail to provide the issuer with the information statement
	described below and these nominees will be required to forward
	such information to the beneficial owners of the certificates.
	Generally, you must file tax returns that are consistent with
	the information return filed by the issuer or be subject to
	penalties unless you notify the IRS of all inconsistencies.


	     

	Under Section 6031 of the Code, any person
	that holds certificates as a nominee at any time during a
	calendar year is required to furnish the issuer with a statement
	containing certain information on the nominee, the beneficial
	owners and the certificates so held. This information includes
	the name, address and taxpayer identification number of the
	nominee, and, as to each beneficial owner:













	 



	 




	the name, address and taxpayer identification
	number of that person,





	 




	 



	 




	whether that person is a United States person, a
	tax-exempt entity or a foreign government, an international
	organization, or any wholly-owned agency or instrumentality of a
	foreign government or an international organization, and





	 




	 



	 




	certain information on certificates that were
	held, bought or sold on behalf of that person throughout the
	year.





	     

	In addition, brokers and financial institutions
	that hold certificates through a nominee are required to furnish
	directly to the issuer information regarding themselves and
	their ownership of certificates. A clearing agency registered
	under Section 17A of the Securities Exchange Act is not
	required to furnish this information statement to the issuer.
	The information referred to above for any calendar year must be
	furnished to the issuer on or before the following
	January 31. Nominees, brokers and financial institutions
	that fail to provide the issuer with the information described
	above may be subject to penalties.


	     

	We will be designated as the tax matters partner
	in the trust agreement or limited liability company agreement,
	as applicable, and, therefore, will be responsible for
	representing you in any dispute with the IRS. The Code provides
	for administrative examination of a partnership as if the
	partnership were a separate and distinct taxpayer. Generally,
	the statute of limitations for partnership items does not expire
	before three years after the date on which the partnership
	information return is filed. Any adverse determination following
	an audit of the return of the issuer by the appropriate taxing
	authorities could result in an adjustment of your tax returns,
	and, under certain circumstances, you may be precluded from
	separately litigating a proposed adjustment to the items of the
	issuer. An adjustment could also result in an audit of your tax
	returns and adjustments of items not related to the income and
	losses of the issuer.


	     


	Tax Consequences to Foreign
	Certificateholders.



	It is not clear
	whether the issuer would be considered to be engaged in a trade
	or business in the United States for purposes of Federal
	withholding taxes on non-U.S. persons because there is no
	clear authority dealing with this issue under facts
	substantially similar to ours. Although it is not expected that
	the issuer would be engaged in a trade or business in the United
	States for these purposes, the issuer will withhold as if it
	were so engaged in order to protect the issuer from possible
	adverse consequences of a failure to withhold. The issuer
	expects to withhold pursuant to Section 1446 of the Code,
	on the portion of its taxable income allocable to foreign
	certificateholders as if this income were effectively connected
	to a U.S. trade or business, at the taxpayers
	ordinary income tax rate. Subsequent adoption of Treasury
	regulations or the issuance of other administrative
	pronouncements may require the issuer to change its withholding
	procedures. In determining a certificateholders nonforeign
	status, the issuer may rely on IRS Form W-8BEN, IRS
	Form W-9 or the certificateholders certification of
	nonforeign status signed under penalties of perjury.



	46







	 



	     

	Each foreign certificateholder might be required
	to file a U.S. individual or corporate income tax return
	and pay U.S. income tax on the amount computed therein,
	including, in the case of a corporation, the branch profits tax,
	on its share of accruals of guaranteed payments and the
	issuers income. Each foreign certificateholder must obtain
	a taxpayer identification number from the IRS and submit that
	number to the issuer on Form W-8BEN in order to assure
	appropriate crediting of the taxes withheld. A foreign
	certificateholder generally would be entitled to file with the
	IRS a claim for refund for taxes withheld by the issuer, taking
	the position that no taxes were due because the issuer was not
	engaged in a U.S. trade or business. However, the IRS may
	assert that additional taxes are due, and no assurance can be
	given as to the appropriate amount of tax liability.


	     


	Backup Withholding.



	Distributions made on the certificates and proceeds from the
	sale of the certificates will be subject to a backup withholding
	tax at a current rate of 30% if, as discussed above in
	connection with the notes, you fail to comply with certain
	identification procedures, unless you are an exempt recipient
	under applicable provisions of the Code. See Tax
	Consequences to Holders of the Notes  Backup
	Withholding.





	STATE TAX CONSEQUENCES



	     

	The above discussion does not address the tax
	consequences of the purchase, ownership or disposition of the
	notes or certificates under any state or local tax law. We
	suggest that you consult your own tax advisors regarding the
	state and local tax consequences of the purchase, ownership and
	disposition of the notes and certificates.





	ERISA CONSIDERATIONS



	     

	Section 406 of the Employee Retirement
	Income Security Act of 1974, as amended
	(

	ERISA

	) and Section 4975 of the Code
	prohibit a pension, profit-sharing or other employee benefit
	plan, as well as individual retirement accounts and specified
	types of Keogh Plans and collective investment funds or
	insurance company general or separate accounts in which these
	plans and accounts are invested (we refer to each of these as a

	Benefit Plan

	) from engaging in specified
	transactions with persons that are parties in
	interest under ERISA or disqualified persons
	under the Code with respect to that Benefit Plan. A violation of
	these prohibited transaction rules may result in an
	excise tax or other penalties and liabilities under ERISA and
	the Code for these persons. The acquisition or holding of
	securities by a Benefit Plan could be considered to give rise to
	a prohibited transaction if the issuer, the seller, the
	originator, the servicer, the sub-servicer, the underwriters,
	the trustee, the managing member or the indenture trustee or any
	of their respective affiliates is or becomes a party in interest
	or a disqualified person with respect to that Benefit Plan.


	     

	In addition, transactions involving the issuer
	might be deemed to constitute prohibited transactions under
	ERISA and the Code with respect to a Benefit Plan that purchased
	securities if assets of the issuer were deemed to be assets of
	the Benefit Plan. Under a regulation issued by the
	U.S. Department of Labor, the assets of the issuer would be
	treated as plan assets of a Benefit Plan for the purposes of
	ERISA and the Code only if the Benefit Plan acquired an
	equity interest in the issuer and none of the
	exceptions contained in the plan assets regulation applied. An
	equity interest is defined under the plan assets regulation as
	an interest other than an instrument that is treated as
	indebtedness under applicable local law and that has no
	substantial equity features. It is likely that the certificates
	will be treated as an equity interest for these purposes. For
	additional information regarding the equity or debt treatment of
	notes, see ERISA Considerations in the prospectus
	supplement.


	     

	Without regard to whether the notes are treated
	as an equity interest for these purposes, the acquisition or
	holding of notes by or on behalf of a Benefit Plan could be
	considered to give rise to a prohibited transaction if the
	servicer, the seller, the issuer, the subservicer, the
	underwriters, the owner trustee, or the managing member, as
	applicable, the transferor, the indenture trustee or any of
	their respective affiliates is or becomes a party in interest or
	a disqualified person with respect to that Benefit Plan.
	Exemptions from the prohibited transaction rules could apply to
	the purchase and holding of the notes by a Benefit Plan
	depending on the type



	47







	 




	and circumstances of the plan fiduciary making
	the decision to acquire the notes. These exemptions include:
	Prohibited Transaction Class Exemption
	(

	PTCE

	) 96-23, regarding transactions
	effected by in-house asset managers;
	PTCE 95-60, regarding investments by insurance company
	general accounts; PTCE 91-38, regarding investments by bank
	collective investment funds; PTCE 90-1, regarding
	investments by insurance company pooled separate accounts; and
	PTCE 84-14, regarding transactions effected by
	qualified professional asset managers. Each
	purchaser of debt securities will be deemed to represent that
	either (a) it is not acquiring the securities with the
	assets of a Benefit Plan or (b) the acquisition and holding
	of the securities will not give rise to a nonexempt prohibited
	transaction under Section 406(a) of ERISA or
	Section 4975 of the Code.



	     

	Employee Benefit Plans that are governmental
	plans as defined in Section 3(32) of ERISA and specified
	church plans as defined in Section 3(33) of ERISA are not
	subject to the ERISA requirements discussed above, however,
	governmental plans may be subject to comparable state law
	restrictions.


	     

	We suggest that a fiduciary considering the
	purchase of securities on behalf of a Benefit Plan consult with
	its ERISA advisors and refer to the prospectus supplement
	regarding whether the assets of the issuer would be considered
	plan assets, the possibility of exemptive relief from the
	prohibited transaction rules and other issues and their
	potential consequences.





	PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION



	     

	We will enter into one or more underwriting
	agreements with respect to the notes of each series and an
	underwriting agreement with respect to the certificates of a
	given series, if offered under this prospectus. In each
	underwriting agreement, we will agree to cause the related
	issuer to sell to the underwriters, and each of the underwriters
	will severally agree to purchase, the principal amount of each
	class of notes and certificates, as the case may be, of the
	related series set forth in the underwriting agreement and in
	the related prospectus supplement. In each of the underwriting
	agreements with respect to any given series of securities, the
	several underwriters will agree, subject to the terms and
	conditions set forth therein, to purchase all the notes and
	certificates, as the case may be, described therein which are
	offered hereby and by the related prospectus supplement if any
	of such notes and certificates, as the case may be, are
	purchased.


	     

	Each prospectus supplement will either set forth
	the price at which each class of notes and certificates, as the
	case may be, being offered thereby will be offered to the public
	and any concessions that may be offered to certain dealers
	participating in that offering, or specify that the related
	notes and certificates are to be resold by the underwriters in
	negotiated transactions at varying prices to be determined at
	the time of such sale. After the initial public offering of any
	notes and certificates the public offering prices and
	concessions may be changed.


	     

	Each underwriting agreement will provide that we
	and GE Capital will indemnify the underwriters against
	certain civil liabilities, including liabilities under the
	Securities Act, or contribute to payments the several
	underwriters may be required to make in respect thereof.


	     

	Each issuer may, from time to time, invest the
	funds in its issuer accounts in eligible investments acquired
	from underwriters.


	     

	Pursuant to each of the underwriting agreements
	with respect to a given series of securities, the closing of the
	issuance of each class of securities subject to any of those
	agreements will be conditioned on the closing of the sale of all
	other classes subject to any of those agreements. The place and
	time of delivery for the securities in respect of which this
	prospectus is delivered will be set forth in the related
	prospectus supplement.





	LEGAL OPINIONS



	     

	Certain legal matters relating to the securities
	of any series will be passed upon for the related trust, us and
	the servicer by Mayer, Brown, Rowe & Maw, Chicago,
	Illinois and New York, New York. Certain legal matters relating

	WHERE YOU CAN FIND MORE INFORMATION



	     

	We filed a registration statement relating to the
	securities with the Securities and Exchange Commission. This
	prospectus is part of the registration statement, but the
	registration statement includes additional information.


	     

	We will file with the SEC all required annual,
	monthly and special SEC reports and other information about any
	issuer we originate.


	     

	You may read and copy any reports, statements or
	other information we file at the SECs public reference
	room at 450 Fifth Street, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20549. You
	can request copies of these documents, upon payment of a
	duplicating fee, by writing to the SEC. Please call the SEC at
	(800) SEC-0330 for further information on the operation of
	the public reference rooms. Our SEC filings are also available
	to the public on the SEC Internet site (http://www.sec.gov.).


	     

	The SEC allows us to incorporate by
	reference information that we file with it, which means
	that we can disclose important information to you by referring
	you to those documents. Any information incorporated by
	reference is considered to be part of this prospectus.
	Information that we file later with the SEC will automatically
	update the information in this prospectus. In all cases, you
	should rely on the later information over different information
	included in this prospectus or the accompanying prospectus
	supplement. We incorporate by reference any future annual,
	monthly and special SEC reports and proxy materials filed by or
	on behalf of any issuer until we terminate offering the
	securities.


	     

	We have not been, nor are we currently, required
	to file reports pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the
	Securities Exchange Act, except for the filing of Current
	Reports on Form 8-K in connection with the issuers we
	originate. These Current Reports are also incorporated into this
	prospectus by reference and made a part hereof.


	     

	As a recipient of this prospectus, you may
	request a copy of any document we incorporate by reference,
	except exhibits to the documents (unless the exhibits are
	specifically incorporated by reference), at no cost, by writing
	or calling:

	Important Notice about Information Presented
	in this





	Prospectus Supplement and the Accompanying
	Prospectus




	     

	You should rely only on the information contained
	or incorporated by reference in this prospectus supplement and
	the accompanying prospectus. We have not authorized anyone to
	provide you with different information.


	     

	We are not offering these securities in any state
	where the offer is not permitted.


	     

	Dealers will deliver a prospectus supplement and
	prospectus when acting as underwriters of the securities and
	with respect to their unsold allotments or subscriptions. In
	addition, all dealers selling the securities will deliver a
	prospectus supplement and prospectus
	until                                         ,                     (90 days
	after the commencement of this offering).


	     

	We tell you about the securities in two separate
	documents that progressively provide more detail: (a) the
	accompanying prospectus, which provides general information,
	some of which may not apply to a particular series of
	securities, including your series; and (b) this prospectus
	supplement, which describes the specific terms of your series of
	securities.


	     

	If the terms of your series of securities vary
	between this prospectus supplement and the prospectus, you
	should rely on the information in this prospectus supplement.


	     

	We include cross-references in this prospectus
	supplement and in the accompanying prospectus to captions in
	these materials where you can find further related discussions.
	The following Table of Contents and the Table of Contents
	included in the accompanying prospectus provide the pages on
	which these captions are located.


	     

	You can find a listing of the pages where
	capitalized terms used in this prospectus supplement are defined
	under the caption Index of Terms beginning on
	page S-     in this prospectus
	supplement and under the caption Index of Terms
	beginning on page      in the
	accompanying prospectus.


	     

	We have made forward-looking statements in this
	prospectus supplement and the accompanying prospectus.
	Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that
	could cause actual results to differ materially from those in
	the forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are
	statements, other than statements of historical facts, that
	address activities, events or developments that we expect or
	anticipate will or may occur in the future. Forward-looking
	statements also include any other statements that include words
	such as anticipate, believe,
	plan, estimate, expect,
	intend and other similar expressions.


	     

	Forward-looking statements are based on certain
	assumptions and analyses we have made in light of our experience
	and our perception of historical trends, current conditions,
	expected future developments and other factors we believe are
	appropriate. Whether actual results and development will conform
	with our expectations and predictions is subject to a number of
	risks and uncertainties.


	     

	All of the forward-looking statements made in
	this prospectus supplement and the accompanying prospectus are
	qualified by these cautionary statements, and there can be no
	assurance that the actual results or developments we have
	anticipated will be realized. Even if the results and
	developments in our forward-looking statements are substantially
	realized, there is no assurance that they will have the expected
	consequences to or effects on us, the issuer, General Electric
	Capital Corporation, General Electric Capital Services, Inc.,
	any finance company or any other person or on our respective
	businesses or operations. The foregoing review of important
	factors, including those discussed in detail in this prospectus
	supplement and the accompanying prospectus should not be
	construed as exhaustive. We undertake no obligation to release
	the results of any future revisions we may make to
	forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances
	after the date of this prospectus supplement and the
	accompanying prospectus or to reflect the occurrences of
	anticipated events.

	The [notes] [certificates] will be book-entry
	securities clearing through DTC (in the United States) or
	Clearstream or Euroclear (in Europe) in minimum denominations of
	$1,000 and in greater whole-dollar denominations.





	Subordination



	     

	The Class B Notes will be subordinated to
	the Class A Notes as follows:













	 



	 




	no interest will be paid on the Class B
	Notes on any payment date until all interest due on the
	Class A Notes through that payment date has been paid in
	full; and





	 




	 



	 




	no principal will be paid on the [Class B
	Notes] on any payment date until the principal due on the
	Class A Notes on that payment date has been paid in full.





	     

	The certificates will be subordinated to the
	Class A Notes and the Class B Notes as follows:













	 



	 




	no distributions on invested amounts will be made
	to the certificates on any payment date until all interest due
	on the Class A Notes and the Class B Notes through
	that payment date has been paid in full; and





	 




	 



	 




	no distributions of the certificate invested
	amounts will be made to the certificates on any payment date
	until all principal on the Class A Notes and the
	Class B Notes has been paid in full.








	Principal Payments



	     

	The aggregate amount of principal payments to be
	made on all outstanding classes of notes on each payment date
	will generally equal the decrease during the prior calendar
	month in [the sum of (a)] the loan value of the receivables
	and [(b) the amount on deposit in the issuers
	pre-funding account as of the end of the pre-funding period].
	The loan value of a receivable equals the discounted present
	value of its scheduled cash flows, using a discount rate equal
	to the average annual percentage rate of that loan.


	     

	Principal payments on each payment date will
	generally be allocated in the following proportions:
	[          ]%
	to the Class A Notes and
	[          ]%
	to the Class B Notes. However, no principal payments will
	be payable on each payment date to the Class B Notes until
	all amounts payable to the Class A Notes on that payment
	date have been paid in full.


	     

	See Description of the Transaction
	Agreements  Distributions for additional detail
	on some of the calculations described above and for special
	priority rules that would apply in a default situation.





	Optional Redemption



	     

	Any class of [notes] [certificates] that remain
	outstanding on any payment date on which we exercise our
	clean-up call will be paid in whole on that payment date at a
	redemption price [for such class] equal to the [outstanding
	principal balance of that class of notes] plus accrued and
	unpaid interest thereon [outstanding invested amount of the
	certificates plus undistributed certificateholders
	distributions on invested amount]. We cannot exercise our
	clean-up call until the aggregate pool balance of the
	receivables declines to 10% or less of the aggregate initial
	pool balance of the receivables, measured for each receivable at
	the time of its sale to the issuer.





	[Mandatory Redemption



	     

	The issuer will have a pre-funding period. On the
	payment date on or immediately following the last day of the
	pre-funding period, any funds remaining in the issuers
	pre-funding account after any purchase of receivables on that
	date will be applied to the [notes] [certificates] then
	outstanding in whole or in part in the same sequence and
	proportions that would apply in a normal [principal payment or
	distribution on the invested amount.]]





	The Initial Receivables



	     

	On the closing date, we will sell to the issuer
	loans and finance leases with an aggregate loan



	S-5







	 




	value of
	$                    measured
	as
	of                           ,                          .






	[Pre-Funding



	     

	We will sell the issuer loans and finance leases
	during a pre-funding period beginning on the closing date and
	ending not later than the close of business on the payment date
	no later than one year after the closing date.


	     

	The issuer will pay for the subsequent
	receivables with funds on deposit in a pre-funding account
	established by the issuer, with an initial deposit of
	$                    .
	We expect to sell subsequent receivables to the issuer with an
	aggregate loan value approximately equal to the amount deposited
	in the pre-funding account. Prior to being used to purchase
	receivables, funds on deposit in the pre-funding account will be
	invested from time to time in highly rated short-term securities.


	     

	The pre-funding period will also terminate early
	if the balance in the pre-funding account is reduced to less
	than $100,000 or if certain defaults or other adverse events
	occur. The pre-funded amount will not exceed 50% of the amount
	of the securities offered in this prospectus supplement. Any
	balance remaining in the pre-funding account at the end of the
	pre-funding period will be payable to the [noteholders as
	principal] [certificateholders as distributable invested
	amounts.]





	[Negative Carry Account



	     

	We anticipate that the average interest rate
	earned by the issuer on investment of funds in the pre-funding
	account may be less than the weighted average interest rate on
	the [notes] [certificates]. To provide a source of funds to
	cover any short fall resulting from this difference, the issuer
	will deposit
	$                    into
	the issuers negative carry account.]





	Credit Enhancement






	[Spread Account



	     

	As credit enhancement for the [notes]
	[certificates], a spread account will be established by the
	issuer. The spread account will be funded as follows:













	 



	 




	On the closing date, the issuer will deposit
	$              (          %
	of the loan value of the initial receivables) into the spread
	account.





	 




	 



	[ 




	On the date of each subsequent sale of
	receivables to the issuer, the issuer will transfer cash or
	highly rated, short-term securities having a value approximately
	equal
	to           %
	of the aggregate loan value of the receivables purchased from
	the pre-funding account to the spread account.]





	 




	 



	 




	On each payment date after any draw has been made
	on the spread account, available collections remaining after
	other more senior payments have been made will be deposited into
	the spread account to the extent necessary to maintain a
	specified minimum balance.





	     

	Funds on deposit in the spread account will be
	available on each payment date to cover shortfalls in [payments
	of interest and principal on the notes] [distributions on
	certificate invested amount and distributions of certificate
	invested amount]. [Funds on deposit in the spread account will
	not be used to cover shortfalls in any distributions on the
	certificates].





	[The Certificates



	     

	On the closing date, the issuer will issue
	certificates to us in an aggregate invested amount of
	$                    .
	[We will initially retain the entire invested amount of the
	certificates.] Distributions on the certificates will be
	subordinate in priority of payment to interest and principal due
	on the notes.]





	[Subordination



	     

	The subordination of the Class B Notes to
	the Class A Notes as described herein will provide
	additional credit enhancement for the Class A Notes.] [The
	subordination of the certificates to the Class A Notes and
	Class B Notes will provide additional credit enhancement
	for the Class A Notes and Class B Notes.]





	Priority of Distributions



	     

	On each payment date after payment to the
	servicer of an amount equal to any accrued but unpaid servicing
	fee [and reimbursement of any unreimbursed servicer advances],
	available collections, plus funds transferred from various
	issuer accounts as described above, will be applied to the
	following (in the priority indicated):











	 


	     

	(1) administration fees;





	 




	 


	     

	(2) to pay the swap counterparty any amounts
	due to swap counterparty under the






	S-6







	 











	 



	swap agreement not including any swap termination
	payments payable under clause (3) below;





	 




	 


	     

	(3) accrued and unpaid interest on the
	Class A Notes and any swap termination payments owed by the
	issuer to the swap counterparty

	pro rata

	based on the
	outstanding principal balance of the Class A Notes and any
	swap termination payments; provided that, any amounts allocable
	to the Class A Notes which are not needed to pay interest
	due on such notes will be applied to pay the portions of any
	swap termination payments remaining unpaid, if any;





	 




	 


	     

	(4) accrued and unpaid interest on the
	Class B Notes;





	 




	 


	     

	(5) to pay principal on the notes in the
	priority described above under Offered
	Securities  Principal Payments;





	 




	 


	     

	[(6) to the spread account, to the extent
	necessary to maintain a specified balance;]





	 




	 


	     

	(7) distributions on the certificate
	invested amount;





	 




	 


	     

	(8) distributions of the certificate
	invested amount of the certificates; and





	 




	 


	     

	(9) the remaining balance, if any, to the
	issuer.





	     

	See Description of the Transaction
	Agreements  Distributions for additional
	details and for special priority rules that would apply in a
	default situation.





	Tax Status



	     

	In the opinion of Mayer, Brown, Rowe & Maw,
	tax counsel to the issuer, the notes will be treated as debt of
	the issuer for U.S. federal income tax purposes and the issuer
	will not be characterized as an association (or publicly traded
	partnership) taxable as a corporation [and the issuer will be
	treated as a partnership in which the certificateholders are
	partners].





	ERISA Considerations



	     

	The notes may be purchased by employee benefit
	plans and accounts. An employee benefit plan, any other
	retirement plan, and any entity deemed to hold plan
	assets of any employee benefit plan or other plan should
	consult with its counsel before purchasing the notes. The
	certificates may not be acquired by any employee benefit plan.
	See ERISA Considerations in this prospectus
	supplement and in the accompanying prospectus.





	Legal Investment



	     

	[The Class A Notes will be eligible
	securities for purchase by money market funds under paragraph
	(a)(10) of Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act of
	1940, as amended.]





	Rating of the [Notes] [Certificates]



	     

	The issuer will not issue the [notes]
	[certificates] unless the Class A Notes are rated in the
	highest short-term rating category and that the Class B
	Notes are rated at least in the A category or its
	equivalent, in each case by at least two nationally recognized
	statistical rating agencies. A rating is not a recommendation to
	purchase, hold or sell securities, inasmuch as such rating does
	not comment as to market price or suitability for a particular
	investor. The ratings of the notes address the likelihood of the
	timely payment of interest on, and the ultimate repayment of
	principal of, the notes pursuant to their terms.

Chart Definitions
Income-oriented closed-end funds make payouts largely from interest	and dividends.
Income and capital appreciation funds seek regular cash	flow made up of interest and dividends, with the remainder from capital appreciation or, if necessary, return of capital.
Capital appreciation and income closed-end funds seek cash flow mainly from capital appreciation.
Single-asset-class funds invest primarily in one asset class, which can be used as components in a well-diversified income portfolio.
Pre-packaged combinations are funds featuring multiple asset types, which are designed to work together to diversify fund cash flow risks.

Closed the Income Gap®
with Nuveen Closed-End Funds



Closed-End Funds Offer Attractive Income Potential
In the search for increased income opportunities, closed-end funds can be a smart choice. Designed and built for income, closed-end funds seek to provide regular, stable cash flow over time and can serve as a compelling tool for optimizing an income portfolio.
Consider closed-end funds if you’re seeking to:1


1


Enhance Income and Cash Flow
Because of their unique closed structure and ability to use leverage,2 closed-end funds offer potentially higher distributions3 than traditional income investments.4


2


Manage Interest Rate Risk 
Floating rate, shorter duration or equity closed-end funds may help reduce a portfolio’s interest rate sensitivity.


3


Protect Purchasing Power
Closed-end funds that invest in real assets and dividend-paying stocks, which typically increase their payments with rising inflation, may help buffer the effects of rising inflation.


4


Maximize After-Tax Efficiency
Nuveen offers a wide array of national, state specific and AMT-free municipal closed-end funds that may help reduce your tax liability on investment income.5


5


Improve Diversification
With strategies that provide access to specialized asset classes, including alternatives, Nuveen closed-end funds may enhance portfolio diversification.

There is no guarantee that any of the funds will achieve their stated objectives. For detailed information on the specific risks associated with each fund, please view the fund overview by clicking on the fund name above.
1 Goal classifications represent common investor concerns when evaluating portfolio needs, are provided for informational purposes only, and are not intended to be relied upon as investment advice or recommendations.
2 Leverage typically magnifies the total return of a fund’s portfolio, whether that return is positive or negative, and creates an opportunity for increased common share net income as well as higher volatility of net asset value, market price, and distributions. There is no assurance that a fund’s leveraging strategy will be successful.
3 Potential distribution sources include net investment income, realized gains and return of capital.  
4 Different types of asset investments have different types of risks, which may provide higher returns but also greater volatility. In general, equity securities tend to be more volatile that fixed income securities. The value of, and income generated by, debt securities will decrease or increase based on changes in market interest rates. As interest rates risk, bond prices fall. In general, below investment grade (high-yield) debt securities tend to be more volatile than investment grade securities. Preferred securities are subordinated to bonds and other debt instruments in a company's capital structure, and therefore are subject to greater credit risk. The interest and principal payments of U.S. Treasury securities are guaranteed.
5 Income may be subject to state and local income taxes and the alternative minimum tax. Capital gains, if any, will be subject to capital gains tax.
