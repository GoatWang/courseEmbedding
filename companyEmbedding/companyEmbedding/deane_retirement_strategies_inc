Fee-Only & Fiduciary

The National Association of Personal Financial Advisors (NAPFA) is the country's leading association of fee-only and fiduciary financial planners.










What is Fee-Only Financial Planning and Why Does it Matter when Choosing an Advisor?
Every financial advisor gets paid for doing their job, however they don't all get paid the same way. A fee-only financial planner (all NAPFA advisors are fee-only) is paid directly by the client on a transparent and pre-arranged payment plan.  This can be an hourly or project rate, monthly retainer, or percentage of the investments managed.
Other financial advisors are paid through other sources including by the companies they recommend. For example, if the planner sells you a specific investment, mutual fund, insurance or other products, they receive a commission or partial commission directly from the company.
When working with a NAPFA Registered Financial Advisor, there are no hidden fees, commissions, third-party payments, or product sales.
If you are not sure how your financial advisor gets paid, just ask them. It is not something that is easy to tell.
How a planner is paid is quite important because it can affect the advice that they offer to their clients. Professional financial planners need to make a living like everyone else, and they are likely to be most loyal to the person who pays them. If that person is you, the client, then pleasing you will bring them long-term business. They will consistently offer you the best financial advice that they have. A commission-based financial planner may be focusing on the companies they work for before the client's best interest. That situation may not be beneficial for all of their clients.
Ultimately, you want to pick a planner who will be loyal to you and your interests. That planner is the fee-only planner.

                BBB has determined that Deane Retirement Strategies, Inc. meets Standards of BBB Accreditation, which include a commitment to make a good faith effort to resolve any consumer complaints. BBB Accredited Businesses pay a fee for accreditation review/monitoring and for support of BBB services to the public.
            

                BBB accreditation does not mean that the business's products or services have been evaluated or endorsed by BBB, or that BBB has made a determination as to the business's product quality or competency in performing services.

BBB Accreditation Reviews

BBB routinely monitors its files on all Accredited Businesses to affirm that they continue to meet all BBB Accreditation Standards











BBB Accreditation Process


        Not every business is eligible for BBB Accreditation. Businesses must meet, commit to and maintain the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards) 
        in order to be eligible for and maintain BBB Accreditation. The BBB Code of Business Practices represents sound advertising, selling and customer
        service practices that enhance customer trust and confidence in business. The Code is built on the BBB Standards for Trust, eight principles that
        summarize important elements of creating and maintaining trust in business.
    

        In order to be eligible for Accreditation a business must complete an Accreditation application.        
    

        Upon receipt of a fully completed BBB Application for Accreditation, BBB staff:        
        
Reviews the application
Researches the business
Verifies the information presented in the application 
May request additional information
May request proof of specific information on the application

        After the review and verification process, BBB will then evaluate if the business meets the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards)..
    
    
        Once BBB has finished its evaluation, the application for BBB Accreditation is either approved or denied. If the applicant is found in compliance with the BBB Code of Business Practices it will be presented to the BBB Board of Directors, or a committee of that board, for final approval. If the application is denied, BBB will contact the applicant, indicating the BBB Standard(s) that were not met and any recourse available to the applicant.

Investment Management New Orleans LA | Deane Retirement Strategies

 




















































 








Deane Retirement Strategies | Retirement Financial Advisor in New Orleans | Retirement Financial Planner | Fee-Only Financial Advisor
You are here: Home / Investment ManagementOur Expertise is Balanced Portfolio Management.
Our performance track record reflects our four principles for managing our Balanced Portfolio Strategy.
 
 
Our Four Investment Management Principles

 
To achieve all four of our investment management principles, at Deane Retirement Strategies we avoid investment extremes. We avoid chasing stocks that provide high returns, but come with extreme price volatility. These type of investments jeopardize principal protection and your sleeping at night. We equally avoid investments with extremely low price volatility that inevitably produce extremely low returns. These type of investments threaten your receiving sustainable income and also hedging inflation…which could result in a reduced lifestyle in the future.
 
To achieve our portfolio investment management goals, we use a Balanced Portfolio Strategy that blends high-quality stocks with high-quality bonds and cash. Using multiple asset classes allows us to make appropriate asset allocation shifts to potentially avoid excessive portfolio volatility and to reduce risks. We use a Balanced Portfolio Strategy exclusively; we do not manage portfolios consisting of only stocks or only bonds.
 
Our expertise is Balanced Style Portfolio Investment Management. We are an excellent fit for you if you appreciate the value of working with professionals who blend the long-term growth of quality stocks with the stability of principal and income provided by quality bonds. Our ultimate investment management goal is that “You Sleep At Night.”
 
 
Why A Balanced Portfolio For Everyone?
How can only one investment portfolio style, our “Balanced Style”, be appropriate for all of our clients, regardless of their age or stage of working life?
 
Myth says that younger investors should be very aggressive, because they have years to make up their portfolio losses. While they will earn more when stocks do well, they will also lose more when stocks decline. If an investor loses 50% in a bear market, they will have to earn 100% on the remaining assets to erase the loss, provided they haven’t bailed out of their aggressive strategy prior to the market rebounding. By comparison, if losses can be contained to 10%, only a subsequent 11% gain is needed to erase the loss. Uncontrolled, aggressive investing potentially becomes the “wrecking ball” of their portfolio’s value.
 
A very aggressive investing strategy is also frequently, but disastrously, used by near retirees who have failed to save adequate retirement money. In an effort to play “catch-up,” they panic and adopt a gambler’s “all or nothing” philosophy, hoping to earn maximum returns quickly. This reckless, aggressive investing strategy almost always ends with further diminished investment returns.
 
The flip side of the coin is the retiree or near retiree who believes in the myth that older investors should only invest in ultra conservative investments. While their goal is to eliminate the possibilities of near-term losses, they negatively subject their portfolio to the long-range, debilitating effects of inflation that will reduce their standard of living over time. Our Balanced Style portfolio provides capital gains and dividends from quality stocks, along with interest payments from bonds. These three sources collectively provide you with sustainable retirement income, along with portfolio growth to hedge against inflation.
 
Our Balanced Portfolio Investment Management Strategy appeals to investors of all ages who are seeking reliable growth, reduced volatility, protection of principal, sustainable income when ready, and peaceful nights’ sleep. Deane Retirement Strategies’ investment management principles are reflected in our Balanced Style’s investment return track record that speaks for itself.
 
 
 
We Do Not Use Mutual Funds – Why Not?
Deane Retirement Strategies does not use mutual funds in their clients’ portfolios, thus avoiding your being charged with each mutual fund’s annual 0.50% – 2.00% average internal fund expenses, such as trading costs, management fees, advertising expenses, broker/advisor compensation, etc. Mutual funds’ internal expenses are annually reoccurring and are passed along to you “behind the scenes.” This is called their “expense ratio.” Even no-load and institutional funds pass along their fund’s expenses to you. So, for example, if you’re paying another financial advisor 1.00% and own a portfolio of mutual funds with an average 1.00% expense ratio, adding together the two fees, your effective total annual portfolio fee is 2.00%. These fees are over and above any additional cost to purchase or sell a mutual fund. Please note that while we do not use mutual funds in our portfolios, we do use ETFs that also have internal fees. However, ETF internal fees are generally substantially less than mutual fund internal fees.
 
Additionally, we do not use mutual funds in our clients’ portfolios because we are prevented from performing thorough due diligence on funds’ portfolio holdings. Mutual funds only disclose their investment holdings quarterly, rendering them blind investment pools for months at a time. This lack of transparency often encourages fund managers to purchase investments in the fund that are inappropriate, presumably in an attempt to enhance performance results, only to return the portfolio to a more marketable, “window dressing” status, just prior to disclosing their quarterly holdings. Lack of holdings’ transparency also exposes your portfolio of funds to the probable, but undetectable, overlapping of individual securities among the various funds; this dilutes portfolio diversification that can lead to unnecessary volatility and under-performance of your portfolio. Using fund overlap software provides analysis that is only valid four days a year, the exact days on which funds’ holdings are reported.
 
We do not use mutual funds in our clients’ portfolios, thus avoiding additional client costs over and above our advisory fee. Avoiding mutual funds in our investment strategy also eliminates the issues of due diligence and duplication that compromise volatility, risk, and performance.
 
 
 
We Are Fee-Only Retirement Advisors
Our  sole  basis  of  client compensation, as a fee only financial planner, is advisory fees. Our “Fee-Only” (commission free) approach to retirement financial planning and investment management allows us to avoid advisor/client conflicts of interest and always place your best interest first.

The annual percentage cost for portfolios valued between $1,000,000 and $5,000,000 begins at 1.25 and declines incrementally to 1%, declining further for larger portfolios. Portfolios under $1,000,000 are subject to a minimum quarterly fee. Your cost is determined by the aggregate value of your assets under our management (401k, IRA, Personal). As your account value increases, your annual cost percentage incrementally decreases.
 
 
Wealth Accumulation Platform Fee Schedule
Our Wealth Accumulation Platform Fee Schedule applies to clients whose portfolios are not yet $1 million, but who are committed to accumulating $1 million by retirement. All of your accounts managed under this platform, including any 401k with a “brokerage window”, are aggregated for billing purposes and charged either 1.25% or 1.50% annually, subject to a minimum quarterly fee of $250.
 
As fee only financial planners, both of our fee schedules are all inclusive… planning and investment management.

Deane Retirement Strategies | Retirement Financial Advisor in New Orleans | Retirement Financial Planner | Fee-Only Financial Advisor
You are here: Home / Wealth AccumulationOur Unique Wealth Accumulation Platform.
Our platform is designed exclusively for individuals who want to accumulate wealth for their future. Our Wealth Accumulation Platform is designed to help you accumulate a $1,000,000 or greater investment portfolio by retirement.

 
You’re probably focused on powering your career, parenting and family priorities, perhaps buying an upscale home, and are likely burdened with student loan repayments. With so many responsibilities on your plate, you probably don’t have either the time or the vision to consciously build your wealth.
 
As your Wealth Accumulation Financial Advisor, we can help you bring order to your financial responsibilities. We’ll begin by assessing your current financial position and then problem solve to make all your financial puzzle pieces fit together.
 
An integral part of our Wealth Accumulation Program is your commitment to make monthly or annual contributions to one or more of your investment accounts that are managed by us. While you’re systematically adding to your 401k, IRA or Personal investment portfolios, our role, as your wealth accumulation financial advisor, is to optimize your portfolios’ growth in the up markets and limit your losses in the down markets. Our astute investment management, as your Wealth Accumulation Financial Advisor, encompasses asset allocation and investment selection. You’re relieved of day-to-day investment research and decisions.
 
The portfolio asset minimums required to participate in our Wealth Accumulation Platform are substantially reduced from those necessary to participate in our “Standard Platform.” Additionally, our Wealth Accumulation Platform’s advisory fee is affordable; it is separate and apart from our “standard investment management platform’s” fee structure.
 
Guided by your personally designed financial plan; with your investment contributions on auto pilot; and with the management of your 401k, IRA, and personal investments delegated to us for professional management, you’re free to concentrate on those things in life most important to you. With our assistance, as your Wealth Accumulation Financial Advisor, you’re on your path toward reaching your goal of a $1,000,000 or greater investment portfolio by retirement. Enjoy the peace of mind associated with building wealth now, to have enough when you’re ready for it.
