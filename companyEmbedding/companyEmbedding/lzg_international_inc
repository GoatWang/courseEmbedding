	Notes
	to the Unaudited Condensed Financial Statements





	November
	30, 2016





	 






	NOTE
	1 – CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS





	 




	The
	accompanying financial statements have been prepared by the Company without audit. In the opinion of management, all adjustments
	(which include only normal recurring adjustments) necessary to present fairly the financial position, results of operations and
	cash flows as of and for the period ended November 30, 2016 and for all periods presented have been made.




	 




	Certain
	information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles
	generally accepted in the United States of America have been condensed or omitted. It is suggested that these condensed financial
	statements be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company’s May 31, 2016
	audited financial statements as reported in Form 10-K. The results of operations for the period ended November 30, 2016 are not
	necessarily indicative of the operating results for the full year ended May 31, 2017.




	 





	NOTE
	2 – GOING CONCERN





	 




	The
	Company's financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
	of America, which contemplate continuation of the Company as a going concern. The Company has not yet established an ongoing source
	of revenues sufficient to cover its operating costs and to allow it to continue as a going concern. The Company has realized net
	losses since inception totaling $3,240,563. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent on the Company
	obtaining adequate capital to fund operating losses until it becomes profitable. If the Company is unable to obtain adequate capital,
	it could be forced to cease operations.




	 




	In
	order to continue as a going concern, the Company will need, among other things, additional capital resources. Management's plan
	is to obtain such resources for the Company by obtaining capital from management and significant shareholders sufficient to meet
	its minimal operating expenses and seeking equity and/or debt financing. However, management cannot provide any assurances that
	the Company will be successful in accomplishing any of its plans.




	 




	The
	ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to successfully accomplish the plans described
	in the preceding paragraph and eventually secure other sources of financing and attain profitable operations. The accompanying
	consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue
	as a going concern.





	 






	NOTE
	3 – SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES





	 





	Basis
	of Presentation





	 




	The
	accompanying consolidated financial statements are prepared on the basis of accounting principles generally accepted in the United
	States of America.




	 





	Use
	of Estimates





	 




	The
	preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions
	that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
	the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ
	from those estimates. The Company’s periodic filings with

	Recent
	Pronouncement





	On
	June 10, 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued update ASU 2014-10, Development Stage Entities
	(Topic 915).   Amongst other things, the amendments in this update removed the definition of development stage
	entity from Topic 915, thereby removing the distinction between development stage entities and other reporting entities from US
	GAAP.  In addition, the amendments eliminate the requirements for development stage entities to (1) present inception-to-date
	information on the statements of income, cash flows and shareholders’ equity, (2) label the financial statements as those
	of a development stage entity;  (3) disclose a description of the development stage activities in which the entity is engaged
	and (4) disclose in the first year in which the entity is no longer a development stage entity that in prior years it had been
	in the development stage.  The amendments are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 31, 2014 and
	interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015, however entities are permitted to early adopt for any annual or interim
	reporting period for which the financial statements have yet to be issued.  The Company has elected to early adopt these
	amendments and accordingly have not labeled the financial statements as those of a development stage entity and have not presented
	inception-to-date information on the respective financial statements.




	 





	NOTE
	4 – LOAN PAYABLE





	 




	As
	of November 30, 2016, the Company has a loan from a non-related party totaling $44,100 which is unsecured, bears interest at 8
	percent, and is due on demand. Interest expense for the six months ended November 30, 2016 and 2015 was $1,702 and $1,410 respectively.





	 






	NOTE
	5 – RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS





	 




	The
	financial statements include related party transactions, which as of November 30, 2016, were loans from an officer of the Company
	totaling $23,500 for operating activities. No further loans have been advanced during the period ending November 30, 2016. The
	loans are due on June 30, 2018, are not collateralized, and bear interest at 8% per annum. These loans accrued interest of $12,757,
	and $11,817, as of November 30, 2016, and May 31, 2016, respectively.




	 




	For
	the three months ended November 30, 2016, a related party consulting firm invoiced the Company $1,600 for consulting, administrative,
	and professional services and out-of-pocket costs provided to or paid on behalf of the Company. The total amount owed to this
	related party for consulting, administrative, and professional services recorded in accounts payable – related party is
	$89,300, and $86,100, as of November 30, 2016, and May 31, 2016 respectively.

	FORWARD
	LOOKING STATEMENTS






	 





	The
	U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) encourages reporting companies to disclose forward-looking information
	so that investors can better understand future prospects and make informed investment decisions. This report contains these types
	of statements. Words such as “may,” “intend,” “expect,” “believe,” “anticipate,”
	“estimate,” “project,” or “continue” or comparable terminology used in connection with any
	discussion of future operating results or financial performance identify forward-looking statements. You are cautioned not to
	place undue reliance on the forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this report. All forward-looking statements
	reflect our present expectation of future events and are subject to a number of important factors and uncertainties that could
	cause actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements.







	 





	 








	ITEM
	2. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS






	 






	Executive
	Overview






	 





	We
	have not recorded revenues from operations since inception and lack revenues to cover our operating costs. These conditions raise
	substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. We are currently devoting our efforts to obtain capital from
	management, significant stockholders and/or third parties to cover minimal expenses; however, there is no assurance that additional
	funding will be available. Our ability to continue as a going concern during the long term is dependent upon our ability to find
	a suitable company and acquire or enter into a merger with such company.




	 




	The
	type of business opportunity with which we acquire or merge will affect our profitability for long term. We may consider a business
	which has recently commenced operations, is a developing company in need of additional funds for expansion into new products or
	markets, is seeking to develop a new product or service, or is an established business which may be experiencing financial or
	operating difficulties and is in need of additional capital. In the alternative, a business combination may involve the acquisition
	of, or merger with, a company which does not need substantial additional capital, but which desires to establish a public trading
	market for its shares, while avoiding, among other things, the time delays, significant expense, and loss of voting control which
	may occur through a public offering.




	 




	Our
	management has not had any preliminary contact or discussions with any representative of any other entity regarding a business
	combination with us. Any target business that is selected may be a financially unstable company or an entity in its early stages
	of development or growth, including entities without established records of sales or earnings. In that event, we will be subject
	to numerous risks inherent in the business and operations of financially unstable and early stage or potential emerging growth
	companies. In addition, we may effect a business combination with an entity in an industry characterized by a high level of risk,
	and, although our management will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in a particular target business, there can be no assurance
	that we will properly ascertain or assess all significant risks.




	 




	Our
	management anticipates that we will likely be able to effect only one business combination, due primarily to our limited financing
	and the dilution of interest for present and prospective stockholders, which is likely to occur as a result of our management’s
	plan to offer a controlling interest to a target business in order to achieve a tax-free reorganization. This lack of diversification
	should be considered a substantial risk in investing in us, because it will not permit us to offset potential losses from one
	venture against gains from another.




	 







	 



	9



	 







	 





	 






	We
	anticipate that the selection of a business combination will be complex and extremely risky. Because of general economic conditions,
	rapid technological advances being made in some industries and shortages of available capital, our management believes that there
	are numerous firms seeking even the limited additional capital which we will have and/or the perceived benefits of becoming a
	publicly traded corporation. Such perceived benefits of becoming a publicly traded corporation include, among other things, facilitating
	or improving the terms on which additional equity financing may be obtained, providing liquidity for the principals of and investors
	in a business, creating a means for providing incentive stock options or similar benefits to key employees, and offering greater
	flexibility in structuring acquisitions, joint ventures and the like through the issuance of stock. Potentially available business
	combinations may occur in many different industries and at various stages of development, all of which will make the task of comparative
	investigation and analysis of such business opportunities extremely difficult and complex.




	 






	Liquidity
	and Capital Resources






	 




	At
	November 30, 2016, we had cash of $2,663 and total liabilities of $179,841 compared to cash of $1,562 and total liabilities of
	$168,499 at May 31, 2016. We have not established an ongoing source of revenue sufficient to cover our operating costs. During
	the six month period ended November 30, 2016 we borrowed $5,500 from a third party to fund our operations and relied upon a stockholder
	for administrative and professional services totaling $1,600. During the year ended May 31, 2016 we borrowed $5,300 from a third
	party to fund our operations and relied upon a stockholder, for administrative and professional services totaling $6,900.




	 




	These
	conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. We are currently devoting our efforts to
	obtaining capital from management, significant stockholders and/or third parties to cover minimal operations; however, there is
	no assurance that additional funding will be available. Our ability to continue as a going concern during the long term is dependent
	upon our ability to find a suitable business opportunity and acquire or enter into a merger with such a company.




	 




	The
	type of business opportunity that we acquire or merge with will affect our profitability for the long term. We may consider a
	business which has recently commenced operations, is a developing company in need of additional funds for expansion into new products
	or markets, is seeking to develop a new product or service, or is an established business which may be experiencing financial
	or operating difficulties and is in need of additional capital. In the alternative, a business combination may involve the acquisition
	of, or merger with, a company which does not need substantial additional capital, but which desires to establish a public trading
	market for its securities, while avoiding, among other things, the time delays, significant expense, and loss of voting control
	which may occur through a public offering.




	 




	During
	the next 12 months we anticipate incurring costs related to the filing of Exchange Act reports, and possibly investigating, analyzing
	and consummating an acquisition. We believe we will be able to meet these costs through funds provided by management, significant
	stockholders and third parties.




	 






	Results
	of Operations






	 




	We
	did not record revenues in 2016 or 2015. General and administrative expenses decreased to $7,599 for the six months ended November
	30, 2016 (“2017 six month period”) compared to $8,604 for the six month period ended November 30, 2015 (“2016
	six month period”). General and administrative expenses decreased to $2,925 for the three month period ended November 30,
	2016 (“2017 second quarter”) compared to $2,929 for the three month period ended November 30, 2015 (“2016 second
	quarter”). General and administrative expenses represented consulting, administrative, professional services and out of
	pocket costs and the decrease for the 2017 interim periods is primarily due to reduced consulting and administrative fees.




	 




	Total
	other expense increased to $2,642 for the 2017 six month period compared to $2,350 for the 2016 six month period and increased
	to $1,352 for the 2017 second quarter compared to $1,178 for the 2016 second quarter as a result of accrued interest on loans.




	 







	 



	10



	 







	 





	 






	Our
	net loss decreased to $10,241 for the 2017 six month period compared to $10,954 for the 2016 six month period. Net loss increased
	to $4,277 for the 2017 second quarter compared to $4,107 for the 2016 second quarter. Management expects net losses to continue
	until we acquire or merge with a business opportunity.




	 






	Commitments
	and Obligations






	 




	We
	have relied upon loans and advances to fund our operational expenses. During the years ended May 31, 2009 and 2010, our Director
	and President, Greg L. Popp, loaned an aggregate of $23,500 to the Company. On April 20, 2010, these loans were combined into
	one promissory note which carries interest at 8%, is not collateralized and matured in June 2012. In June 2016, Mr. Popp extended
	the due date of this loan from June 30, 2016 to June 30, 2018. These loans accrued interest of $12,757 as of November 30, 2016.




	 




	During
	the 2017 six month period we borrowed $5,500 from a third party for operating expenses. At November 30, 2016 we owe the third
	party $44,100 and accrued interest on this loan of $10,184. These loans are payable upon demand, are not collateralized and bear
	interest at 8% per annum.




	 




	During
	the 2017 six month period First Equity Holdings, Corp. (“First Equity”), a 20% stockholder, provided consulting, administrative
	and professional services and provided to, or paid on behalf of the Company, out-of-pocket costs. First Equity billed the Company
	$3,200 for its services and advances for the 2017 six month period. As of November 30, 2016 First Equity’s account payable
	totals $89,300.






	 








	Off-Balance
	Sheet Arrangements






	 




	We
	have not entered into any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect
	on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures
	or capital resources and would be considered material to investors.




	 






	Critical
	Accounting Policies








	 






	We
	qualify as an “emerging growth company” under the recently enacted JOBS Act. As a result, we are permitted to, and
	intend to, rely on exemptions from certain disclosure requirements. For so long as we are an emerging growth company, among other
	things, we will not be required to:




	 








	•




	Have
	an auditor report on our internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to Section
	404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act;






	 








	•




	Submit
	certain executive compensation matters to shareholder advisory votes, such as “say-on-pay”
	and “say-on-frequency”






	 








	•




	Obtain
	shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved; and






	 








	•




	Disclose
	certain executive compensation related items such as the correlation between executive
	compensation and performance and comparisons of the Chief Executives compensation to
	median employee compensation.






	 




	In
	addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition
	period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words,
	an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply
	to private companies. We have elected to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period. Our financial statements
	may therefore not be comparable to those of companies that comply with such new or revised accounting standards.




	 







	 



	11



	 







	 





	 






	We
	will remain an “emerging growth company” for up to five years, or until the earliest of (i) the last day of the first
	fiscal year in which our total annual gross revenues exceed $1 billion; (ii) the date that we become a “large accelerated
	filer” as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which would occur if the market value of our
	ordinary shares that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the last business day of our most recently completed
	second fiscal quarter or (iii) the date on which we have issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt during the preceding
	three-year period.

	ITEM
	4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES





	 






	Disclosure
	Controls and Procedures






	 




	We
	maintain disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) that are designed
	to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our filings under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and
	reported within the periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC. This information is accumulated to allow our management
	to make timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Our President, who serves as our principal executive officer and principal
	financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by
	this report and he determined that our disclosure controls and procedures were ineffective due to a control deficiency. During
	the period we did not have additional personnel to allow segregation of duties to ensure the completeness or accuracy of our information.
	Due to the size and operations of the Company we are unable to remediate this deficiency until we acquire or merge with another
	company.




	 






	Changes
	to Internal Control over Financial Reporting






	 




	Our
	management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule
	13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act). Management conducted an evaluation of our internal control over financial reporting and determined
	that there were no changes made in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended November 30, 2016 that
	have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting.







	  








	PART
	II – OTHER INFORMATION





	 






	ITEM
	1A. RISK FACTORS




	 






	AN
	INVESTMENT IN THE COMPANY IS HIGHLY SPECULATIVE IN NATURE AND INVOLVES A HIGH DEGREE OF RISK.






	 






	We
	have extremely limited assets and no source of revenue.








	 






	We
	have limited assets and have had no revenues since inception. We will not receive revenues until we complete an acquisition, reorganization
	or merger. We can provide no assurance that any selected or acquired business will produce any material revenues for the Company
	or our stockholders, or that any such business will operate on a profitable basis.





	 





	We
	will, in all likelihood, sustain operating expenses without corresponding revenues, at least until we complete a business combination
	with a private company. This may result in our incurring a net operating loss that will increase unless we consummate a business
	combination with a profitable business. We cannot assure you that we can identify a suitable business opportunity and consummate
	a business combination, or that any such business will be profitable at the time of its acquisition by the Company, or ever become
	profitable.





	 








	 



	12



	 







	 






	 









	There
	is currently no trading market for our common stock, and liquidity of shares of our common stock is limited.






	 




	Shares
	of our common stock are not registered under the securities laws of any state or other jurisdiction and are not quoted on any
	OTC market. Accordingly, there is no public trading market for the common stock. Further, no public trading market is expected
	to develop in the short term. Therefore, outstanding shares of our common stock cannot be offered, sold, pledged or otherwise
	transferred unless subsequently registered pursuant to, or exempt from registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended
	(the “Securities Act”) and any other applicable federal or state securities laws or regulations. Stockholders may
	rely on the exemption from registration provided by Rule 144 of the Securities Act (“Rule 144”), subject to certain
	restrictions; namely, common stock may not be sold until one year after:




	 






	(i)






	the
	completion of a business combination with a private company after which the Company would
	cease to be a “shell company” (as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange
	Act); and








	(ii)






	the
	disclosure of certain information on a Current Report on Form 8-K within four business
	days of the business combination, and only if the Company has been current in all of
	its periodic SEC filings for the 12 months preceding the contemplated sale of stock.






	 




	Compliance
	with the criteria for securing exemptions under federal securities laws and the securities laws of the various states is extremely
	complex, especially in respect of those exemptions affording flexibility and the elimination of trading restrictions for the securities
	received in exempt transactions and subsequently disposed of without registration under the Securities Act or state securities

	PRINCIPAL
	EXECUTIVE OFFICER CERTIFICATION





	 




	I, Greg
	L. Popp, certify that:




	 








	1.




	I
	have reviewed this quarterly report on Form 10-Q of LZG International, Inc.;






	 








	2.




	Based
	on my knowledge, this report does not contain any untrue statement of a material fact
	or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the statement made, in light of the
	circumstances under which statements were made, not misleading with respect to the period
	covered by this report;






	 








	3.




	Based
	on my knowledge, the financial statements, and other financial information included in
	this report, fairly present in all material respects the financial condition, results
	of operations and cash flows of the registrant as of, and for, the periods presented
	in this report.






	 








	4.




	The
	registrant’s other certifying officer(s) and I are responsible for establishing
	and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules
	13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) and internal control over financial reporting (as defined in
	Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) for the registrant and have:






	 




	(a)
	Designed such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under our supervision,
	to ensure that material information relating to the registrant, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to us by
	others within those entities, particularly during the period in which this report is being prepared;




	 




	(b)
	Designed such internal control over financial reporting, or caused such internal control over financial reporting to be designed
	under our supervision, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
	financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles;




	 




	(c)
	Evaluated the effectiveness of the registrant’s disclosure controls and procedures and presented in this report our conclusions
	about the effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures, as of the end of the period covered by this report based on
	such evaluation; and




	 




	(d)
	Disclosed in this report any change in the registrant’s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the
	registrant’s most recent fiscal quarter (the registrant’s fourth fiscal quarter in the case of an annual report) that
	has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the registrant’s internal control over financial
	reporting; and




	 








	5.




	The
	registrant’s other certifying officer(s) and I have disclosed, based on our most
	recent evaluation of internal control over financial reporting, to the registrant’s
	auditors and the audit committee of registrant’s board of directors (or persons
	performing the equivalent function):






	 




	(a)
	All significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control over financial reporting which
	are reasonably likely to adversely affect the registrant’s ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information;
	and




	 




	(b)
	Any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the registrant’s
	internal control over financial reporting.

	Notes to the
	Unaudited Condensed Financial Statements





	February 28,
	2017





	 






	NOTE 1 -	CONDENSED
	FINANCIAL STATEMENTS





	 




	The accompanying
	financial statements have been prepared by the Company without audit. In the opinion of management, all adjustments (which include
	only normal recurring adjustments) necessary to present fairly the financial position, results of operations and cash flows as
	of and for the period ended February 28, 2017 and for all periods presented have been made.




	 




	Certain information
	and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally
	accepted in the United States of America have been condensed or omitted. It is suggested that these condensed financial statements
	be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company’s May 31, 2016 audited financial
	statements as reported in Form 10-K. The results of operations for the period ended February 28, 2017 are not necessarily indicative
	of the operating results for the full year ended May 31, 2017.




	 





	NOTE 2 –
	GOING CONCERN





	 




	The Company's
	financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America,
	which contemplate continuation of the Company as a going concern. The Company has not yet established an ongoing source of revenues
	sufficient to cover its operating costs and to allow it to continue as a going concern. The Company has realized net losses since
	inception totaling $3,244,840. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent on the Company obtaining
	adequate capital to fund operating losses until it becomes profitable. If the Company is unable to obtain adequate capital, it
	could be forced to cease operations.




	 




	In order to
	continue as a going concern, the Company will need, among other things, additional capital resources. Management's plan is to
	obtain such resources for the Company by obtaining capital from management and significant shareholders sufficient to meet its
	minimal operating expenses and seeking equity and/or debt financing. However, management cannot provide any assurances that the
	Company will be successful in accomplishing any of its plans.




	 




	The ability
	of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to successfully accomplish the plans described in
	the preceding paragraph and eventually secure other sources of financing and attain profitable operations. The accompanying consolidated
	financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern.

	OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES





	 





	Basis of

	2017





	 






	NOTE 3 -	SUMMARY
	OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES - continued





	 





	Use of Estimates





	 




	The preparation
	of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect
	the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
	statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those
	estimates. The Company’s periodic filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission include, where applicable, disclosures
	of estimates, assumptions, uncertainties and markets that could affect the financial statements and future operations of the Company.





	Recent Pronouncement





	 




	On June 10,
	2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued update ASU 2014-10, Development Stage Entities (Topic
	915).   Amongst other things, the amendments in this update removed the definition of development stage entity
	from Topic 915, thereby removing the distinction between development stage entities and other reporting entities from US GAAP. 
	In addition, the amendments eliminate the requirements for development stage entities to (1) present inception-to-date information
	on the statements of income, cash flows and shareholders’ equity, (2) label the financial statements as those of a development
	stage entity;  (3) disclose a description of the development stage activities in which the entity is engaged and (4) disclose
	in the first year in which the entity is no longer a development stage entity that in prior years it had been in the development
	stage.  The amendments are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 31, 2014 and interim reporting
	periods beginning after December 15, 2015, however entities are permitted to early adopt for any annual or interim reporting period
	for which the financial statements have yet to be issued.  The Company has elected to early adopt these amendments and accordingly
	have not labeled the financial statements as those of a development stage entity and have not presented inception-to-date information
	on the respective financial statements.





	 






	NOTE 4 –
	LOAN PAYABLE





	 




	As of February
	28, 2017, the Company has a loan from a non-related party totaling $44,100 which is unsecured, bears interest at 8%, and is due
	on demand. Interest expense for the nine months ended February 28, 2017 and February 29, 2016 was $2,584 and $2,122 respectively.





	 






	NOTE 5 –
	RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS





	 




	The financial
	statements include related party transactions, which as of February 28, 2017, were loans from an officer of the Company totaling
	$23,500 for operating activities. No further loans have been advanced during the period ending February 28, 2017. The loans are
	due on June 30, 2018, are not collateralized, and bear interest at 8% per annum. These loans accrued interest of $13,227, and
	$11,817, as of February 28, 2017, and May 31, 2016, respectively. Interest expense for the nine months ended February 28, 2017
	and February 29, 2016 was $1,410 and $1,410 respectively.




	 




	For the three

	ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION
	AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS






	 






	Executive Overview






	 





	We have not recorded revenues from
	operations since inception and lack revenues to cover our operating costs. These conditions raise substantial doubt about our
	ability to continue as a going concern. We are currently devoting our efforts to obtain capital from management, significant stockholders
	and/or third parties to cover minimal expenses; however, there is no assurance that additional funding will be available. Our
	ability to continue as a going concern during the long term is dependent upon our ability to find a suitable company and acquire
	or enter into a merger with such company.




	 




	The type of business opportunity
	with which we acquire or merge will affect our profitability for long term. We may consider a business which has recently commenced
	operations, is a developing company in need of additional funds for expansion into new products or markets, is seeking to develop
	a new product or service, or is an established business which may be experiencing financial or operating difficulties and is in
	need of additional capital. In the alternative, a business combination may involve the acquisition of, or merger with, a company
	which does not need substantial additional capital, but which desires to establish a public trading market for its shares, while
	avoiding, among other things, the time delays, significant expense, and loss of voting control which may occur through a public
	offering.




	 




	Our management has not had any preliminary
	contact or discussions with any representative of any other entity regarding a business combination with us. Any target business
	that is selected may be a financially unstable company or an entity in its early stages of development or growth, including entities
	without established records of sales or earnings. In that event, we will be subject to numerous risks inherent in the business
	and operations of financially unstable and early stage or potential emerging growth companies. In addition, we may effect a business
	combination with an entity in an industry characterized by a high level of risk, and, although our management will endeavor to
	evaluate the risks inherent in a particular target business, there can be no assurance that we will properly ascertain or assess
	all significant risks.




	 




	Our management anticipates that we
	will likely be able to effect only one business combination, due primarily to our limited financing and the dilution of interest
	for present and prospective stockholders, which is likely to occur as a result of our management’s plan to offer a controlling
	interest to a target business in order to achieve a tax-free reorganization. This lack of diversification should be considered
	a substantial risk in investing in us, because it will not permit us to offset potential losses from one venture against gains
	from another.




	 







	 



	10



	 







	 









	We anticipate that the selection
	of a business combination will be complex and extremely risky. Because of general economic conditions, rapid technological advances
	being made in some industries and shortages of available capital, our management believes that there are numerous firms seeking
	even the limited additional capital which we will have and/or the perceived benefits of becoming a publicly traded corporation.
	Such perceived benefits of becoming a publicly traded corporation include, among other things, facilitating or improving the terms
	on which additional equity financing may be obtained, providing liquidity for the principals of and investors in a business, creating
	a means for providing incentive stock options or similar benefits to key employees, and offering greater flexibility in structuring
	acquisitions, joint ventures and the like through the issuance of stock. Potentially available business combinations may occur
	in many different industries and at various stages of development, all of which will make the task of comparative investigation
	and analysis of such business opportunities extremely difficult and complex.




	 






	Liquidity and Capital Resources






	 




	At February 28, 2017, we had cash
	of $1,338 and total liabilities of $182,793 compared to cash of $1,562 and total liabilities of $168,499 at May 31, 2016. We have
	not established an ongoing source of revenue sufficient to cover our operating costs. During the nine month period ended February
	28, 2017 we borrowed $5,500 from a third party to fund our operations and relied upon a stockholder for administrative and professional
	services totaling $4,800. During the year ended May 31, 2016 we borrowed $5,300 from a third party to fund our operations and
	relied upon a stockholder, for administrative and professional services totaling $6,900.




	 




	These conditions raise substantial
	doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. We are currently devoting our efforts to obtaining capital from management,
	significant stockholders and/or third parties to cover minimal operations; however, there is no assurance that additional funding
	will be available. Our ability to continue as a going concern during the long term is dependent upon our ability to find a suitable
	business opportunity and acquire or enter into a merger with such a company.




	 




	The type of business opportunity
	that we acquire or merge with will affect our profitability for the long term. We may consider a business which has recently commenced
	operations, is a developing company in need of additional funds for expansion into new products or markets, is seeking to develop
	a new product or service, or is an established business which may be experiencing financial or operating difficulties and is in
	need of additional capital. In the alternative, a business combination may involve the acquisition of, or merger with, a company
	which does not need substantial additional capital, but which desires to establish a public trading market for its securities,
	while avoiding, among other things, the time delays, significant expense, and loss of voting control which may occur through a
	public offering.




	 




	During the next 12 months we anticipate
	incurring costs related to the filing of Exchange Act reports, and possibly investigating, analyzing and consummating an acquisition.
	We believe we will be able to meet these costs through funds provided by management, significant stockholders and third parties.




	 






	Results of Operations






	 




	We did not record revenues in 2017
	or 2016. General and administrative expenses represented consulting, administrative, professional services and out of pocket costs.
	General and administrative expenses decreased to $10,524 for the nine months ended February 28, 2017 (“2017 nine month period”)
	compared to $11,429 for the nine month period ended February 29, 2016 (“2016 nine month period”). The decrease of
	general and administrative expenses for the 2017 nine month period is primarily due to reduced consulting and administrative fees.
	General and administrative expenses increased to $2,925 for the three month period ended February 28, 2017 (“2017 third
	quarter”) compared to $2,825 for the three month period ended February 29, 2016 (“2016 third quarter”).




	 




	Total other expense increased to
	$3,994 for the 2017 nine month period compared to $3,532 for the 2016 nine month period and increased to $1,352 for the 2017 third
	quarter compared to $1,182 for the 2016 third quarter as a result of accrued interest on loans.




	 







	 



	11



	 







	 









	Our net loss decreased to $14,518
	for the 2017 nine month period compared to $14,961 for the 2016 nine month period. Net loss increased to $4,277 for the 2017 third
	quarter compared to $4,007 for the 2016 third quarter. Management expects net losses to continue until we acquire or merge with
	a business opportunity.




	 






	Commitments and Obligations






	 




	We have relied upon loans and advances
	to fund our operational expenses. During the years ended May 31, 2009 and 2010, our Director and President, Greg L. Popp, loaned
	an aggregate of $23,500 to the Company. On April 20, 2010, these loans were combined into one promissory note which carries interest
	at 8%, is not collateralized and matured in June 2012. In June 2016, Mr. Popp extended the due date of the promissory note from
	June 30, 2016 to June 30, 2018. These loans accrued interest of $13,227 as of February 28, 2017.




	 




	During the 2017 nine month period
	we borrowed $5,500 from a third party for operating expenses. At February 28, 2017 we owe the third party $44,100 and accrued
	interest on this loan of $11,066. These loans are payable upon demand, are not collateralized and bear interest at 8% per annum.




	 




	During the 2017 nine month period
	First Equity Holdings, Corp. (“First Equity”), a 20% stockholder, provided consulting, administrative and professional
	services and provided to, or paid on behalf of the Company, out-of-pocket costs. First Equity billed the Company $4,800 for its
	services and advances for the 2017 nine month period. As of February 28, 2017 First Equity’s account payable totals $90,900.






	 








	Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements






	 




	We have not entered into any off-balance
	sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in
	financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources and would
	be considered material to investors.




	 






	Critical Accounting Policies








	 






	We qualify as an “emerging
	growth company” under the recently enacted JOBS Act. As a result, we are permitted to, and intend to, rely on exemptions
	from certain disclosure requirements. For so long as we are an emerging growth company, among other things, we will not be required
	to:




	 








	•




	Have an auditor report on our
	internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley
	Act;






	 








	•




	Submit certain executive compensation
	matters to shareholder advisory votes, such as “say-on-pay” and “say-on-frequency”






	 








	•




	Obtain shareholder approval of
	any golden parachute payments not previously approved; and






	 








	•




	Disclose certain executive compensation
	related items such as the correlation between executive compensation and performance
	and comparisons of the Chief Executives compensation to median employee compensation.






	 




	In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS
	Act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B)
	of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an emerging growth company can delay
	the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have elected
	to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period. Our financial statements may therefore not be comparable
	to those of companies that comply with such new or revised accounting standards.




	 







	 



	12



	 







	 









	We will remain an “emerging
	growth company” for up to five years, or until the earliest of (i) the last day of the first fiscal year in which our total
	annual gross revenues exceed $1 billion; (ii) the date that we become a “large accelerated filer” as defined in Rule
	12b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which would occur if the market value of our ordinary shares that is held by
	non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter or (iii)
	the date on which we have issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt during the preceding three-year period.





	 





	 








	ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE
	DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK





	 




	Not applicable to smaller reporting
	companies.






	 






	 








	ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES





	 






	Disclosure Controls and Procedures






	 




	We maintain disclosure controls and
	procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) that are designed to ensure that information required
	to be disclosed in our filings under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the periods specified
	in the rules and forms of the SEC. This information is accumulated to allow our management to make timely decisions regarding
	required disclosure. Our President, who serves as our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, evaluated the
	effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report and he determined that
	our disclosure controls and procedures were ineffective due to a control deficiency. During the period we did not have additional
	personnel to allow segregation of duties to ensure the completeness or accuracy of our information. Due to the size and operations
	of the Company we are unable to remediate this deficiency until we acquire or merge with another company.




	 






	Changes to Internal Control
	over Financial Reporting






	 




	Our management is responsible for
	establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange
	Act). Management conducted an evaluation of our internal control over financial reporting and determined that there were no changes
	made in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended February 28, 2017 that have materially affected,
	or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting.

	PART II –
	OTHER INFORMATION





	 






	ITEM 1A. RISK
	FACTORS




	 






	AN INVESTMENT IN THE COMPANY
	IS HIGHLY SPECULATIVE IN NATURE AND INVOLVES A HIGH DEGREE OF RISK.






	 






	We have extremely limited assets
	and no source of revenue.








	 






	We have limited assets and have had
	no revenues since inception. We will not receive revenues until we complete an acquisition, reorganization or merger. We can provide
	no assurance that any selected or acquired business will produce any material revenues for the Company or our stockholders, or
	that any such business will operate on a profitable basis.





	 





	We will, in all likelihood, sustain
	operating expenses without corresponding revenues, at least until we complete a business combination with a private company. This
	may result in our incurring a net operating loss that will increase unless we consummate a business combination with a profitable
	business. We cannot assure you that we can identify a suitable business opportunity and consummate a business combination, or
	that any such business will be profitable at the time of its acquisition by the Company, or ever become profitable.





	 







	There is currently no trading
	market for our common stock, and liquidity of shares of our common stock is limited.






	 




	Shares of our common stock are not
	registered under the securities laws of any state or other jurisdiction and are not quoted on any OTC market. Accordingly, there
	is no public trading market for the common stock. Further, no public trading market is expected to develop in the short term.
	Therefore, outstanding shares of our common stock cannot be offered, sold, pledged or otherwise transferred unless subsequently
	registered pursuant to, or exempt from registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”)
	and any other applicable federal or state securities laws or regulations. Stockholders may rely on the exemption from registration
	provided by Rule 144 of the Securities Act (“Rule 144”), subject to certain restrictions; namely, common stock may
	not be sold until one year after:




	(i) the completion
	of a business combination with a private company after which the Company would cease to be a “shell company” (as defined
	in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act); and




	(ii) the disclosure
	of certain information on a Current Report on Form 8-K within four business days of the business combination, and only if the
	Company has been current in all of its periodic SEC filings for the 12 months preceding the contemplated sale of stock.




	 




	Compliance with the criteria for
	securing exemptions under federal securities laws and the securities laws of the various states is extremely complex, especially
	in respect of those exemptions affording flexibility and the elimination of trading restrictions for the securities received in
	exempt transactions and subsequently disposed of without registration under the Securities Act or state securities laws.
