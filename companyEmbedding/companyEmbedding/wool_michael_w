Perfect

A christmas gift for my husband. He loves it, and looks so classy!

Just what he was looking for
















Verified Purchase


Well made, stylish, and well priced.  Not a heavy wool coat, but long and elegant.  Good for his needs.  I suspect that the wool is fragile given its composition and weight, so he'll be using it for dress wear, not everyday.

PERFECT

My husband had to replace a 20yr old coat that was the same and this coat is exactly the same as that one albeit it has one more pocket inside. Just a lovely coat, well made, comfortable and so nice looking.  Very pleased.

Nice Coat. Nice Price!
















Verified Purchase


My son is 6'10" tall. Needless to say, it's difficult to find clothes that fit. We found a coat very similar to this one made of the same materials in a store for twice the price on sale!! That one needed to be lengthend in the sleeves as did this one. It was less painful to pay for tailoring when the coat was half the price!! He loves it, and it fits hime well.

Hello irohr, I am sorry we do not test for temperature rating for our coat, the main reason is that they are too subjective, not only is everybody different, conditions at any given temperature are different as well. also humidity, wind, sun and clouds all affect how cold a given temperature feels as well.

How do I choose a lawyer?Consider the following: 
Comfort Level - Are you comfortable telling the lawyer personal
information? Does the lawyer seem interested in solving your problem? 
Credentials - How long has the lawyer been in practice? Has
the lawyer worked on other cases similar to yours? 
Cost - How are the lawyer's fees structured - hourly or flat
fee? Can the lawyer estimate the cost of your case? 
City - Is the lawyer's office conveniently located?
Not sure what questions to ask a lawyer?
Here are a few to get you started:

How long have you been in practice?
How many cases like mine have you handled?
How often do you settle cases out of court?
What are your fees and costs?
What are the next steps?
