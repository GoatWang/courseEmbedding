Resource Innovation Office REIT Purchases Office Building in Chicago 
      and Announces Stock and Cash Distributions






November 29, 2016 11:02 AM Eastern Standard Time



PHILADELPHIA--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Resource Innovation Office REIT, Inc. (“Innovation Office REIT”), a 
      non-traded real estate investment trust sponsored by Resource Real 
      Estate, Inc., announced Tuesday that it has completed the purchase of 
      1025 W Sunnyside, an office building located in Chicago, Illinois, from 
      Cedar Street Companies for $7.25 million.
    


      This location offers 27,852 square feet of innovative office and retail 
      space. The building’s design includes exposed wood beams, high ceilings, 
      open floor plans, and an abundance of natural light. The office layout 
      has several lounges and café-style workspaces that foster collaboration 
      and encourage employee interaction. The property is conveniently located 
      one block south of the Wilson CTA train station (Red and Purple lines) 
      and immediately across from the 2010 Wilson Yard development, a major 
      retail and multifamily complex.
    

      The property is currently 100 percent occupied by tenants that include 
      Fansided, one of the country’s fastest growing independent sports and 
      entertainment networks. It has easy accessibility to Montrose Park, 
      which offers sandy beaches, a skate park, athletic fields, golf courses, 
      and hiking trails.
    

      Innovation Office REIT Chief Investment Officer, Martin Caverly, 
      explains that, “The Uptown submarket in which the property is located is 
      the focus of significant investment by the city and is undergoing a 
      process of rapid gentrification. The Innovation Office REIT intends to 
      focus on retaining current tenants and growing revenue as the 
      surrounding neighborhood continues to improve.”
    

      Earlier, on November 21, 2016, the Board of Directors of Innovation 
      Office REIT declared cash distributions on the Class A and Class T 
      outstanding common stock based on daily record dates for the periods 
      from December 1, 2016 through December 29, 2016, from December 30, 2016 
      to January 30, 2017, and from January 31, 2017 to February 27, 2017, 
      which distributions it expects to pay on December 30, 2016, January 31, 
      2017, and February 28, 2017, respectively.
    

      Distributions for these periods will be calculated based on the 
      stockholders of record each day during these periods as follows:
    


        Class A Common Stock – at a rate of $0.000547945 per share per day;
      

        Class T Common Stock – at a rate of $0.000547945 per share per day 
        less the applicable daily distribution and shareholder servicing fees 
        accrued for and allocable to the Class T common stock divided by the 
        number of shares of common stock of such class outstanding as of the 
        close of business on the respective record dates.
      


      Stockholders may choose to receive cash distributions or purchase 
      additional shares through Innovation Office REIT’s distribution 
      reinvestment plan. Distributions reinvested pursuant to the distribution 
      reinvestment plan will be reinvested in shares of the same class as the 
      shares on which the distributions are made. Some or all of the cash 
      distributions may be paid from sources other than cash flows from 
      operations.
    

      Also on November 21, 2016, Innovation Office REIT’s Board of Directors 
      authorized a stock dividend for the fourth quarter of 2016 in the amount 
      of 0.005 shares of common stock on each outstanding share of common 
      stock to all common stockholders of record as of the close of business 
      on December 31, 2016. Stock dividends are issued in the same class of 
      shares as the shares for which such stockholder received the stock 
      dividend. Innovation Office REIT expects to issue this stock dividend on 
      or about January 13, 2017.
    

      Innovation Office REIT believes that the stock dividend should be a 
      tax-free transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes under Section 
      305(a) of the Internal Revenue code of 1986, as amended, but 
      stockholders should consult their own tax advisors regarding the tax 
      consequences of this stock dividend.
    

All statements and information other than statements of historical 
      fact included in this press release regarding strategy, future 
      operations, financial position, estimated revenues, projected costs, 
      prospects, plans and objectives of management are forward-looking

      suggested by the forward-looking statements we make are reasonable, we 
      can give no assurance that these plans, intentions or expectations will 
      be achieved because of the number of risks and uncertainties, many of

      leverage and meeting debt service obligations, operating properties in 
      different locations throughout the U.S., general, market or business 
      conditions and changes in laws or regulations.


These cautionary statements qualify all forward-looking statements 
      attributable to us or persons acting on our behalf.

Resource Innovation Office REIT, Inc. Announces Cash Distribution and 
      Stock Dividend






February 23, 2017 02:00 PM Eastern Standard Time



PHILADELPHIA--(BUSINESS WIRE)--On February 16, 2017, the Board of Directors of Resource Innovation 
      Office REIT, Inc. (the “REIT”) declared cash distributions on the 
      outstanding shares of the REIT’s Class A and Class T shares based on 
      daily record dates for the periods from February 28, 2017 to March 30, 
      2017, from March 31, 2017 to April 27, 2017, and from April 28, 2017, to 
      May 30, 2017, which distributions the REIT expects to pay on March 31, 
      2017, April 28, 2017, and May 31, 2017, respectively.
    


      Distributions for these periods will be calculated based on shareholders 
      of record each day during these periods as follows:
    


        Class A Common Stock—at a rate of $0.000547945 per share per day;
      

        Class T Common Stock—at a rate of $0.000547945 per share per day less 
        the applicable daily distribution and shareholder servicing fees 
        accrued for and allocable to the Class T common stock,
      


      each divided by the number of shares of common stock of such class 
      outstanding as of the close of business on each respective record date.
    

      Shareholders may choose to receive cash distributions or purchase 
      additional shares through the REIT’s distribution reinvestment plan. 
      Distributions reinvested pursuant to the distribution reinvestment plan 
      will be reinvested in shares of the same class as the shares on which 
      the distributions are made. Some or all of the cash distributions may be 
      paid from sources other than cash flows from operations.
    

Stock Dividend


      Also on February 16, 2017, the REIT’s Board of Directors authorized a 
      stock dividend for the first quarter of 2017, in the amount of 0.01 
      shares of common stock on each outstanding share of common stock to all 
      common shareholders of record as of the close of business on March 31, 
      2017. Stock dividends are issued in the same class of shares as the 
      shares for which such shareholder received the stock dividend. The REIT 
      expects to issue this stock dividend on or about April 14, 2017.
    

      The stock dividend should be a tax-free transaction for U.S. federal 
      income tax purposes under Section 305(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 
      1986, as amended, but shareholders should consult their own tax advisors 
      regarding the tax consequences of this stock dividend.

      fact included in this press release regarding strategy, future 
      operations, financial position, estimated revenues, projected costs,

            Office Overview
        





Meeting the Demand for U.S. Office Space


Resource believes that the U.S. office market presents an untapped investment opportunity. We seek office space in urban environments that have high employment growth and that attract today's top talent.
The U.S. is experiencing a shift in office trends - there is a greater demand for today's top talent and companies are changing in order to attract and retain them. These individuals prioritize lifestyle when they decide where to work and live, and this includes seeking more open, collaborative work spaces in urban or urban-like areas. Characteristics of open office typically include:

Creative floor plans
Multipurpose areas
Flexible work spaces
Natural light
Indoor and outdoor space

Martin Caverly
What does the future of office space look like? Resource Real Estate Inc., a global real estate firm sponsoring alternative investments through a series of REITs, is betting it is more creative and less structured than the offices of today. It encourages spontaneous co-worker engagement, is located in an urban environment with proximity to public transportation, and can easily be turned over from tenant to tenant.
Martin Caverly is leading this effort as chief investment officer of Resource Innovation Office REIT. We talked to Caverly, who oversaw the restructuring of Evoq Properties out of the Meruelo Maddux Properties bankruptcy in 2011, about his views on creative office.
CPE: Where did this revisioning of office space come from?
Caverly: One of the things we did at Evoq that turned out to be valuable was converting some of our old warehouse buildings. Our biggest trophy asset was Alameda Square, which is Arts District adjacent in downtown LA. We took one of these big old buildings—a former storage-and-manufacturing space with high floor-to-ceilings, really cool window lines and mushroom columns—and turned that into an 83,000-square-foot office. It quickly leased to a major fashion/apparel company. We had stumbled upon this idea of creative office.
CPE: What does the phrase “creative office” really mean?
Caverly: It is about authenticity of place, location, working collaboratively and using space efficiently. These are open-plan spaces, without many individual offices or assigned seating. They allow businesses to function more efficiently, compete for top talent and have flexibility within their workspace.
CPE: Why office space, and why now?
Caverly: The macro view has been that office has been the laggard in this economic recovery period. There has not been as much new development, because banks are still tight when it comes to office, unlike some other types of product. But the nature of how we use offices is changing, and even major companies are moving out of the suburbs and back toward the urban core. Millennials do not want to commute to the suburbs. Companies are realizing that you have to change how you use office space to get your people to come in. You want them to be in the office happily and voluntarily. It requires a new way of thinking about how you use your space.
CPE: How will the Resource Innovation Office REIT manage these assets?
Caverly: We want to hold assets for 10 years at a time—we are not looking for a three-year hold-and-sell cycle. Once someone else has taken the risk of converting and repositioning the building, we will buy it and hold it, and aggressively asset manage it.
CPE: Who is the target tenant?
Caverly: Tech and media are the obvious sectors, but others would be law, financial services, energy, manufacturing and everything in between. Just about every industry is looking for smarter ways to utilize office space.
CPE: Where will you look for properties to purchase?
Caverly: We have 12 target markets where we have observed companies relocating to a downtown-proximate location from the suburbs, as well as a large Millennial workforce. Asset identifiers include redeveloped warehouses, traditional older buildings with good bones that have been reskinned and amenitized. Those markets include San Diego, Portland, Denver, Minneapolis, Chicago and Nashville.
CPE: Any concerns about purchasing in a strong market?
Caverly: We feel we will be buying at 10 to 15 percent below what I think the peak was, which was October to December of 2015. If you can buy lower, that is always good, but our advantage is we are going to buy buildings that we think have a competitive re-leasing advantage in the future. So they’ll have higher rents, higher occupancy and hopefully higher values. We think the timing is great.

RE:


RESOURCE
INNOVATION OFFICE REIT, INC.




Resource Securities, Inc.
1845 Walnut Street, 18th Floor
Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19103

Ladies and Gentlemen:

The undersigned, Resource Innovation
Office REIT, Inc. (the “ Company ”), a Maryland
corporation, is conducting a public offering (the “
Offering ”) of up to $1,100,000,000 of shares of its
common stock, $0.01 par value per share, in any combination of the
following two classes of common stock: Class A and Class T
(individually, the “ Class A Shares ” and the
“ Class T Shares ” and collectively the “
Shares ”), of which up to $100,000,000 of shares are
intended to be offered pursuant to the Company’s distribution
reinvestment plan (“ DRP ”). The Company desires
for Resource Securities, Inc. (the “ Dealer Manager
”), to act as its Dealer Manager in connection with the offer
and sale of the Shares to the public in the Offering. In connection
with the sales of Shares, the Company hereby confirms the terms of
this Second Amended & Restated Dealer Manager Agreement (this
“ Agreement ”), dated and effective as of
March 23, 2016, with you, as Dealer Manager, as
follows. The Company reserves the right to reallocate between
the DRP and the primary offering. This Agreement amends and
restates in its entirety the Dealer Manager Agreement dated
June 1, 2015, as amended by Amendment No. 1 dated
December 31, 2015, between you, the Company and Resource Real
Estate, Inc.

1. Description of
Shares. Except as
described in the Prospectus (as defined below) or in Section
4 hereof, the Class A Shares and the Class T Shares are to be
sold at a per share cash price as follows (unless otherwise
disclosed in the Prospectus):

The Company will be required to

is reached (as defined in Section 4(h) hereof) (the “
NAV pricing date ”). Following the NAV pricing date,
the Company will publish an updated estimated value per Class A
Share and Class T Share on at least an annual basis. In the
event the Company determines its NAV during the period of this
Offering, the Company will adjust the offering price per Class A
Share and Class T Share as described in the Prospectus and reflect
the updated offering price per share in a supplement to the
Prospectus.


2. Representations, Warranties and Agreements of
the Company. The Company
represents and warrants to and agrees with Dealer Manager
that:

(a) Registration Statement and
Prospectus . The Company has prepared and filed with the
Securities and Exchange Commission (the “ SEC ”)
a registration statement (Registration No. 333-201842) that has
become effective for the registration of the Shares under the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “ Securities
Act ”), and the applicable rules and regulations (the
“ Securities Act Rules and Regulations ”) of the
SEC promulgated thereunder. Copies of such registration statement
as initially filed and each amendment thereto have been or will be
delivered to the Dealer Manager. The registration statement and the
prospectus contained therein, as finally amended at the effective
date of the registration statement (the “ Effective
Date ”), are respectively hereinafter referred to as the
“ Registration Statement ” and the “
Prospectus ,” except that if the Company files a
prospectus or prospectus supplement pursuant to Rule 424(b) under
the Securities Act, or if the Company files a post-effective
amendment to the Registration Statement, the term
“Prospectus” includes the prospectus filed pursuant to
Rule 424(b) or the prospectus included in such post-effective
amendment. The term “ Preliminary Prospectus ”
as used herein shall mean a preliminary prospectus related to the
Shares as contemplated by Rule 430 or Rule 430A of the Securities
Act Rules and Regulations included at any time as part of the
Registration Statement. If a separate registration statement is
filed and becomes effective solely with respect to shares of the
Company’s common stock offered pursuant to the DRP, the terms
“Registration Statement” and “Prospectus”
shall also refer to such registration statement and prospectus
contained therein from and after the date of effectiveness of such
registration statement, as such registration statement and
prospectus may be amended or supplemented from time to
time.

(b) Compliance with the Federal
Securities Laws . On (i) the Effective Date, (ii) the date of
the Prospectus and (iii) the date any post-effective amendment to
the Registration Statement becomes effective or any amendment or

supplements thereto, as applicable, have complied, and will comply,
in all material respects, with the Securities Act, the Securities
Act Rules and Regulations, the Exchange Act and the rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder (the “Exchange Act
Rules and Regulations” ). On the Effective Date, the
Registration Statement did not or will not contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading. On the date of the Prospectus, as
amended or supplemented, as applicable, the Prospectus did not and
will not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary
in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading; provided, however, that the foregoing provisions
of this Section 2(b) will not extend to any statements
contained in or omitted from the Registration Statement or the
Prospectus that are primarily within the knowledge of the Dealer
Manager or any of the Dealers (as defined below) and are based upon
written information furnished to the Company by the Dealer Manager
expressly for use in the Registration Statement or
Prospectus.

(c) Securities Matters . No
order preventing or suspending the use of any Preliminary
Prospectus or the Prospectus has been issued and no proceedings for
that purpose are pending, threatened or, to the knowledge of the
Company, contemplated by the SEC; and, to the knowledge of the
Company, no order suspending the offering of the Shares in any
jurisdiction has been issued and no proceedings for that purpose
have been instituted or threatened or are contemplated.

(d) Authorization of Shares .
The Shares have been duly authorized and, when issued and sold as
contemplated by the Prospectus and the Company’s charter, as
amended and supplemented, and upon payment therefor as provided in
the Prospectus and this Agreement, the Shares will be validly
issued, fully paid and nonassessable and will conform to the
description thereof contained in the Prospectus.

Company was duly formed under the laws of the State of Maryland and

and conduct its business as described in the Prospectus.

(f) Use of Funds . The
Company intends to use the funds received from the sale of the
Shares as set forth in the Prospectus.

(g) Authorization of
Agreement . The Company has full legal right, power and
authority to enter into this Agreement and to perform the
transactions contemplated hereby, except to the extent that the
enforceability of the indemnity and contribution provisions
contained in Sections 9 and 10 of this Agreement,
respectively, may be limited under applicable securities laws and
to the extent that the enforceability of this Agreement may be
limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or
other similar laws that affect creditors’ rights generally or
by equitable principles relating to the availability of
remedies.

The execution and delivery of this
Agreement, the consummation of the transactions contemplated herein
and compliance with the terms of this Agreement by the Company do
not and will not conflict with, or result in a breach of any of the
terms and provisions of, or constitute a default under (i) any of
the Company’s organizational documents; (ii) any contract,
indenture, mortgage, deed of trust, voting trust, note, lease or
other agreement or instrument to which the Company is a party or by
which the Company or any of its properties is bound; or (iii) any
rule or regulation, writ, statute, injunction or decree of any
government, governmental instrumentality or court, domestic or
foreign, having jurisdiction over the Company or any of its
properties, except to the extent that the enforceability of the
indemnity and contribution provisions contained in Sections
9 and 10 of this Agreement, respectively, may be limited
under applicable securities law and to the extent that the
enforceability of this Agreement may be limited by bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws that

relating to the availability of remedies.

No consent, approval, authorization
or other order of any governmental authority is required in

Regulatory Authority (“ FINRA ”) or under
applicable securities laws.

Dealer Manager.

of the Shares shall occur continuously in the
jurisdictions in which the Shares are registered or qualified or
exempt from registration (as confirmed in writing by the Company to
the Dealer Manager) unless and until the Offering is terminated,
provided that the Dealer Manager and the Dealers will suspend or
terminate offering Shares upon request of the Company at any time
and will resume offering Shares upon subsequent request of the
Company. The Offering Period shall in all events terminate upon the
sale of all of the Shares. Upon termination of the Offering Period,
the Dealer Manager’s appointment and this Agreement shall
terminate without obligation on the part of the Dealer Manager or
the Company except as set forth in this Agreement.

(c) Best Efforts and Formation of

selling group composed of participating broker-dealers (the “

with the SEC, a member of FINRA, and duly licensed or registered by
the regulatory authorities in the jurisdictions in which they will
offer and sale Shares, (ii) have been previously approved by the
Company (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed),

Manager, or any other Dealer, will be required to complete and
execute the subscription documents described in the

and only if (i) the Dealer Manager has received a properly
completed and executed subscription agreement (“
Subscription Agreement ”), together with payment of
the full purchase price of each purchased Share, from an investor
who satisfies the applicable suitability standards and minimum
purchase requirements set forth in the Registration Statement as

has accepted such subscription, and (iii) such investor has been
admitted as a stockholder of the Company. In addition, no sale of

Prospectus. The Dealer Manager hereby acknowledges and agrees that
the Company, in its sole and absolute discretion, may accept or
reject any subscription, in whole or in part, for any reason
whatsoever or no reason, and no commission or dealer manager fee

(c) Distribution and Shareholder
Servicing Fee.  Each outstanding Class T Share sold in the
primary Offering will be subject to a distribution and shareholder
servicing fee payable by the Company to the Dealer Manager for five
years from the date on which such share is issued for services and
expenses related to the marketing, sale and distribution of such
shares and for providing shareholder services. The annual
distribution and shareholder servicing fee of 1.0% of the purchase
price per Class T Share (or, once reported, the NAV per Class T
Share) will accrue daily as provided in the “Description of
Shares” section of the Prospectus and will be paid monthly in
arrears. The Dealer Manager will reallow the distribution and
shareholder servicing fee to the Dealer who initially sold the
Class T Shares giving rise to such distribution and shareholder
servicing fees, provided that, if the Dealer Manager is notified
that the Dealer who sold such Class T Shares is no longer the
broker-dealer of record with respect to such Class T Shares, then
such Dealer’s entitlement to the distribution and shareholder
servicing fees related to such Class T Shares shall cease, and such
Dealer shall not receive the distribution and shareholder servicing
fee for any portion of the month in which such Dealer is not the
broker-dealer of record on the last day of the month. Thereafter,
such distribution and shareholder servicing fee may be reallowed by
the Dealer Manager to the then-current broker-dealer of record of
the Class T Shares, if any, if such broker-dealer of record has
entered into a Selected Dealer Agreement or similar servicing
agreement with the Dealer Manager that provides for such
reallowance. The Dealer Manager may also reallow some or all of the
distribution and shareholder servicing fee to other broker-dealers
who provide services with respect to the Class T Shares pursuant to
a servicing agreement with the Dealer Manager to the extent that
such servicing agreement provides for such reallowance, all in
accordance with the terms of such servicing agreement. In this
regard, all determinations will be made by the Dealer Manager in
good faith in its sole discretion.

Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary herein, the Company will cease paying the distribution and
shareholder servicing fee with respect to all Class T Shares sold
in the Offering at the earliest of: (i) the date at which, in the
aggregate, underwriting compensation from all sources, including
the distribution and shareholder servicing fee, equals 10% of the
gross proceeds from the primary Offering (i.e. excluding proceeds
from sales pursuant to the DRP); (ii) the date on which the Company
lists the Shares on a national securities exchange; and (iii) the
date of a merger or other extraordinary transaction in which the
Company is a party and in which the Shares are exchanged for cash
or other securities.

Class T Shares issued under the DRP
will not be subject to the distribution and shareholder servicing
fee.

In no event shall the total
aggregate underwriting compensation payable to the Dealer Manager
and any Dealers participating in the Offering, including, but not
limited to selling commissions, dealer manager fees and
distribution and shareholder servicing fees, exceed ten percent
(10.0%) of the gross offering proceeds from the primary Offering in
the aggregate.

(d) Reduced Selling
Commissions . Upon the terms set forth in the Prospectus,
reduced selling commissions will be paid to the Dealer Manager and
reduced per share selling prices shall be recovered on large
transactions of Class A Shares and Class T Shares in accordance
with the following tables, which may be amended and supplemented by
the Prospectus:

Following the
NAV pricing date, the percentage discounts on selling commissions
will be applied to the adjusted per share purchase
price.




The reduced selling price and
selling commission will apply to the entire purchase of Class A
Shares or Class T Shares. Until the NAV pricing date, all
commission rates and dealer manager fees are calculated assuming a
price per Class A Share of $10.00 and a price per Class T Share of
$9.47. For example, a purchase of 250,000 Class A Shares in a
single transaction would result in a purchase price of $2,425,000
($9.70 per share), selling commissions of $97,000 and dealer
manager fees of $72,750.

(e) Discounted “Family and
Friends” Sales . As described in the Prospectus, the
Dealer Manager agrees to sell up to 5% of the Class A Shares in the
primary Offering to persons identified by the Company pursuant to
the Company’s “friends and family” program. Until
the NAV pricing date, the officers, directors and affiliates of the
Company and investors designated by the Company as buying under the
“friends and family” program may subscribe to Class A
Shares for a subscription price of $9.00, reflecting that selling
commissions in the amount of $0.70 per share and the dealer manager
fee in the amount of $0.30 per share will not be payable in
connection with these purchases. Following the NAV pricing date, a
similar discount will be applied to the new per share public
offering price of Class A Shares. The Dealer Manager agrees to work
together with the Company to implement this program and to execute
sales under the program according to the procedures agreed upon by
the Dealer Manager and the Company.

(f) Discounted Dealer Sales
. In addition, as described in the Prospectus, the Dealer
Manager may sell Class A Shares to Dealers, their retirement plans,
their representatives and the family members, IRAs and the
qualified plans of their representatives, prior to the NAV pricing
date, at a purchase price of $9.30 per share, reflecting that
selling commissions in the amount of $0.70 per share
 
- 7 -


will not be payable in consideration of the
services rendered by such Dealers and representatives in the
Offering. Following the NAV pricing date, a similar discount will
be applied to the new per share public offering price. For purposes
of this discount, a family member includes such person’s
spouse, parent, child, sibling, mother- or father-in-law, son- or
daughter-in law or brother- or sister-in-law.

(g) Payment of Expenses and
Fees . The Company will also reimburse the Dealer Manager for
all items of underwriting compensation referenced in the
Prospectus, if any, to the extent the Prospectus indicates that
they will be paid by the Company, provided that (i) total
underwriting compensation may not exceed 10% of gross proceeds from
the Offering (excluding proceeds from the offering of Shares
pursuant to the DRP), and (ii) total organization and offering
expenses, when added to total underwriting compensation, may not
exceed 15% of gross proceeds from the Offering. In accordance with
FINRA Rule 2310, the Company shall also pay directly or reimburse
the Dealer Manager for bona fide invoiced due diligence expenses of
the Dealers and non-participating broker dealers, subject to the
cap on organization and offering expenses described
above.

(h) Minimum Offering .
Notwithstanding the foregoing, no commissions, payments or amounts
whatsoever will be paid to the Dealer Manager under this Section
4 unless or until the Company has raised a minimum of
$2,000,000 in subscription funds from any combination of sales of
Class A Shares and Class T Shares, including subscriptions received
from the Company’s directors, officers and advisor and their
respective affiliates (the “ Minimum Offering
”). Until the Minimum Offering is reached, investments will
be held in escrow. If the Minimum Offering is not reached within
the time period specified in the Prospectus, investments will be
returned to the investors in accordance with the Prospectus.
Furthermore, until the Company raises $50 million in the Offering
from persons not affiliated with the Company or its advisor (the
“ Pennsylvania Minimum ”), investments from
Pennsylvania investors will be held in a separate escrow and no
commissions, payments or amounts whatsoever will be paid thereon to
the Dealer Manager under this Section 4 unless and until the
Pennsylvania Minimum has been reached, and then only with respect
to such investments from Pennsylvania investors as are released to
the Company from such escrow. Similarly, no commissions, payments
or amounts whatsoever will be paid to the Dealer Manager with
respect to sales of Shares to residents of any other state that has
imposed a minimum offering amount higher than the Minimum Offering
(a “ State-Required Minimum Offering ”) unless
or until the gross proceeds of the Shares sold in the Offering
(including sales made to residents of other jurisdictions) have
reached a minimum of the applicable State-Required Minimum Offering
and are disbursed to the Company from escrow. Until the applicable
State-Required Minimum Offering is reached, investments from
residents of that state will be held in escrow. If the applicable
State-Required Minimum Offering is not obtained prior to the
termination of the Offering, the investments from residents of that
state will be promptly returned to them in accordance with the
Prospectus.

(i) Payment to Dealers . The
Company will not be liable or responsible to any Dealer for direct
payment of commissions to such Dealer; it is the sole and exclusive
responsibility of the Dealer Manager for payment of commissions to
Dealers. Notwithstanding the above, at its discretion, the Company
may act as agent of the Dealer Manager by making direct payment of
commissions to such Dealers without incurring any liability
therefor.

5. Conditions to the Dealer
Manager’s Obligations. The Dealer Manager’s obligations hereunder
shall be subject to the following terms and conditions, and if all
such conditions are not satisfied or waived by the Dealer Manager
on or before the initial Effective Date or at any time thereafter
until the Termination Date, then no funds shall be released (i)
from the Escrow Account if the Dealer Manager provides notice to
this effect to the Company and the Escrow Agent, and (ii) from the
designated deposit account in the name of the Company at UMB Bank,
N.A. if the Dealer Manager provides notice to this effect to the
Company and UMB Bank, N.A.

Manager, the Prospectus would include an untrue statement of
material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make
the statements therein, in view of the circumstances under which
they were made, not misleading, the Company will promptly notify
the Dealer Manager thereof (unless the information shall have been
received from the Dealer Manager) and will prepare an amendment or

comply, with all requirements and obligations imposed upon any of

Patriot Act of 2001 and regulations administered by the Office of
Foreign Asset Control at the Department of the Treasury; and (vi)
this Agreement and the Prospectus, as amended and
supplemented.

The Dealer Manager will not offer
the Shares, and in its agreements with Dealers will require that
the Dealers not offer Shares, in any jurisdiction unless and until
(i) the Dealer Manager has been advised by the Company in writing
that the Shares are either registered in accordance with, or exempt
from, the securities laws of such jurisdiction and (ii) the Dealer
Manager and any Dealer offering Shares in such jurisdiction have
all required licenses and registrations to offer Shares in that
jurisdiction.

(b) No Additional
Information.  The Dealer Manager shall not, and in its
agreements with Dealers will require that Dealers agree not to,
give or provide any information or make any representations
concerning the Offering except as set forth in the Prospectus, as
amended and supplemented, and in the Authorized Sales
Materials.

(c) Sales of Shares . The
Dealer Manager shall, and in its agreements with Dealers shall
require that each Dealer shall solicit purchases of the Shares only

- 11 -



(e) Suitability.  The
Dealer Manager will offer Shares, and in its agreements with
Dealers will require that each Dealer offer Shares, only to persons
who it has reasonable grounds to believe meet the financial
qualification and suitability standards set forth in the
Prospectus, as amended and supplemented, or in any suitability
letter or memorandum sent to the Dealer Manager by the
Company. The Dealer Manager further agrees that the Company,
in its sole and absolute discretion, may accept or reject any
subscription, in whole or in part, for any reason whatsoever or no
reason, and no commission, dealer manager fee or distribution and
shareholder servicing fee will be paid to the Dealer Manager with
respect to the portion of any subscription that is
rejected.

In offering Shares, the Dealer
Manager will comply, and in its agreements with the Dealers will
require that the Dealers comply, with the provisions of all
applicable rules and regulations relating to the suitability of
investors, including, without limitation, the FINRA Conduct Rules
and the NASAA Guidelines. The Dealer Manager agrees that in
recommending the purchase of the Shares in the Offering to an
investor, the Dealer Manager and each person associated with the
Dealer Manager that makes such recommendation shall have, and in
its agreements with Dealers will require that each Dealer shall
have, with respect to investors to which it makes a recommendation,
reasonable grounds to believe, on the basis of information obtained
from the investor concerning the investor’s investment
objectives, other investments, financial situation and needs, and
any other information known by the Dealer Manager, the person
associated with the Dealer Manager or the Dealer, as applicable,
that: (i) the investor is or will be in a financial position
appropriate to enable the investor to realize to a significant
extent the benefits described in the Prospectus, including the tax
benefits where they are a significant aspect of an investment in
the Shares; (ii) the investor has a fair market net worth
sufficient to sustain the risks inherent in the Offering, including
loss of investment and lack of liquidity; and (iii) an investment
in the Shares offered in the Offering is otherwise suitable for the
investor.

The Dealer Manager agrees as to
investors to whom it makes a recommendation with respect to the
purchase of the Shares in the Offering, and in its agreements with
the Dealers will require that the Dealers agree, to maintain in the
files of the Dealer Manager (or the Dealer, as applicable)
documents disclosing the basis upon which the determination of
suitability was reached as to each investor. In making these
determinations as to financial qualification and suitability, the
Dealer Manager may rely on representations from (i) investment
advisers who are not affiliated with a Dealer, banks acting as
trustees or fiduciaries and (ii) information it has obtained from a
prospective investor, including such information as the investment
objectives, other investments, financial situation and needs of the
person or any other information known by the Dealer Manager (or
Dealer, as applicable) after due inquiry. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Dealer Manager shall not, and each Dealer shall
agree not to, execute any transaction in the Company in a
discretionary account without prior written approval of the
transaction by the customer.

(f) Suitability Records
. The Dealer Manager shall maintain, or in its agreements with
Dealers shall require the Dealers to maintain, for at least six (6)
years or for a period of time not less than that required to comply
with all applicable federal, state and other regulatory
requirements, whichever is later, a record of the information
obtained to determine that an investor meets the financial
qualification and suitability standards imposed on the offer and
sale of the Shares (both at the time of the initial subscription
and at the time of any additional subscriptions, including initial
enrollments and increased participations in the DRP), and a
representation of the investor that the investor is investing for
the investor’s own account or, in lieu of such
representation, information indicating that the investor for whose
account the investment was made met the suitability standards. The
Company agrees that the Dealer Manager can satisfy its obligations
by contractually requiring such information to be maintained by the
investment advisers or banks referred to herein.
 
- 12 -



(g) Authorized Sales
Materials . Except for Authorized Sales Materials, the
Company has not authorized the use of any supplemental literature
or sales material in connection with the Offering and the Dealer
Manager agrees not to use any such material that has not been
authorized by the Company. The Dealer Manager further agrees (i)
not to deliver any Authorized Sales Materials to any person unless
it is accompanied or preceded by the Prospectus, as amended and
supplemented, (ii) not to show or give to any investor or
prospective investor or reproduce any material or writing that is
supplied to it by the Company and marked “broker-dealer use
only” or otherwise bearing a legend denoting that it is not
to be used in connection with the sale of Shares to members of the
public and (iii) not to show or give to any investor or prospective
investor in a particular jurisdiction any material or writing that
is supplied to it by the Company if such material bears a legend
denoting that it is not to be used in connection with the sale of
Shares to members of the public in such jurisdiction.

(h) Escrow Agreement . The
Dealer Manager agrees to be bound by the terms of the Escrow
Agreement dated June 1, 2015, among UMB Bank, N.A., as Escrow
Agent, the Dealer Manager and the Company, which is included as an
exhibit to the Registration Statement and the Dealer Manager
further agrees that it will not represent or imply that the Escrow
Agent identified in the Prospectus has investigated the
desirability or advisability of an investment in the Company or has
approved, endorsed or passed upon the merits of the Shares or of
the Company, nor will the Dealer Manager use the name of said
Escrow Agent in any manner whatsoever in connection with the offer
or sale of the Shares other than by acknowledgment that it has
agreed to serve as escrow agent.

(i) Selected Dealer
Agreements . All engagements of the Dealers shall be
evidenced by a Selected Dealer Agreement. The Dealer Manager will
permit a Dealer to participate in the Offering only if such Dealer
is a member of FINRA, registered with the SEC, duly licensed or
registered by the regulatory authorities in the jurisdictions in
which the Company will offer and sell Shares, and has been
previously approved by the Company (such approval not to be
unreasonably withheld or delayed).

(j) Customer Information
. The Dealer Manager will use commercially reasonable efforts
to provide the Company with any and all subscriber information that
the Company requests in order to confirm that the Dealer Manager
has complied with the requirements under Section 8(e)
above.

(k) Information to the
Company . The Dealer Manager will provide the Company with such
information relating to the offer and sale of the Shares by it as
the Company may from time to time reasonably request or as may be
requested to enable the Company to prepare such reports of sale as
may be required to be filed under applicable federal or state
securities laws.

(l) Payment of Expenses
. The Dealer Manager will pay all expenses incident to the
performance of its obligations under this Agreement, including the
formation and management of the selling group and the fees and
expenses of its own counsel and accountants, even if the Offering
is not successfully completed.

(m) AML Compliance . Although
acting as a wholesale distributor and not itself selling shares
directly to investors, the Dealer Manager represents to the Company
that it has established and implemented anti-money laundering
compliance programs (“ AML Program ”) in
accordance with applicable law, including applicable FINRA Conduct
Rules, Exchange Act Rules and Regulations and the Uniting and
Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to
Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001, as amended (the
“ USA PATRIOT Act ”), specifically including,
but not limited to, Section 352 of the International Money
Laundering Abatement and Anti-Terrorist Financing Act of 2001 (the
“ Money Laundering Abatement Act ”, and together
with the USA PATRIOT Act, the “ AML Rules ”),
reasonably expected to detect and cause the reporting of suspicious
transactions in connection with the offering and sale of the
Shares. The Dealer Manager further represents that it is currently
in
 
- 13 -


compliance with all AML Rules, specifically
including, but not limited to, the Customer Identification Program
requirements under Section 326 of the Money Laundering Abatement
Act, and the Dealer Manager hereby covenants to remain in
compliance with such requirements and shall, upon request by the
Company, provide a certification to the Company that, as of the
date of such certification (i) its AML Program is consistent with
the AML Rules, and (ii) it is currently in compliance with all AML
Rules, specifically including, but not limited to, the Customer
Identification Program requirements under Section 326 of the Money
Laundering Abatement Act.

(n) Cooperation . Upon
the expiration or earlier termination of this Agreement, the Dealer
Manager will use reasonable efforts to cooperate fully with the
Company and any other party that may be necessary to accomplish an
orderly transfer and transfer to such a successor dealer manager of
the operation and management of the services the Dealer Manager is
providing to the Company under this Agreement. The Dealer
Manager will not be entitled to receive any additional fee in
connection with the foregoing provisions of this Section
8(n) , but the Company will pay or reimburse the Dealer Manager
for any out-of-pocket expenses reasonably incurred by the Dealer
Manager in connection therewith.

9.
Indemnification.

(a) Indemnification of the Dealer
Manager and Dealers . To the extent permitted by the
Company’s charter and the provisions of Article II.G of the

Manager, their officers and directors and each person, if any, who
controls such Dealer or Dealer Manager within the meaning of
Section 15 of the Securities Act (the “ Indemnified
Persons ”) from and against any losses, claims, damages
or liabilities (“ Losses ”), joint or several,
to which such Indemnified Persons may become subject, under the

upon (i) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a
material fact contained (A) in the Registration Statement, the
Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus used prior to the effective
date of the Registration Statement or any post-effective amendment
or supplement to any of them or (B) in any blue sky application or

information being hereinafter called a “ Blue Sky
Application ”) or (C) in any Authorized Sales Materials,
or (ii) the omission or alleged omission to state in the
Registration Statement, the Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus
used prior to the effective date of the Registration Statement or
any post-effective amendment or supplement to any of them or in any

therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading. The Company will reimburse each Indemnified Person
for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such
Indemnified Person in connection with investigating or defending
such Loss.

Notwithstanding the foregoing
provisions of this Section 9(a) , the Company will not be
liable in any such case to the extent that any such Loss or expense
arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement or alleged
untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made in reliance
upon and in conformity with written information furnished (i) to
the Company by the Dealer Manager or (ii) to the Company or the
Dealer Manager by or on behalf of any Dealer specifically for use
in the Registration Statement, the Prospectus, any Preliminary
Prospectus used prior to the effective date of the Registration
Statement or any post-effective amendment or supplement to any of
them, any Blue Sky Application or any Authorized Sales Materials,
and, further, the Company will not be liable in any such case if it
is determined that such Dealer or the Dealer Manager was at fault
in connection with the Loss, expense or action.
 
- 14 -



The foregoing indemnity agreement of
this Section 9(a) is subject to the further condition that,
insofar as it relates to any untrue statement, alleged untrue
statement, omission or alleged omission made in the Prospectus (or
amendment or supplement thereto) that was eliminated or remedied in
any subsequent amendment or supplement thereto, such indemnity
agreement shall not inure to the benefit of an Indemnified Party
from whom the person asserting any Losses purchased the Shares that
are the subject thereof, if a copy of the Prospectus as so amended
or supplemented was not sent or given to such person at or prior to
the time the subscription of such person was accepted by the
Company, but only if a copy of the Prospectus as so amended or
supplemented had been supplied to the Dealer Manager or the Dealer
prior to such acceptance.

(b) Dealer Manager

indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its officers and directors

has signed the Registration Statement and each person, if any, who
controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the
Securities Act (the “ Company Indemnified Persons
”), from and against any Losses to which any of the Company
Indemnified Persons may become subject, under the Securities Act,
the Exchange Act or otherwise, insofar as such Losses (or actions
in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon (i) any untrue
statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained
in the Registration Statement, the Prospectus, any Preliminary
Prospectus used prior to the effective date of the Registration
Statement or any post-effective amendment or supplement to any of
them or in any Blue Sky Application or Authorized Sales Materials;
or (ii) the omission or alleged omission to state in the
Registration Statement, the Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus
used prior to the effective date of the Registration Statement or
any post-effective amendment or supplement to any of them or in any
Blue Sky Application or Authorized Sales Materials a material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements
therein not misleading, provided that clauses (i) and (ii) apply,
to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement
or omission was made in reliance upon and in conformity with
written information furnished to the Company by or on behalf of the
Dealer Manager specifically for use with reference to the Dealer
Manager in the preparation of the Registration Statement, the
Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus used prior to the effective
date of the Registration Statement or any post-effective amendment
or supplement to any of them or in preparation of any Blue Sky
Application or Authorized Sales Materials; or (iii) any use of
sales literature not authorized or approved by the Company or any
use of “broker-dealer use only” materials with members
of the public by the Dealer Manager in the offer and sale of the
Shares or any use of sales literature in a particular jurisdiction
if such material bears a legend denoting that it is not to be used
in connection with the sale of Shares to members of the public in
such jurisdiction; or (iv) any untrue statement made by the Dealer
Manager or its representatives or agents or omission to state a

connection with the offer and sale of the Shares; or (v) any
material violation of this Agreement; or (vi) any failure to comply

federal or state securities laws and the rules and regulations

Loss, expense or action. This indemnity agreement will be in
addition to any liability that the Dealer Manager may otherwise
have.

Statement and each person, if any, who controls the Company or the
Dealer Manager within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities
Act (the “ Dealer Indemnified Persons ”) from
and against any Losses to which a Dealer Indemnified Person may
become
 
- 15 -


subject, under the Securities Act, the Exchange
Act or otherwise, insofar as such Losses (or actions in respect
thereof) arise out of or are based upon (a) any untrue statement or
alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the
Registration Statement, the Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus
used prior to the effective date of the Registration Statement or
any post-effective amendment or supplement to any of them or in any
Blue Sky Application or Authorized Sales Materials; or (b) the
omission or alleged omission to state in the Registration
Statement, the Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus used prior to
the effective date of the Registration Statement or any
post-effective amendment or supplement to any of them or in any
Blue Sky Application or Authorized Sales Materials a material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements
therein not misleading, provided that clauses (a) and (b) apply, to
the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement or
omission was made in reliance upon and in conformity with written
information furnished to the Company or the Dealer Manager by or on
behalf of the Dealer specifically for use with reference to the
Dealer in the preparation of the Registration Statement, the
Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus used prior to the effective
date of the Registration Statement or any post-effective amendment
or supplement to any of them or in preparation of any Blue Sky
Application or Authorized Sales Materials; or (c) any use of sales
literature not authorized or approved by the Company or any use of
“broker-dealer use only” materials with members of the
public by the Dealer in the offer and sale of the Shares or any use
of sales literature in a particular jurisdiction if such material
bears a legend denoting that it is not to be used in connection
with the sale of Shares to members of the public in such
jurisdiction; or (d) any untrue statement made by the Dealer or its
representatives or agents or omission to state a fact necessary in
order to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances
under which they were made, not misleading in connection with the
offer and sale of the Shares; or (e) any material violation of this
Agreement or the Selected Dealer Agreement entered into between the
Dealer Manager and the Dealer; or (f) any failure to comply with
applicable laws governing privacy issues, money laundering
abatement and anti-terrorist financing efforts, including
applicable rules of the SEC and FINRA and the USA PATRIOT Act; or
(g) any other failure to comply with applicable rules of FINRA or
federal or state securities laws and the rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder. Each such Dealer will reimburse each Dealer
Indemnified Person for any legal or other expenses reasonably
incurred by them in connection with investigating or defending any
such Loss, expense or action. This indemnity agreement will be in
addition to any liability that such Dealer may otherwise
have.

(d) Action Against Parties;
Notification . Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party
under this Section 9 of notice of the commencement of any
action, such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof
is to be made against any indemnifying party under this Section
9 , notify in writing the indemnifying party of the
commencement thereof. The failure of an indemnified party to so
notify the indemnifying party will relieve the indemnifying party
from any liability under this Section 9 as to the particular
item for which indemnification is then being sought, but not from
any other liability that it may have to any indemnified party. In
case any such action is brought against any indemnified party, and
it notifies an indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the
indemnifying party will be entitled, to the extent it may wish,
jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to
participate in the defense thereof, with separate counsel. Such
participation shall not relieve such indemnifying party of the
obligation to reimburse the indemnified party for reasonable legal
and other expenses (subject to Section 9(e) ) incurred by
such indemnified party in defending itself, except for such
expenses incurred after the indemnifying party has deposited funds
sufficient to effect the settlement, with prejudice, of the claim
in respect of which indemnity is sought. Any such indemnifying
party shall not be liable to any such indemnified party on account
of any settlement of any claim or action effected without the
consent of such indemnifying party. Any indemnified party shall not
be bound to perform or refrain from performing any act pursuant to
the terms of any settlement of any claim or action effected without
the consent of such indemnified party.
 
- 16 -



(e) Reimbursement of Fees and
Expenses . The indemnifying party shall pay all legal fees and
expenses of the indemnified party in the defense of such claims or
actions; provided, however, that the indemnifying party shall not
be obliged to pay legal expenses and fees to more than one law firm
in connection with the defense of similar claims arising out of the
same alleged acts or omissions giving rise to such claims
notwithstanding that such actions or claims are alleged or brought
by one or more parties against more than one indemnified party. If
such claims or actions are alleged or brought against more than one
indemnified party, then the indemnifying party shall only be
obliged to reimburse the expenses and fees of the one law firm that
has been selected by a majority of the indemnified parties against
which such action is finally brought; and in the event a majority
of such indemnified parties are unable to agree on which law firm
for which expenses or fees will be reimbursable by the indemnifying
party, then payment shall be made to the first law firm of record
representing an indemnified party against the action or claim. Such
law firm shall be paid only to the extent of services performed by
such law firm and no reimbursement shall be payable to such law
firm on account of legal services performed by another law
firm.

10. Contribution.

(a) If the indemnification provided
for in Section 9 hereof is for any reason unavailable to or
insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party in respect of
any losses, liabilities, claims, damages or expenses referred to
therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the
aggregate amount of such losses, liabilities, claims, damages and
expenses incurred by such indemnified party, as incurred,
(i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the
relative benefits received by the Company, the Dealer Manager and
the Dealer, respectively, from the proceeds of the offering of the
Shares pursuant to this Agreement and the relevant Selected Dealer
Agreement or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause
(i) is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as
is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred
to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Company,
the Dealer Manager and the Dealer, respectively, in connection with
the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses,
liabilities, claims, damages or expenses, as well as any other
relevant equitable considerations.

(b) The relative benefits received
by the Company, the Dealer Manager and the Dealer, respectively, in
connection with the proceeds of the Offering and the relevant
Selected Dealer Agreement shall be deemed to be in the same
respective proportion as the total net proceeds from the Offering
and the relevant Selected Dealer Agreement (before deducting
expenses), received by the Company, and the total selling
commissions and dealer manager fees received by the Dealer Manager
and the Dealer, as applicable, in each case as set forth in the
Prospectus bear to the aggregate public offering price of the
Shares sold in the Offering.

(c) The relative fault of the
Company, the Dealer Manager and the Dealer, respectively, shall be
determined by reference to, among other things, whether any such
untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission
or alleged omission to state a material fact related to information
supplied by the Company, or by the Dealer Manager or by the Dealer,
respectively, and the parties’ relative intent, knowledge,
access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such
statement or omission.

(d) The Company, the Dealer Manager
and the Dealer (by virtue of entering into the Selected Dealer
Agreement) agree that it would not be just and equitable if
contribution pursuant to this Section 10 were determined by
pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation which does
not take account of the equitable contributions referred to above
in this Section 10 . The aggregate amount of losses,
liabilities, claims, damages and expenses incurred by an
indemnified party and referred to above in Section 9 shall
be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably
incurred by such indemnified party in investigating, preparing or
defending against any litigation, or any investigation or
proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or
threatened, or any claim whatsoever based upon any such untrue
statement or omission or alleged omission.
 
- 17 -



(e) Notwithstanding the provisions
of this Section 10 , the Dealer Manager and the Dealer shall
not be required to contribute the amount by which the total price
at which the Shares sold to the public by them exceeds the amount
of any damages which the Dealer Manager and the Dealer have
otherwise been required to pay by reason of any untrue or alleged
untrue statement or omission or alleged omission.

(f) No party guilty of fraudulent
misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the
Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any party
who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.

(g) For the purposes of this
Section 10 , (i) the Dealer Manager’s officers,
directors, employees, members, partners, agents and
representatives, and each person, if any, who controls the Dealer
Manager within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act
or Section 20 of the Exchange Act shall have the same rights to
contribution of the Dealer Manager, (ii) the Dealer’s
officers, directors, employees, members, partners, agents and
representatives, and each person, if any, who controls the Dealer
within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section
20 of the Exchange Act should have the same rights to contribution
of the Dealer and (iv) each of the officers, directors, employees,
members, partners, agents and representatives of the Company,
respectively, each officer of the Company who signed the
Registration Statement and each person, if any, who controls the
Company, within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities
Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act shall have the same rights to
contribution of the Company, respectively. The Dealers’
respective obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section
10 are several in proportion to the number of Shares sold by
each Dealer and not joint.

11. Representations and
Agreements to Survive Delivery.

(a) The respective agreements,
representations and warranties of the Company and the Dealer
Manager set forth in this Agreement shall remain operative and in
full force and effect regardless of (i) any investigation made by
or on behalf of the Dealer Manager or any Dealer or any person
controlling the Dealer Manager or any Dealer or by or on behalf of
the Company or any person controlling the Company and (ii) the
acceptance of any payment for the Shares.

(b) The respective agreements and
obligations of the Company and the Dealer Manager set forth in
Sections 4, 6(g), 8(a), 8(e), 8(h), 8(k), 9 through 12, 16, 20,
21, 23 and 24 shall remain operative and in full force
and effect regardless of (i) any investigation made by or on behalf
of the Dealer Manager or any Dealer or any person controlling the
Dealer Manager or any Dealer or by or on behalf of the Company or
any person controlling the Company, (ii) the acceptance of any
payment for the Shares and (iii) the expiration or termination of
this Agreement.

12. Termination.

12(a) , this Agreement shall expire at the end of the Offering

not sooner terminated, the Dealer Manager’s agency and this
Agreement shall terminate upon termination of the Offering Period
without obligation on the part of the Dealer Manager or the

this Agreement, (i) the Company shall pay to the Dealer Manager all
accrued amounts payable under Section 4 hereof at such time
as such amounts become payable and (ii) the Dealer Manager shall
promptly deliver to the Company all records and documents in its
possession that relate to the Offering and that are not designated
as “dealer” copies.

(c) Extended Terms . The
terms of this Agreement shall be extended to cover offerings of
additional shares of the Company’s common stock pursuant to
the DRP which are offered pursuant to a separate registration
statement (a “ DRP Registration Statement ”) and

Registration Statement, this Agreement shall automatically be

Notwithstanding the above, the Dealer Manager may authorize certain
Dealers that are “$250,000 broker-dealers” to instruct
their customers to make their checks for Shares subscribed for
payable directly to the Dealer or authorize a debit from the
customer’s account maintained with the Dealer for the amount
of shares subscribed for by the customer. In such case, the Dealer
will collect the proceeds of the subscribers’ checks and
debits and wire funds to the escrow agent or, if instructed by the
Dealer Manager, issue a check for the aggregate amount of the
subscription proceeds made payable to the order of the escrow
agent, or if instructed by the Dealer Manager, made payable to
“Resource Innovation Office REIT, Inc.” The procedures
for the transmittal of checks and wiring of funds of $250,000
broker-dealers will be set forth in the agreements between the
$250,000 broker-dealer and the Dealer Manager.
