Do NOT buy this book in the KINDLE edition!!!

By JerseyPeach
Don't get me wrong.  I LOVE the Norton Reader and every single essay in it, BUT I bought the Kindle edition and imagine my surprise when I realized that I couldn't change the font size to make it bigger so I could read without my glasses.  Imagine my surprise when I realized that if I wanted the font to be bigger at all, I'd have to hold the Kindle in landscape position instead of portrait position - not comfortable and not good.  If you're going to buy the Norton Reader, and I highly recommend the book itself, do NOT get it in the Kindle edition.  It does NOT operate like all of your other Kindle books and I don't understand why.  I have other anthology books that are "readers" and they all allow me to increase the font size to whatever is comfortable for me.  This book - in the KINDLE edition - is a HUGE disappointment.  Shame on you, Amazon!  You should have put a disclaimer next to the Kindle edition so we'd know.  I'm very disappointed.

Rented it for a class but I kind of liked the stories in the book

By Taylir D.
Rented it for a class but I kind of liked the stories in the book, overall it was a waste of money because it has only excerpts of bigger pieces.
