In 2007, the company was launched as DuPont Fabros Technology and went public as a real estate investment trust (REIT).[6] At its IPO, DFT ranked as the largest U.S. IPO by a REIT year to date and ranked as the seventh largest REIT IPO ever.[7]
DFT won its first award in 2012, after being named Recycled Water Customer of the Year by WateReuse.[8] It continued in the same manner in 2014 when it was named the Fastest Growing Company by the Washington Business Journal.[9] In 2015, DFT won the Brill Award for Efficient IT for Data Center Design among North American participants.[10]

Dupont Fabros's stock soars toward record after Digital Realty buyout deal
Shares of Dupont Fabros Technology Inc.  soared 13% in premarket trade Friday toward a record high, after the developer and operator of multi-tenant data centers announced an agreement to be acquired by Digital Realty Trust Inc.  in an all-stock deal that values Dupont Fabros at $4.95 billion. Under terms of the deal, Digital Realty will exchange 0.545 of its shares for each Dupont Fabros share outstanding. Based on Thursday's closing prices, that values Dupont Fabros shares at $63.63 each, or 14.9% above the previous session's close of $55.36, and 13.3% above the June 2 record close of $56.16. The deal is expected to close in the second half of 2017, and to immediately add to financial metrics and to strengthen the balance sheet. The merger is expected to realize synergies of $18 million a year. "This strategic and complementary transaction significantly enhances Digital Realty's ability to support the growth of hyper-scale users in the top U.S. data center metro areas, while providing meaningful customer and geographic diversification for DuPont Fabros," said Digital Realty Chief Executive William Stein. Dupont Fabros's stock has rallied 26% year to date through Thursday, while Digital Realty shares have climbed 19% and the S&P 500  has gained 8.7%.

SHARES











WASHINGTON (AP) _ Dupont Fabros Technology Inc. (DFT) on Thursday reported a key measure of profitability in its second quarter. The results beat Wall Street expectations.
The Washington-based real estate investment trust said it had funds from operations of $70.5 million, or 78 cents per share, in the period.
The average estimate of nine analysts surveyed by Zacks Investment Research was for funds from operations of 77 cents per share.

Funds from operations is a closely watched measure in the REIT industry. It takes net income and adds back items such as depreciation and amortization.
The company said it had net income of $30.1 million, or 38 cents per share.
The data center operator posted revenue of $140.7 million in the period, also exceeding Street forecasts. Six analysts surveyed by Zacks expected $140.6 million.
The company's shares have risen 39 percent since the beginning of the year. The stock has increased 34 percent in the last 12 months.

Dupont Fabros's stock soars toward record after Digital Realty buyout deal
Shares of Dupont Fabros Technology Inc.  soared 13% in premarket trade Friday toward a record high, after the developer and operator of multi-tenant data centers announced an agreement to be acquired by Digital Realty Trust Inc.  in an all-stock deal that values Dupont Fabros at $4.95 billion. Under terms of the deal, Digital Realty will exchange 0.545 of its shares for each Dupont Fabros share outstanding. Based on Thursday's closing prices, that values Dupont Fabros shares at $63.63 each, or 14.9% above the previous session's close of $55.36, and 13.3% above the June 2 record close of $56.16. The deal is expected to close in the second half of 2017, and to immediately add to financial metrics and to strengthen the balance sheet. The merger is expected to realize synergies of $18 million a year. "This strategic and complementary transaction significantly enhances Digital Realty's ability to support the growth of hyper-scale users in the top U.S. data center metro areas, while providing meaningful customer and geographic diversification for DuPont Fabros," said Digital Realty Chief Executive William Stein. Dupont Fabros's stock has rallied 26% year to date through Thursday, while Digital Realty shares have climbed 19% and the S&P 500  has gained 8.7%.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

History[edit]
The company was co-founded in 1997 by Lammot J. du Pont and Hossein Fateh as they entered the real estate market in 1997 as DuPont Fabros Development pursuing a broad array of commercial development opportunities.[3] Three years later, the co-founders focused their efforts toward building and managing data centers.[4] Their approach categorized data centers as real estate in which customers could sign long-term triple net leases as opposed to short-term license agreements.[5]
In 2007, the company was launched as DuPont Fabros Technology and went public as a real estate investment trust (REIT).[6] At its IPO, DFT ranked as the largest U.S. IPO by a REIT year to date and ranked as the seventh largest REIT IPO ever.[7]
DFT won its first award in 2012, after being named Recycled Water Customer of the Year by WateReuse.[8] It continued in the same manner in 2014 when it was named the Fastest Growing Company by the Washington Business Journal.[9] In 2015, DFT won the Brill Award for Efficient IT for Data Center Design among North American participants.[10]
In February 2015 the company named Christopher Eldredge as its CEO.[11]
As of March 2016, the company had a market cap of approximately $2.41 billion and the company's public annual financial reports indicated revenue growth from $174 million in 2008 to more than $452 million in 2015.[1][12]
In October 2016 the company purchased the building and land previously used for printing the Toronto Star newspaper for $40,500,000 USD. The building is scheduled for use in the third quarter of 2017 as the company's first data center in Toronto.[13]
In November 2016, the company was rated one of the 50 best workplaces in 2016.[14]
As of January 2017 DFT was ranked by Data Center Knowledge as the third largest data center provider in the world with a 6.0% market share.[15]
Products and services[edit]
DuPont Fabros Technology operates as a real estate investment trust, which owns, acquires, develops and operates data centers for large wholesale customers.[16] DFT’s data center wholesale customers are various well-known enterprises, including Facebook, Microsoft, Rackspace, Dropbox, Symantec, ServerCentral, and UBS.[5][17] In 2015, DFT had 12 data centers located in Northern Virginia, New Jersey, Chicago, and Silicon Valley, covering an area of 3 million square feet and having a 270 MW power capacity.[5] Four of its data centers are certified according to ISO/IEC 27001:2013, thus ensuring that DFT is providing power, cooling and security within its data centers while securing the privacy of clients’ data.[18] In June 2016, DFT sold its NJ1 facility and had 11 data centers located in Northern Virginia, Chicago, and Silicon Valley, covering an area of 3.3 million square feet and having 287 MW power capacity.[19] DFT offers various Connectivity services to its customers including Dark Fiber services at its campus environments in Ashburn and Chicago. Dark Fiber services are offered as Intra- Data Center Connectivity and Inter- Data Center Connectivity.
DFT operates carrier-neutral data centers in the United States. Computer Business Review reported that DFT's Ashburn, Virginia data center campus was the third largest in the world, covering a total area of 1,600,000 square feet.[20]

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.



Value Score
A


Growth Score

Momentum Score

VGM Score

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

The Zacks Equity Research reports, or ZER for short, are our in-house, independently produced research reports.
The ever popular one-page Snapshot reports are generated for virtually every single Zacks Ranked stock. It's packed with all of the company's key stats and salient decision making information. Including the Zacks Rank, Zacks Industry Rank, Style Scores, the Price, Consensus & Surprise chart, graphical estimate analysis and how a stocks stacks up to its peers.
The detailed multi-page Analyst report does an even deeper dive on the company's vital statistics. In addition to all of the proprietary analysis in the Snapshot, the report also visually displays the four components of the Zacks Rank (Agreement, Magnitude, Upside and Surprise); provides a comprehensive overview of the company business drivers, complete with earnings and sales charts; a recap of their last earnings report; and a bulleted list of reasons to buy or sell the stock. It also includes an industry comparison table to see how your stock compares to its expanded industry, and the S&P 500.
Researching stocks has never been so easy or insightful as with the ZER Analyst and Snapshot reports.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

Home > Features > Security & Compliance 






 
Maximum Protection
Security on Site
Each data center entrance is monitored 24x7x365 by officers in our Security Operations Center (SOC), which is enclosed in ballistic-grade glass and has direct visibility into the main lobby area, as well as the loading dock area. Some DFT facilities offer added protection with exterior fences, gated access, as well as natural and man-made obstructions placed around the facility to prevent vehicular penetration.  
The DFT SOC is staffed around the clock by Security Officers who are responsible for asset protection through management of access control, recurring foot patrols and video surveillance.
All visitors to DFT data centers must present a current government-issued ID prior to entering. The main areas within our data centers have numerous security challenge points, including access card and biometric authentication at a portal entrance to our data center area. DFT proactively monitors its premises, as well as your individual space within our facility, using CCTV camera surveillance. Video footage is retained for a minimum of 95 days.
As a DFT customer, you also have options for additional security measures, including:
Gallery fencing installed in your computer room to separate DFT-maintained areas from your critical asset area
Biometric authentication to access your computer room
Designated areas within your space(s) that restrict access to equipment
Limited access to pre-authorized personnel only
Committed to Compliance
Physical security is just the beginning. Many DFT data centers are ISO 27001 certified and all are SSAE 16 compliant, and we assist our clients with compliance and security-related audits, such as HIPAA, PCI, FedRAMP and others.
Moving ahead, you can count on us to work toward and earn the certifications that will matter to your industry.

CONNECTIVITY
Ensuring a secure, steady connection to your customers, partners and the world.

 



 
Home > Features > Connectivity 






 
Connect Your Way
Multiple network providers are available at each DFT data center to keep you connected to your customers and business partners while supporting your applications and critical IT infrastructure.
A carrier-neutral, network-agnostic data center provider, DFT offers you network connectivity through multiple network carriers, including dark fiber providers and lit carriers. We have relationships with 40 network carriers, two globally leading Internet Exchanges (IXPs) and multiple cloud service providers. If your network carrier of choice is not already onsite, we can invite them to establish their presence in a DFT data center on your behalf.
Each DFT data center features a multi-lateral underground conduit system, owned and operated by DFT. The fiber-optic cables enter the data center via multiple underground Points of Entry (POEs) for added security and diversity—leading to a centralized Meet-Me-Room (MMR) and customer computer rooms.
DFT offers a range of options to meet your connectivity requirements, whether you wish to connect to a network carrier of your choice, peer your traffic on an Internet Exchange or take advantage of dark fiber in one of our campus environments.
Whether you’re looking to directly connect with a network carrier of your choice or connect to an IXP within a data center or across a campus, DFT’s diverse dark fiber connectivity offers you the flexibility and scalability you need. Dark fiber delivers on the promise of high-performance, scalability, network reliability, redundancy and low latency.
No matter what your network strategy and requirements may be, DFT can enable you to achieve your goals. Our data centers are designed to facilitate easy installation and feature redundant options for you and your carriers via our various network service offerings. This ensures your business is always connected.

William Stein, CEO of Digital Realty
Digital Realty Trust Inc. has entered into a definitive agreement with data center provider DuPont Fabros Technology Inc. to merge in an all-stock transaction valued at approximately $7.6 billion. It’s a move that paves the way for Digital Realty to become the second-largest data center REIT in the country.
It will be quite a marriage. Of particular note, DuPont Fabros will bring to the table 12 purpose-built, hyper-scale data centers totaling approximately 3.4 million net rentable square feet in the highly coveted data center hubs of Northern Virginia, home to, among several other facilities, the 446,000-square-foot, 41.6-megawatt ACC7 facility in Ashburn; metropolitan Chicago; and Silicon Valley. Additionally, DuPont Fabros has a prime development portfolio consisting of six projects—located in Ashburn, Va., Chicago, Santa Clara, Calif., and Toronto—that are scheduled to come online within the next 12 months, as well as strategic land holdings in Ashburn and Oregon, and newly acquired acreage in Phoenix.
“DFT and Digital’s product offerings, customer rosters and respective geographic footprints complement each other well and provide many opportunities to grow our combined business over the coming years,” William Stein, CEO of Digital Realty Trust, wrote in a letter to the DuPont Fabros team following the announcement of the merger agreement. “DFT has truly distinguished itself in the industry through its top-tier, strategically located portfolio as well as its world-class customer base of blue-chip companies. As a combined company, we will be better able to meet the growing needs of enterprise-level customers around the globe amid the rapid, ongoing shift to third-party cloud providers.”
Money is Not an Issue in this Union
Per terms of the agreement DuPont Fabros shareholders will receive a fixed exchange ratio of 0.545 Digital Realty shares per DuPont Fabros share, at an implied price per share of $64.32. The multi-billion-dollar price tag includes the assumption of $1.6 billion of existing debt, which Digital Realty plans to refinance through investment grade corporate bonds and other financings. In preparation for the acquisition, Digital Realty has secured a fully committed $1.4 billion bridge loan facility, courtesy of BofA Merrill Lynch and Citigroup.
The planned unification has its supporters; the Digital Realty-DuPont Fabros agreement appears to be well received by analysts. “I think the merger increases Digital Realty’s speed to market in several markets‎ and offers highly achievable expense synergies,” Jonathan Atkin, managing director with RBC Capital Markets, told Commercial Property Executive.
The boards of directors of both Digital Realty and DuPont Fabros have provided their unanimous approval of the transaction, which remains subject to the consent of the companies’ shareholders and other customary closing conditions. If all goes as anticipated, the merger will close in the second half of 2017. With an equity market capitalization of $25.2 billion, the resulting Digital Realty will then be the eighth-largest publicly traded REIT in the U.S.

SAN DIEGO, June 9, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Shareholder rights law firm Johnson & Weaver, LLP (J&W) has launched an investigation into whether the board members of DuPont Fabros Technology, Inc. (NYSE:    DFT) breached their fiduciary duties in connection with the proposed sale of the Company to Digital Realty (NYSE:    DLR). DuPont Fabros is a real estate investment trust (REIT), engages in the ownership, acquisition, development, operation, management, and lease of large-scale data center facilities in the United States. 








On June 9, 2017, DuPont Fabros announced they have entered into a definitive merger agreement, in which Digital Realty will acquire DuPont Fabros. Under terms of the deal, Digital Realty will exchange 0.545 of its shares for each Dupont Fabros share outstanding. Based on Thursday's closing prices, that values Dupont Fabros shares at $63.63 each. However, shareholders will be subject to the future price fluctuation of Digital Realty's stock price.
The investigation concerns whether the DuPont Fabros board failed to satisfy their duties to the Company shareholders, including whether the board adequately pursued alternatives to the acquisition and whether the board obtained the best price possible for DuPont Fabros shares of common stock. 
If you are a shareholder of DuPont Fabros and believe the proposed buyout price is too low and you're interested in learning more about the investigation or your legal rights and remedies, please contact lead analyst Jim Baker (jimb@johnsonandweaver.com) at 619-814-4471.
