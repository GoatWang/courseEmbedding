PCI Compliance
As you know transaction security is a serious issue these days. There has been much said and much confusion has resulted. PCI (DSS) is a term that you will hear again and again. It stands for Payment Card Industry (Data Security Standards).
Visa’s CISP (Cardholder Information Security Program) and MasterCard’s SDP (Site Data Protection) programs are security initiatives that require clients to safeguard card data. Visa and MasterCard, along with the other card brands, have adopted these common industry security requirements again referred to as the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards (PCI DSS).
Customers, businesses, and organizations using electronic forms of payment expect their cardholder data to be stored securely and privately. Paperless Transaction Corp., in partnership with the Card Brands, data security firms and national Issuing Banks, aims to help educate its clients on the basics of data security and the mandatory industry requirements around the protection of data throughout the payment transaction process.
Regarding the p2p Hosted Donation/Payment Page, we have ensured that all of the sensitive credit card information is always encrypted upon entry for security purposes. Additionally, the credit card information (even for recurring transactions) is never stored. We have a secure Profile Management system so that recurring transactions are only tied to a Profile ID (and not the actual credit card information) to add another level of online security.
Basically, the primary point of emphasis of PCI Compliance is that the credit card transaction has been made secure from the entry point (p2p site) to the “back end” credit card processor (Paymentech via Orbital). You can rest easy; all your transactions are PCI compliant with Paperless Transactions Corporation—which means they are safe and secure.

President and CEO George Reich founded the Paperless Transaction Corporation in 1998 to provide the retail segment cost-cutting software and firmware applications for electronic check processing. Located in Irving, Texas, PTC programmers designed a powerful database software system capable of processing millions of electronic check transactions quickly and accurately. PTC was first to exploit new banking regulations permitting the use of electronic debit items in place of conventional paper checks. The Dallas Business Journal praised PTC for their innovation, naming them in 2001 the 2nd fastest growing tech firm in the Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex. During this startup period, PTC boasted a sustained growth of 600%.
At its inception, PTC employed four core staff members. Reich hired daughters Emily and Andrea Reich to serve, respectively, as Operations Manager and Marketing Manager, while Bobby Hestand took a position as IT Director. Over the years, PTC has remained a family business with the additions of son-in-law Micah Hobart, Vice President and Chief Operating Officer, and Patrick Moraw, VP of Sales.
In 2004 PTC undertook a study to determine the viability of devoting their efforts entirely to the faith-based ministry and church non-profit areas. The results were surprising. PTC discovered that faith-based fundraising was severely underserved, with few web-based solutions available to assist in this essential work. Recognizing an opportunity to come alongside churches and non-profits to help achieve their strategic missions, PTC reworked its business model to reflect their new priority.
Later that same year, PTC recruited a team of internet-savvy programmers and charged them with the task of modifying existing software applications to function as web-based giving platforms. This emphasis on technological innovation remains a central facet of PTC’s mission and has yielded an array of sophisticated web- and mobile-based giving solutions, including iPad and iPhone applications and giving pages, events support software, e-commerce shopping carts, Text-To Give capabilities, Facebook apps and Virtual Terminals for credit card and check processing.
Employees at PTC share a love of the Gospel, a commitment to ethical Christian principles and a servant attitude. They treasure their role in providing web-based fundraising solutions that assist ministries and churches in spreading the Gospel and alleviating suffering throughout the world.
PTC continues to be encouraged by countless stories of how their web-based fundraising software has helped grow ministry and church donations by as much as 60%.
 
Executive Leadership
George Reich – President and CEO
A graduate of California State University with a degree in business, George possesses 30 years of experience in electronic payment systems. A military veteran with a diverse range of professional and church experiences, George volunteered six years as a Bible study teacher with Bible Study Fellowship and is a former member of the board of directors of Sterling Payment Systems, a national credit card processor. He served as special advisor to the board of Rafiki Africa Ministries, an organization providing food and shelter to African communities. George considers his most important achievement to be his 47-year marriage to Mary Lynn. He is grandfather to five children.
Micah Hobart – Chief Operating Officer
Micah Hobart brings over 20 years of experience in payments and business management to PTC. After completing his Master of Business Administration in finance from the University of Iowa in 1997, Micah spent two years in the management training program at Procter and Gamble. Prior to joining PTC, he worked at Luminant Worldwide as an enterprise strategy consultant. Micah is tasked with establishing the strategic direction for technology, operations, marketing and sales, and is responsible for managing PTC’s relationships with credit and debit networks and banks.
Patrick Moraw – VP of Sales and Marketing
A graduate summa cum laude of Southwestern Assemblies of God University with a double major in Christian Education and Pastoral (Church) Ministries, Patrick joined PTC in 2003 as Vice President of Sales and Marketing. In this role, Patrick helps develop the innovative giving and fundraising software used by clients across the country. A frequent speaker, he routinely demonstrates the effectiveness of PTC products at events and conferences. A major focus of Patrick’s work involves creating new strategic partnerships with non-profit and church software companies that offer value-added solutions to PTC’s clients. Patrick and his wife Rachel have three children. Together they founded the Family D.R.E.A.M. Center, an organization that provides instruction and training in dance, music, education and the arts to children and families all over the Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex.

Paperless Real Estate Deals & Transactions
loadingDOCS
Embracing the digital era. See how:
































What Is It?
We want all the components of a real estate transaction to work with modern technology. Working with our real estate clients, we've come up with a paperless transaction solution that launches the entire office—lock, stock and barrel—into the digital era.














Are These Your Challenges Too?






















‌ 
Paperwork

It's hard enough to close a deal. It's that much more difficult when you need to shuffle faxes, emails and paperwork to get it done! How do you speed the process up?
















‌ 
Workflow

The back and forth of submission and approval is complicated. Even more so when agents are not fully engaged. How do you get agents and staff to work together?
















‌ 
Accuracy

Over the course of a day, entering data into several systems like the MLS and back office increases the likelihood of errors. Are you sure your data is accurate?
















‌ 
Compliance

Difficulty tracking a file. Where is it? Is it completed? Have the conditions been met? Non-compliance is always looming in the background.





























How We Help
















TRANSACTIONS
Our platform puts all of your documents and requirements in one place for your staff and agents. Whether you prefer paper or digital, we make sure your transactions are managed the same way.
BACK OFFICE INTEGRATION
With built-in integration, enjoy a reliable flow of transaction information into your back office.
CHECKLISTS
We want to help your staff and agents stay on the same page. Create custom checklists to make sure agents turn in all of their documents before closing a deal, ensuring compliance.































COLLABORATION
Help agents stay up to date on the status of a deal and encourage their participation, with automatic notifications for incomplete or missing documents.
MLS INTEGRATION
One of the greatest time-saving features we can provide is MLS integration, because it means entering data only once.
DASHBOARD
Our online dashboard is color-coded with automated indicators—so there’s never a question of a file’s status and there’s no learning curve.

What Makes Paperless Pipeline Different?


With Paperless Pipeline:
Your staff and agents aren't forced into a workflow designed by software engineers. Instead they can adopt workflows that suit their technical skill level.
You are never locked into a long-term contract. So if it doesn't meet your needs, you can just cancel any time.
Your data is never held hostage. Download a backup of your transactions for free each month.
You never pay based on number of agents. So idling agents don't cost you a thing. Just pay based on the number of transactions your office handles each month. And change your transaction limits month to month at no cost.
You can try out the product completely free of charge for 21-days (no credit card needed.)

Paperless Pipeline has been the easiest product rollout we’ve ever done. The interface is simple and intuitive, and even our least tech savvy agents and staff have been able to use the platform efficiently in a couple of weeks. It’s refreshing to work with a tech company that gets how real people work.- Feb 2013

Time, training, and patience gave us a 100% adoption rate. ALL of our agents use Paperless Pipeline, some more intensely than others, but all use it. To this day (two years later) I still have people who initially balked that we were going “to the cloud” with their transactions that now sing the praises of Pipeline.- Feb 2013

How It All Works Together



1 Add Documents


           There are 3 ways to get a document into the system. Scan it, email it in or upload it directly to the site. You can even upload multiple documents at once.
        
 

2 Assign To Transaction


          Uploaded documents are sent to a holding queue, where office staff or agents with appropriate permissions can assign them to a transaction.
        
 

3 Double-Check Docs


          Staff can check for errors while assigning docs by reviewing them for missing signatures and pages. Instant document previews are available for PDFs.
        
 

4 Review Checklists


          Staff can check off docs as they come in. A red checklist means it needs attention. A green checklist means everything is done and the agent can get paid.
        
 

5 Email Agents


          You can email agents right from the system. The message, date, and time are saved in the transaction to prevent "you didn't tell me that" discussions.
        
 

6 Missing Paperwork


          When agents are emailed about missing docs, they can just reply with the missing doc attached and it'll go right to the system. They can scan or upload directly too.
        
 

7 Mark It Complete


           All finished? Staff can mark the paperwork complete in the system and send a message to the broker letting them know it's ready for review.
        
 

8 Final Broker Review


          The broker can review all the transaction’s files on one page. They can fire off notes for items that still need work or mark them as complete.
        
 
 



Paperless Pipeline is a great solution for our office. Not only did we get rid of a warehouse full of old files, but now the agents and staff can access their files anytime, from anywhere. State auditors are happy with it and gave it their approval. Simple, cost effective, and it works!- Feb 2013

Paperless Pipeline incorporates the most advanced security solutions, giving you the same level of data protection and redundancy as an online bank.



Access Anywhere
Paperless Pipeline is always available for you to access no matter where you are in the world via all modern web browsers (Internet Explorer, Firefox, Safari, Chrome, etc). In addition, you can download all the files and data from your account every month using a secure link created just for you.
Offline backups can be saved on your local computers or servers and used as an alternate way to store and access your transaction data.
 


Online Security
Your login connection with Paperless Pipeline is secure and encrypted using industry-leading SSL technology. The information stored in Amazon.com's data centers is accessible only by SSL encrypted endpoints - meaning your data can't be viewed while being sent from your computer to Amazon's secure facilities.
Your data in Paperless Pipeline is safer and more secure than with most online applications and is even safer than traditional offline storage.
 


Multiple Backups
Paperless Pipeline stores user data in Amazon.com's highly reliable data centers. Every document uploaded and every word typed into Paperless Pipeline is automatically copied to multiple backup locations using the Amazon S3 cloud storage service.
Amazon S3 provides a highly durable storage infrastructure designed for mission-critical and primary data storage. The service redundantly stores data in multiple facilities and on multiple devices within each facility.
 





After doing much research and actually purchasing another program, we are currently using Paperless Pipeline. We like that it is simple to use and easy to learn. Our agents embraced it and are thrilled with the convenience of having everything in one place that is accessible from anywhere.- Feb 2013

Questions & Answers

What is a transaction file?
A transaction file is anything from listing to pending to closed. A transaction is counted only once - when it's created. Once a transaction is created, you can change the status at anytime and it will continue to count as just a single transaction file.
For example, if you start a transaction file as a listing, that counts as one transaction file. If you get a pending offer on that listing, you will change the status from "listing" to "pending" and it will continue to count as only one transaction.
How does the transaction file quota work?
When you create a transaction file, it counts against your quota for the current month's billing cycle. The transaction quota is reset on your billing date every month and any open transaction files you created in previous months will not count against your new quota.
How does Paperless Pipeline help my real estate company?
"What do I need to close my deal?"
"I turned in my paperwork…you lost it!"
Questions like this will disappear when you begin to use Paperless Pipeline. Brokers and agents love using the application for real estate document management because we focus on one thing: eliminating the burden of paper. It's not uncommon for an office using Pipeline to cut their paperwork management time in half for every single transaction.
If you've already gone digital and you store your files on a web server in carefully organized folders, then your email inbox is probably a mess. With Paperless Pipeline, your files are accessible by everyone who needs access (and no one who doesn't) no matter what time it is or where they are in the world. You can stop emailing files back and forth and save your inbox for valuable client communication.

How does Paperless Pipeline work? What does it do?
Paperless Pipeline replaces your filing cabinets or file server where your transaction documents are stored. And, it's better than traditional real estate transaction software because you can access it from anywhere. Think of it as your online filing cabinet that's accessible 24/7 from wherever you are. 
You can create a new transaction file in Paperless Pipeline by typing a property address and assigning a status like "Listing" or "Pending". That's it…very little data entry is needed to get started.
Docs can then be added to your account by scanning, emailing, or uploading directly into a transaction. The average Paperless Pipeline customer saves more than 50% on their copy bill as a result of putting their real estate documents online.
What doesn't Paperless Pipeline do?
Paperless Pipeline is not a forms company. If you want forms, choose from the dozens of existing solutions like Zipforms, RealFast, or your own MLS.
But once your forms are filled out, don't put them in a filing cabinet. Take your office mobile instead and use Paperless Pipeline for your real estate transaction management.
Will Paperless Pipeline help me track commissions and agent production?
Yes. Add Paperless Pipeline's optional commission module to your account and you can manage transactions and track commissions + agent production all from within the same system. Learn more about Pipeline's commission module »
How do I get started with Paperless Pipeline?
If you're a hands on person, just sign up and start using Paperless Pipeline. It's free and you don't need to enter a credit card.
If you want to learn exactly how Paperless Pipeline will help your office manage their real estate transactions online, sign up for a personal demo. You'll get a guided tour through the system as well as a chance to ask questions specific to your office.
