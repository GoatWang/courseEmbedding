Credit Acceptance Announces Retirement of Chairman and Founder, Donald A. Foss 

Southfield, Michigan, Jan.  04, 2017  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) --  Credit Acceptance Corporation (NASDAQ: CACC) (referred to as the "Company", "Credit Acceptance", "we", "our", or "us") announced today that Donald A. Foss, the Company's Chairman, has decided to retire as an officer and director effective January 3, 2017.   Mr. Foss founded Credit Acceptance in 1972 and served as the Company's Chief Executive Officer from 1972 through 2001. He added the role of Chairman of the Board at the time of the Company's initial public stock offering in 1992. Since that time, the Company's market capitalization has grown from $90 million to over $4.5 billion. In addition to delivering returns to shareholders over this 24.5 year period in excess of 20% per year, the Company has helped change the lives of millions of individuals by helping them obtain a vehicle and providing an opportunity for these individuals to improve their credit standing.    The Board has no present intention to fill the Chairman's role or to fill the vacancy on the board created by Mr. Foss's retirement. The Board of Directors will be led by Lead Director and Chair of the Audit Committee, Mr. Thomas N. Tryforos.   About Credit Acceptance    Since 1972, Credit Acceptance has offered automobile dealers financing programs that enable them to sell vehicles to consumers, regardless of their credit history. Our financing programs are offered through a nationwide network of automobile dealers who benefit from sales of vehicles to consumers who otherwise could not obtain financing; from repeat and referral sales generated by these same customers; and from sales to customers responding to advertisements for our product, but who actually end up qualifying for traditional financing.    Without our financing programs, consumers are often unable to purchase a vehicle or they purchase an unreliable one. Further, as we report to the three national credit reporting agencies, an important ancillary benefit of our programs is that we provide our consumers with an opportunity to improve their lives by improving their credit score and move on to more traditional sources of financing. Credit Acceptance is publicly traded on the NASDAQ under the symbol CACC. For more information, visit creditacceptance.com.  Investor Relations: Douglas W. Busk

SKIP CLASS? YOU WON'T PASS.


                  If you're good at taking notes and listening during lecture, and regurgitating information then this class is for you. There is minimal math involved which was appreciated on my end. There are lots of free-response questions during tests so you really need to know your stuff, but the questions repeat every test which makes it easier.

                  I'm not sure why Dr. Foss has mediocre reviews. Although the class was boring, he's a good professor and explains the concepts pretty well. The tests are very straightforward.

                  He's a great professor! Reading the textbook is optional. He gives 4 tests and all of them are comprehensive. Tests are super easy. If you pay attention in class you should get an A. You don't HAVE to come to class since he posts his powerpoints online, but I would recommend it because then you won't have to do that much outside of class.

                  By far the WORST professor I've had at UH. I even changed my major because of him. He expects your test answers to be in his exact words. Tests are literally impossible. I asked for advice on how to study better for his exams and he sent me a link to his book on amazon that is about how to study better in college...

                  Avoid at all costs. His lectures are SO confusing and the test are just freaking insane. His grading system is the weirdest I have ever seen in my 3 years of college. No extra credit.

                  I do not like him as a professor his grading system makes no sense. He was a bad lecturer too. I just do not understand why the school even allows him to lecture. He is obviously out of touch and does not know how to grading system on blackboard works. Please do not take you will regret it.

                  He's nice but he is a horrible lecturer. His powerpoint presentations are hard to follow. He is just such a horrible professor. For his final review he doesn't even give you anything. You have a practice exam and HE keeps it. Whatever you do DO NOT TAKE HIM. Least favorite professor this semester.

                  Dr Foss is a wonderful professor who wants all his students to pass. Lecture is not mandatory, but go anyway because his powerpoints wont make a ton of sense if you don't. He's a sweet guy who's just really excited about psychology. I believe that anyone who failed the tests just did not study because he uploads study guides! He curves the class!!!

                  Foss is an interesting character. Great person. 3 tests and 1 final which is cumulative. Tests are difficult. Half multiple choice half write in answer. If you read the book and go to class you will pass. TA grades tests pretty fairly. Attendance is not required but i highly recommend it. The amount of lecture you miss in one day is quite a bit.

                  Although Professor Foss is a kind individual overall, his testing and actual teaching skills need work. His grading is tough, and you need to be able to remember quite a bit, as each of his tests are cumulative. I would not take this professor again, as I generally did better learning on my own than I did with him.

                  Good luck when tests come around because his lectures and powerpoints give you no indication on what to study. His lectures are usually so random that you aren't even able to take mediocre notes. Grading scale is a mess and just overall studying for an exam is really stressful since you have no idea what to study.

                  This is a horrible professor.  If you need to take Intro to Methods of Psychology, do not take him.  If I would have known he was such a bad teacher and does not really clarify the information, I would have not taken him.  The only reason I did not drop the class is because I could not, due to the fact that I already had a few drops from college.

                  If you want to hear the same tone for 2 hours a week and that doesn't bother you ... go right ahead and pick this professor. Other than that, his teaching style makes me want to get out of my chair and go home and teach myself. He makes his teaching basic and is not an entertainer. I can't sit there and listen to someone babble in the same tone.

                  Two tests, 24 questions each (half multiple choice, half short answer), one 80 question final.  No other grades.  Grades in my class were distributed according to relative placement. (15%A, 15%B, 50%C, 10%D, 10%F)  I hated the way he worded test questions, especially on short answer questions.  Hardest lower level course I've taken so far.

                  He teaches primarily through examples; if you don't use examples to understand things, beware. Attempts at clarity may also result in more examples.  He posts his powerpoints, but the information won't make sense without being in-class and having context. Attendance is very important.  Lecture-focused; not much discussion or group work.

                  I did not have a lot of trouble with this class, but some of my classmates did. The number one thing I can suggest is that you read the material in the textbook  BEFORE attending a lecture on the material. Also, you don't want to skip class, because some of the items on the tests are not covered in the book or in his notes. Grades on curve.

                  Do not miss class, if you do, you will have trouble understanding the material. There is eight exams with six questions plus the final which is comprehensive with 80 questions. Foss is a friendly professor but his teaching method was difficult for me to understand and retain some of the material he went over during lectures.

                  You have 8 tests that are 6 questions each, half are multiple choice and half are fill in the blank. His fill in the blank questions are vague and it's hard to tell what he wants. The final counts for 70% of your grade. He doesn't take attendance, but if you miss class and try to read the powerpoints it won't make sense. The book kind of helps.

                  I took this class because I had to. Foss is a good teacher and his lectures seemed clear and straight forward, but his tests are not. Not multiple choice, they are all short answer. Most of the class passed because of his curve.

More than 40 years after he opened his first used-car dealership in Detroit, Don Foss is still in the special finance game. Along the way, he became the largest independent dealer in Michigan and founded Credit Acceptance, which has been buying subprime contracts since 1972. Special Finance caught up with Foss to learn his secrets for lasting success in subprime auto retail. SF: How did you get started in the car business?DF: You could say I started small. I bought an old tow truck and went around town, buying and reselling junk cars. Eventually I was able to buy better cars and sell those — first out of my driveway, then from my first lot, in 1967. SF: Was it your focus on the subprime market that allowed the business to grow, and what led you to start Credit Acceptance?DF: Well, at that time, those were really the only customers I had. The business did grow and we were able to open a couple more lots. But I began to realize that, even as I worked as hard as I possibly could at selling cars, we would have to do better on the collections side. We decided to start the finance company in 1972. The two people I put in charge were not all that experienced in finance, but they were experienced in collections. It worked out well for me — I could still be the friendly salesman on the lot and not have to turn around and play the mean collector the next week. SF: At what point were you able to offer your lending services to other dealers?DF: It was nine years before we took on another dealer — and before Credit Acceptance turned a profit, by the way — but that wasn’t necessarily the plan. I thought I would just be a big retailer. But a friend of mine wanted to open a lot and he knew it was the financing that made it work for me. It spread by word-of-mouth from there. SF: Did bringing on other dealers require special finance training as well?DF: Absolutely. We had to train our new dealers on process, inventory … You have to understand that most dealers are trained to sell the customer on the car and its features. The problem is, that might not be the car that the customer can afford. In special finance, you’re selling the benefits of financing. SF: Do you believe that’s the reason many dealers are wary of the subprime market?DF: A lot of dealers will always ignore those customers. Now, that creates a bigger market for me, but what I hate to see is dealers who don’t show any respect for those customers. Sales guys may feel that, if they can’t finance the customer, they’re wasting their time. But you really just have to match the customer to the right vehicle. I’ve often said that if you’re telling the customer, “You don’t have enough of a down payment, you have to go get more money,” you’re making a mistake. Even if they do manage to get more, eight or nine months later, making the payments has become a big problem.  SF: Having been in the business since the ’60s, you’ve been through several downturns. What advice can you offer to other dealers to help them stay in business now?DF: One secret to our survival is that we’ve always had very little debt. We’ve managed our overhead well. It’s so easy for a buy-here, pay-here dealer to sell himself into oblivion. With Credit Acceptance, we were at least always able to finance the lots. The early ’80s was as bad as I’ve ever seen it. We had a banner up at that time that said, “We buy cars, bring your title!” Every day we would have a customer with his title wanting to sell his car because he was moving to Texas. The joke was, “Will the last person out of Michigan please turn out the lights?” But as rough as it got, we were able to survive and thrive. When things were at their worst and my friends would ask me, “Don, what do you think is going to happen?” I would just say, “Hey, people still need cars. When I see them walking down 12 Mile Road, rather than driving, I’ll start to worry.”

i bought a car, a Saturn from the CARite in Madison Hights, Michigan. A brand new location, i bought the car on Friday Feburary 7th 2014 at around 6pm, and at 10:30pm the car was dead and had to be towed back to the dealership, which is where she still at the time.I have tried 4 times to contact the Sales Manager, Jose. But he flat won't talk to me, the service dept.has no answers, they haven't finished their process of checking the car, to see what they believe the problem is, While i was waiting in negitive 5 degree weather in a car with no power and a 1 year old,the roadside assistance man, steve stated it was a valve cover casket, bad altinator, and bad power sterring pump. My question is this... If you are brand new to the neighborhood, and somebody buys a car you did not inspect before selling and she has a problem of this size within 3 hours of purchase, wouldn't you tell that customer that you will cover the repairs?? or split the cost with me?? This manager hasn't had a conversation with me yet. I know the car was bought AS IS, but the michigan law says I can have my money back, which is all I want at this point and I have made clear, my next step is to call the local news station and put Jose and CARite in the Hall of Shame.

Unfortunately, Michigan law says no such thing with regards to buying a used car. You buy it....you own it. Period.

Not to have consumer protection laws is not right especially when car loans from banks have to disclose all options in the car why does the dealer not have to disclose all issue with the car to banks. It a federal offense to power book a car, but it legal to sell a used car that breaks down the same day and has no recourse. These types of laws are meant to protect only banks not consumersCarRite should be ashamed about this post since they have a mission statement says its all about the customers blah blah blah. Sounds like CAC running a car dealer group
