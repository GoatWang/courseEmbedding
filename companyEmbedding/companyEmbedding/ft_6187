Voted 100 Best Communities for Young People!


                    
                    Hudson is a city in Summit County, Ohio, United States. The population was 22,262 at the 2010 census. It is a suburban community in the Akron Metropolitan Statistical Area and...

                    Hudson is a city in Summit County, Ohio, United States. The population was 22,262 at the 2010 census. It is a suburban community in the Akron Metropolitan Statistical Area and the larger Cleveland-Akron-Canton Combined Statistical Area, the 15th largest Combined Statistical Area in the United States.
The Hudson Park Board oversees more than one thousand acres (4 km²) of parkland in the city. The most prominent property is Hudson Springs Park, which has a 50-acre lake open to kayaks, canoes and small motorized boats. Boat storage is available to residents only for an annual fee. The lake is stocked with fish and encircled by a walking trail that ventures into the woods that stretch along a large portion of the lake. The park also has a disc golf course, docks, sand volleyball pit and permanent corn-hole boards (bring your own bean bags). Cascade Park, Barlow Farm Park, and Colony Park are large neighborhood parks used for sports and general family recreation. Other properties, such as Doc's Woods, MacLaren Woods, Trumbull Woods, and Bicentennial Woods, are kept as forested nature preserves. The first Hudson Park, Wildlife Woods, is actually located west of the city in the Cuyahoga Valley National Park.

Hudson, unlike many surrounding communities, has retained two-lane roadways in much of its downtown. This has helped preserve the open spaces, historical buildings, and trees that the city values. However, this can also significantly lengthen the amount of time commuters spend in the downtown area. There are some services from Metro RTA, and much of Hudson is accessible by foot or bike.

Public schools are included in the Hudson City School District. The largest school in the district is Hudson High School.
There are also many private schools in the area. Seton Catholic School is one. Founded in 1962, Hudson Montessori School is the 13th oldest Montessori school in the United States. Hudson is the original home of what would become Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland and remains home to the Western Reserve Academy, a coeducational boarding and day college preparatory school housed on the original campus of Western Reserve College.

In 2010, the city was named as one of the 100 Best Communities for Young People by America's Promise. The award was based on the city's "Community First" organization that was developed in the 1990's to combat drug use and school dropouts and to promote better choices for the city's youth by providing additional educational and cultural opportunities.
