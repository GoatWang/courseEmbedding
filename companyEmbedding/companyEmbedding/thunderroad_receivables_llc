Re:
ThunderRoad Motorcycle Trust 2016-1 (formerly ThunderRoad Motorcycle Trust 2015-1)



Asset Backed Notes (the “Notes”)
Sample Receivables Agreed-Upon Procedures

 

We have performed the procedures enumerated in Attachment A, which were agreed to by the addressees of this report (the “Specified Parties”), solely to assist ThunderRoad Receivables LLC (the “Depositor”) in evaluating the accuracy of certain information with respect to a pool of retail motorcycle receivables secured by new and used motorcycles (the “Receivables”) relating to the ThunderRoad Motorcycle Trust 2016-1 securitization transaction (the “Transaction”).  This agreed‑upon procedures engagement was conducted in accordance with attestation standards established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants.  The sufficiency of the procedures is solely the responsibility of the Specified Parties.  Consequently, we make no representation regarding the sufficiency of the procedures described in Attachment A, either for the purpose for which this report has been requested or for any other purpose.


The procedures performed and our associated findings are included in Attachment A.


On 31 March 2016, ThunderRoad Financial, LLC (the “Sponsor”) amended our engagement agreement, which indicated that the Transaction will now be rated by a nationally recognized statistical rating organization (a “rating agency”).  Therefore, we issue this amended report which replaces our previously issued agreed-upon procedures report dated 7 December 2015 (the “Preliminary Securitization Offering Document AUP Report”) relating to the accuracy of certain information:



a.
With respect to the Receivables and






b.
That is contained in the Preliminary Securitization Offering Document (as defined in the Preliminary Securitization Offering Document AUP Report) relating to the offering of the Notes.










 







 


Page 2 of 3





This amended report is permissible to be used to comply with SEC Rule 15Ga-2 or SEC Rule 17g-10.  The procedures performed and results of those procedures are not modified from our previously issued Preliminary Securitization Offering Document AUP Report dated 7 December 2015  and there have not been any other procedures performed to satisfy the criteria for due diligence performed beyond the originally issued Preliminary Securitization Offering Document AUP Report.


For the purpose of the procedures described in this report, the Sponsor, on behalf of the Depositor, provided us with:



a.
Imaged copies of:







i.
(a) Conditional sale contract and security agreement, (b) simple finance charge, (c) retail installment contract and security agreement, (d) retail installment contract simple finance charge, (e) retail installment contract and security agreement (consumer credit document), (f) contract for sale and security agreement for sale of vehicle with payment of simple interest or (g) simple interest vehicle contract for
sale and security agreement (as applicable and collectively, the “Contract”),







ii.
ThunderRoad financial credit application (the “Application”) and







iii.
Bill of sale or monster powersports invoice (as applicable and collectively, the “Bill of Sale,” together with the Contract and Application, the “Source Documents”),



relating to the Sample Receivables (as defined in Attachment A),



b.
The list of relevant characteristics (the “Sample Characteristics”), on the Preliminary Data File and Data File (both as defined herein), which are listed on Exhibit 2 to Attachment A, and






c.
Instructions, assumptions and methodologies, which are described in Attachment A.





For the purpose of the procedures described in this report, Piper Jaffray & Co. (the “Initial Purchaser”), on behalf of the Depositor, provided us with:



a.
Electronic data files labeled “TR - Loan Data and Tables - v12-NoNamesVIN-ValuesOnly‑_2015-11-30.xlsx” and the corresponding record layout and decode information (the “Preliminary Data File”) that the Initial Purchaser, on behalf of the Depositor, indicated contains information on certain retail motorcycle receivables (the “Preliminary Receivables”) as of 31 October 2015 (the “Preliminary Cutoff Date”) and






a.
Instructions, assumptions and methodologies which are described in Attachment A.

The procedures included in Attachment A were limited to comparing or recalculating certain information that is further described in Attachment A.  The Depositor is responsible for the Source Documents, Sample Characteristics, Preliminary Data File and the determination of the instructions, assumptions and methodologies that are described herein.  We were not requested to perform and we have not performed any procedures other than those listed in Attachment A with respect to the preparation or verification of any of the information set forth on the Preliminary Data File.  We have not verified, and we make no representation as to, the accuracy, completeness or reasonableness of the Source Documents or any other information provided to us by the Sponsor or Initial Purchaser, both on behalf of the Depositor, upon which we relied in forming our findings.  Accordingly, we make no representation and express no opinion as to (a) the existence of the Preliminary
Receivables or Receivables, (b) questions of legal or tax interpretation and (c) the accuracy, completeness or reasonableness of any instructions, assumptions and methodologies provided to us by or on behalf of the Depositor that are described in this report.  We undertake no responsibility to update this report for events and circumstances occurring after the date hereof.
We were not engaged to, and did not, conduct an examination to express an opinion or a review to express a conclusion in accordance with attestation standards established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants on any of the items referred to herein.  Accordingly, we do not express such an opinion or conclusion.  Had we performed additional procedures, other matters might have come to our attention that would have been reported to you.
The agreed-upon procedures described in this report were not performed for the purpose of:



a.
Satisfying any criteria for due diligence published by a rating agency or






b.
Making any findings with respect to:







i.
Whether the origination of the Receivables conformed to, or deviated from, stated underwriting or credit extension guidelines, standards, criteria, or other requirements,







ii.
The value of the collateral securing the Receivables,







iii.
Whether the originators of the Receivables complied with federal, state or local laws or regulations or







iv.
Any other factor or characteristic of the Receivables that would be material to the likelihood that the issuer of the Notes will pay interest and principal in accordance with applicable terms and conditions.





This report is intended solely for the use of the Specified Parties and is not intended to be and should not be used by anyone other than the Specified Parties.  It is not intended to be and should not be used by any other person or entity, including investors and rating agencies, who are not identified in the report as Specified Parties but who may have access to this report as required by law or regulation.

Attachment A





Procedures performed and our associated findings





1.
As instructed by the Sponsor, on behalf of the Depositor, we randomly selected a sample of 100 Preliminary Receivables from the Preliminary Data File (the “Sample Receivables”).  The Sample Receivables are listed on Exhibit 1 to Attachment A.  For the purpose of this procedure, the Sponsor, on behalf of the Depositor, did not inform us as to the basis for how they determined the number of Sample Receivables they instructed us to select from the Preliminary Data File.








2.
For each Sample Receivable, we compared the Sample Characteristics listed on Exhibit 1 to Attachment A, as shown on the Preliminary Data File, to the corresponding information located on certain of the Source Documents, subject to the instructions, assumptions and methodologies provided by the Sponsor, on behalf of the Depositor, that are stated in the notes on Exhibit 2 to Attachment A.  The Source Document(s) that we were instructed by the Sponsor, on behalf of the Depositor, to use for each Sample Characteristic are shown on Exhibit 2 to Attachment A.  Except for the information shown on Exhibit 3 to Attachment A, all such compared information was in agreement.

ThunderRoad Financial Issues First-Ever Securitization

Natalie Mattila
April 15, 2016
 1 

















ThunderRoad Financial LLC is entering the securitization market for the first time, according to presale report from Morningstar. The $59.7 million transaction is expected to close today.
ThunderRoad Motorcycle Trust 2016-1, a private placement transaction under Rule 144A, is backed by prime and subprime motorcycle retail installment loans with an average original term of 74 months, according to the report.
“The primary risk in a motorcycle asset-backed transaction is that the borrowers may default,” Morningstar said in the report, and “the secondary risk is that the proceeds from the sales of motorcycles backing the defaulted receivables may be insufficient to make the required timely payment of interest and ultimate payment of principal.”
The Reno, Nev.-based lender’s portfolio nearly tripled to 5,717 loans in January, up from 1,510 loans at the same time a year prior. Year-over-year delinquencies as a percentage of the outstanding loan balance increased to 5.26% from 3.85% during the same time period.

Matt – May 27, 2016

My friend Dave turned me on to your flavors. I have tried hundreds of flavors and thunder road knocks my socks off. Perfect dead-on breakfast vape that can handle an all day vape. Amazing. Keep up the great work and I’m in interested in trying your other flavors. I already know broad creek rules, also.

David (verified owner) – May 27, 2016

Thank you 51&Prospect! This is such an amazing flavor!!! It’s like eating the best french toast you’ve ever had. I have two favorite flavors that I vape, Thunder Road and Broad Creek. Both amazingly good! Awesome!

Tyler (verified owner) – September 6, 2016

Great juice, I love it and my girl goes crazy over it. She said it should be called Christmas cookie, but it is  definitely a all day vape and not to overpowering; nice and smooth.
