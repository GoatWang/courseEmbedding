OverviewVision, Mission and ValuesCompany History










 

Organized as a Real Estate Investment Trust, Rayonier creates value for shareholders through solid cash flows that fund our dividend, and through the increasing value of our core businesses - Forest Resources and Real Estate. 




 

  			Much of our value resides in our 2.7 million acres of timberland – a renewable resource that generates cash flow and historically has appreciated faster than inflation. Our knowledge of land and how to maximize its return carries over to our Real Estate business as demographics and population growth increase property values above those of timberlands.

 




Forest Resources 
            As one of the largest private landowners in the U.S., we own, lease or manage approximately 2.7 million acres of highly-productive timberlands in the U.S. and New Zealand to supply timber to a wide variety of markets including pulp, paper, lumber, renewable energy production and other wood products.


 
 



Real Estate 
            At Rayonier, we evaluate each acre of our timberland to determine its greatest potential and highest and best use. In some cases, land that was once best suited for growing timber is now more valuable for residential, industrial, commercial or conservation use. Our real estate subsidiary provides added value by entitling or selling these properties.




REIT Structure
Rayonier is structured as a real estate investment trust and our stock is traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol RYN. 

Careers 
Our strong track record of execution creates value for our shareholders and positions Rayonier as a strong, stable employer. There are more than 300 employees in the Rayonier family, each sharing our passion to create value in all we do.

United States Court of Appeals, Fifth Circuit




15-20375










                                      	Appellee-Foundation Surgery Affiliate of Southwest Houston, the owner of a surgical and imaging facility in Houston, entered into a purchase and sale agreement in 2008 with appellee Rainer Capital Acquisitions. Rainer marketed tenant-in-common interests in the property through a Private Placement Memorandum, which described Southwest as the seller and sole tenant and Rainer as the property manager. Appellants subsequently purchased tenant-in-common interests; the agreement contained an arbitration clause. Two years later, Southwest stopped making full rent payments and vacated the property. Following the filing of a petition, the Rainer moved to compel arbitration; the district court ordered the parties to arbitration and denied motions to reconsider. On appeal, appellants argued the district court erred in entering orders following its grant of Rainer's motion to compel arbitration as all matters were to be stayed under 9 U.S.C. §2. The court of appeals affirmed holding the district court did not err in declining to stay the litigation as to non-signatories to the arbitration clause. Specifically, because the claims between the various litigants were wholly distinct and able to be separated, non-signatories were not bound to the arbitration requirement and a stay as it related to their proceedings was not warranted. Additionally, the record reflected there was no material issue of fact remaining as it related to the physicians, grant of summary judgment was proper. Accordingly, the judgment of the district court was affirmed.
