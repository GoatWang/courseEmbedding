FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

Mr. Ganoza continued, "At our newly acquired Lindero Gold Project in Argentina, we continue advancing with the optimization of the process design which we plan to conclude in the second quarter of 2017."Third quarter consolidated financial highlights:    --  Sales of $65.2 million, compared to $39.0 million in Q3 2015     --  Net income of $11.8 million and earnings per share of $0.09,        compared to $2.6 million and $0.02, respectively, in Q3 2015     --  Adjusted net income of $10.0 million, compared to $2.7 million in Q3        2015     --  Net cash provided by operating activities of $28.5 million, compared        to $17.9 million in Q3 2015     --  Cash flow from operations before changes in non-cash working capital        of $26.1 million, compared to $9.4 million in Q3 2015     --  Cash position, including short term investments and working capital,        at September 30, 2016 was $103.2 million     --  Silver and gold production of 2,089,506 and 14,111 ounces,        respectively     --  AISC(i) per ounce of payable silver of $7.56 (i) All-in sustaining cash cost is net of by-product credits for gold, lead and zinc                                                                    Third quarter consolidated financial results                                ----------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                      %                   % Key Figures                 3Q 2016     3Q 2015  Change     2Q 2016  Change ----------------------------------------------------------------------------Operating Information                                                       ----------------------------------------------------------------------------Realized Silver price                                                        ($/oz)                       19.49       14.88      31%      16.81      16%Realized Gold price                                                          ($/oz)                       1,327       1,122      18%      1,263       5%Silver sold (oz)          2,070,913   1,737,928      19%  1,529,645      35%Gold sold (oz)               13,739      10,998      25%      9,174      50%All-in sustaining cash                                                       cost (US$/oz Ag)               7.6        13.8     -45%        9.9     -23%(net of by-product                                                           credits from gold, lead                                                     and zinc)                                                                  Financial Information (Expressed in $ millions except per earnings per       share)                                                                     ----------------------------------------------------------------------------Sales                          65.2        39.0      67%       44.5      47%Mine Operating Earnings        28.4        10.3     176%       15.9      79%Net income (loss)              11.8         2.6     354%       (1.4)      - Basic earnings (loss) per                                                    share                         0.09        0.02     350%      (0.01)      - Adjusted net income                                                          (loss)                        10.0         2.7     270%       (1.5)      - ADJUSTED EBITDA                33.3        11.5     190%       18.6      79%Cash provided by (used                                                       for) operating                                                              activities                    28.5        17.9      59%       (1.3)      - Cash provided by (used                                                       for) operating                                                              activities before                                                           changes in working                                                          capital                       26.1         9.4     178%       12.7     106%Capex                         (11.3)      (17.2)    -34%       (6.2)     82%Free Cash Flow(i)              17.2         0.7       -        (7.5)      - Cash and cash                                                                equivalents, end of                                                         period                       103.2       109.9      -6%       89.2      16%----------------------------------------------------------------------------(i) Free Cash Flow is Cash provided by operating activities less additions  to mineral properties and plant and equipment, and net deposits to          contractors and suppliers                                                   Net income amounted to $11.8 million (Q3 2015: $2.6 million income), resulting in basic earnings per share of $0.09 (Q3 2015: $0.02). Compared to Q3 2015, results were impacted by sales of $65.2 million resulting mostly from higher silver and gold sold related to the processing plant expansion to 3,000 tpd at the San Jose Mine as well as 31% and 18% higher realized prices for silver and gold respectively.Sales were $65.2 million, 67% increase year over year (Q3 2015: $39.0 million). Silver and gold ounces sold increased 19% and 25%, respectively, while realized prices, per ounce, on provisional sales for silver and gold were $19.49 and $1,327, compared to $14.89 and $1,122, respectively, in Q3 2015.Mine operating earnings was $28.4 million, 176% increase year over year (Q3 2015: $10.3 million), while the gross margin (mine operating earnings over sales) was 44% (Q3 2015: 26%). Gross margin improved as a result of higher realized metal prices and lower unit costs at both operations.Adjusted EBITDA was $33.3 million, 190% increase year over year driven by increases at Caylloma and San Jose of 393% and 122% respectively.Cash flow from operations, before changes in working capital (refer to non-GAAP financial measures) increased 178% to $26.1 million (Q3 2015: $9.4 million) from the same period in the prior year, as a result of stronger operating results and timing differences in the payment of income taxes.Consolidated Operating Results                                                                                            QUARTERLY RESULTS                                              -------------------------------------------                                       Three months ended September 30                                       -------------------------------------------                                                    2016                                                     -------------------------------------------Consolidated Metal Production         Caylloma       San Jose  Consolidated                                  -------------- ------------- --------------Silver (oz)                            308,680      1,780,825     2,089,506 Gold (oz)                                  160         13,951        14,111 Lead (000's lbs)                         7,452              -

Higher silver and gold production in the quarter of 20% and 29%, respectively, compared to Q3 2015, is explained by the processing plant expansion to 3,000 tpd at the San Jose Mine.

Zinc and lead production were 5% and 17% higher, respectively, year over year mainly as a result of higher mill throughput of 12%.Cash cost per tonne of processed ore was $71.83, a decrease of 19% year over year driven by lower mining costs related to the cessation of mining narrow veins and lower indirect costs related to headcount. Additionally, lower mining costs are further explained by lower execution in mine preparation and related costs, for which we expect there to be a partial catch-up in the fourth quarter. All-in sustaining cash cost per payable ounce of silver, net of by-product credits, was $3.27; below annual guidance of $12.50 as a result of lower execution of sustaining capital expenditures and lower cash cost per tonne (refer to non-GAAP financial measures).The financial statements and MD&A are available on SEDAR and have also been posted on the Company's website at http://www.fortunasilver.com/s/financial_reports.asp.Conference call to review third quarter financial and operations resultsDate: Tuesday, November 8, 2016                                             Time: 9:00 a.m. Pacific / 12:00 p.m. Eastern                                Dial in number (Toll Free): +1.866.932.0173                                 Dial in number (International): +1.785.424.1630                             Replay number (Toll Free): +1.877.481.4010                                  Replay number (International): +1.919.882.2331                              Replay Passcode: 10104                                                      Playback of the conference call will be available until November 22, 2016 at 11:59 p.m. Eastern.

All statements included herein, other than statements of historical fact, are Forward looking Statements and are subject to a variety of known and unknown risks and uncertainties which could cause actual events or results to differ materially from those reflected in the Forward looking Statements. The Forward looking Statements in this news release include, without limitation, statements about the Company's plans for its mines and mineral properties; the Company's business strategy, plans and outlook; the merit of the Company's mines and mineral properties; the future financial or operating performance of the Company; and proposed expenditures. Often, but not always, these Forward looking Statements can be identified by the use of words such as "estimated", "potential", "open", "future", "assumed", "projected", "used", "detailed", "has been", "gain", "planned", "reflecting", "will", "containing", "remaining", "to be", or statements that events, "could" or "should" occur or be achieved and similar expressions, including negative variations.Forward looking Statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors which may cause the actual results, performance or achievements of the Company to be materially different from any results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by the Forward looking Statements. Such uncertainties and factors include, among others, changes in general economic conditions and financial markets; changes in prices for silver and other metals; technological and operational hazards in Fortuna's mining and mine development activities; risks inherent in mineral exploration; uncertainties inherent in the estimation of mineral reserves, mineral resources, and metal recoveries; governmental and other approvals; political unrest or instability in countries where Fortuna is active; labor relations issues; as well as those factors discussed under "Risk Factors" in the Company's Annual Information Form. Although the Company has attempted to identify important factors that could cause actual actions, events or results to differ materially from those described in Forward looking Statements, there may be other factors that cause actions, events or results to differ from those anticipated, estimated or intended.Forward looking Statements contained herein are based on the assumptions, beliefs, expectations and opinions of management, including but not limited to expectations regarding the Company's plans for its mines and mineral properties; mine production costs; expected trends in mineral prices and currency exchange rates; the accuracy of the Company's current mineral resource and reserve estimates; that the Company's activities will be in accordance with the Company's public statements and stated goals; that there will be no material adverse change affecting the Company or its properties; that all required approvals will be obtained; that there will be no significant disruptions affecting operations and such other assumptions as set out herein. Forward looking Statements are made as of the date hereof and the Company disclaims any obligation to update any Forward looking Statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or results or otherwise, except as required by law. There can be no assurance that Forward looking Statements will prove to be accurate, as actual results and future events could differ materially from those anticipated in such statements. Accordingly, investors should not place undue reliance on Forward looking Statements.This news release also refers to non-GAAP financial measures, such as cash cost per tonne of processed ore; cash cost per payable ounce of silver; total production cost per tonne; all-in sustaining cash cost; all-in cash cost; adjusted net (loss) income; operating cash flow per share before changes in working capital, income taxes, and interest income; and adjusted EBITDA. These measures do not have a standardized meaning or method of calculation, even though the descriptions of such measures may be similar. These performance measures have no meaning under International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and therefore, amounts presented may not be comparable to similar data presented by other mining companies.FOR FURTHER INFORMATION PLEASE CONTACT: Fortuna Silver Mines Inc.Investor RelationsCarlos Baca+51.1.616.6060, ext. 0 (Peru)

The higher net income was driven mostly by higher realized metal prices and increased production from the San Jose Mine as a result of the plant expansion from 2,000 tpd to 3,000 tpd completed at the end of the second quarter of 2016. Selling general and administrative expenses were lower compared to the same period in 2016 by $4.4 million due mostly to mark-to-market effects in share based instruments in 2016. This was partially offset by $2.1 million in foreign exchange losses and $1.6 million in derivative losses.Silver and gold metal sales increased 22% and 41% while realized metal prices increased 17% for silver to $17.45 per ounce, 2% for gold to $1,220 per ounce, and 65% and 31% for zinc and lead, respectively.Adjusted EBITDA in the first quarter of 2017 increased $18.0 million over the prior year to $30.4 million as a result of higher sales and operating leverage. Cash provided by operating activities was $8.9 million compared to cash consumed of $0.3 million in the first quarter of 2016, while cash provided by operating activities before changes in working capital increased $13.3 million to $19.4 million.At March 31, 2017, the Company had cash and short-term investments totaling $191.2 million (December 31, 2016: $123.6 million).

Minerals Market Research Reports & Industry Analysis
Minerals are solid, naturally occurring chemical substances with structures that are highly organized atomically. They also have very specific physical properties, and are formed through biogeochemical processes. Though they may look like rocks to the untrained eye, minerals differ from rocks substantially in that they have only one specific chemical composition, while rocks are a mix of many kinds of minerals or mineraloids. 
	 Some of the many chemical compositions minerals can have, ordered approximately by their abundance in the Earths crust from highest to lowest, include the Silicate class, the Carbonate class, the Sulfate class, the Halide class, the Oxide class, the Sulfide class, the Phosphate class, the Element class, and the Organic class. Minerals are a critical commodity to many industries following their mining and processing and form a material input to chemicals manufacturing, metallurgy, building materials manufacturing, electrical grid infrastructure, electronics, glass products, vehicles, and high-technology. Rare earth minerals or rare earth elements are particularly crucial to numerous energy efficiency and renewable energy technologies.
Common oxide minerals include chromite, hematite, and magnetite. Economically, minerals from the Sulfide class are arguably just as valuable as metal ores, and include chalcopyrite, or copper iron sulfide, galena, or lead sulfide, and pentlandite, or nickel iron sulfide. The Element class is home to those minerals called native metals or intermetallic elements, such as gold, silver, and copper, as well as natural alloys. The Element class is also where one could find semi-metals and non-metals, such as bismuth, graphite, and sulfur.
