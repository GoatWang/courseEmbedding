Who is Who

Our organization

WT Logistics LLC
  Is a full service Logistics provider, Imports, Exports, DDP deliveries,
  port-to-port, domestic and international cargo, full customs services,
  warehousing and “virtual warehousing’ services, 3PL, and distribution.
WT Cargo LLC.
  Provider of Cargo Services. Registered and bonded with the “Federal
  Maritime Commission” (FMC) as Non Vessel Common Carrier Operator (NVOCC)
  and Ocean Freight Forwarder, also registered with the “FAA” as Air Freight
  Forwarder. Member of IATA, Air forwarders Association and CNS. Participates in C-TPAT and other
  security related programs with the Department of Homeland Security.
  Currently hold contracts with mayor ocean carriers and airlines with
  worldwide services. Areas on specialization are heavy cargo, oversized
  cargo, project cargo, frozen cargo and cargo requiring special handling.

With over 25 years in the market and wide experience in
transportation logistics and distribution, our main offices are located in Miami, Florida USA, just a few miles from the Miami International Airport, Port of Miami and Port Everglades (Fort Lauderdale). We service all the major Ports and Airports in the United States. 
By using the wide international network of partners and
service providers, worldwide, we offer services from any point of origin to
your destination: we provide services from and to all over the world.
Among our customers are manufacturers of capital goods,
consumer products, food and beverage, wholesalers, industrial equipment etc.
Our warehouse is equipped with state of the art information
systems as well of infrastructure allows us to handle the most diverse variety
of products.
Our Services

Our professionals offer their experience to advice and
handle the most difficult tasks, from large “one-time” projects to repetitive
services. 
In large projects, we have the experience of handling the
transportation door-to-door of large manufacturing plants, mining equipment,
truck fleets, oil rigs, large scale air conditioner units, tanks and in
general, large and heavy equipment that requires special handling, complex
coordination, professional planning and accurate execution. 
Our activities are oriented in four groups of customers:

Customers Located in the United States Importing from
  overseas.
Customers Located in the Unite States Exporting.
International Customers importing from the United States.
International Customers Exporting to the United States.

For each situation we have a group of professionals that
have the knowledge and experience to advise our customers the most economical
and efficient method to handle that operation.
From the origin to the destination.
Our customers count and rely in our services to
access the North American market and also for North American companies to
access their international customers, most frequently Latin America. We execute
their instructions and act as an extension of their operation in the market.
Importers to the United States usually request
the use of the INCOTERMS “DDP” (Duties,
Delivery Paid), in other words: door-to-door. The property of the imported good
is transferred to the buyer at his designated location. Our organization can
execute the complete process, including providing “Importer of record” and,
when required, represent the customer in the “FDA” (“Food and Drug
Administration”) registration process.
3PL Third Party Logistics

When optimizing the supply and demand, you often realize
that your customer needs do not mach with your ability to deliver. We can help
you closing this gap providing local warehousing and distribution, giving you
the sense of a “virtual warehouse” to fulfill your customer needs.
We can be as the “Importer or Records” or have your customer
to do so. We can, then, deliver your products “Just-In-Time”, access multiple
distribution centers or tailor the process as per your customer needs. We have
extensive experience in this area, ask us and our specialists will help you.
In exports, we can hold your inventory and proceed to ship
as needed; we will act and be like an extension of your operation.
Cross-Docking is a
logistics technique that eliminates the put away, storage, and order picking
functions of a warehouse while still allowing it to serve its receiving and shipping
functions. It enables firms to eliminate inventory costs and reduce
transportation costs, often at the same time.
Simply put, cross-docking moves imported product into
domestic equipment or moves domestic product into export equipment. It is becoming
more and more common in today’s logistics operations.
 
Handling of Pound or Products?

Maybe both…
The international flow of goods requires the use of multiple
steam-companies, airlines and other means of transportation.  The service is
measured by weight or by volume. The transport company product is the “box”,
“pallet” and/or the unit of transportation. The content is not their main
concern. We know that for you as a shipper or as a consignee, your concern is
your product. Our information systems as well the communication with our
customers is in their language and not in terms like “on-hands”, “airway bills”
or “bill-of-lading”. We keep track of all the references associated to the
cargo for future references.
Storage and Distribution

We service all the international Sea-ports and Airports in
the United States. We have access to distributions centers shipping and or
receiving products in the most convenient locations to minimize cost. We can
arrange and provide deliveries “JIT” (Just in Time) reducing inventory levels
and ate the same time, increase the level of service.
We can be you warehouse space in South Florida, secured,
accurate and professionally managed. See our warehouse offer.
What is Logistics?

That part of Supply chain process involving planning
implementation, efficient and effective flow of information and goods between a
point of origin and the point of consumption tailor-made according to customers
requirements
The difference between a logistic provider and a cargo
provider is that a good logistics provider deals with your “products”
and a cargo provider handles your pallets, kilos and volume. 
Our repetitive customers are the best proof that our service
is consistent and high quality. When requiring special handling and high
dedication, our group of professionals will be there to help you.
 
Consulting and Planning

Before you face a Supply Chain Management solution, a group
of professionals will analyze your needs and go through three basic steps:
Analysis
Will collect all the information about the current process,
taking notes on the strength and weakness, drawing the flow of goods, materials
and assessing the levels of information available,
Project
After the Analysis phase, we will design a working model
with your management and employees, proposing methods to optimize your current
process and placing you Supply Chain in a competitive and profitable stage.
Implementation
After the proposal approval, we will put our resources to
work, delivering the solution, coordinating the complex network that will
create the new optimized Supply Chain that will reduce your logistics cost.

so xpo was the company selected to deliver the tv i ordered on amazon .. the day before thd deliver i received a call to remind me about the delivery. i also received a reminder via email.  i went on yelp to read the reviews the night before and based on what i read, i got really worried .. i really did expect the worst .. well the day arrived and i couldn't be more pleased.. the called 30 mins before ... arrived, unboxed the tv, installed the stand, plugged it in and left all within 15 mins .. so i wanted to at least come on here and put a positive review to help tell folks out there to relax a bit & give this company a chance.







ZERO ZERO ZERO--definitely not worth the one star (this company isn't even worth the chewed piece of gum stuck to the bottom of my shoe) but unfortunately it's the only rating option I have available!  PLEASE READ--RUN FOR THE HILLS if you hear the letters XPO out of any companies mouth for shipment/delivery because frankly it won't happen!!  

After 8+ days you will talk to countless "representatives" and supposed "supervisors" all of which will lie through their teeth and try and pass the buck to the next guy.  You may get lucky and get the occasional empty apology that wastes even more of your time because again they don't follow through with anything they say they will.  And please by any means don't hold your breath waiting for them to pick up their phones and contact you because that phone call will never come...any communication we have exchanged with this "company" was initiated by myself or my husband.

I'm not sure how a "company" that is run so poorly stays in business.  We are contemplating taking legal action against them for the atrocious customer service experience and fraudulent services that has led to a mountain of unnecessary distress.  Perhaps when they're in court under oath they'll have to tell the truth even if it strikes them dead right there!!







Lengthy discussion prior to delivery of a fridge via a Best Buy sales manager about hauling away a fridge 6 feet down a hall and relocating a fridge 5 feet up the hall, and hooking up the new fridge, charge $28. The sales mgr fails to indicate to XPO how to enter the gate. I confirm the delivery 1 day prior and reiterate I will need to be called to let them thru the gate. Staying home from work and reading previous bad reviews was anxiety producing, but nobody is prepping for brain surgery, and I am no fridge virgin.

XPO calls 30 minutes out - tailgates into the subdivision, rings doorbell, not following instructions yet. Am believer measure twice cut once. The man who would not give me his name is a hothead, unhinged does not begin to describe his Trump like behavior. He calls the warehouse with the intent of hauling off the old fridge but not delivering the new one that is sitting in the street. All the food I unloaded from the inoperable fridge is packed in ice for 1 more hour and then a smorgasbord for all. 

After 35 minutes of calls and his whining about his packet will get him in hot water, clueless about this ruining his day, it is his job to deliver appliances, and Best Buy is on the phone speaking not to the driver but to me saying make him deliver. He tells me now I will be required to sign a waiver. 

Not happening. I explain that I watched the movers put the fridges in the house and not one door had to be removed. Asked him to leave the new in line filter intact on the fridge being hauled off, he promptly cuts it in two, $35 blown, he is pissed. I am praying he is not packing. I offer him and his buddy who speaks little English a cold drink, he declines. Again he demands I sign a waiver as I will hold him accountable for the dings he is going to put in floors and walls.  I tell him go slow and no damage will occur. He does put the new fridge in the kitchen, refuses to install it and drives away, I had taken many photos while all of his antics were going on. 

He missed a good tip, hope he did not kick the dog when he got home. He refused to give me his name until he needed me to sign the completed delivery. 1.20 hours of lousy CS.

Hubs got on phone with Best Buy and Samsung getting instructions as to why the bad actor failed to hook up the fridge. Already done a Best Buy survey at their urgency, seems nobody has good luck with this outfit but they all use them, in the future supposedly Geek Squad will do all appliance installations. Won't repeat this scenario, life is too short.







If the option was zero stars that is what I'd pick. We are still in the middle of this nightmare. I attempted to replace a refrigerator for my tenant.  The existing frig is not cooling or freezing properly, Our first delivery attempt the delivery man from XPO Last Mile Courier. measured the space and said the frig would not fit.  He did not bring the frig up the stairs to the second floor. 
The frig is similar in size to the existing one.  I asked if the documented his measurements. 
Apparently not at least no record.  
After much measuring and discussion we decided to not risk keeping the the original purchase and pick a smaller frig.  So we purchase and wait for a call from XPO Last Mile Courier. They called that evening with 2 hour window.  They arrive after the estimated time unbox the frig and see it is damagaed with a big dent in the back side of the frig. The driver recommends we refuse delivery due to damage which we agreed to.  I return to the store for the third time.  The Ridder Park store did not have the same model in stock and recommend I go to the Newhall store because they had 4 in stock.  
Why couldn't it be ordered by the store I'm at?? No I  have to drive to the store...really same company but do not share inventory.  I drive to Newhall store purchase new frig then attempt to get refund from Newhall store.  NO I must drive back to the store I purchased the frig??? REALLY?? Are you separate stores?  YUPP  Not like sears or Home Depot. I will never make this kind or purchase a Lowes ever ever again.
BUT we're not done yet this frig still needs to be delivered to my tenant who is not so patiently waiting for a frig that will keep her food cold.  3 days later, eating out with her children. 
Now it's Saturday I get the call for delivery between 12 to 2pm on Sunday. Then I get another call changing time to 2pm to 4pm. Then they call tenant and tell her 2:30 to 4:30. At 4:18 they call are running behind schedule and no ETA. but GUARANTEED that it would be delivered today. Next call is cancelling deliver for that day.  Apparently they don't pay Over time. 
 But they will call on Monday in the PM with an ETA. 
At this point I'm attempted to cancel but my tenant needs a frig ASAP to add to all this she took one day off work to accept deliver that didn't happen. The biggest complaint is with XPO Last Mile Courier service but Lowes needs to take responbility for doing business with an unreliable company.
SURE WISH I HAD READ THIS EARLIER.







Horrible customer service!!! Very unprofessional!!!! they have delivered a washer machine to my house, and i specifically asked them before coming to my house to make sure to take off their shoes, or use those plastic covers for their shoes, because i have an infant baby crawling all over the house and i'm keeping it clean, and in the living room there is a light grey rag which i try to keep clean, because every stain or mark is noticeable. And they didn't listen to me, i wasn't home at the moment when they have arrived and they walked inside with shoes on, dirty shoes on and didn't even care. After i called them to ask why didn't they do what i asked, and they hanged up the phone and never answered back! Very rude and unprofessional!!!







Ordered washing machine from Lowe's in San Jose. Got a call the night before delivery that they would come at 6-8 pm on.... drum roll...... a Friday night, during Game 4 of the 2017 NBA Finals. I accepted anyways cause I really needed a washing machine.

Friday night rolls around, I'm watching the game and I waited, 6 pm nothing, 7 pm nothing, 8 pm nothing. 9 pm, nothing. Complete No Show. Totally disturbed the game as I tried to call Lowe's and XPO delivery.  

Called Lowe's the next day to find out that the delivery company couldn't find the item at Lowe's due to it being out of stock.They never called me about this as this is some vital information. I would have been waiting the entire weekend. I called XPO and they never answer the phone. At one point in time, I was on hold for an hour.

In the end, I went to pick it up myself at another Lowe's and just installed it myself. If you want something done right, do it yourself it seems. Horrible experience to say the least.







ZERO STARS. I purchased a refrigerator, washer and dryer from Lowe's. I actually purchased more expensive appliances specifically because they were in stock and guaranteed for delivery on Sunday instead of waiting a week. We just bought a house and needed a fridge, washer and dryer immediately, as there were none in the house. I get an automated call on Saturday saying delivery is confirmed for Sunday from 3:30 - 5:30pm. We frantically unpack to clear space for the appliances and 2:30 rolls around. I get another automated call saying delivery is now from 6:30 - 8:30 pm. Ok, fine. It gets to be 7:30 and I call XPO to make sure my delivery is still on track. We are living out of a cooler waiting on our new fridge, so we really need it that day. Chris (the customer service rep for XPO) says that, yes, the driver is still confirmed for delivery but that he had bad traffic (not unheard of in metro Atlanta, so I wasn't upset) and reassured me the delivery was still on track. Then 9:30pm rolls around and no show. I call back and was told the driver is "MIA all day" and "they don't know where he is, He's not answering his phone and they aren't sure if he has the delivery items or not." WHAT?! Are you telling me you actually don't know where your employee is, if he's got my items or not (THAT I ALREADY BOUGHT AND PAID FOR FROM LOWES), and that your excuse is "he's not answering his phone?" She then tells me that "he's probably not coming since it is 9:30 on a Sunday" and she can reschedule the delivery for Tuesday. The whole reason I purchased these specific appliances (at a higher cost than I would have paid for other models that could have been delivered Thursday) was because they were available for next day delivery. I explain this to her and say that Tuesday delivery is unacceptable. She then says "I'll talk to my manager" AND HANGS UP ON ME. I've spent the last 48 hours moving a house, unpacking boxes, and waiting on my delivery only to be unceremoniously hung up on after being told that their delivery driver essentially made off with my appliances and they don't know where he is. Fast forward to the next day, we go to the Lowe's store we bought them from and, big shocker here,THE APPLIANCES WERE RETURNED TO THE STORE AT 10:30 PM LAST NIGHT BY THE DELIVERY DRIVER. He literally made ZERO deliveries yesterday and just drove around with them in the truck all day and returned them to the store. Now Lowe's is telling me that the earliest they can deliver them is on Thursday, because "we have a lot of other deliveries to deal with and they are already scheduled." ARE YOU KIDDING?! Now we are renting a U-Haul and taking off work to pick up our appliances directly from the store. I'm not living out of a cooler for another 4 days. After multiple conversations with customer service, Lowe's has agreed to reimburse us for the cost of the truck rental and I'm still arguing with them about price matching us for the lower cost washer and dryer we wanted to purchase in the first place, but didn't since they wouldn't be delivered until Thursday...THE NEW DELIVERY TIME FOR OUR "GUARANTEED ON SUNDAY" delivery. XPO Logistics has the worst customer service from a company I have EVER experienced. Completely uncommunicative, no regard for your time or effort, and clearly I'm not the only one who has experienced this. From now on, if I ever have the need for delivery, I'll be asking each store who they contract with for delivery service. If it is XPO, I'll be shopping elsewhere. That's how bad they are.







THE WORST COMPANY!!! STAY AWAY FROM XPO!!! 
We were supposed to have a pergola delivered yesterday 5:30-7:30. We drove an hour stuck in Atlanta traffic to be home on time and They call us last minute to cancel due to weather?! It wasn't even raining! I called and spoke with Tiffany and asked her to reschedule it for Sunday. Last night we get a phone call saying they're coming TODAY ?! It's Friday and I schedule it for Sunday! I just called them again and they said that they can't reschedule delivers for more than 1 day...so why "Tiffany " didn't mention that yesterday?! BECAUSE SHE DOESNT CARE. THEY DONT CARE ABOUT YOU, YOUR DELIVERY OR YOUR TIME ! Period.







I just spoke with a rep named Kathy who was totally unhelpful and rude. I had to call the company where I originally purchased the items in order for them to "release" the items to XPO. The company said the items were "released" to XPO on Saturday (it's now Tuesday). The furniture store rep was helpful and contacted XPO to resolve this issue. They said everything was processed as it should have been on Saturday and that I should call to schedule delivery. Unfortunately I'm told by Kathy that it would take 48 hours to assign someone to deliver the furniture and I can't schedule delivery till then. 

Just tell me the truth and don't be nasty about it - someone forgot to do something at XPO with this order or you're short staffed or whatever. I can handle anything if you're not a jerk on the phone. Spend your money on another service.







It better be 75 and sunny with nothing more than a light breeze and parking better be wide open and you better have an elevator and moving sidewalk in your building that goes right into your apartment for these guys to deliver. 

IKEA used XPO LOGISTICS as the delivery/assembly company for a couch we ordered and paid to have delivered/assembled. XPO showed up and their drivers immediately said they wouldn't park in the delivery parking spot in front of our building and would be leaving in 15min if they couldn't find a better place to park. I got them to stay to deliver after fighting with the driver for 10 min. then he said he was leaving without assembling (which I paid for). THEN when he started the delivery he said he wasn't going to deliver because my building doesn't have an elevator and he had to walk up stairs - A DELIVERY COMPANY WHO WON'T DELIVER UNLESS CONDITIONS ARE PERFECT. What a joke.

Oh, and they "Don't do refunds" for the assembly I paid $80 for but didn't receive.







The worst delivery company I have ever seen. Rescheduled 3 times and paid extra for time stop but my order was still nowhere to be found. Waited for the whole day for delivery and call multiple times during the day to make sure they knew about the time stop, but still no use. I don't understand why they are still in business for this. If you cannot keep your promises and deliver on time, then don't do it.  Huge waste of my time.







After reading reviews about this company I was rather concerned about a delivery I was expecting from Amazon. I received a text message the day before the scheduled delivery date to confirm all was on schedule. At 7.30 the next morning I received a text to confirm my order had left their Crick Depot and was on its way. About 11.15am I received a phone call to inform me they would be with me in approximately 15 minutes. 2 very well mannered young men delivered my order from Amazon. So for all the negative reviews I cannot fault the company and award them 5 stars. Well done and thank you x







If apathy were an Olympic event, XPO would win the Gold Medal.

Oh where do I begin. Let's start with the scorecard: 0-4. Out of four deliveries, XPO managed to find a unique way to mess up each and every one. 

I ordered various large pieces for a home solar project. The wholesaler had (no longer based on these events) an exclusive with XPO. Much like the cable company, XPO calls you prior and provides a time window to be available for delivery. Fair enough...can't fault them for that. However, I took time off to be available from the 3-6PM arrival...and nada. After 6PM I called to inquire. The response: "we had a new driver and he was afraid to come down your street". Sigh. Simple follow-up question I asked: "Is there a reason you didn't call to tell me this"? Their answer was essentially..."That's not my job". Seriously...zero effort to minimize my frustration. I eventually asked to speak to this gentleman's supervisor. He actually was quite good. He tracked down the error and made certain the shipment would arrive first thing between 8-11AM the next day. 

So...next day I waited...again...patiently from 8-11AM. Nada. Nothing. Zillch. Again, I called to inquire as to the whereabouts. This time, a different, yet equally dismissive customer service rep said, it would be delivered between 3-6PM, and whomever told me it would be between 8-11AM was wrong. Once again..."Is there a reason you didn't call to tell me this"? You guessed the answer..."That's not my job".

The order did arrive. Intact. Hooray. The driver was polite and efficient. But I needed to make one more purchase/delivery. This time the order was scheduled again between 3-6PM. The timing was perfect...just one small problem...only half the order was there. The driver had no clue where the other half was. So I called XPO. I seemed to irritate them inquiring as to where the other half was. Their response was..."it's probably on a truck somewhere...but we won't know until some truck has one extra box leftover. Check back in a week." Meanwhile, I have workers whose very paycheck and lives depend on getting this order and proceeding with the project. There was zero empathy. Zero apology. It is as though they have a monopoly and you are simply at their mercy. So one week went by, and I heard nothing. I again called. They were able to find it in their warehouse (seemingly based only on my call). I arranged for shipping THE FOLLOWING DAY. Nope...a few hours later, there was a driver pounding on my unoccupied door. Fortunately, my solar installer was able to come over and sign on my behalf. 

We have several other projects that would involve XPO. We contacted our wholesaler, who is keeping track of such complaints, and has arranged to now also allow shipping via UPS. It may cost a fraction more...but it is so very worth it!







We got a call yesterday that our patio furniture we bought from Home Depot was being delivered today between 6am & 6pm.  HomeDepot's website said expect delivery 6/7 & I couldn't find tracking, so I called the phone number this morning left by XPO.  I spoke with a young man who was very professional & he said that we were #2 on the list and that we'd receive a call about 30 minutes before they arrive.  Sure enough, about 30 minutes later we received a call from a very friendly man who said they'd be here in 10-20 minutes & finished with "God Bless You".  They arrived about 15 minutes later, were friendly & professional & the furniture was exactly what we had ordered - a full 10 days before we expected it!!







I have bought my furniture from Ikea on 5/21 and scheduled delivery for 5/23 between 1-5 pm. At delivery day I was called and asked if they could come earlier and I accepted. Driver has come around 10:30, the street was narrow and the driver had a phone call about 20-25 mins (the truck was in the middle of the street meantime) told he couldn't block the road and gone advising me to re-schedule. I did so, I re-scheduled for 5/25 between 1-5 pm. I went to Boston City Hall and got moving truck permission for 70 dollars. That day I went the adress earlier and started to wait the delivery. Around 4 pm I called Ikea to ask and I was told the truck had 2 more deliveriea and would be at the adress around 5. At 5 pm I called Ikea and told that the driver has come but gone because he couldn't find a parking space?? Even though I was waiting in front of the building and had a moving truck permition from city.. and now neither ikea nor xpo take responsibility for that..







Just rent a truck for your next delivery! Had to have some furniture delivered. Set up the appointment & all I can say is at least they delivered within the 4 hour window they said they would. However, we did get a call saying they were leaving the facility & would be there in X amount of minutes. We were outside waiting for them to arrive for an hour & a half past the time they said they would be there for. When they arrived, the doors opened & the smell of weed just poured out. Well guess I know why your were so late.They were nice & all, but definately not professionally dressed & the vehicle was not a regular delivery vehicle, but a sketchy, unmarked, beat up, old, truck.







I wont even give these fools a star. The most unprofessional, irresponsible, pathetic business which is unfortunately used by a lot of stores around the bay to deliver. I recently bought a a huge TV stand with cabinets. They called me to tell me they wont be delivering as scheduled because of the rain, and also that the truck broke down. My furniture was already in their truck. I called customer service to reschedule for a Sunday and they call us 30 minutes prior on a Saturday and tell us they are on their way. The furniture was not padded for protection. The two movers, were careless while moving it inside our home and dropped and dragged it causing damage. I have been on the phone almost everyday with these fools for some compensation. They just started a stupid worthless escalation report and have not returned any calls. Stay away from them. Ask the store you are buying from which company will deliver and if its these fools, just do it yourself!!!! They do have a ridiculous charge for delivery too! Total waste of time and money.







XPO was the assigned delivery company for my baby dresser. I have never worked with a delivery company as unorganized and incompetent as them. I initially received 2 separate phone calls to arrange a delivery. Never received a phone all on the first scheduled day, so I called them. They told me that unfortunately the dresser was not on the schedule for delivery that day. I asked the operator what happened, and she had no answer. So, we rescheduled it for a second delivery date. And, AGAIN, the delivery had not been scheduled. Now, my husband had taken time off work to receive it, and no package.

When we talked to the operations manager, he said he had no idea what happened, and I have talked to XPO again and they cannot explain how I had two "scheduled" deliveries that were actually never scheduled by them. They are blaming the vendor which I find very hard to believe.







We would give them zero stars but it is not an option. 
We receive packaged goods from a plethora of trucking firms on a regular and daily basis.  We never have any issues BUT when it comes to XPO Logistics the drivers seem to be above deliveries.  The driver named MATT is the worst, we have had several bad experiences with him.......super rude and thinks that he is large and in charge. 

WE will never use this company ever again and we note to all of our vendors that we will not accept deliveries from XPO Logistics. 
If you want to have a good day and a great delivery experience steer clear of these folks.







They delivered my new washer and dryer, but instead of giving us the information and the opportunity to take off the power cord, they took it with them despite the fact that it has been discussed up front that I was going to keep it. 

When I called them to try and rectify the situation all they did was give me the runaround and a response of,  "too bad, so sorry".

Their customer service was awful!

Thankfully, the Sears Outlet that I purchased the units from, stepped up and did the right thing.

so xpo was the company selected to deliver the tv i ordered on amazon .. the day before thd deliver i received a call to remind me about the delivery. i also received a reminder via email.  i went on yelp to read the reviews the night before and based on what i read, i got really worried .. i really did expect the worst .. well the day arrived and i couldn't be more pleased.. the called 30 mins before ... arrived, unboxed the tv, installed the stand, plugged it in and left all within 15 mins .. so i wanted to at least come on here and put a positive review to help tell folks out there to relax a bit & give this company a chance.

ZERO ZERO ZERO--definitely not worth the one star (this company isn't even worth the chewed piece of gum stuck to the bottom of my shoe) but unfortunately it's the only rating option I have available!  PLEASE READ--RUN FOR THE HILLS if you hear the letters XPO out of any companies mouth for shipment/delivery because frankly it won't happen!!  After 8+ days you will talk to countless "representatives" and supposed "supervisors" all of which will lie through their teeth and try and pass the buck to the next guy.  You may get lucky and get the occasional empty apology that wastes even more of your time because again they don't follow through with anything they say they will.  And please by any means don't hold your breath waiting for them to pick up their phones and contact you because that phone call will never come...any communication we have exchanged with this "company" was initiated by myself or my husband.I'm not sure how a "company" that is run so poorly stays in business.  We are contemplating taking legal action against them for the atrocious customer service experience and fraudulent services that has led to a mountain of unnecessary distress.  Perhaps when they're in court under oath they'll have to tell the truth even if it strikes them dead right there!!

Lengthy discussion prior to delivery of a fridge via a Best Buy sales manager about hauling away a fridge 6 feet down a hall and relocating a fridge 5 feet up the hall, and hooking up the new fridge, charge $28. The sales mgr fails to indicate to XPO how to enter the gate. I confirm the delivery 1 day prior and reiterate I will need to be called to let them thru the gate. Staying home from work and reading previous bad reviews was anxiety producing, but nobody is prepping for brain surgery, and I am no fridge virgin.XPO calls 30 minutes out - tailgates into the subdivision, rings doorbell, not following instructions yet. Am believer measure twice cut once. The man who would not give me his name is a hothead, unhinged does not begin to describe his Trump like behavior. He calls the warehouse with the intent of hauling off the old fridge but not delivering the new one that is sitting in the street. All the food I unloaded from the inoperable fridge is packed in ice for 1 more hour and then a smorgasbord for all. After 35 minutes of calls and his whining about his packet will get him in hot water, clueless about this ruining his day, it is his job to deliver appliances, and Best Buy is on the phone speaking not to the driver but to me saying make him deliver. He tells me now I will be required to sign a waiver. Not happening. I explain that I watched the movers put the fridges in the house and not one door had to be removed. Asked him to leave the new in line filter intact on the fridge being hauled off, he promptly cuts it in two, $35 blown, he is pissed. I am praying he is not packing. I offer him and his buddy who speaks little English a cold drink, he declines. Again he demands I sign a waiver as I will hold him accountable for the dings he is going to put in floors and walls.  I tell him go slow and no damage will occur. He does put the new fridge in the kitchen, refuses to install it and drives away, I had taken many photos while all of his antics were going on. He missed a good tip, hope he did not kick the dog when he got home. He refused to give me his name until he needed me to sign the completed delivery. 1.20 hours of lousy CS.Hubs got on phone with Best Buy and Samsung getting instructions as to why the bad actor failed to hook up the fridge. Already done a Best Buy survey at their urgency, seems nobody has good luck with this outfit but they all use them, in the future supposedly Geek Squad will do all appliance installations. Won't repeat this scenario, life is too short.

If the option was zero stars that is what I'd pick. We are still in the middle of this nightmare. I attempted to replace a refrigerator for my tenant.  The existing frig is not cooling or freezing properly, Our first delivery attempt the delivery man from XPO Last Mile Courier. measured the space and said the frig would not fit.  He did not bring the frig up the stairs to the second floor. The frig is similar in size to the existing one.  I asked if the documented his measurements. Apparently not at least no record.  After much measuring and discussion we decided to not risk keeping the the original purchase and pick a smaller frig.  So we purchase and wait for a call from XPO Last Mile Courier. They called that evening with 2 hour window.  They arrive after the estimated time unbox the frig and see it is damagaed with a big dent in the back side of the frig. The driver recommends we refuse delivery due to damage which we agreed to.  I return to the store for the third time.  The Ridder Park store did not have the same model in stock and recommend I go to the Newhall store because they had 4 in stock.  Why couldn't it be ordered by the store I'm at?? No I  have to drive to the store...really same company but do not share inventory.  I drive to Newhall store purchase new frig then attempt to get refund from Newhall store.  NO I must drive back to the store I purchased the frig??? REALLY?? Are you separate stores?  YUPP  Not like sears or Home Depot. I will never make this kind or purchase a Lowes ever ever again.BUT we're not done yet this frig still needs to be delivered to my tenant who is not so patiently waiting for a frig that will keep her food cold.  3 days later, eating out with her children. Now it's Saturday I get the call for delivery between 12 to 2pm on Sunday. Then I get another call changing time to 2pm to 4pm. Then they call tenant and tell her 2:30 to 4:30. At 4:18 they call are running behind schedule and no ETA. but GUARANTEED that it would be delivered today. Next call is cancelling deliver for that day.  Apparently they don't pay Over time.  But they will call on Monday in the PM with an ETA. At this point I'm attempted to cancel but my tenant needs a frig ASAP to add to all this she took one day off work to accept deliver that didn't happen. The biggest complaint is with XPO Last Mile Courier service but Lowes needs to take responbility for doing business with an unreliable company.SURE WISH I HAD READ THIS EARLIER.

Horrible customer service!!! Very unprofessional!!!! they have delivered a washer machine to my house, and i specifically asked them before coming to my house to make sure to take off their shoes, or use those plastic covers for their shoes, because i have an infant baby crawling all over the house and i'm keeping it clean, and in the living room there is a light grey rag which i try to keep clean, because every stain or mark is noticeable. And they didn't listen to me, i wasn't home at the moment when they have arrived and they walked inside with shoes on, dirty shoes on and didn't even care. After i called them to ask why didn't they do what i asked, and they hanged up the phone and never answered back! Very rude and unprofessional!!!

Ordered washing machine from Lowe's in San Jose. Got a call the night before delivery that they would come at 6-8 pm on.... drum roll...... a Friday night, during Game 4 of the 2017 NBA Finals. I accepted anyways cause I really needed a washing machine.Friday night rolls around, I'm watching the game and I waited, 6 pm nothing, 7 pm nothing, 8 pm nothing. 9 pm, nothing. Complete No Show. Totally disturbed the game as I tried to call Lowe's and XPO delivery.  Called Lowe's the next day to find out that the delivery company couldn't find the item at Lowe's due to it being out of stock.They never called me about this as this is some vital information. I would have been waiting the entire weekend. I called XPO and they never answer the phone. At one point in time, I was on hold for an hour.In the end, I went to pick it up myself at another Lowe's and just installed it myself. If you want something done right, do it yourself it seems. Horrible experience to say the least.

ZERO STARS. I purchased a refrigerator, washer and dryer from Lowe's. I actually purchased more expensive appliances specifically because they were in stock and guaranteed for delivery on Sunday instead of waiting a week. We just bought a house and needed a fridge, washer and dryer immediately, as there were none in the house. I get an automated call on Saturday saying delivery is confirmed for Sunday from 3:30 - 5:30pm. We frantically unpack to clear space for the appliances and 2:30 rolls around. I get another automated call saying delivery is now from 6:30 - 8:30 pm. Ok, fine. It gets to be 7:30 and I call XPO to make sure my delivery is still on track. We are living out of a cooler waiting on our new fridge, so we really need it that day. Chris (the customer service rep for XPO) says that, yes, the driver is still confirmed for delivery but that he had bad traffic (not unheard of in metro Atlanta, so I wasn't upset) and reassured me the delivery was still on track. Then 9:30pm rolls around and no show. I call back and was told the driver is "MIA all day" and "they don't know where he is, He's not answering his phone and they aren't sure if he has the delivery items or not." WHAT?! Are you telling me you actually don't know where your employee is, if he's got my items or not (THAT I ALREADY BOUGHT AND PAID FOR FROM LOWES), and that your excuse is "he's not answering his phone?" She then tells me that "he's probably not coming since it is 9:30 on a Sunday" and she can reschedule the delivery for Tuesday. The whole reason I purchased these specific appliances (at a higher cost than I would have paid for other models that could have been delivered Thursday) was because they were available for next day delivery. I explain this to her and say that Tuesday delivery is unacceptable. She then says "I'll talk to my manager" AND HANGS UP ON ME. I've spent the last 48 hours moving a house, unpacking boxes, and waiting on my delivery only to be unceremoniously hung up on after being told that their delivery driver essentially made off with my appliances and they don't know where he is. Fast forward to the next day, we go to the Lowe's store we bought them from and, big shocker here,THE APPLIANCES WERE RETURNED TO THE STORE AT 10:30 PM LAST NIGHT BY THE DELIVERY DRIVER. He literally made ZERO deliveries yesterday and just drove around with them in the truck all day and returned them to the store. Now Lowe's is telling me that the earliest they can deliver them is on Thursday, because "we have a lot of other deliveries to deal with and they are already scheduled." ARE YOU KIDDING?! Now we are renting a U-Haul and taking off work to pick up our appliances directly from the store. I'm not living out of a cooler for another 4 days. After multiple conversations with customer service, Lowe's has agreed to reimburse us for the cost of the truck rental and I'm still arguing with them about price matching us for the lower cost washer and dryer we wanted to purchase in the first place, but didn't since they wouldn't be delivered until Thursday...THE NEW DELIVERY TIME FOR OUR "GUARANTEED ON SUNDAY" delivery. XPO Logistics has the worst customer service from a company I have EVER experienced. Completely uncommunicative, no regard for your time or effort, and clearly I'm not the only one who has experienced this. From now on, if I ever have the need for delivery, I'll be asking each store who they contract with for delivery service. If it is XPO, I'll be shopping elsewhere. That's how bad they are.

THE WORST COMPANY!!! STAY AWAY FROM XPO!!! We were supposed to have a pergola delivered yesterday 5:30-7:30. We drove an hour stuck in Atlanta traffic to be home on time and They call us last minute to cancel due to weather?! It wasn't even raining! I called and spoke with Tiffany and asked her to reschedule it for Sunday. Last night we get a phone call saying they're coming TODAY ?! It's Friday and I schedule it for Sunday! I just called them again and they said that they can't reschedule delivers for more than 1 day...so why "Tiffany " didn't mention that yesterday?! BECAUSE SHE DOESNT CARE. THEY DONT CARE ABOUT YOU, YOUR DELIVERY OR YOUR TIME ! Period.

I just spoke with a rep named Kathy who was totally unhelpful and rude. I had to call the company where I originally purchased the items in order for them to "release" the items to XPO. The company said the items were "released" to XPO on Saturday (it's now Tuesday). The furniture store rep was helpful and contacted XPO to resolve this issue. They said everything was processed as it should have been on Saturday and that I should call to schedule delivery. Unfortunately I'm told by Kathy that it would take 48 hours to assign someone to deliver the furniture and I can't schedule delivery till then. Just tell me the truth and don't be nasty about it - someone forgot to do something at XPO with this order or you're short staffed or whatever. I can handle anything if you're not a jerk on the phone. Spend your money on another service.

It better be 75 and sunny with nothing more than a light breeze and parking better be wide open and you better have an elevator and moving sidewalk in your building that goes right into your apartment for these guys to deliver. IKEA used XPO LOGISTICS as the delivery/assembly company for a couch we ordered and paid to have delivered/assembled. XPO showed up and their drivers immediately said they wouldn't park in the delivery parking spot in front of our building and would be leaving in 15min if they couldn't find a better place to park. I got them to stay to deliver after fighting with the driver for 10 min. then he said he was leaving without assembling (which I paid for). THEN when he started the delivery he said he wasn't going to deliver because my building doesn't have an elevator and he had to walk up stairs - A DELIVERY COMPANY WHO WON'T DELIVER UNLESS CONDITIONS ARE PERFECT. What a joke.Oh, and they "Don't do refunds" for the assembly I paid $80 for but didn't receive.

The worst delivery company I have ever seen. Rescheduled 3 times and paid extra for time stop but my order was still nowhere to be found. Waited for the whole day for delivery and call multiple times during the day to make sure they knew about the time stop, but still no use. I don't understand why they are still in business for this. If you cannot keep your promises and deliver on time, then don't do it.  Huge waste of my time.

After reading reviews about this company I was rather concerned about a delivery I was expecting from Amazon. I received a text message the day before the scheduled delivery date to confirm all was on schedule. At 7.30 the next morning I received a text to confirm my order had left their Crick Depot and was on its way. About 11.15am I received a phone call to inform me they would be with me in approximately 15 minutes. 2 very well mannered young men delivered my order from Amazon. So for all the negative reviews I cannot fault the company and award them 5 stars. Well done and thank you x

If apathy were an Olympic event, XPO would win the Gold Medal.Oh where do I begin. Let's start with the scorecard: 0-4. Out of four deliveries, XPO managed to find a unique way to mess up each and every one. I ordered various large pieces for a home solar project. The wholesaler had (no longer based on these events) an exclusive with XPO. Much like the cable company, XPO calls you prior and provides a time window to be available for delivery. Fair enough...can't fault them for that. However, I took time off to be available from the 3-6PM arrival...and nada. After 6PM I called to inquire. The response: "we had a new driver and he was afraid to come down your street". Sigh. Simple follow-up question I asked: "Is there a reason you didn't call to tell me this"? Their answer was essentially..."That's not my job". Seriously...zero effort to minimize my frustration. I eventually asked to speak to this gentleman's supervisor. He actually was quite good. He tracked down the error and made certain the shipment would arrive first thing between 8-11AM the next day. So...next day I waited...again...patiently from 8-11AM. Nada. Nothing. Zillch. Again, I called to inquire as to the whereabouts. This time, a different, yet equally dismissive customer service rep said, it would be delivered between 3-6PM, and whomever told me it would be between 8-11AM was wrong. Once again..."Is there a reason you didn't call to tell me this"? You guessed the answer..."That's not my job".The order did arrive. Intact. Hooray. The driver was polite and efficient. But I needed to make one more purchase/delivery. This time the order was scheduled again between 3-6PM. The timing was perfect...just one small problem...only half the order was there. The driver had no clue where the other half was. So I called XPO. I seemed to irritate them inquiring as to where the other half was. Their response was..."it's probably on a truck somewhere...but we won't know until some truck has one extra box leftover. Check back in a week." Meanwhile, I have workers whose very paycheck and lives depend on getting this order and proceeding with the project. There was zero empathy. Zero apology. It is as though they have a monopoly and you are simply at their mercy. So one week went by, and I heard nothing. I again called. They were able to find it in their warehouse (seemingly based only on my call). I arranged for shipping THE FOLLOWING DAY. Nope...a few hours later, there was a driver pounding on my unoccupied door. Fortunately, my solar installer was able to come over and sign on my behalf. We have several other projects that would involve XPO. We contacted our wholesaler, who is keeping track of such complaints, and has arranged to now also allow shipping via UPS. It may cost a fraction more...but it is so very worth it!

We got a call yesterday that our patio furniture we bought from Home Depot was being delivered today between 6am & 6pm.  HomeDepot's website said expect delivery 6/7 & I couldn't find tracking, so I called the phone number this morning left by XPO.  I spoke with a young man who was very professional & he said that we were #2 on the list and that we'd receive a call about 30 minutes before they arrive.  Sure enough, about 30 minutes later we received a call from a very friendly man who said they'd be here in 10-20 minutes & finished with "God Bless You".  They arrived about 15 minutes later, were friendly & professional & the furniture was exactly what we had ordered - a full 10 days before we expected it!!

I have bought my furniture from Ikea on 5/21 and scheduled delivery for 5/23 between 1-5 pm. At delivery day I was called and asked if they could come earlier and I accepted. Driver has come around 10:30, the street was narrow and the driver had a phone call about 20-25 mins (the truck was in the middle of the street meantime) told he couldn't block the road and gone advising me to re-schedule. I did so, I re-scheduled for 5/25 between 1-5 pm. I went to Boston City Hall and got moving truck permission for 70 dollars. That day I went the adress earlier and started to wait the delivery. Around 4 pm I called Ikea to ask and I was told the truck had 2 more deliveriea and would be at the adress around 5. At 5 pm I called Ikea and told that the driver has come but gone because he couldn't find a parking space?? Even though I was waiting in front of the building and had a moving truck permition from city.. and now neither ikea nor xpo take responsibility for that..

Just rent a truck for your next delivery! Had to have some furniture delivered. Set up the appointment & all I can say is at least they delivered within the 4 hour window they said they would. However, we did get a call saying they were leaving the facility & would be there in X amount of minutes. We were outside waiting for them to arrive for an hour & a half past the time they said they would be there for. When they arrived, the doors opened & the smell of weed just poured out. Well guess I know why your were so late.They were nice & all, but definately not professionally dressed & the vehicle was not a regular delivery vehicle, but a sketchy, unmarked, beat up, old, truck.

I wont even give these fools a star. The most unprofessional, irresponsible, pathetic business which is unfortunately used by a lot of stores around the bay to deliver. I recently bought a a huge TV stand with cabinets. They called me to tell me they wont be delivering as scheduled because of the rain, and also that the truck broke down. My furniture was already in their truck. I called customer service to reschedule for a Sunday and they call us 30 minutes prior on a Saturday and tell us they are on their way. The furniture was not padded for protection. The two movers, were careless while moving it inside our home and dropped and dragged it causing damage. I have been on the phone almost everyday with these fools for some compensation. They just started a stupid worthless escalation report and have not returned any calls. Stay away from them. Ask the store you are buying from which company will deliver and if its these fools, just do it yourself!!!! They do have a ridiculous charge for delivery too! Total waste of time and money.








I have to fix this myself. They dragged it and tell me thats how it was when they picked it from the store!!! Really?

XPO was the assigned delivery company for my baby dresser. I have never worked with a delivery company as unorganized and incompetent as them. I initially received 2 separate phone calls to arrange a delivery. Never received a phone all on the first scheduled day, so I called them. They told me that unfortunately the dresser was not on the schedule for delivery that day. I asked the operator what happened, and she had no answer. So, we rescheduled it for a second delivery date. And, AGAIN, the delivery had not been scheduled. Now, my husband had taken time off work to receive it, and no package.When we talked to the operations manager, he said he had no idea what happened, and I have talked to XPO again and they cannot explain how I had two "scheduled" deliveries that were actually never scheduled by them. They are blaming the vendor which I find very hard to believe.

We would give them zero stars but it is not an option. We receive packaged goods from a plethora of trucking firms on a regular and daily basis.  We never have any issues BUT when it comes to XPO Logistics the drivers seem to be above deliveries.  The driver named MATT is the worst, we have had several bad experiences with him.......super rude and thinks that he is large and in charge. WE will never use this company ever again and we note to all of our vendors that we will not accept deliveries from XPO Logistics. If you want to have a good day and a great delivery experience steer clear of these folks.

They delivered my new washer and dryer, but instead of giving us the information and the opportunity to take off the power cord, they took it with them despite the fact that it has been discussed up front that I was going to keep it. When I called them to try and rectify the situation all they did was give me the runaround and a response of,  "too bad, so sorry".Their customer service was awful!Thankfully, the Sears Outlet that I purchased the units from, stepped up and did the right thing.

Freezable Products








 Are there restrictions on the pickup of freight which has freezable material?
Our LTL operations will pick up freezable products (defined as any product which freezes at or below 32 degrees Fahrenheit)
    from all points in the XPO LTL operating area five days per week, regardless of shipment destination.
Are there exclusions for shipments of freezable materials?
Because weather conditions can change rapidly, products or merchandise requiring protection from cold or freezing are not
    eligible to move as Instant Guaranteed (G!) shipments.
My freight has freezable materials. Will my freight be delayed due to severe cold temperatures?
When temperatures reach 10 degrees Fahrenheit or below for three or more consecutive days, shipments which are subject to
    temperature-related damage may be delayed.
As a customer, what can I do to ensure the integrity of my freezable shipment?
Customers shipping freezable commodities must indicate that the product requires protective service on the bill of lading.
All such shipments must be clearly marked “Protect from Freezing at 32 Degrees F or below” on the bill of
        lading.
In addition, these shipments must be clearly labeled “Freezable Product.”
Your local XPO Logistics LTL service center will provide you with “Freezable Product” labels.
Further information can be found in Item 12 of the CNWY 199 Tariff.
View the Freeze Area Map for a current list of locations experiencing
        freezing temperatures.

XPO Logistics (XPO): Remarkable Growth in A Mature Industry


June 03, 2015, 01:14:41 PM EDT
By Martin Tillier

For corporations, growth comes in many forms. Some companies, such as Google (GOOG, GOOGL) become dominant forces in industries that are destined for growth and their expansion is largely a function of the growth of the industry. Some, such as Amazon (AMZN), pursue growth at the expense of short-term profits, ruthlessly eliminating competitors to dominate an existing industry. In both of those cases, though, sector-wide growth is a contributing factor to the ultimate success of the strategy. Achieving exponential growth in a mature industry is significantly more difficult.There are some well-known examples, but usually they involve disruption of an accepted business model or a change in the basic product. Tesla (TSLA) would be a good example of that. Occasionally, you come across a company that achieves remarkable growth in a mature industry by simply being better than the competition and making smart decisions about expansion and acquisition. XPO Logistics (XPO) is one such company.XPO is a Greenwich, Connecticut based transportation logistics company. Their growth has been truly remarkable so far, from $158 million in revenue in 2010 to $2.46 billion last year, but according to CEO and Chairman Bradley Jacobs, that is just the beginning. In a statement on Monday detailing a $3.26 billion mixed equity and debt issue to raise capital, Jacobs described the company’s growth strategy as “...still in its early innings.” Given the performance over the last few years and analysts’ projections of 40 percent growth in the next year, those are scary words for the freight forwarding industry.When companies raise capital it is often a warning sign for investors. If, as in the case of many small oil exploration and production companies this year, it is to tide them through tough times. An equity issue can seriously dilute the existing stock, while issuing new debt adds to ongoing expenses. The fact that this news barely registered as a blip on XPO’s chart this week, then, indicates that investors have remarkable confidence in Jacobs and his team.That confidence is understandable, and fairly easily explained. Firstly, it doesn’t come as a surprise. XPO have announced two major acquisitions in the last few months. At the end of April they released plans to buy Norbert Dentressangle S.A. and then just a few days later revealed that they would be acquiring Bridge Terminal Transport Services, Inc. Incidentally, the scope and potential of the Dentressangle deal may be lost on many Americans, but as a European I am only too aware of the ubiquity of that company’s trucks on the other side of the pond.However, takeovers like that need capital, so news of new equity and debt was expected. It is a measure of confidence in the company that all of that new stock was purchased by existing shareholders and that Moody’s gave the new debt issue a B1 rating. In part, that is down to the track record of the CEO. Jacobs was the founder of United Waste Systems and co-founder of United Rentals, both of which adopted aggressive, but ultimately very successful growth by acquisition strategies. He clearly knows what he is doing here, a belief that is further evidenced by the timing of the deal. It took advantage of dollar strength before the exchange rate began to turn, adding value almost instantly.Sooner or later, of course, even the most aggressive growth company has to make money to make it all worthwhile, but if most estimates are to be believed that shouldn’t pose a problem for XPO. They are generally expected to move to profit later this year and the fact that a large part of the capital scheduled to be raised from the latest offering is to bolster the acquisition fund indicates that profitability can be maintained while still pursuing yet more growth in the future.For a growth strategy to be attractive to investors, one of two requirements must be met. It must have proven to be effective in the past, and there must be confidence in the ability of the management team to handle the rapid expansion. XPO meets both of those requirements, so, despite the stock doubling in the last year, the best may yet be to come.

Who is Who

Our organization

WT Logistics LLC
  Is a full service Logistics provider, Imports, Exports, DDP deliveries,
  port-to-port, domestic and international cargo, full customs services,
  warehousing and “virtual warehousing’ services, 3PL, and distribution.
WT Cargo LLC.
  Provider of Cargo Services. Registered and bonded with the “Federal
  Maritime Commission” (FMC) as Non Vessel Common Carrier Operator (NVOCC)
  and Ocean Freight Forwarder, also registered with the “FAA” as Air Freight
  Forwarder. Member of IATA, Air forwarders Association and CNS. Participates in C-TPAT and other
  security related programs with the Department of Homeland Security.
  Currently hold contracts with mayor ocean carriers and airlines with
  worldwide services. Areas on specialization are heavy cargo, oversized
  cargo, project cargo, frozen cargo and cargo requiring special handling.

With over 25 years in the market and wide experience in
transportation logistics and distribution, our main offices are located in Miami, Florida USA, just a few miles from the Miami International Airport, Port of Miami and Port Everglades (Fort Lauderdale). We service all the major Ports and Airports in the United States. 
By using the wide international network of partners and
service providers, worldwide, we offer services from any point of origin to
your destination: we provide services from and to all over the world.
Among our customers are manufacturers of capital goods,
consumer products, food and beverage, wholesalers, industrial equipment etc.
Our warehouse is equipped with state of the art information
systems as well of infrastructure allows us to handle the most diverse variety
of products.
Our Services

Our professionals offer their experience to advice and
handle the most difficult tasks, from large “one-time” projects to repetitive
services. 
In large projects, we have the experience of handling the
transportation door-to-door of large manufacturing plants, mining equipment,
truck fleets, oil rigs, large scale air conditioner units, tanks and in
general, large and heavy equipment that requires special handling, complex
coordination, professional planning and accurate execution. 
Our activities are oriented in four groups of customers:

Customers Located in the United States Importing from
  overseas.
Customers Located in the Unite States Exporting.
International Customers importing from the United States.
International Customers Exporting to the United States.

For each situation we have a group of professionals that
have the knowledge and experience to advise our customers the most economical
and efficient method to handle that operation.
From the origin to the destination.
Our customers count and rely in our services to
access the North American market and also for North American companies to
access their international customers, most frequently Latin America. We execute
their instructions and act as an extension of their operation in the market.
Importers to the United States usually request
the use of the INCOTERMS “DDP” (Duties,
Delivery Paid), in other words: door-to-door. The property of the imported good
is transferred to the buyer at his designated location. Our organization can
execute the complete process, including providing “Importer of record” and,
when required, represent the customer in the “FDA” (“Food and Drug
Administration”) registration process.
3PL Third Party Logistics

When optimizing the supply and demand, you often realize
that your customer needs do not mach with your ability to deliver. We can help
you closing this gap providing local warehousing and distribution, giving you
the sense of a “virtual warehouse” to fulfill your customer needs.
We can be as the “Importer or Records” or have your customer
to do so. We can, then, deliver your products “Just-In-Time”, access multiple
distribution centers or tailor the process as per your customer needs. We have
extensive experience in this area, ask us and our specialists will help you.
In exports, we can hold your inventory and proceed to ship
as needed; we will act and be like an extension of your operation.
Cross-Docking is a
logistics technique that eliminates the put away, storage, and order picking
functions of a warehouse while still allowing it to serve its receiving and shipping
functions. It enables firms to eliminate inventory costs and reduce
transportation costs, often at the same time.
Simply put, cross-docking moves imported product into
domestic equipment or moves domestic product into export equipment. It is becoming
more and more common in today’s logistics operations.
 
Handling of Pound or Products?

Maybe both…
The international flow of goods requires the use of multiple
steam-companies, airlines and other means of transportation.  The service is
measured by weight or by volume. The transport company product is the “box”,
“pallet” and/or the unit of transportation. The content is not their main
concern. We know that for you as a shipper or as a consignee, your concern is
your product. Our information systems as well the communication with our
customers is in their language and not in terms like “on-hands”, “airway bills”
or “bill-of-lading”. We keep track of all the references associated to the
cargo for future references.
Storage and Distribution

We service all the international Sea-ports and Airports in
the United States. We have access to distributions centers shipping and or
receiving products in the most convenient locations to minimize cost. We can
arrange and provide deliveries “JIT” (Just in Time) reducing inventory levels
and ate the same time, increase the level of service.
We can be you warehouse space in South Florida, secured,
accurate and professionally managed. See our warehouse offer.
What is Logistics?

That part of Supply chain process involving planning
implementation, efficient and effective flow of information and goods between a
point of origin and the point of consumption tailor-made according to customers
requirements
The difference between a logistic provider and a cargo
provider is that a good logistics provider deals with your “products”
and a cargo provider handles your pallets, kilos and volume. 
Our repetitive customers are the best proof that our service
is consistent and high quality. When requiring special handling and high
dedication, our group of professionals will be there to help you.
 
Consulting and Planning

Before you face a Supply Chain Management solution, a group
of professionals will analyze your needs and go through three basic steps:
Analysis
Will collect all the information about the current process,
taking notes on the strength and weakness, drawing the flow of goods, materials
and assessing the levels of information available,
Project
After the Analysis phase, we will design a working model
with your management and employees, proposing methods to optimize your current
process and placing you Supply Chain in a competitive and profitable stage.
Implementation
After the proposal approval, we will put our resources to
work, delivering the solution, coordinating the complex network that will
create the new optimized Supply Chain that will reduce your logistics cost.

Operations[edit]
XPO Logistics operates on a global scale as a third-party provider of end-to-end goods management. Its supply chain operations encompass approximately 1.5% of the $1 trillion transportation and logistics industry, including 63 members of the Fortune 100, making XPO one of the 10 largest providers of these services in the world.[11][12]
The company’s physical assets include 9,900 53-foot rail containers, another 8,000 chassis for transporting those containers by road, and 19,000 tractors and 47,000 trailers to haul goods.[12] It operates 438 cross-dock facilities to transfer freight from rail to road and back again, and 748 warehouses with more than 150 million square feet of space for e-commerce fulfillment; reverse logistics; omnichannel support; factory and aftermarket support; and integrated manufacturing, packaging, and distribution.[3]
XPO obtained most of its physical assets by acquiring a variety of companies within the supply chain arena. The diversity of their services has been cited as key to the company’s stability when the economy dips, or when factors like inclement weather impact specific modes of transportation, such as rail.[13] XPO makes additional capacity available to its customers through contracts covering 10,000 independently owned and operated trucks; and access to over one million brokered trucks supplied by approximately 50,000 independent carriers.[14]
XPO’s operations are part of the SmartWay Transport Partnership, a program administered by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Under the program, freight shippers, carriers, and logistics companies voluntarily collaborate to improve fuel efficiency and reduce emissions.[15]
Goods management[edit]
XPO Logistics provides end-to-end management through a variety of supply chain services, including contract logistics, freight brokerage, less-than-truckload transport, full truckload transport, last mile logistics, intermodal (rail) transport, drayage, expedited ground and air shipping, global freight forwarding, and managed transportation.[16]
Contract logistics[edit]
XPO is the second-largest global provider of contract logistics, which involves managing the non-transport handling of goods for other companies.[17] Its services include omni-channel and e-commerce fulfillment of orders; warehousing and distribution; the handling of returned goods (reverse logistics); supply chain optimization; and managed transportation. It provides these services in a number of sectors including retail, e-commerce, high tech, aerospace, telecom, food and beverage, healthcare, and agriculture.[18]
Freight brokerage[edit]
One of XPO's more prominent services in both North America and Europe is freight brokerage: the act of connecting road carriers with companies that need to ship raw material, parts, or finished goods. As a third-party logistics (3PL) provider, XPO brokers these connections, cutting costs for both shippers and carriers using a custom platform (See § Technology, below.), market intelligence, and carrier rankings based on their load profiles – the amount and types of goods they move.[19]
Less-than-truckload transport[edit]
XPO is one of the world’s largest providers of less-than-truckload (LTL) transport, which is the trucking of pallets to different destinations by using a hub-and-spoke distribution system. The company is the largest LTL carrier in Europe and the second-largest in North America.[6][20][21] Its network includes more next-day and two-day shipping lanes than any other North American provider.[22][23]
In combination with XPO’s other asset-heavy businesses, less-than-truckload transport represents approximately one third of the company’s total revenue.[24]
Last mile logistics[edit]
Last mile represents one of XPOʼs highest growth areas due to e-commerce, as consumers have been increasingly purchasing heavy goods online. The company facilitates over 12 million deliveries a year,[25] and in 2016 began rolling out last mile services in Europe.
Intermodal and drayage[edit]
XPO owns or leases 9,900 53-ft. intermodal boxes and 8,000 chassis to transport them by road. It operates a drayage network of 2,200 independent owner-operators, with access to over 25,000 additional trucks.[26] XPO's intermodal and drayage businesses have run on a custom platform called Rail Optimizer since 2015 (See § Technology, below.).
E-commerce fulfillment[edit]
With its acquisition of Norbert Dentressangle, XPO became Europe’s largest provider of e-commerce fulfillment – the processing and distribution of durable goods purchased online. Much of XPO’s high growth has been attributed to its engagement in e-commerce (which also encompasses reverse logistics) and the arranging of in-home (last mile) delivery of bulky items.[24] Retail/e-commerce is the company's largest end market, accounting for 26% of sales.[27]
Technology[edit]
XPO Logistics employs approximately 1,600 IT specialists and invested over $400 million in technology in 2016.[28] The company built Freight Optimizer and Rail Optimizer, two cloud-based platforms that use data mining to predict prices and optimize its network;[29] last-mile technology to manage customer experience in real-time;[30] and an expedite bid system to automatically match loads to carriers through a web-based auction portal.[31] XPO has also developed logistics technology – including advanced robotics – for omni-channel distribution, reverse logistics, transportation management, LEAN manufacturing support, aftermarket support, and supply chain optimization.[32][33]
History[edit]
XPO Logistics was founded in May 1989 by Michael Welch and Keith Avery as Express-1 (Express One) Expedited Solutions, which specialized in time-critical, high-value shipments.[34] The company was purchased in August 2004 by Segmentz, Inc., a transportation firm that traded publicly as NYSE AMEX: SZI.[35] In 2006, Segmentz changed its name to Express-1 Expedited Solutions, which had become its main operating unit, and began trading its stock under the new symbol XPO.[36]
In September 2011, American businessman Bradley Jacobs gained approximately 71 percent ownership[37][38] in Express-1 when he led an investment of up to $150 million through his firm Jacobs Private Equity LLC, which is XPO's largest stockholder.[39] He assumed the roles of chairman of the board and CEO, announced plans to move the company's headquarters from Michigan to Greenwich, CT, and changed its name to XPO Logistics.
In March 2012, XPO opened a national operations center in Charlotte, N.C.[40][41][42] with the help of a job development investment grant awarded by the North Carolina Economic Investment Committee.[43]
On June 14, 2012, XPO Logistics listed its shares on the New York Stock Exchange.[44]
In March 2013, the office of North Carolina Governor Pat McCrory announced that XPO's expansion of its national operations center would bring 287 new jobs to Charlotte within 21 months.[45][46]
On September 11, 2014, XPO announced an agreement with several investment organizations to channel $700 million into the company for future acquisitions.[47] On June 1, 2015, a larger group of global investors agreed to funnel an additional $1.26 billion of equity into XPO.[48][49]
In June 2016, XPO Logistics joined the Fortune 500 for the first time.[50] One month later, XPO was named the Fortune 500's fastest-growing company.[51]
XPO was ranked #17 among Forbes’ most innovative growth companies for 2016, and #263 among America’s best employers.[7]
Acquisitions[edit]
Since March 2012, XPO has acquired 17 companies through a combination of cash and stock transactions. According to the company, the goal of these acquisitions was to make XPO a one-stop shop for supply chain services across a variety of geographies and customer verticals.[52]
A number of these acquisitions were significant for expanding XPO’s role in various segments of the industry. On the following dates, XPO purchased these companies:

Operations[edit]
XPO Logistics operates on a global scale as a third-party provider of end-to-end goods management. Its supply chain operations encompass approximately 1.5% of the $1 trillion transportation and logistics industry, including 63 members of the Fortune 100, making XPO one of the 10 largest providers of these services in the world.[11][12]
The company’s physical assets include 9,900 53-foot rail containers, another 8,000 chassis for transporting those containers by road, and 19,000 tractors and 47,000 trailers to haul goods.[12] It operates 438 cross-dock facilities to transfer freight from rail to road and back again, and 748 warehouses with more than 150 million square feet of space for e-commerce fulfillment; reverse logistics; omnichannel support; factory and aftermarket support; and integrated manufacturing, packaging, and distribution.[3]
XPO obtained most of its physical assets by acquiring a variety of companies within the supply chain arena. The diversity of their services has been cited as key to the company’s stability when the economy dips, or when factors like inclement weather impact specific modes of transportation, such as rail.[13] XPO makes additional capacity available to its customers through contracts covering 10,000 independently owned and operated trucks; and access to over one million brokered trucks supplied by approximately 50,000 independent carriers.[14]
XPO’s operations are part of the SmartWay Transport Partnership, a program administered by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Under the program, freight shippers, carriers, and logistics companies voluntarily collaborate to improve fuel efficiency and reduce emissions.[15]
Goods management[edit]
XPO Logistics provides end-to-end management through a variety of supply chain services, including contract logistics, freight brokerage, less-than-truckload transport, full truckload transport, last mile logistics, intermodal (rail) transport, drayage, expedited ground and air shipping, global freight forwarding, and managed transportation.[16]
Contract logistics[edit]
XPO is the second-largest global provider of contract logistics, which involves managing the non-transport handling of goods for other companies.[17] Its services include omni-channel and e-commerce fulfillment of orders; warehousing and distribution; the handling of returned goods (reverse logistics); supply chain optimization; and managed transportation. It provides these services in a number of sectors including retail, e-commerce, high tech, aerospace, telecom, food and beverage, healthcare, and agriculture.[18]
Freight brokerage[edit]
One of XPO's more prominent services in both North America and Europe is freight brokerage: the act of connecting road carriers with companies that need to ship raw material, parts, or finished goods. As a third-party logistics (3PL) provider, XPO brokers these connections, cutting costs for both shippers and carriers using a custom platform (See § Technology, below.), market intelligence, and carrier rankings based on their load profiles – the amount and types of goods they move.[19]
Less-than-truckload transport[edit]
XPO is one of the world’s largest providers of less-than-truckload (LTL) transport, which is the trucking of pallets to different destinations by using a hub-and-spoke distribution system. The company is the largest LTL carrier in Europe and the second-largest in North America.[6][20][21] Its network includes more next-day and two-day shipping lanes than any other North American provider.[22][23]
In combination with XPO’s other asset-heavy businesses, less-than-truckload transport represents approximately one third of the company’s total revenue.[24]
Last mile logistics[edit]
Last mile represents one of XPOʼs highest growth areas due to e-commerce, as consumers have been increasingly purchasing heavy goods online. The company facilitates over 12 million deliveries a year,[25] and in 2016 began rolling out last mile services in Europe.
Intermodal and drayage[edit]
XPO owns or leases 9,900 53-ft. intermodal boxes and 8,000 chassis to transport them by road. It operates a drayage network of 2,200 independent owner-operators, with access to over 25,000 additional trucks.[26] XPO's intermodal and drayage businesses have run on a custom platform called Rail Optimizer since 2015 (See § Technology, below.).
E-commerce fulfillment[edit]
With its acquisition of Norbert Dentressangle, XPO became Europe’s largest provider of e-commerce fulfillment – the processing and distribution of durable goods purchased online. Much of XPO’s high growth has been attributed to its engagement in e-commerce (which also encompasses reverse logistics) and the arranging of in-home (last mile) delivery of bulky items.[24] Retail/e-commerce is the company's largest end market, accounting for 26% of sales.[27]
Technology[edit]
XPO Logistics employs approximately 1,600 IT specialists and invested over $400 million in technology in 2016.[28] The company built Freight Optimizer and Rail Optimizer, two cloud-based platforms that use data mining to predict prices and optimize its network;[29] last-mile technology to manage customer experience in real-time;[30] and an expedite bid system to automatically match loads to carriers through a web-based auction portal.[31] XPO has also developed logistics technology – including advanced robotics – for omni-channel distribution, reverse logistics, transportation management, LEAN manufacturing support, aftermarket support, and supply chain optimization.[32][33]
History[edit]
XPO Logistics was founded in May 1989 by Michael Welch and Keith Avery as Express-1 (Express One) Expedited Solutions, which specialized in time-critical, high-value shipments.[34] The company was purchased in August 2004 by Segmentz, Inc., a transportation firm that traded publicly as NYSE AMEX: SZI.[35] In 2006, Segmentz changed its name to Express-1 Expedited Solutions, which had become its main operating unit, and began trading its stock under the new symbol XPO.[36]
In September 2011, American businessman Bradley Jacobs gained approximately 71 percent ownership[37][38] in Express-1 when he led an investment of up to $150 million through his firm Jacobs Private Equity LLC, which is XPO's largest stockholder.[39] He assumed the roles of chairman of the board and CEO, announced plans to move the company's headquarters from Michigan to Greenwich, CT, and changed its name to XPO Logistics.
In March 2012, XPO opened a national operations center in Charlotte, N.C.[40][41][42] with the help of a job development investment grant awarded by the North Carolina Economic Investment Committee.[43]
On June 14, 2012, XPO Logistics listed its shares on the New York Stock Exchange.[44]
In March 2013, the office of North Carolina Governor Pat McCrory announced that XPO's expansion of its national operations center would bring 287 new jobs to Charlotte within 21 months.[45][46]
On September 11, 2014, XPO announced an agreement with several investment organizations to channel $700 million into the company for future acquisitions.[47] On June 1, 2015, a larger group of global investors agreed to funnel an additional $1.26 billion of equity into XPO.[48][49]
In June 2016, XPO Logistics joined the Fortune 500 for the first time.[50] One month later, XPO was named the Fortune 500's fastest-growing company.[51]
XPO was ranked #17 among Forbes’ most innovative growth companies for 2016, and #263 among America’s best employers.[7]
Acquisitions[edit]
Since March 2012, XPO has acquired 17 companies through a combination of cash and stock transactions. According to the company, the goal of these acquisitions was to make XPO a one-stop shop for supply chain services across a variety of geographies and customer verticals.[52]
A number of these acquisitions were significant for expanding XPO’s role in various segments of the industry. On the following dates, XPO purchased these companies:

August 16, 2013: 3PD, Inc., the largest heavy goods home delivery provider in North America.[53]
December 28, 2013: National Logistics Management (a Landstar System business), North America’s largest online manager of expedited shipments.[17]
March 31, 2014: Pacer International, Inc., the third-largest intermodal provider in North America and the leading provider of intermodal services between the U.S. and Mexico.[54][55][56]
September 2, 2014: New Breed Logistics, a large U.S. provider of contract logistics solutions for blue chip customers.[32][33]
June 8, 2015: French logistics group Norbert Dentressangle, a leading contract logistics provider in Europe and the owner-operator of the largest truck fleet in Europe.[20][21]
October 30, 2015: Con-way Inc., the second largest less-than-truckload transport provider in North America, with additional operations for global contract logistics, managed transportation, truckload and freight brokerage.[57][58][59]

Operations[edit]
XPO Logistics operates on a global scale as a third-party provider of end-to-end goods management. Its supply chain operations encompass approximately 1.5% of the $1 trillion transportation and logistics industry, including 63 members of the Fortune 100, making XPO one of the 10 largest providers of these services in the world.[11][12]
The company’s physical assets include 9,900 53-foot rail containers, another 8,000 chassis for transporting those containers by road, and 19,000 tractors and 47,000 trailers to haul goods.[12] It operates 438 cross-dock facilities to transfer freight from rail to road and back again, and 748 warehouses with more than 150 million square feet of space for e-commerce fulfillment; reverse logistics; omnichannel support; factory and aftermarket support; and integrated manufacturing, packaging, and distribution.[3]
XPO obtained most of its physical assets by acquiring a variety of companies within the supply chain arena. The diversity of their services has been cited as key to the company’s stability when the economy dips, or when factors like inclement weather impact specific modes of transportation, such as rail.[13] XPO makes additional capacity available to its customers through contracts covering 10,000 independently owned and operated trucks; and access to over one million brokered trucks supplied by approximately 50,000 independent carriers.[14]
XPO’s operations are part of the SmartWay Transport Partnership, a program administered by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Under the program, freight shippers, carriers, and logistics companies voluntarily collaborate to improve fuel efficiency and reduce emissions.[15]
Goods management[edit]
XPO Logistics provides end-to-end management through a variety of supply chain services, including contract logistics, freight brokerage, less-than-truckload transport, full truckload transport, last mile logistics, intermodal (rail) transport, drayage, expedited ground and air shipping, global freight forwarding, and managed transportation.[16]
Contract logistics[edit]
XPO is the second-largest global provider of contract logistics, which involves managing the non-transport handling of goods for other companies.[17] Its services include omni-channel and e-commerce fulfillment of orders; warehousing and distribution; the handling of returned goods (reverse logistics); supply chain optimization; and managed transportation. It provides these services in a number of sectors including retail, e-commerce, high tech, aerospace, telecom, food and beverage, healthcare, and agriculture.[18]
Freight brokerage[edit]
One of XPO's more prominent services in both North America and Europe is freight brokerage: the act of connecting road carriers with companies that need to ship raw material, parts, or finished goods. As a third-party logistics (3PL) provider, XPO brokers these connections, cutting costs for both shippers and carriers using a custom platform (See § Technology, below.), market intelligence, and carrier rankings based on their load profiles – the amount and types of goods they move.[19]
Less-than-truckload transport[edit]
XPO is one of the world’s largest providers of less-than-truckload (LTL) transport, which is the trucking of pallets to different destinations by using a hub-and-spoke distribution system. The company is the largest LTL carrier in Europe and the second-largest in North America.[6][20][21] Its network includes more next-day and two-day shipping lanes than any other North American provider.[22][23]
In combination with XPO’s other asset-heavy businesses, less-than-truckload transport represents approximately one third of the company’s total revenue.[24]
Last mile logistics[edit]
Last mile represents one of XPOʼs highest growth areas due to e-commerce, as consumers have been increasingly purchasing heavy goods online. The company facilitates over 12 million deliveries a year,[25] and in 2016 began rolling out last mile services in Europe.
Intermodal and drayage[edit]
XPO owns or leases 9,900 53-ft. intermodal boxes and 8,000 chassis to transport them by road. It operates a drayage network of 2,200 independent owner-operators, with access to over 25,000 additional trucks.[26] XPO's intermodal and drayage businesses have run on a custom platform called Rail Optimizer since 2015 (See § Technology, below.).
E-commerce fulfillment[edit]
With its acquisition of Norbert Dentressangle, XPO became Europe’s largest provider of e-commerce fulfillment – the processing and distribution of durable goods purchased online. Much of XPO’s high growth has been attributed to its engagement in e-commerce (which also encompasses reverse logistics) and the arranging of in-home (last mile) delivery of bulky items.[24] Retail/e-commerce is the company's largest end market, accounting for 26% of sales.[27]
Technology[edit]
XPO Logistics employs approximately 1,600 IT specialists and invested over $400 million in technology in 2016.[28] The company built Freight Optimizer and Rail Optimizer, two cloud-based platforms that use data mining to predict prices and optimize its network;[29] last-mile technology to manage customer experience in real-time;[30] and an expedite bid system to automatically match loads to carriers through a web-based auction portal.[31] XPO has also developed logistics technology – including advanced robotics – for omni-channel distribution, reverse logistics, transportation management, LEAN manufacturing support, aftermarket support, and supply chain optimization.[32][33]
History[edit]
XPO Logistics was founded in May 1989 by Michael Welch and Keith Avery as Express-1 (Express One) Expedited Solutions, which specialized in time-critical, high-value shipments.[34] The company was purchased in August 2004 by Segmentz, Inc., a transportation firm that traded publicly as NYSE AMEX: SZI.[35] In 2006, Segmentz changed its name to Express-1 Expedited Solutions, which had become its main operating unit, and began trading its stock under the new symbol XPO.[36]
In September 2011, American businessman Bradley Jacobs gained approximately 71 percent ownership[37][38] in Express-1 when he led an investment of up to $150 million through his firm Jacobs Private Equity LLC, which is XPO's largest stockholder.[39] He assumed the roles of chairman of the board and CEO, announced plans to move the company's headquarters from Michigan to Greenwich, CT, and changed its name to XPO Logistics.
In March 2012, XPO opened a national operations center in Charlotte, N.C.[40][41][42] with the help of a job development investment grant awarded by the North Carolina Economic Investment Committee.[43]
On June 14, 2012, XPO Logistics listed its shares on the New York Stock Exchange.[44]
In March 2013, the office of North Carolina Governor Pat McCrory announced that XPO's expansion of its national operations center would bring 287 new jobs to Charlotte within 21 months.[45][46]
On September 11, 2014, XPO announced an agreement with several investment organizations to channel $700 million into the company for future acquisitions.[47] On June 1, 2015, a larger group of global investors agreed to funnel an additional $1.26 billion of equity into XPO.[48][49]
In June 2016, XPO Logistics joined the Fortune 500 for the first time.[50] One month later, XPO was named the Fortune 500's fastest-growing company.[51]
XPO was ranked #17 among Forbes’ most innovative growth companies for 2016, and #263 among America’s best employers.[7]
Acquisitions[edit]
Since March 2012, XPO has acquired 17 companies through a combination of cash and stock transactions. According to the company, the goal of these acquisitions was to make XPO a one-stop shop for supply chain services across a variety of geographies and customer verticals.[52]
A number of these acquisitions were significant for expanding XPO’s role in various segments of the industry. On the following dates, XPO purchased these companies:

August 16, 2013: 3PD, Inc., the largest heavy goods home delivery provider in North America.[53]
December 28, 2013: National Logistics Management (a Landstar System business), North America’s largest online manager of expedited shipments.[17]
March 31, 2014: Pacer International, Inc., the third-largest intermodal provider in North America and the leading provider of intermodal services between the U.S. and Mexico.[54][55][56]
September 2, 2014: New Breed Logistics, a large U.S. provider of contract logistics solutions for blue chip customers.[32][33]
June 8, 2015: French logistics group Norbert Dentressangle, a leading contract logistics provider in Europe and the owner-operator of the largest truck fleet in Europe.[20][21]
October 30, 2015: Con-way Inc., the second largest less-than-truckload transport provider in North America, with additional operations for global contract logistics, managed transportation, truckload and freight brokerage.[57][58][59]

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion

Data Format: N-Triples RDF

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
