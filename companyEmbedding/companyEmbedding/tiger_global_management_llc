Tiger Global Management, which has risen to prominence by investing in start-ups, will change its leadership as two executives depart, the firm told investors in a letter on Monday.One of the firm’s investment heads, Feroz Dewan, will leave at the end of June to set up his own investment firm, according to the letter. Another partner, Caleb Watts, will also leave next month to focus on managing his fortune.The moves will lead to one of the biggest reorganizations at Tiger Global since its founding in 2001. Mr. Dewan, who joined the firm in 2003, oversaw its roughly $6 billion hedge fund business and led one of two “long-only” funds that invests in public stocks.With his departure, Scott Shleifer will assume control of all of Tiger Global’s public equity business, which manages roughly $10 billion in assets. Mr. Shleifer, one of the firm’s earliest employees, had previously co-led its $10 billion private equity business, which has invested in technology companies like Facebook and the Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba Group.

“Scott joined Tiger Global in 2002 and has been an integral decision maker and large and consistent profit generator in both our public and private equity funds for many years,” Tiger Global’s founder, Chase Coleman, wrote in the letter. Continue reading the main story

The private equity division’s other co-chief, Lee Fixel, will assume sole control of the unit.“Lee joined in 2006 and has played the leading role in our private equity investing efforts in recent years, specifically having spearheaded many of our most important and successful investments,” Mr. Coleman wrote.As part of the reorganization, Tiger Global said that it would combine its two long-only funds, merging the four-month-old Internet Opportunities fund into its Long Opportunities vehicle.

In the letter, the firm said that it realized that running so many public stock funds proved to be a challenge and that simplifying was the better answer.According to Tiger Global, both funds had been performing relatively well, with the Long Opportunities vehicle posting a 20 percent net investment return over the past 19 months and the Internet Opportunities fund returning 11 percent over its four months.“We regret that it took launching T.G.I.O. for us to fully appreciate this, and we apologize for the inconvenience,” Mr. Coleman wrote.As part of the reorganization, Tiger Global will let investors in its public equity funds withdraw their investments if they wish as of June 30.A spokeswoman for Tiger Global declined to comment on the letter.

   Hedge Fund Analysis-Hedge Funds-News  Tiger Global Discusses Priceline, Charter, Q2 Performance    Published on August 22, 2016 at 2:13 pm by  
                                Raymond Jones
                                  in Hedge Fund Analysis,Hedge Funds,News         Page 1 of 2Next &gt&gtSee All           Billionaire Chase Coleman‘s Tiger Global Management LLC recently released its 2016 second quarter investor letter, revealing the performance of its funds during that period. The Tiger Global (TGI) fund, which since inception has generated an average annual return of 18.3% (Net) and was down by 22.1% during the first quarter, managed to end the second quarter with a meager net gain of 0.8%. However, the onshore investors of its Tiger Global Long Opportunities (TGLO) fund were not as lucky. After losing 14.45% during the first quarter of 2016, the TGLO fund lost another 2.4% during the second quarter. Tiger Global is tackling its underperformance unflinchingly, expressing the following in its letter:  “At Tiger Global, two of our core cultural tenets are intellectual honesty and continuous improvement. We know there will be periods when we perform poorly and make mistakes, and we strive to be honest with ourselves and you, our investors, about what we have done well and what we have not. If there is a silver lining in negative performance, it is the opportunity to learn and improve. We believe that by continuously iterating, as we have in the past, we will become even stronger as an organization.”  According to Tiger Global’s 13F filing for the June 30 reporting period, its U.S. equity portfolio was worth $5.06 billion at the end of June, 27% less than what it was worth at the end of March. The filing also revealed that Tiger Global’s top-10 holdings accounted for almost 98% of its portfolio’s value and that a majority of those ten stocks were from the tech sector. In this article, we’ll see what Tiger Global had to say about some of its most prominent positions and discuss the 2016 performance of five key stocks in its portfolio. Through extensive research, we determined that imitating some of the picks of hedge funds and other institutional investors can help generate market-beating returns over the long run. The key is to focus on the small-cap picks of these investors, since they are usually less followed by the broader market and are less price-efficient. Our backtests that covered the period between 1999 and 2012, showed that following the 15 most popular small-caps among hedge funds can help a retail investor beat the market by an average of 95 basis points per month (see more details here).  #5 Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) – Shares Owned by Tiger Global Management LLC (as of June 30): 5.66 Million – Value of Holding (as of June 30): $616.58 Million Tiger Global initiated its stake in Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) during the final quarter of 2015, but has significantly reduced its holding in the company since then, bringing it down by 47% and 75% during the first and second quarters of 2016, respectively. The technology behemoth reported better than expected quarterly numbers last month, following which its stock has been on a consistent uptrend. Currently, investors and analysts are eagerly waiting for the company to launch the next iteration of its bestselling product, the iPhone, which is expected to be unveiled at an event next month. Although most analysts believe that the new iPhone models have the potential to bring the company back to solid growth, some of them think that, irrespective of the features or pricing of the new phones, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) will find it increasingly difficult to repeat the quarterly financial performances it has delivered in the past. On August 19, eminent tech analyst Gene Munster of Piper Jaffray released a note to his clients in which he reiterated his ‘Buy’ rating and $151 price target on Apple’s stock  and also highlighted that “in the next three years, the area where Apple can make the most impactful improvement is in battery life.” David Einhorn‘s Greenlight Capital reduced its stake in Apple by 17% to 6.85 million shares during the second quarter.

While the stock has managed to recoup some of those second quarter losses following its latest earnings release, it is still trading down by 20% year-to-date. For the second quarter, JD.Com Inc(ADR) (NASDAQ:JD) reported EPS of $0.29 on revenue of $9.80 billion, crushing analysts’ consensus earnings estimate of a loss of $0.03 per share, and being in-line with revenue estimates of $9.81 billion. Earlier this year, the company acquired Wal-Mart’s Chinese online marketplace, Yihaodian, by offering 5% of its float to Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (NYSE:WMT). However, analysts think that despite this partnership, JD.Com will find it increasingly difficult to compete against Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (NYSE:BABA), which has recently launched a major promotion in the hotly contested Chinese online grocery space. On August 13, analysts at Piper Jaffray reiterated their ‘Neutral’ rating and $27 price target on the stock. Philippe Laffont‘s Coatue Management reduced its stake in JD.Com by 8% to 19.7 million shares during the second quarter.

Atulit Shankar, Digital marketerAnswered 60w agoTiger Global Management is based out of New York and is run by Chase Coleman, III. Tiger Global Management is a hedge fund with 11-25 clients and discretionary assets under management (AUM) of $32,269,600,000 (Form ADV from 2016-03-30).Tiger Global by far has been one of the most successful hedge fund startup investor and when the first quarter was down by 22 percent the discussion in its investor report began with “Tiger Global had a poor first quarter”. Their last reported 13F filing for Q1 2016 included $6,933,873,000 in managed 13F securities and a top 10 holdings concentration of 90.45%. Tiger Global Management’s largest holding is Netflix Inc with shares held of 17,997,273 which returned -10.6%. The 13F portfolios was only down by 9.2% while only two-third of Tiger’s portfolios was invested in the top 5 companies. JD’s -17.9% return was on top of the table followed by Amazon’s -12.2% return and fortunately Apple’s return was 4% in which Tiger’s position size was $ 1.12 billion.What made things really worse for Tiger Global this year is the poor performance of its short book and the leverage it used. When a hedge fund’s long and short positions go against it, the leverage used by the hedge fund magnifies it losses. When a hedge fund makes money from both its short and long positions, the leverage used by the hedge fund will magnify its gains. This is totally expected and normal. Here is an excerpt from the letter about its shortsOn the short side, we continue to see compelling opportunities in a number of areas, including retail and consumer, technology, frauds and fads. The sharp sell-off in January and February was followed by a substantial reduction in short exposure in the broader markets. While several of our shorts went against us during this period, we believe the resulting divergence between stock prices and fundamentals has put us in a position to profit in the future. In fact, we have increased our exposure in several ideas as the reward-to-risk ratio has improved…This is not the first time hedge funds had a rocky first quarter, in fact for Tiger Global had around $16 Billion under management at the beginning of 2015, its on shore funding returns were -5.5% for the first three months into the year and ended up with 11.5% for the final quarter. A gain of 6.8% for the full year and a major part of this gain can be attributed to its commitment towards its long term portfolio ideas and the Q4 report statedWe felt we were seeing particularly attractive risk/reward opportunities in public companies relative to the private opportunities we had been evaluating, giving us more conviction to add to our largest ideas, particularly Amazon and Netflix. In China, JD has continued to report strong growth and market share gains…A small recap at the Tiger Cub’s glorious past would highlight why it is one of the most high valued hedge fund companies. Tiger Global Management returned 71 percent after fees in 2007. In fact, by the end of 2007 Tiger Global’s annualized return since inception was around 44%. Tiger Global lost 26% in 2008 and was up about 1% in 2009. Chase Coleman and his team returned 45% in 2011, 23% in 2012, 14% in 2013, and 17% in 2014.Read more at Tiger Global Beyond The Poor First Quarter Of 20162.5k Views · 2 UpvotesPromoted by Lighter CapitalLooking for a non-dilutive VC alternative?Lighter Capital has you covered with up to $2M in alternative funding for post-seed tech companies.Learn More at lightercapital.comView More AnswersRelated QuestionsHow does Tiger Global find investment opportunities in startups that are outside the US?Does Tiger Global have a stake in Facebook?How can I contact Kalyan Krishnamurthy from Tiger Global?Does the investment firm Tiger Global have a representative based in India?How does one get a job at Tiger Global?What is it like to work at Tiger Global?What is Tiger Global's investment strategy?How much has Tiger Global actually invested in India?What are the investment firms in India?How is it to work at Tiger Global Management?Related QuestionsHow does one get in touch with Tiger Global Management?Why did Tiger Global decide to fund Flipkart?
