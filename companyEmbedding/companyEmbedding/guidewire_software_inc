Guidewire Software Inc., commonly Guidewire, is a software publisher based in Foster City, California. It offers core back-end software for property and casualty (P&C) insurance carriers in the U.S. and worldwide,[1] as well as the Guidewire Live suite of online analytics services for P&C insurers.[2]
In September 2011, Guidewire filed with the SEC to raise up to $100 million in an initial public offering (IPO) and first publicly traded on the NYSE in January 2012.[3] Guidewire was later cited as being one of the top IPOs of 2012,[4] even #1.[5]
The company has been cited as being among the 50 most desirable mid-size Bay Area companies (101 to 500 employees) to work for 2010-2012, [6] and was in the "Top 50 Large Companies" in the Glassdoor Best places to work for both 2015 and 2016.[7]
Guidewire develops the Gosu programming language, it released as open source in 2010.
Business model[edit]
The company was established in 2001 founded by six people: Ken Branson, James Kwak, John Raguin, and Marcus Ryu from Ariba (and McKinsey, where James and Marcus had met); and John Seybold and Mark Shaw from Kana Software. They are a recurring revenue software company as they sell term licenses. Its three main software products are ClaimCenter, PolicyCenter, and BillingCenter, each servicing a major component of a P&C insurance carrier.[1] There are a number of add-on modules, as well as an increasing number of value-added online services provided via Guidewire Live.

            Hey there! Are you maybe looking for Firebase instead?

            







    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

22 GB gzip250 GB uncompressed

Download



The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.


RDF
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage.date> "2001-02"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#gYearMonth>  .

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.




Total triples: 63 million

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).

Guidewire Software Inc., commonly Guidewire, is a software publisher based in Foster City, California. It offers core back-end software for property and casualty (P&C) insurance carriers in the U.S. and worldwide,[1] as well as the Guidewire Live suite of online analytics services for P&C insurers.[2]
In September 2011, Guidewire filed with the SEC to raise up to $100 million in an initial public offering (IPO) and first publicly traded on the NYSE in January 2012.[3] Guidewire was later cited as being one of the top IPOs of 2012,[4] even #1.[5]
The company has been cited as being among the 50 most desirable mid-size Bay Area companies (101 to 500 employees) to work for 2010-2012, [6] and was in the "Top 50 Large Companies" in the Glassdoor Best places to work for both 2015 and 2016.[7]
Guidewire develops the Gosu programming language, it released as open source in 2010.
Business model[edit]
The company was established in 2001 founded by six people: Ken Branson, James Kwak, John Raguin, and Marcus Ryu from Ariba (and McKinsey, where James and Marcus had met); and John Seybold and Mark Shaw from Kana Software. They are a recurring revenue software company as they sell term licenses. Its three main software products are ClaimCenter, PolicyCenter, and BillingCenter, each servicing a major component of a P&C insurance carrier.[1] There are a number of add-on modules, as well as an increasing number of value-added online services provided via Guidewire Live.

Guidewire Software Inc., commonly Guidewire, is a software publisher based in Foster City, California. It offers core back-end software for property and casualty (P&C) insurance carriers in the U.S. and worldwide,[1] as well as the Guidewire Live suite of online analytics services for P&C insurers.[2]
In September 2011, Guidewire filed with the SEC to raise up to $100 million in an initial public offering (IPO) and first publicly traded on the NYSE in January 2012.[3] Guidewire was later cited as being one of the top IPOs of 2012,[4] even #1.[5]
The company has been cited as being among the 50 most desirable mid-size Bay Area companies (101 to 500 employees) to work for 2010-2012, [6] and was in the "Top 50 Large Companies" in the Glassdoor Best places to work for both 2015 and 2016.[7]
Guidewire develops the Gosu programming language, it released as open source in 2010.
Business model[edit]
The company was established in 2001 founded by six people: Ken Branson, James Kwak, John Raguin, and Marcus Ryu from Ariba (and McKinsey, where James and Marcus had met); and John Seybold and Mark Shaw from Kana Software. They are a recurring revenue software company as they sell term licenses. Its three main software products are ClaimCenter, PolicyCenter, and BillingCenter, each servicing a major component of a P&C insurance carrier.[1] There are a number of add-on modules, as well as an increasing number of value-added online services provided via Guidewire Live.

Guidewire Software Inc., commonly Guidewire, is a software publisher based in Foster City, California. It offers core back-end software for property and casualty (P&C) insurance carriers in the U.S. and worldwide,[1] as well as the Guidewire Live suite of online analytics services for P&C insurers.[2]
In September 2011, Guidewire filed with the SEC to raise up to $100 million in an initial public offering (IPO) and first publicly traded on the NYSE in January 2012.[3] Guidewire was later cited as being one of the top IPOs of 2012,[4] even #1.[5]
The company has been cited as being among the 50 most desirable mid-size Bay Area companies (101 to 500 employees) to work for 2010-2012, [6] and was in the "Top 50 Large Companies" in the Glassdoor Best places to work for both 2015 and 2016.[7]
Guidewire develops the Gosu programming language, it released as open source in 2010.
Business model[edit]
The company was established in 2001 founded by six people: Ken Branson, James Kwak, John Raguin, and Marcus Ryu from Ariba (and McKinsey, where James and Marcus had met); and John Seybold and Mark Shaw from Kana Software. They are a recurring revenue software company as they sell term licenses. Its three main software products are ClaimCenter, PolicyCenter, and BillingCenter, each servicing a major component of a P&C insurance carrier.[1] There are a number of add-on modules, as well as an increasing number of value-added online services provided via Guidewire Live.

    Perspectives  

    Read insights from Guidewire experts and customers.  























Optimizing Claims – A Win-Win for Insurers and Customers
The claims operations in most insurance companies are huge. It is also important to consider that a relatively small improvement in claims can translate into a significant increase in operating margin. Now this is not news to most insurers and over the past few years many have made a lot of enhancements in claims processes but there is still room for improvement and one answer is predictive analytics.

Guidewire Insight
                      Claims analytics can enhance the bottom line in many ways, including reducing settlement lags and claims payout, automatically assigning adjusters according to priority and skill set, and reducing leakage in terms of both expense and indemnity. One current customer experiencing this is commercial lines insurer Atlas Financial Holdings. In this blog, Stuart Rose, market strategy director for Guidewire Predictive  Analytics, identifies some of the benefits of predictive analytics in claims and how Atlas realized them.                    







The Engagement Era: Elevating the Work of Insurance
Insurance knowledge workers spend far too much of their time on repetitive, mundane work that offers little value to the policyholder or agent. Guidewire’s Value Consulting team has worked on more than 300 engagements over the last decade. Based on this experience, we estimate that 80% of workers’ time is spent on basic tasks and compliance

Guidewire Insight
                      In this third of a three-part series, Guidewire's Brian Desmond identifies another important outcome when insurers embrace the engagement era by using engagement era systems.  It is the potential to elevate the work of insurance. These systems offer myriad benefits to insurers, including the ability to gain time that can be invested in more strategic work so that knowledge workers can better apply their expertise and experience.                    







ITA Pro Magazine - June 2017 - 23
Even before the ball dropped to signal the start of 2017, it seemed obvious this year would be a wild ride. For those following the moves of our leading technology solution providers, it was difficult to keep up as mergers and acquisitions moved at a pace not seen for years. Throw in the influx of insurtech companies, the already crowded core-solutions market, and the threat of major technology companies hanging over the heads of everyone in the industry—solution providers and insurers—and there were more than enough issues to keep us thinking for months.

Guidewire Insight
                      "It’s difficult to be a core system technology company," says Guidewire CEO Marcus Ryu. "The functional footprint to have a minimal offering is substantial. You can go a long time before being rewarded. That’s a risk prospect. When we started Guidewire, we had more of an open field. It was difficult, but the competitive landscape now is less favorable for new entrants. Entrepreneurs interested in the industry are not generally looking to build a core system, but are looking at starting a new style of MGA or applying some horizontal technology in IoT, drones or machine learning and apply it to an insurance problem. That’s much more of the orientation we’ve seen." Ryu and other core system provider CEOs share their thoughts on today's market in this ITA article.

Optimizing Claims – A Win-Win for Insurers and Customers
The claims operations in most insurance companies are huge. It is also important to consider that a relatively small improvement in claims can translate into a significant increase in operating margin. Now this is not news to most insurers and over the past few years many have made a lot of enhancements in claims processes but there is still room for improvement and one answer is predictive analytics.

Guidewire Insight
                      Claims analytics can enhance the bottom line in many ways, including reducing settlement lags and claims payout, automatically assigning adjusters according to priority and skill set, and reducing leakage in terms of both expense and indemnity. One current customer experiencing this is commercial lines insurer Atlas Financial Holdings. In this blog, Stuart Rose, market strategy director for Guidewire Predictive  Analytics, identifies some of the benefits of predictive analytics in claims and how Atlas realized them.                    







The Engagement Era: Elevating the Work of Insurance
Insurance knowledge workers spend far too much of their time on repetitive, mundane work that offers little value to the policyholder or agent. Guidewire’s Value Consulting team has worked on more than 300 engagements over the last decade. Based on this experience, we estimate that 80% of workers’ time is spent on basic tasks and compliance

Guidewire Insight
                      In this third of a three-part series, Guidewire's Brian Desmond identifies another important outcome when insurers embrace the engagement era by using engagement era systems.  It is the potential to elevate the work of insurance. These systems offer myriad benefits to insurers, including the ability to gain time that can be invested in more strategic work so that knowledge workers can better apply their expertise and experience.                    







ITA Pro Magazine - June 2017 - 23
Even before the ball dropped to signal the start of 2017, it seemed obvious this year would be a wild ride. For those following the moves of our leading technology solution providers, it was difficult to keep up as mergers and acquisitions moved at a pace not seen for years. Throw in the influx of insurtech companies, the already crowded core-solutions market, and the threat of major technology companies hanging over the heads of everyone in the industry—solution providers and insurers—and there were more than enough issues to keep us thinking for months.

Guidewire Insight
                      "It’s difficult to be a core system technology company," says Guidewire CEO Marcus Ryu. "The functional footprint to have a minimal offering is substantial. You can go a long time before being rewarded. That’s a risk prospect. When we started Guidewire, we had more of an open field. It was difficult, but the competitive landscape now is less favorable for new entrants. Entrepreneurs interested in the industry are not generally looking to build a core system, but are looking at starting a new style of MGA or applying some horizontal technology in IoT, drones or machine learning and apply it to an insurance problem. That’s much more of the orientation we’ve seen." Ryu and other core system provider CEOs share their thoughts on today's market in this ITA article.

Optimizing Claims – A Win-Win for Insurers and Customers
The claims operations in most insurance companies are huge. It is also important to consider that a relatively small improvement in claims can translate into a significant increase in operating margin. Now this is not news to most insurers and over the past few years many have made a lot of enhancements in claims processes but there is still room for improvement and one answer is predictive analytics.

Guidewire Insight
                      Claims analytics can enhance the bottom line in many ways, including reducing settlement lags and claims payout, automatically assigning adjusters according to priority and skill set, and reducing leakage in terms of both expense and indemnity. One current customer experiencing this is commercial lines insurer Atlas Financial Holdings. In this blog, Stuart Rose, market strategy director for Guidewire Predictive  Analytics, identifies some of the benefits of predictive analytics in claims and how Atlas realized them.                    







The Engagement Era: Elevating the Work of Insurance
Insurance knowledge workers spend far too much of their time on repetitive, mundane work that offers little value to the policyholder or agent. Guidewire’s Value Consulting team has worked on more than 300 engagements over the last decade. Based on this experience, we estimate that 80% of workers’ time is spent on basic tasks and compliance

                      In this third of a three-part series, Guidewire's Brian Desmond identifies another important outcome when insurers embrace the engagement era by using engagement era systems.  It is the potential to elevate the work of insurance. These systems offer myriad benefits to insurers, including the ability to gain time that can be invested in more strategic work so that knowledge workers can better apply their expertise and experience.                    







ITA Pro Magazine - June 2017 - 23
Even before the ball dropped to signal the start of 2017, it seemed obvious this year would be a wild ride. For those following the moves of our leading technology solution providers, it was difficult to keep up as mergers and acquisitions moved at a pace not seen for years. Throw in the influx of insurtech companies, the already crowded core-solutions market, and the threat of major technology companies hanging over the heads of everyone in the industry—solution providers and insurers—and there were more than enough issues to keep us thinking for months.

Guidewire Insight
                      "It’s difficult to be a core system technology company," says Guidewire CEO Marcus Ryu. "The functional footprint to have a minimal offering is substantial. You can go a long time before being rewarded. That’s a risk prospect. When we started Guidewire, we had more of an open field. It was difficult, but the competitive landscape now is less favorable for new entrants. Entrepreneurs interested in the industry are not generally looking to build a core system, but are looking at starting a new style of MGA or applying some horizontal technology in IoT, drones or machine learning and apply it to an insurance problem. That’s much more of the orientation we’ve seen." Ryu and other core system provider CEOs share their thoughts on today's market in this ITA article.

Optimizing Claims – A Win-Win for Insurers and Customers
The claims operations in most insurance companies are huge. It is also important to consider that a relatively small improvement in claims can translate into a significant increase in operating margin. Now this is not news to most insurers and over the past few years many have made a lot of enhancements in claims processes but there is still room for improvement and one answer is predictive analytics.

Guidewire Insight
                      Claims analytics can enhance the bottom line in many ways, including reducing settlement lags and claims payout, automatically assigning adjusters according to priority and skill set, and reducing leakage in terms of both expense and indemnity. One current customer experiencing this is commercial lines insurer Atlas Financial Holdings. In this blog, Stuart Rose, market strategy director for Guidewire Predictive  Analytics, identifies some of the benefits of predictive analytics in claims and how Atlas realized them.                    







The Engagement Era: Elevating the Work of Insurance
Insurance knowledge workers spend far too much of their time on repetitive, mundane work that offers little value to the policyholder or agent. Guidewire’s Value Consulting team has worked on more than 300 engagements over the last decade. Based on this experience, we estimate that 80% of workers’ time is spent on basic tasks and compliance

It is the potential to elevate the work of insurance.

 Guidewire InsuranceSuite™ is a proven solution that promotes optimized insurance operations through insights derived from an engaged global customer community, and empowers employees, agents, and customers to respond and adapt to market change.
By providing a single source of truth for all customer, transactional, and financial data, InsuranceSuite:
Enables insurers to realize analytic insight and a true omnichannel experience across all distribution channels and all lines of business
Empowers insurers to quickly adapt their products and processes to achieve speed-to-market and invoke operational efficiencies and continual improvement across their organization
Enables profitable growth and the ability to capitalize on today's market opportunities and trends, including swift adoption of innovative technologies, delivering personalized product and service offerings, meeting increasingly heightened customer expectations, and addressing aggressive industry competition
We’ve designed InsuranceSuite using a modular approach based on a common technology platform covering the entire insurance lifecycle. Insurers can select and implement individual applications or a pre-integrated core system suite based on their specific requirements and priorities. This also maximizes flexibility for insurers to deploy and upgrade as they see fit. 
We also offer flexible deployment options, including the ability to deploy InsuranceSuite via a traditional on-premises approach or in private and public (and hybrid) cloud environments like Amazon Web Services (AWS) or Microsoft Azure. Alternatively, insurers can leverage a Guidewire InsuranceCloud Solutions partner to design a custom cloud solution.
InsuranceSuite provides a complete set of applications to support your core operations, and a platform that provides the deep functionality required to successfully and continually advance your products, processes, and customer relationships. InsuranceSuite supports your critical requirements—for all lines of business—and promotes sales, service, and underwriting excellence across your organization, while delivering the technology that you need to adapt and succeed in a time of rapid industry change.

Innovate with Digital Channels
Today, in nearly every major market, there is an overarching theme of enhancing customer journeys and providing digital capability. The rapid evolution of the customer as the driver of all things in the digital age has created a world where streamlined automation and self-service transactions across channels are a must and not merely "nice-to-haves."
