				Victoria D. Harker – Chief Financial Officer – Gannett Co.			

Posted on December 30, 2012 



Victoria D. Harker
Chief Financial Officer
Victoria D. Harker was appointed Chief Financial Officer (CFO) of Gannett Co. Inc. in July 2012, where she is responsible for all financial functions and operations worldwide.
Previously, Victoria was CFO and President of Global Business Services of the AES Corporation, a multinational power company with consolidated 2011 revenues of $17 billion and assets of $45 billion operating in 28 countries. She joined AES in 2006 where she successfully led the re-engineering of the company’s capital structure, financial reporting, and controls environment, returning it to Fortune #153 in 2008. While at AES, Victoria managed the Finance and Business Services operations worldwide, including Information Technology, Purchasing, Risk Oversight and Trading Operations.
Before joining AES, Victoria was the acting CFO and Treasurer of MCI from November 2002 through January 2006, and served as CFO of MCI Group, a unit of World Com Inc., from 1998 to 2002. Prior to this, Victoria also held several positions at MCI in Finance, Information Technology and Operations.
In addition, Victoria serves on the Board of Directors of Xylem, Inc. (formally ITT), a $4 billion global water infrastructure company, as Chair of the Audit Committee as well as a member of the Nominating, Governance and Compensation Committees. She also serves on the Finance and Audit committees of the Board of Directors of Darden Restaurants, Inc., the $10 billion parent of the Capital Grille, Olive Garden, Red Lobster, Seasons 52 and Bahama Breeze restaurants. She also is a member of the board of directors for Huntington Ingalls Industries.
Previously, Victoria served on the Advisory Boards of three AES subsidiary companies: Indianapolis Power & Light, $1.3B and Dayton Power and Light $4B, two midwest energy companies, and Gener S.A., a $3B co-generation business, currently the second largest energy producer in Chile.
On July 3, 2012, Victoria was appointed by Governor Robert F. McDonnell to the University of Virginia’s Board of Visitors. Previously, she was Chairman of the University of Virginia’s Board of Managers and served as both Investment and Audit Committee Chair. She is trustee of the UVA Foundation’s $250M Jefferson Trust. Victoria participates in the American University Advisory Council, is a member of The Economic Club of Washington, D.C., and an emeritus member of the Board of Wolftrap Foundation for the Performing Arts.
Victoria received her Bachelor of Arts degree, majoring in English, with a concentration in Economics, from the University of Virginia and a Master’s degree in Business Administration, with a concentration in Finance, from American University in Washington, DC. A two-time ironman triathlete, marathon runner and long distance swimmer, she lives in McLean, Virginia with her husband and three sons.
Her husband Drew Harker is a high powered lawyer with government contacts.
Her son Ethan is a soccer player over at Flint Hill Prep School.  Pretty nice digs if you can buy a ticket.  He’s a sophomore.  Here’s his Facebook page.
Here’s a map of her home.  It’s worth about $2.4 million.

                Victoria Harker has worked in the power industry, telecommunications industry and now in media as CFO of Gannett Co. Inc. The triathlete initially thought she would be a lawyer, but later went on to pursue an English degree. (Video by Emily Mekinc)

                Joanne S. Lawton            








 



Victoria Harker, an AES Corp. and MCI financial alum, leads all aspects of Gannett’s global finance and operations worldwide. The McLean giant, with $5.16 billion in 2013 revenue, is now a major player in TV affiliate ownership, in addition to its continuing place as a newspaper publisher.
Why the numbers business? Like many English majors I decided I was going to go to law school. I got a glimpse of what lawyers got to do all day long. I found the business end of it much more interesting than the legal end and thought there was much more to this. The law was not for me and business was much more intriguing and engaging

Joanne S. Lawton










 


So, it was an epiphany? In any service industry, you’re giving more narrow advice on a particular problem but you’re not necessarily part of the solution. Don’t just hand me a spreadsheet full of numbers. What does it mean?





What’s the funniest misconception you’ve heard about CFOs? Probably the frequency that people think I’m going to be male. I get a lot of things addressed to Victor or Mr. Harker. People also assume we don’t have a life outside of the numbers.
What’s your passion outside of the office? Bike and swim. I do a lot of that. I spend time with my corporate boards. I’m on the UVa. board as well. There’s a lot of demand for time outside of my kids. I try on different sports. I did the Chesapeake Bay swim a couple times, two Ironmans. Not fast. It’s endurance.
You’re a triathlete. What drew you to that sport? It’s endurance oriented, lots of Type A personalities, but you’re trying to reach a different goal. You’re connecting in a different environment and challenging yourself to see what’s possible.




 


Have you done the Ironman in Hawaii? I’ve done Florida and Arizona. I’m waiting to try to qualify for Hawaii in my 50s.
Were you athletic as a kid? I did long-distance running and softball. I like having the opportunity to work toward a goal with a group of people who are very like-minded but outside the people I interact with day to day. It’s a new distance, a new time, a new race, a new sport altogether. They’re all seeking to evolve themselves.

What’s next, race-wise? I’ve got the Sea Gull Century, then I’ll probably do another half-Ironman. I’m getting older and slower but I’m still doing them.
What’s the benefit of endurance racing? It gets you outside. It probably staves off the effects of aging. I think it’s as much mental as it is physical. I went through a period with financial crisis, with MCI buying WorldCom. Having the endurance sports really helped keep equilibrium for me. It’s a lot cheaper than therapy. I do find having that outlet has been a very mental health and mental strength enabler for me. It gives you a perspective. You know you can put one foot in front of the other. How hard can this be?

A closer look:
Age: 49
Education: Bachelor’s in English, concentration in economics, University of Virginia; MBA in finance, American University
Residence: McLean
Family: Husband Drew, a partner with Arnold & Porter LLP; three teenage sons; the older two are studying at UVa.
First job: My brother had a paper route. I used to be his bookkeeper, keeping track of his money. I was 12 or so.
