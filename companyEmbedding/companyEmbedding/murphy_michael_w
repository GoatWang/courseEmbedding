Michael W. Murphy
"The Sharp Experience means that the people of Sharp are focused on the special purpose of their work, how meaningful it is to patients and their families and the difference they make."
Mike Murphy is president and chief executive officer of Sharp HealthCare. Murphy oversees a workforce of more than 18,000 employees, 2,600 affiliated physicians and 2,100 volunteers. They provide care and service in a fully integrated not-for-profit system that includes four acute-care hospitals, three specialty hospitals, three affiliated medical groups, five urgent care centers, three skilled nursing facilities, home health, hospice, state-of-the-art outpatient facilities and a health plan.
Murphy, whose career in health care spans more than 30 years, was appointed to his position in June 1996. Under Murphy's direction, Sharp has dedicated itself to The Sharp Experience, which is transforming the health care experience for employees, physicians and customers. This focus on purpose, worthwhile work and making a difference has led to increased employee, physician and patient satisfaction, as well as enhanced loyalty and improved outcomes as Sharp strives to fulfill its vision of becoming the best place to work, practice medicine and receive care.
A Southern California native, Murphy is a graduate of California State University at Long Beach and is a certified public accountant. He served as chairman of the board of the Greater San Diego Regional Chamber of Commerce in 2005, and he is a member of the board of directors for the State of California Chamber of Commerce. Murphy is also a member and supporter of several community-based health and social service organizations.
