Premier Exhibitions Inc. Stock Downgraded (PRXI)






TheStreet Wire




Kevin Baker



Oct 11, 2013 11:10 AM EDT













 


























































  Editor's Note: Any reference to TheStreet Ratings and its underlying recommendation does not reflect the opinion of TheStreet, Inc. or any of its contributors including Jim Cramer or Stephanie Link.  NEW YORK ( TheStreet) -- Premier Exhibitions (Nasdaq: PRXI) has been downgraded by TheStreet Ratings from hold to sell. The company's weaknesses can be seen in multiple areas, such as its unimpressive growth in net income, weak operating cash flow and generally disappointing historical performance in the stock itself.   EXCLUSIVE OFFER: Jim Cramer's Protégé, Dave Peltier, only buys Stocks Under $10 that he thinks could potentially double. See what he's trading today with a 14-day FREE pass.   Highlights from the ratings report include:   The company, on the basis of change in net income from the same quarter one year ago, has significantly underperformed when compared to that of the S&P 500 and the Hotels, Restaurants & Leisure industry. The net income has significantly decreased by 102.3% when compared to the same quarter one year ago, falling from $2.68 million to -$0.06 million.   Net operating cash flow has significantly decreased to $0.49 million or 69.51% when compared to the same quarter last year. In addition, when comparing to the industry average, the firm's growth rate is much lower.   Despite any intermediate fluctuations, we have only bad news to report on this stock's performance over the last year: it has tumbled by 33.49%, worse than the S&P 500's performance. Consistent with the plunge in the stock price, the company's earnings per share are down 100.00% compared to the year-earlier quarter. Naturally, the overall market trend is bound to be a significant factor. However, in one sense, the stock's sharp decline last year is a positive for future investors, making it cheaper (in proportion to its earnings over the past year) than most other stocks in its industry. But due to other concerns, we feel the stock is still not a good buy right now.   The return on equity has improved slightly when compared to the same quarter one year prior. This can be construed as a modest strength in the organization. Compared to other companies in the Hotels, Restaurants & Leisure industry and the overall market, PREMIER EXHIBITIONS INC's return on equity significantly trails that of both the industry average and the S&P 500.   The gross profit margin for PREMIER EXHIBITIONS INC is rather high; currently it is at 51.21%. Regardless of PRXI's high profit margin, it has managed to decrease from the same period last year. Despite the mixed results of the gross profit margin, PRXI's net profit margin of -0.79% significantly underperformed when compared to the industry average.    Premier Exhibitions, Inc., together with its subsidiaries, engages in presenting museum-quality touring exhibitions to public worldwide. The company develops, deploys, operates, and presents exhibition products in exhibition centers, museums, and non-traditional venues. Premier Exhibitions has a market cap of $78.9 million and is part of the services sector and leisure industry. Shares are down 41% year to date as of the close of trading on Monday.  You can view the full Premier Exhibitions Ratings Report or get investment ideas from our investment research center.  STOCKS TO BUY: TheStreet Quant Ratings has identified a handful of stocks that can potentially TRIPLE in the next 12-months. Learn more..

Premier Exhibitions, Inc. Company Profile

   The
   
    Titanic
   
   was on her maiden trip when an iceberg hit the ship, and Premier Exhibitions is here to tell the tale. The company owns RMS Titanic, which salvages and displays artifacts from the doomed
   
    Titanic
   
   ocean liner, runs a touring
   
    Titanic
   
   exhibit, and sells
   
    Titanic
   
   merchandise. It is considered the salvor-in-possession, or owner, of the wrecked ship. Premier's other exhibits include "Bodies...The Exhibition" and "Bodies Revealed" (preserved bodies and organs) and "Dialog in the Dark" (exploring a world without sight). Premier was created as a holding company in 2004 when it spun off RMS Titanic. The company has announced plans to sell its
   
    Titanic
   
   holdings to focus on other tourning exhibits.

History[edit]
RMS Titanic Inc.[edit]
RMS Titanic Founder G. Michael Harris put the first Salvage Operation of the RMS Titanic in October 1986. The first Titanic expedition began in July 1987 and was financed by Titanic Ventures Limited Partnership, George Tulloch, Connecticut,and Oceanic Research & Exploration, G. Michael Harris, Florida. These co-partners led a $6 million expedition to the ship, and recovered artifacts 12,850 feet (3.92 km) beneath the surface of the North Atlantic. In order to recover these artifacts, George Tulloch, G. Michael Harris and their team completed 32 dives to Titanic in the “Nautile”, a deep-diving submersible chartered by Oceanic Research and Exploration in a partnership with Ifremer, the French Research Institute for Exploration of the Sea.[4] This is the greatest number of deep-sea dives ever completed for any televised project.[5][6] The company had an OTC ticker symbol of SOST.[7] In 1994 it won a Virginia court order to get salvor-in-possession rights to the ship.[citation needed]
Tulloch (August 6, 1944 – January 21, 2004), who had built up the largest BMW dealership in the United States and had an American Financial background, In 1992, the company, through a reverse merger, formed into RMS Titanic Inc. Tulloch co-lead operations on the Titanic in 1993, 1994, 1996, and 1998 along with G. Michael Harris who served on the Board of Directors as well as all aspects of the companies exhibition touring business. G. Michael Harris along with his team of experts also designed the traveling as well as the permanent Titanic Exhibitions worldwide.[8]
G. Michael Harris opened the first Permeant Titanic exhibition on April 10, 1999[9][when?] and is the largest, Titanic Exhibition in the world, located in Orlando, Florida and sold it to Premier Exhibitions in 2012. G. Michael Harris was the Expedition Leader in the summer of 2000 with over 120 hours on the wreck of the RMS Titanic and made 11 dives in the Russian Deep Diving Submersiable MIR1 & MIR2. Expedition 2000 was the last manned salvage dives on the RMS Titanic but was the most successful from an artifact recovery operations. Mr. Harris also found the now world-famous perfume bottles from the Titanic on August 2, 2000 in the Mir2 Russian Submersible along with Mr. Harris' Director of Operations, David Walker.
The television documentary “Return to the Titanic….LIVE”, hosted by Telly Savalas, was shown in 27 countries in 1987. A feature was the supposed live opening of the assistant purser's safe on television.[10]
RMS Titanic and Premier continue to be involved in litigation over the matter.[11]
1999 takeover[edit]
In 1999 founder G. Michael Harris (Belleair, Florida), Arnie Geller (Atlanta, Georgia)and music promoter Joseph B. Marsh (who handled tours for Janet Jackson, David Copperfield, and Fleetwood Mac) led a takeover and ousting of Tulloch.[12]
Arnie Geller was installed as President and CEO of the company and G. Michael Harris was installed as Chief Operating Officer as well as Secretary of the Corporation RMS Titanic, Inc. G. Michael Harris and Arnold Geller fired all officers and Directors and were the only two remaining Directors of the Company.[13] Mr. John Joslyn was a small shareholder of RMST and took part in the Takeover of the Company in 1999.[14]
Bodies[edit]
In October 2004, the company changed its name to Premier Exhibitions and changed its ticker symbol to initially to PXHB on the OTC, after it branched out with the Bodies exhibition after it acquired the The Universe Within Touring Company, LLC.[15]
The Body exhibits is now the primary money maker for the firm with presenting 19 separate human anatomy exhibitions at 33 venues while the Titanic is on exhibit at 15 locations in 2009.[15]
In 2009 the company reported that 19% of its revenue comes from Titanic and 67% from Bodies with the rest among its other exhibitions.[2]
The Body exhibits have generated considerable controversy over their appropriateness and questioning the practice of selling cadavers for public display without family permission.[1]
The company changed its ticker symbol again to PRXI when it was listed on NASDAQ. New ticker symbol is PRXIQ
2009[edit]
In 2009 its other exhibits include "Dialog in the Dark" in which visitors pass through an exhibit totally without light.[16] and Star Trek: The Exhibition.[17]
2016[edit]
On June 14, 2016, it filed for bankruptcy pursuant to chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code[18]
RMS Titanic Inc.[edit]
RMS Titanic Inc. has been the wreck's legal salvager since 1994. Starting in 2009 they changed their approach to that of closer co-operation with Titanic preservation and regulatory bodies, an approach in place circa 2012.[19]

The first Titanic expedition began in July 1987 and was financed by Titanic Ventures Limited Partnership, George Tulloch, Connecticut,and Oceanic Research & Exploration, G. Michael Harris, Florida. These co-partners led a $6 million expedition to the ship, and recovered artifacts 12,850 feet (3.92 km) beneath the surface of the North Atlantic. In order to recover these artifacts, George Tulloch, G. Michael Harris and their team completed 32 dives to Titanic in the “Nautile”, a deep-diving submersible chartered by Oceanic Research and Exploration in a partnership with Ifremer, the French Research Institute for Exploration of the Sea.[4] This is the greatest number of deep-sea dives ever completed for any televised project.[5][6] The company had an OTC ticker symbol of SOST.[7] In 1994 it won a Virginia court order to get salvor-in-possession rights to the ship.[citation needed]

The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.
