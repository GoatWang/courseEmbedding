System and method for cell planning in a wireless communication network



Patent number:  7995529
                                            

Abstract:  A cellular network having a plurality of mobile stations and a plurality of cells. Each cell is configured to provide communication services to the plurality of mobile stations using at least two overlapping channels. Each cell includes a base station configured to provide communication services using at least four channels, which include the overlapping channels, within a service area divided into three or four sectors. The service area may be hexagonal or square shaped. A first pair of the four channels has an overlapping portion. A second pair of the four channels, the channels of the second pair being different channels than those of the first pair, may also have an overlapping portion. The four channels may each comprise a portion of an Educational Broadband Service/Broadcast Radio Services band. The first and second pairs of channels may be nonadjacent to one another.

SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR CELL PLANNING IN A WIRELESS COMMUNICATION NETWORK



Publication number:  20080318585
                                            

Abstract:  A cellular network having a plurality of mobile stations and a plurality of cells. Each cell is configured to provide communication services to the plurality of mobile stations using at least two overlapping channels. Each cell includes a base station configured to provide communication services using at least four channels, which include the overlapping channels, within a service area divided into three or four sectors. The service area may be hexagonal or square shaped. A first pair of the four channels has an overlapping portion. A second pair of the four channels, the channels of the second pair being different channels than those of the first pair, may also have an overlapping portion. The four channels may each comprise a portion of an Educational Broadband Service/Broadcast Radio Services band. The first and second pairs of channels may be nonadjacent to one another.

SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR CONDENSED FREQUENCY REUSE IN A WIRELESS COMMUNICATION SYSTEM



Publication number:  20080240032
                                            

Abstract:  A legacy spectrum allocation results in inefficient use of the spectrum now allocated to broadband services. A broadband wireless OFDMA communication system allocates channels with overlap between adjacent channels to make more efficient use of the allocated spectrum. Guard tones are eliminated to reduce channel bandwidth requirements leaving a smaller bandwidth overlap. Interference mitigation procedures are used to reduce adjacent channel interference.

Method for providing remote emulation of the functionality of a private exchange



Patent number:  6229885
                                            

Abstract:  A method facilitates providing private exchange functionality to a subscriber that is remote from the private network. In the private network, telephones connected thereto can be accessed via extension dialing. The remote subscriber can dial the extension of a second telephone connected to said private network. A local exchange receives the extension and translates it into a phone number for the second telephone. The local exchange then uses the phone number to establish a connection between the subscriber and the second telephone. The same method can be used to implement remote speed dialing and automatic callback through the private network.

Method and apparatus for locating a mobile station by comparing calculated location area with GPS coordinates



Patent number:  5724660
                                            

Abstract:  A method and apparatus for determining the location of a mobile telephone within the serving area of a mobile telephone system. A mobile switching center analyzes the calling mobile telephone number and called telephone number to determine if a location function is required. Upon initiation of the location function by the mobile switching center, a mobile location module calculates a location estimate of the mobile telephone. The mobile location module receives a list of signal strengths received by the mobile telephone from cell site antennas within the serving area. The distance between the mobile telephone and a plurality of cell site antennas is calculated using a technique which reduces the error component of the calculated distances. These reduced error distances are used to geometrically determine an estimate of the location area.
