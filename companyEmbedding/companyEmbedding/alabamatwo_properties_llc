Because our company was created by experienced attorneys, we strive to be the best legal document service on the web. If you are not satisfied with our services, please contact us immediately and we will correct the situation, provide a refund or offer credit that can be used for future LegalZoom orders.
LegalZoom Satisfaction Guarantee Details:

If you're not satisfied, simply call us toll-free at (800) 773-0888 during our normal business hours. All requests made under this guarantee must be made within 60 days of purchase. We will process your request within 5 business days after we've received all of the documents and materials sent to you. Unfortunately, we can't refund or credit any money paid to government entities, such as filing fees or taxes, or to other third parties with a role in processing your order. We also cannot refund any money paid by you directly to third parties, such as payments made by you directly to attorneys affiliated with our legal plans or attorney-assisted products.
If you want to exchange the product you ordered for a different one, you must request this exchange and complete your replacement order within 60 days of purchase. The purchase price of the original item, less any money paid to government entities, such as filing fees or taxes, or to other third parties with a role in processing your order, will be credited to your LegalZoom account. Any payments made directly by you to attorneys affiliated with our legal plans or attorney-assisted products are not eligible for exchange or credit. Any price difference between the original order and the replacement order or, if a replacement order is not completed within 60 days of purchase, the full original purchase price (in each case less any money paid to government entities or other third parties) will be credited to the original form of payment. If you paid for your original order by check, LegalZoom will mail a check for the applicable amount to your billing address.
Please note that we cannot guarantee the results or outcome of your particular procedure. For instance, the government may reject a trademark application for legal reasons beyond the scope of LegalZoom's service. In some cases, a government backlog can lead to long delays before your process is complete. Similarly, LegalZoom does not guarantee the results or outcomes of the services rendered by our legal plan attorneys or attorney-assisted products. Problems like these are beyond our control and are not covered by this guarantee.
Since we're dedicating time and effort to your legal document preparation, our guarantee only covers satisfaction issues caused by LegalZoom - not changes to your situation or your state of mind.

Corporations Compared to LLCs









Knowledge Center&rtrif;Corporation&rtrif;Corporations Compared to LLCs 













        Corporations Compared to LLCs      
Limited liability companies (LLCs) are one of the newest types of business entities. Like corporations, they offer many benefits over partnerships and sole proprietorships. Whether an LLC or a corporation is better for a small business depends on the type of business. The best comparison here is between an LLC and an S corporation, because an LLC can choose to be taxed as an S corporation.
Social Security Taxes
The owners of the S corporation can take out some profits without Social Security taxes. For a large business in which the owners take out salaries of $118,500 or more plus profits, there would not be much difference, since the Social Security tax cuts out at that level as of 2015. However, for a smaller business, in which an owner could take out a $30,000 salary and $20,000 profit, the extra taxes on the $20,000 would be over $3,000.
Raising Money
If a corporation plans to go public or sell stock to a large group of people, the corporate stock might be easier to sell than membership interests in the LLC.
Liability Protection
An important advantage of an LLC is that in some states, a creditor cannot collect the members’ LLC distributions. With a corporation, creditors cannot collect a shareholder’s personal assets, but can collect the shareholder’s dividends.
Profits, Losses, and Taxes
The other advantages of LLCs are found in certain tax situations. For example, an LLC can make special allocations of profits and losses among members, whereas S corporations cannot. S corporations must have one class of ownership in which profits and losses are allocated according to the percentage ownership. In an LLC, money borrowed by the company can increase the tax basis (and lower the taxes) of the owners, whereas in an S corporation, it does not. Contributing property to set up an LLC is not taxable, even for minority interest owners, whereas for a corporation, regulations only allow it to be tax­ free for the contributors who have control of the business.
Foreign Ownership
The owners of an LLC can be foreign persons, other corporations, or any kind of trust, whereas the owners of S corporations cannot. An LLC may have an unlimited number of members, while an S corporation is limited to one hundred.
Management Options
LLCs are also popular because of their flexible management options, allowing owners to directly managed the business or have others handle the day to day operations. LLCs have fewer formalities than corporations, another advantage for some business owners.
Fringe Benefits
Corporations offer a greater variety of fringe benefit plans than any other business entity. Various retirement, stock option and employee stock purchase plans are available only for corporations. Plus, sole proprietors, partners and employees owning more than 2% of an S corporation must pay taxes on fringe benefits (such as group-term life insurance, medical reimbursement plans, medical insurance premiums and parking). Shareholder-employees of a C corporation do not have to pay taxes on these benefits.

LLCs and Real Property - Benefits and Pitfalls


Do LLCs work well to hold title to and deal in real property? Here are some benefits and potential pitfalls.
Benefit: They insulate property owners from personal liability
Pitfalls: The LLC normally protects the personal assets of the members from slip-and-fall and other on-site tort claims, as well as protects them from contract and transactional claims related to the property. However, the LLC should get commercial insurance to protect its big asset, the property itself, from being subject to claims made directly against the LLC. And don't forget that any sensible lender (and many have come to their senses following the subprime credit slide) will require the personal guarantees of LLC members when they finance property owned by the LLC. In other words, the members will be personally liable for the loan - their LLC's limited liability protection will not insulate them from this major liability.
Benefit: Property can easily be placed in an LLC
Pitfalls: You can transfer title to an LLC in minutes--the forms are short and clear. But don't forget that most existing property loans require you to obtain the consent of the current lender before you transfer ownership to another person or legal entity. And most will NOT agree, because they want to re-qualify the new entity as a borrower (and possibly charge new loan origination points and a higher interest rate). Anticipating your lender's firm "No," before you make the transfer you must make sure you can refinance, by paying off the current loan and taking out another in the name of the LLC. And, as mentioned above, the LLC members probably will have to personally guarantee the new loan. So a transfer may not be worth it. Also, a transfer of property to an LLC may have significant collateral effects, such as triggering a real property tax reassessment at the property's current market value. You may also face potential tax issues to deal with (more on this below).
Benefit: Property can be transferred into and out of an LLC tax-free
Pitfalls. Transfers of property into and out of an LLC are free of IMMEDIATE tax consequences. But what this really means is that taxes that would normally be due on gain built into the property are only DEFERRED until later when the property or the LLC is sold. The magic that makes this tax-deferral happen is a complicated set of rules that adjust the members' and the LLC's basis in the property and the members' interests. The downside is that it takes an expert tax advisor who is steeped in LLC taxes to get this to happen correctly. And, of course, there are plenty of gotcha's that can come up to make many transfers of property into and out of an LLC immediately taxable. Another big potential wrinkle is the set of tax rules that applies to encumbered property--that is, property subject to a debt. Since most real property is subject to a first mortgage, and maybe even a second note or a line of credit, this is a big wrinkle. The tax rules that apply to property loans require additional adjustments to the basis of the LLC and its members, and these adjustments have to be continuously made as the loans are paid off. In other words, expect more complications, and the need for more tax help, if the property is leveraged (subject to debt).
Benefit: The series LLC is ideal for property-development LLCs
Pitfalls: Delaware, Nevada and other states have enacted special sections of their LLC law to allow the formation of special "series" LLCs. Separate assets, such as separate parcels of real estate, can be isolated behind separate legal and tax firewalls within one series LLC. Each asset is subject to its own liabilities, but not those of the other assets in the series LLC. In other words, a real property developer can create one series LLC for a multi-property development project, and keep each property's liability status isolated from the other properties in the LLC, even if they share a common membership and management structure. Further, because the properties are not owned by separate legal entities, each may qualify under the federal tax law for like-kind exchange treatment--that is, the ability to swap one for the other without incurring a tax bill. Sounds too good to be true, doesn't it: A form of state-sanctioned smoke and mirrors? It may be ... and it may be best to take a wait-and-see approach to make sure state courts and the IRS approve of these series LLC statutes and tax-transfer tactics. A downside of setting up a series LLC is its complexity: It requires a separate set of financial books for each series LLC asset, and you may have to set one up in a state that is different from the one where the property is located. Setting up an out-of-state series LLC raises additional "home-vs.-foreign" state legal and tax issues--for example, how will your home state treat and tax your out-of-state series LLC income and loss allocations on each property? You'll need expert tax help from someone who is familiar with series LLCs.
Benefit: Putting property in an LLC places it out of reach of personal creditors
Pitfalls: An interest in an LLC is personal property that may be subject to attachment and liquidation by creditors. The LLC statutes of each state give creditors various rights to obtain charging orders, which are formal court orders to seize the economic rights associated with an LLC interest. If this happens, the creditor steps into the shoes of an LLC member and collects the member's share of LLC profits and property as they are paid out by the LLC. Some states also allow LLC creditors to exercise the debtor's LLC voting rights, which makes the creditor a substitute member in the LLC. Finally, some states go whole-hog and let a creditor petition a court to force a sale and liquidation of the LLC's property to pay off the creditor's claim immediately. Obviously, it's important to explore LLC state charging order and creditor-rights rules if you want to satisfy yourself that your interest in your LLC's property is beyond the grasp or at least realistically out of reach of your personal creditors.

Is my loan guaranteed in any way? 
Yes. Your PLUS loan is authorized in Part B of Title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended (the "FFELP" program). Under the PLUS loan program, you can obtain low-cost student loans to help pay for the cost of higher education. The PLUS loan is made to parents of eligible students or to graduate students by lenders. The lender cannot require you to provide collateral for the loan. To protect the lender from loss in the event of the borrower's death, disability, bankruptcy, or default, the loan is guaranteed by a guarantor. In certain circumstances, the lender also is protected if the student attends a school that closes or if the school falsely certifies the borrower's loan. Guarantors are reinsured by the U.S. Department of Education for all or part of the amount of the default claims it pays to lenders.

As for the charging order, certain states (I am aware of Delaware and Nevada) limit charging orders to the assets of the member. Further, they are not a very useful debt collection tool as the creditor does not have a voting/control interest and has only a right to payment via an economic interest at some uncertain date, without any ability to determine when the judgment will be paid off since they cannot force the sale of the membership interest (under most state laws and a good operating agreement). Most creditors simply settle with the debtor-member rather than pursue the charging order remedy.

WINTER PARK, Fla., Oct. 8, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Elevation Financial Group, LLC announces the acquisition of two multifamily properties, located in Montgomery, Alabama, for a purchase price of $6.8 million. The portfolio purchase includes Olympia Heights Townhome Apartments, a 202-unit apartment community consisting of 1, 2 and 3-bedroom two-story townhome-style residences and Cyprus Court Apartments, a 176-unit apartment community also consisting of 1, 2 and 3-bedroom two-story garden-style units. Aligning with Elevation's branding strategy, Cyprus Court Apartments will be renamed Serenity Apartments® at the Park and Olympia Heights will be renamed Serenity Townhomes at Montgomery. 
The continued deployment of investor capital from its subsidiary, Elevation Real Property Fund V, LLC, supports Elevation's expansion and presence in the Southeastern region. Both properties are located in the reviving Southeast sector of the Montgomery Loop, an area that has garnered significant attention from city government and local businesses for redevelopment and community investment. 
"This portfolio acquisition represents a wonderful value-add opportunity for our fifth fund and establishes a significant presence and base of operations in Alabama.  We look forward to dramatically revitalizing the physical assets while providing a higher level of quality and service to the residents," said Chris King, CEO of Elevation Financial Group.
Supporting its mission to provide clean, safe and affordable housing, Elevation will undertake extensive renovations to the common areas, amenities and units of both communities. Serenity Townhomes at Montgomery will undergo a comprehensive revitalization to the apartment exteriors, clubhouse pool, and grounds as well as significant interior renovations and upgrades to the units. At Serenity Apartments at the Park, Elevation has recognized the lack of amenities for families and children and in addition to planned renovations to the unit interiors and exteriors will build a park complete with a playground, soccer field and running track. 
The properties will be professionally managed by Elevation Property Management, LLC, an affiliate of Elevation Financial Group with a management portfolio in excess of 2,500 units covering five Southern states.

In addition to certain guarantees provided by law, LegalZoom guarantees your satisfaction with our services and support. Because our company was created by experienced attorneys, we strive to be the best legal document service on the web. If you are not satisfied with our services, please contact us immediately and we will correct the situation, provide a refund or offer credit that can be used for future LegalZoom orders.
LegalZoom Satisfaction Guarantee Details:

If you're not satisfied, simply call us toll-free at (800) 773-0888 during our normal business hours. All requests made under this guarantee must be made within 60 days of purchase. We will process your request within 5 business days after we've received all of the documents and materials sent to you. Unfortunately, we can't refund or credit any money paid to government entities, such as filing fees or taxes, or to other third parties with a role in processing your order. We also cannot refund any money paid by you directly to third parties, such as payments made by you directly to attorneys affiliated with our legal plans or attorney-assisted products.
If you want to exchange the product you ordered for a different one, you must request this exchange and complete your replacement order within 60 days of purchase. The purchase price of the original item, less any money paid to government entities, such as filing fees or taxes, or to other third parties with a role in processing your order, will be credited to your LegalZoom account. Any payments made directly by you to attorneys affiliated with our legal plans or attorney-assisted products are not eligible for exchange or credit. Any price difference between the original order and the replacement order or, if a replacement order is not completed within 60 days of purchase, the full original purchase price (in each case less any money paid to government entities or other third parties) will be credited to the original form of payment. If you paid for your original order by check, LegalZoom will mail a check for the applicable amount to your billing address.
Please note that we cannot guarantee the results or outcome of your particular procedure. For instance, the government may reject a trademark application for legal reasons beyond the scope of LegalZoom's service. In some cases, a government backlog can lead to long delays before your process is complete. Similarly, LegalZoom does not guarantee the results or outcomes of the services rendered by our legal plan attorneys or attorney-assisted products. Problems like these are beyond our control and are not covered by this guarantee.
Since we're dedicating time and effort to your legal document preparation, our guarantee only covers satisfaction issues caused by LegalZoom - not changes to your situation or your state of mind.

Corporations Compared to LLCs









Knowledge Center&rtrif;Corporation&rtrif;Corporations Compared to LLCs 













        Corporations Compared to LLCs      
Limited liability companies (LLCs) are one of the newest types of business entities. Like corporations, they offer many benefits over partnerships and sole proprietorships. Whether an LLC or a corporation is better for a small business depends on the type of business. The best comparison here is between an LLC and an S corporation, because an LLC can choose to be taxed as an S corporation.
Social Security Taxes
The owners of the S corporation can take out some profits without Social Security taxes. For a large business in which the owners take out salaries of $118,500 or more plus profits, there would not be much difference, since the Social Security tax cuts out at that level as of 2015. However, for a smaller business, in which an owner could take out a $30,000 salary and $20,000 profit, the extra taxes on the $20,000 would be over $3,000.
Raising Money
If a corporation plans to go public or sell stock to a large group of people, the corporate stock might be easier to sell than membership interests in the LLC.
Liability Protection
An important advantage of an LLC is that in some states, a creditor cannot collect the members’ LLC distributions. With a corporation, creditors cannot collect a shareholder’s personal assets, but can collect the shareholder’s dividends.
Profits, Losses, and Taxes
The other advantages of LLCs are found in certain tax situations. For example, an LLC can make special allocations of profits and losses among members, whereas S corporations cannot. S corporations must have one class of ownership in which profits and losses are allocated according to the percentage ownership. In an LLC, money borrowed by the company can increase the tax basis (and lower the taxes) of the owners, whereas in an S corporation, it does not. Contributing property to set up an LLC is not taxable, even for minority interest owners, whereas for a corporation, regulations only allow it to be tax­ free for the contributors who have control of the business.
Foreign Ownership
The owners of an LLC can be foreign persons, other corporations, or any kind of trust, whereas the owners of S corporations cannot. An LLC may have an unlimited number of members, while an S corporation is limited to one hundred.
Management Options
LLCs are also popular because of their flexible management options, allowing owners to directly managed the business or have others handle the day to day operations. LLCs have fewer formalities than corporations, another advantage for some business owners.
Fringe Benefits
Corporations offer a greater variety of fringe benefit plans than any other business entity. Various retirement, stock option and employee stock purchase plans are available only for corporations. Plus, sole proprietors, partners and employees owning more than 2% of an S corporation must pay taxes on fringe benefits (such as group-term life insurance, medical reimbursement plans, medical insurance premiums and parking). Shareholder-employees of a C corporation do not have to pay taxes on these benefits.
