 Career History



Chief Information Officer

                                    2009 - Current                


Grand Canyon Education, Inc.


                  Grand Canyon Education, Inc. is a regionally accredited provider of postsecondary education services focused on offering graduate and undergraduate degree programs in its core disciplines of education, healthcare, business, and liberal arts. The company offers programs online, on ground at campus in Phoenix, Arizona, and onsite at facilities it leases and at facilities owned by third party employers. Grand Canyon Education was founded by Christopher C. Richardson and Brent D. Richardson in November 2003 and is headquartered in Phoenix, AZ.                




Chief Information Officer

                                    1998 - 2009                


Apollo Education Group, Inc.


                  Apollo Group, Inc. was founded in 1973 in response to a gradual shift in higher education demographics from a student population dominated by youth to one in which approximately half the students are adults and over 80 percent of whom work full-time. Apollo's founder, John Sperling, believed—and events proved him right—that lifelong employment with a single employer would be replaced by lifelong learning and employment with a variety of employers. Lifelong learning requires an institution dedicated solely to the education of working adults.

Today, Apollo Group, Inc., through its subsidiaries, University of Phoenix, Apollo Global, Carnegie Learning, College for Financial Planning, and Institute for Professional Development, has established itself as a leading provider of higher education programs for working adults by focusing on servicing the needs of the working adult
