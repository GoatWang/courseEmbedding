On this day in 1928, work begins at Chicago’s new Galvin Manufacturing Corporation. (The company had officially incorporated the day before.) In 1930, Galvin would introduce the Motorola radio, the first mass-produced commercial car radio. (The name had two parts: “motor” evoked cars and motion, while “ola” derived from “Victrola” and was supposed to make people think of music.)
In 1921, engineer Paul Galvin and his friend Edward Stewart started a storage-battery factory in Marshfield, Wisconsin; it went out of business two years later. In 1926, Galvin and Stewart re-started their battery-manufacturing company, this time in Chicago. That one went out of business too, but not before the partners figured out a way for home radios to draw power from an electrical wall outlet; they called it the dry-battery eliminator. Galvin bought back the eliminator part of his bankrupt company at auction for $750 and went right back into business, building and repairing eliminators and AC radio sets for customers like Sears, Roebuck. 
Soon, however, Galvin’s attention turned to the car-radio business. The first car radios–portable “travel radios” powered by batteries, followed by custom-installed built-in radios that cost $250 apiece (about $2,800 in today’s dollars)–had appeared in 1926, but they were way too expensive for the average driver. If he could find a way to mass-produce affordable car radios, Galvin thought, he’d be rich. In June 1930, he enlisted inventors Elmer Wavering and William Lear to retrofit his old Studebaker with a radio and drove 800 miles to the Radio Manufacturers Association’s annual meeting in Atlantic City. He parked outside the convention, turned up the music (for this purpose, Wavering had installed a special speaker under the Studebaker’s hood), and waited for the RMAers’ orders to come rolling in. 
A few did, and Galvin sold enough of his $110 5T71 car radios to come close to breaking even for the year. He changed his company’s name to Motorola and changed the way we drive–and ride in–cars forever.
For his part, William Lear went on to invent the eight-track cartridge-tape system, which came standard in every Ford car starting in 1966. Meanwhile, carmakers developed their own radio-manufacturing divisions, gradually squeezing Motorola out of the market it had built. The company stopped making car radios in 1984. Today, it’s best known for making cellular phones.

Playing career[edit]
Club[edit]
Born in Lixnaw, County Kerry, Galvin plays his club football with his local club Finuge and with his divisional side Feale Rangers and has enjoyed much success. He also plays hurling with his local club Lixnaw.
In 2002 Galvin tasted victory for the first time as a footballer when Finuge qualified for the final of the county junior championship. The opponents on that occasion were Castlegregory. After two defeats at the same stage of the competition in 1998 and 2000, Galvin's side made no mistake at the third time of asking. A merited 0–12 to 1–6 victory gave Finuge the victory and gave Galvin a county junior winners' medal.[4] Finuge subsequently represented Kerry in the provincial junior championship and even reached the final. Cork champions Kiskeam provided the opposition, however, the dream season continued for the Kerry men. Galvin added a Munster junior winners' medal to his collection following a 0–14 to 0–11 victory.[5]
After surrendering their county title for a year, Finuge were back in the county junior final again in 2004. Lispole were the opponents this time around and a close game developed once again. Galvin's side nearly kicked the match away with an enormous wides tally, however, after a period of extra-time Finuge regained the title on a score line of 1–10 to 1–7.[6] Another provincial decider beckoned for Galvin's side, with Cork champions Aghabullogue providing the opposition. The game was an exciting but one-sided affair, and Galvin picked up a second Munster junior winners' medal after a 2–13 to 3–4 victory.[7] On this occasion the Kerry side went all the way to the All-Ireland final where Stewartstown Harps of Tyrone were waiting. Galvin gave an outstanding display in that game and the northerners were easily brushed aside on a score line of 1–14 to 0–6.[8] This win gave Galvin an All-Ireland club winners' medal in the junior grade.
In 2007 Galvin lined out with divisional side Feale Rangers in the final of the county senior championship. A divisional side from the other half of the county, South Kerry provided the opposition. Furthermore, South Kerry were going for a remarkable fourth county title in succession. The game was an extremely close affair, however, Galvin's side pulled through to win by 1–5 to 0–6.[9] With that he added a county senior winners' medal to his collection. It was Rangers' first county triumh in twenty-seven years.
Galvin is also a hurler of note and has enjoyed much success with Lixnaw. In 1999 he was a key member of the team that lined out against Crotta O'Neill's in the final of the countys enior championship. After a 2–8 apiece draw, Lixnaw made no mistake in the replay and secured a narrow 0–9 to 1–5 victory. It was his first senior winners' medal in hurling.
After back-to-back county final defeats in 2002 and 2003, Lixnaw were back in 2005 and faced Abbeydorney. A third defeat in four years looked extremely likely, however, Galvin was the hero of the day. In the second minute of injury-time he sent over the equalising point and secured a 1–11 to 2–8 draw and a second chance in the replay.[10] Lixnaw made no mistake on the second occasion and blew the opposition off the pitch. An enormous 0–17 to 0–6 victory gave Galvin a second county winners' medal.[11]
After surrendering the hurling title the following year, Lixnaw were back to reclaim it in 2007. Kilmoyley provided the opposition in another final as Galvin's side went into the game as underdogs. The form book was torn up as Lixnaw powered to a 1–12 to 2–6 victory and a third county winners' medal for Galvin.
On 21 January 2011, media reports suggested that Galvin was poised for a club transfer from Finuge to St Vincent's in Dublin, but his club team-mate and former member of the Kerry management team, Éamonn Fitzmaurice, rubbished those reports via Twitter.[12]
Minor and under-21[edit]
Galvin first came to prominence on the inter-county scene as a member of the Kerry minor football team in the late 1990s. He lined out in his only provincial decider in that grade in 1997 with Limerick providing the opposition. The game was a huge triumph for 'the Kingdom' as Galvin's side won by 4–12 to 1–7. It was his first Munster winners' medal at minor level.[13] Kerry were later defeated in the subsequent All-Ireland semi-final. The same year he won an All-Ireland Vocational Schools Championship with the Kerry Vocational Schools team following victory over Tyrone in the final.
Galvin's performances at minor level made him an automatic choice for the Kerry under-21 team in 1999. The provincial decider that year pitted Kerry against archrivals Cork. A close game developed, however, after the sixty minutes Kerry were the champions by 1–10 to 0–7. It was Galvin's only Munster under-21 winners' medal.[14] An All-Ireland final appearance followed for Galvin, with Westmeath providing the opposition. Kerry were the favourites going into the game, however, the Leinster minnows proved that they were no pushovers. A narrow 0–12 to 0–9 score line resulted in defeat for Galvin's side.
Galvin continued to play for the Kerry under-21 team for another two seasons, however, he enjoyed little further success.
Senior[edit]
Galvin first played at intercounty senior level for Kerry not with the footballers but the hurlers in the late 90s. He made a number of appearances with the team during the NHL during this time.
Galvin joined the Kerry senior football team in the early 2000s, however, he had to wait for a number of years before establishing himself on the starting fifteen. In 2003 he renewed his rivalry with Limerick when he came on as a substitute in the provincial decider. A 1–11 to 0–9 victory gave Galvin a first Munster winners' medal in the senior grade.[15] After an exciting game with Roscommon, Kerry advanced to an All-Ireland semi-final meeting with Tyrone. After being shocked in the latter stages of the two previous championships, Kerry were out to atone and were favourites going into the match. The whole team struggled and Kerry looked like they were going to be left behind with the new "blanket defence" that was introduced by teams like Armagh and perfected by Tyrone. Many criticised this tactic as a means of stopping talented footballers like Ó Sé and Colm Cooper from playing but few could deny its effectiveness. A humiliating 0–13 to 0–6 defeat saw Tyrone advance to the All-Ireland final while Kerry were unceremoniously dumped out of the championship.[16]
2004 saw Galvin become an integral part of the Kerry team. The year began well with Kerry reaching the final of the National League. An exciting 3–11 to 1–6 victory saw Kerry claim the title and Galvin picked up a first National Football League winners' medal.[17] Kerry later booked their almost annual spot in the provincial final and, for the second year in succession, Limerick were the opponents. Surprisingly, that game ended in a 1–10 apiece draw.[18] The replay was also a close-run affair; however, Kerry never really looked in danger of losing. A 3–10 to 2–9 victory gave Galvin a second Munster winners' medal.[19] The All-Ireland series proved no difficulty for Kerry, and 'the Kingdom' booked their place in the All-Ireland final against Mayo. An early goal from Alan Dillon gave the Connacht men some hope, however, the game was effectively over after twenty-five minutes when Colm Cooper scored Kerry's only goal of the day. The points kept coming from Galvin's team and an injury-time Michael Conroy goal was nothing but a consolation for Mayo. A 1–20 to 2–9 victory gave Galvin an All-Ireland winners' medal.[20] Galvin was later presented with his first All-Star, the 1000th award since the scheme began in 1971.[21]
In 2005 Kerry were hot favourites to retain their All-Ireland title. All was going to plan as Galvin's side reached yet another provincial final. In a return to tradition, Cork were the opponents. A close game developed, however, in the end Kerry were the narrow winners by 1–11 to 0–11.[22] It was Galvin's third consecutive Munster winners' medal. Following this win Kerry cruised through the All-Ireland series to reach another championship decider with Tyrone providing the opposition. In one of the great finals of the decade, the result remained in doubt until the final whistle. Dara Ó Cinnéide powered Kerry ahead with a goal after just six minutes. Tyrone responded in kind with a Peter Canavan goal just before half-time. Tomás Ó Sé launched the Kerry comeback in the 57th minute with Kerry's second goal; however, it was too later. Tyrone hung on to win by 1–16 to 2–10. It was Galvin's first defeat in an All-Ireland final.[23]
In 2006 Kerry reached the final of the National League and played Galway. Galvin's side could only manage three points in the opening half, however, the introduction of Eoin Brosnan transformed the team. At the end of the seventy minutes a 2–12 to 0–10 score line gave Kerry their 18th National League title and a second for Galvin.[24] The league win was a false dawn as Kerry went out tamely to Cork in a replay of the Munster final. The team, however, bounced back against Longford to set up a meeting with Armagh in the All-Ireland quarter-final. At half-time it looked as though the Ulser hoodoo would strike again but Kerry blitzed the men from the orchard county in the second half and won by a score of 3–15 to 1–13. The game was not without incident as Galvin was red-carded for an altercation with the Armagh water carrier.[25] Kerry again beat Cork in the subsequent semi-final before lining out against Mayo in the All-Ireland final. An unbelievable opening first-half saw Kerry go 2–4 to no score ahead after just ten minutes, courtesy of goals by Declan O'Sullivan and Kieran Donaghy. Colm Cooper slotted a third Kerry goal, however, Mayo settled and reduced the deficit to 3–8 to 3–2 at half-time. The second thirty-five minutes saw Kerry run riot while the westerners could only muster three points. A final score of 4–15 to 3–5 gave Kerry another All-Ireland title and gave Galvin a second All-Ireland winners' medal.[26] Galvin finished off the year with a second All-Star award.
2007 saw Kerry face Cork in the provincial decider once again. A close game developed, however, at the full-time whsitle Kerry were the champions by 1–15 to 1–13.[27] It was Ó Galvin's fourth Munster winners' medal. Kerry then had the narrowest of victories in their All-Ireland quarter-final against Monaghan, setting up a glamour All-Ireland semi-final tie with Dublin. Kerry saw off a great Dublin comeback in the second half to win by two points. The subsequent All-Ireland final was an historic occasion as Kerry faced Cork in the very first all-Munster championship decider. While the first half was played on an even keel, 'the Kingdom' ran riot in the second half and a rout ensued. Cork goalkeeper Alan Quirke came in for much criticism after conceding some easy goals. At the full-time whistle Cork were trounced by 3–13 to 1–9.[28] It was a third All-Ireland medal for Galvin and the first completion of back-to-back All-Ireland titles since Cork in 1989 and 1990.
In 2008 Galvin was appointed captain of the Kerry team. It was a great honour, . What should have been a dream season for the Finuge man, particularly since Kerry were attempting to capture a first three-in-a-row of All-Ireland titles since 1986, 'the Kingdom's' championship opener against Clare was a dark moment for Galvin. The game was a largely low-key affair except for one controversial incident between referee Paddy Russell and Galvin. Russell was attempting to book the team captain when he slapped the notebook out of Russell's hand. Galvin then remonstrated with the linesman who had recommended his second yellow card. The incident has been described as due to the "frustration" he felt at being booked "for highlighting to the linesman the blatant and protracted pulling and dragging he was subjected to off the ball by his Clare marker".[29] Galvin received a six-month suspension, however, this was later reduced to twelve weeks. It looked at this stage that Galvin's dream season was in tatters. Kerry drove on without him and reached the All-Ireland final for a fifth successive year. Conveniently, Galvin's suspension ended on the day of the championship decider against Tyrone. While he did not start the game he came on as a substitute. An exciting game developed, one that was more competitive than the routs that had taken place at the same stage of the championship over the previous two years. The sides were level seven times before Colm Cooper nudged Kerry 0–8 to 0–7 ahead before the interval. Tyrone simply wore Kerry into the ground in the second half as a priceless goal from Tommy McGuigan and a string of late points inspired Tyrone to their third All-Ireland title of the decade.[30]
2009 saw Galvin return to the half-forward line for Kerry's opening Munster semi-final meeting with Cork. That game ended in a draw, however, Kerry were well beaten in the replay. 'The Kingdom' were subsequently banished to the qualifiers where they had some unimpressive wins over Longford, Sligo and Antrim. Galvin and his squad later lined out in the All-Ireland quarter-final and thrashed Dublin before overcoming Meath in a disappointing semi-final. For the second year in-a-row Kerry faced Cork in the All-Ireland final. Surprisingly, the men from 'the Kingdom' went into the game as slight underdogs. This tag appeared to be justified when Galvin's side trailed by 1–3 to 0–1 early in the opening half. The Kerry team stuck to their gameplan while Cork recorded fourteen wides, and at the final whistle Kerry were the champions again by 0–16 to 1–9.[31] It was Galvin's fourth All-Ireland medal. He subsequently won an All-Star and the Footballer of the Year award.
In June 2010, Galvin was given an eight-week ban after the 2010 Munster Senior Football Championship semi-final replay win over Cork.[32] The GAA's Central Competitions Control Committee proposed the suspension after reviewing video evidence of Galvin putting his finger into Eoin Cadogan's mouth.[33]
On 1 February 2014, Galvin unexpectedly announced his retirement from inter county football in the aftermath of Kerry's opening round game of the 2014 National Football League.[34] Kerry had lost by one point to Dublin in a game in which Galvin had not been involved.[35][36][37][38]
On 3 March 2015, Galvin returned to the Kerry senior football panel.[39]

Controversy[edit]
In October 2011, Galvin allegedly assaulted the impressionist Oliver Callan and his producer James McDonald[46][47] late at night in Kehoe's Pub, Central Dublin. Among witnesses to the alleged incident were a Government Minister, a TD, a senator and several journalists. One witness alleged Galvin called Callan a "Fucking Cunt".[48] Callan later described how Galvin approached him with "his eyes bulging" and looking "crazy".[49] The incident was investigated by the Garda Síochána.[1] The media speculated on the reason behind the alleged incident, reporting that Callan had recently mimicked Galvin asking Taoiseach Enda Kenny to man-up by giving him a body-wax on Green Tea[50] and that Galvin had texted Callan before an appearance on The Saturday Night Show in relation to "gay jibes" the satirist had directed at him.[51] It was eventually revealed that Galvin had complained (or not complained at all)[52] to RTÉ after what he described as "the most excruciating night of my life" at home on his sofa between his parents in Kerry watching The Saturday Night Show when Callan referred to Galvin's "years spent in the closet".[53]
On 6 December 2011, Galvin spoke of the encounter during an interview on The Ray D'Arcy Show on Today FM.[54][55]

Playing career[edit]
Club[edit]
Born in Lixnaw, County Kerry, Galvin plays his club football with his local club Finuge and with his divisional side Feale Rangers and has enjoyed much success. He also plays hurling with his local club Lixnaw.
In 2002 Galvin tasted victory for the first time as a footballer when Finuge qualified for the final of the county junior championship. The opponents on that occasion were Castlegregory. After two defeats at the same stage of the competition in 1998 and 2000, Galvin's side made no mistake at the third time of asking. A merited 0–12 to 1–6 victory gave Finuge the victory and gave Galvin a county junior winners' medal.[4] Finuge subsequently represented Kerry in the provincial junior championship and even reached the final. Cork champions Kiskeam provided the opposition, however, the dream season continued for the Kerry men. Galvin added a Munster junior winners' medal to his collection following a 0–14 to 0–11 victory.[5]
After surrendering their county title for a year, Finuge were back in the county junior final again in 2004. Lispole were the opponents this time around and a close game developed once again. Galvin's side nearly kicked the match away with an enormous wides tally, however, after a period of extra-time Finuge regained the title on a score line of 1–10 to 1–7.[6] Another provincial decider beckoned for Galvin's side, with Cork champions Aghabullogue providing the opposition. The game was an exciting but one-sided affair, and Galvin picked up a second Munster junior winners' medal after a 2–13 to 3–4 victory.[7] On this occasion the Kerry side went all the way to the All-Ireland final where Stewartstown Harps of Tyrone were waiting. Galvin gave an outstanding display in that game and the northerners were easily brushed aside on a score line of 1–14 to 0–6.[8] This win gave Galvin an All-Ireland club winners' medal in the junior grade.
In 2007 Galvin lined out with divisional side Feale Rangers in the final of the county senior championship. A divisional side from the other half of the county, South Kerry provided the opposition. Furthermore, South Kerry were going for a remarkable fourth county title in succession. The game was an extremely close affair, however, Galvin's side pulled through to win by 1–5 to 0–6.[9] With that he added a county senior winners' medal to his collection. It was Rangers' first county triumh in twenty-seven years.
Galvin is also a hurler of note and has enjoyed much success with Lixnaw. In 1999 he was a key member of the team that lined out against Crotta O'Neill's in the final of the countys enior championship. After a 2–8 apiece draw, Lixnaw made no mistake in the replay and secured a narrow 0–9 to 1–5 victory. It was his first senior winners' medal in hurling.
After back-to-back county final defeats in 2002 and 2003, Lixnaw were back in 2005 and faced Abbeydorney. A third defeat in four years looked extremely likely, however, Galvin was the hero of the day. In the second minute of injury-time he sent over the equalising point and secured a 1–11 to 2–8 draw and a second chance in the replay.[10] Lixnaw made no mistake on the second occasion and blew the opposition off the pitch. An enormous 0–17 to 0–6 victory gave Galvin a second county winners' medal.[11]
After surrendering the hurling title the following year, Lixnaw were back to reclaim it in 2007. Kilmoyley provided the opposition in another final as Galvin's side went into the game as underdogs. The form book was torn up as Lixnaw powered to a 1–12 to 2–6 victory and a third county winners' medal for Galvin.
On 21 January 2011, media reports suggested that Galvin was poised for a club transfer from Finuge to St Vincent's in Dublin, but his club team-mate and former member of the Kerry management team, Éamonn Fitzmaurice, rubbished those reports via Twitter.[12]
Minor and under-21[edit]
Galvin first came to prominence on the inter-county scene as a member of the Kerry minor football team in the late 1990s. He lined out in his only provincial decider in that grade in 1997 with Limerick providing the opposition. The game was a huge triumph for 'the Kingdom' as Galvin's side won by 4–12 to 1–7. It was his first Munster winners' medal at minor level.[13] Kerry were later defeated in the subsequent All-Ireland semi-final. The same year he won an All-Ireland Vocational Schools Championship with the Kerry Vocational Schools team following victory over Tyrone in the final.
Galvin's performances at minor level made him an automatic choice for the Kerry under-21 team in 1999. The provincial decider that year pitted Kerry against archrivals Cork. A close game developed, however, after the sixty minutes Kerry were the champions by 1–10 to 0–7. It was Galvin's only Munster under-21 winners' medal.[14] An All-Ireland final appearance followed for Galvin, with Westmeath providing the opposition. Kerry were the favourites going into the game, however, the Leinster minnows proved that they were no pushovers. A narrow 0–12 to 0–9 score line resulted in defeat for Galvin's side.
Galvin continued to play for the Kerry under-21 team for another two seasons, however, he enjoyed little further success.
Senior[edit]
Galvin first played at intercounty senior level for Kerry not with the footballers but the hurlers in the late 90s. He made a number of appearances with the team during the NHL during this time.
Galvin joined the Kerry senior football team in the early 2000s, however, he had to wait for a number of years before establishing himself on the starting fifteen. In 2003 he renewed his rivalry with Limerick when he came on as a substitute in the provincial decider. A 1–11 to 0–9 victory gave Galvin a first Munster winners' medal in the senior grade.[15] After an exciting game with Roscommon, Kerry advanced to an All-Ireland semi-final meeting with Tyrone. After being shocked in the latter stages of the two previous championships, Kerry were out to atone and were favourites going into the match. The whole team struggled and Kerry looked like they were going to be left behind with the new "blanket defence" that was introduced by teams like Armagh and perfected by Tyrone. Many criticised this tactic as a means of stopping talented footballers like Ó Sé and Colm Cooper from playing but few could deny its effectiveness. A humiliating 0–13 to 0–6 defeat saw Tyrone advance to the All-Ireland final while Kerry were unceremoniously dumped out of the championship.[16]
2004 saw Galvin become an integral part of the Kerry team. The year began well with Kerry reaching the final of the National League. An exciting 3–11 to 1–6 victory saw Kerry claim the title and Galvin picked up a first National Football League winners' medal.[17] Kerry later booked their almost annual spot in the provincial final and, for the second year in succession, Limerick were the opponents. Surprisingly, that game ended in a 1–10 apiece draw.[18] The replay was also a close-run affair; however, Kerry never really looked in danger of losing. A 3–10 to 2–9 victory gave Galvin a second Munster winners' medal.[19] The All-Ireland series proved no difficulty for Kerry, and 'the Kingdom' booked their place in the All-Ireland final against Mayo. An early goal from Alan Dillon gave the Connacht men some hope, however, the game was effectively over after twenty-five minutes when Colm Cooper scored Kerry's only goal of the day. The points kept coming from Galvin's team and an injury-time Michael Conroy goal was nothing but a consolation for Mayo. A 1–20 to 2–9 victory gave Galvin an All-Ireland winners' medal.[20] Galvin was later presented with his first All-Star, the 1000th award since the scheme began in 1971.[21]
In 2005 Kerry were hot favourites to retain their All-Ireland title. All was going to plan as Galvin's side reached yet another provincial final. In a return to tradition, Cork were the opponents. A close game developed, however, in the end Kerry were the narrow winners by 1–11 to 0–11.[22] It was Galvin's third consecutive Munster winners' medal. Following this win Kerry cruised through the All-Ireland series to reach another championship decider with Tyrone providing the opposition. In one of the great finals of the decade, the result remained in doubt until the final whistle. Dara Ó Cinnéide powered Kerry ahead with a goal after just six minutes. Tyrone responded in kind with a Peter Canavan goal just before half-time. Tomás Ó Sé launched the Kerry comeback in the 57th minute with Kerry's second goal; however, it was too later. Tyrone hung on to win by 1–16 to 2–10. It was Galvin's first defeat in an All-Ireland final.[23]
In 2006 Kerry reached the final of the National League and played Galway. Galvin's side could only manage three points in the opening half, however, the introduction of Eoin Brosnan transformed the team. At the end of the seventy minutes a 2–12 to 0–10 score line gave Kerry their 18th National League title and a second for Galvin.[24] The league win was a false dawn as Kerry went out tamely to Cork in a replay of the Munster final. The team, however, bounced back against Longford to set up a meeting with Armagh in the All-Ireland quarter-final. At half-time it looked as though the Ulser hoodoo would strike again but Kerry blitzed the men from the orchard county in the second half and won by a score of 3–15 to 1–13. The game was not without incident as Galvin was red-carded for an altercation with the Armagh water carrier.[25] Kerry again beat Cork in the subsequent semi-final before lining out against Mayo in the All-Ireland final. An unbelievable opening first-half saw Kerry go 2–4 to no score ahead after just ten minutes, courtesy of goals by Declan O'Sullivan and Kieran Donaghy. Colm Cooper slotted a third Kerry goal, however, Mayo settled and reduced the deficit to 3–8 to 3–2 at half-time. The second thirty-five minutes saw Kerry run riot while the westerners could only muster three points. A final score of 4–15 to 3–5 gave Kerry another All-Ireland title and gave Galvin a second All-Ireland winners' medal.[26] Galvin finished off the year with a second All-Star award.
2007 saw Kerry face Cork in the provincial decider once again. A close game developed, however, at the full-time whsitle Kerry were the champions by 1–15 to 1–13.[27] It was Ó Galvin's fourth Munster winners' medal. Kerry then had the narrowest of victories in their All-Ireland quarter-final against Monaghan, setting up a glamour All-Ireland semi-final tie with Dublin. Kerry saw off a great Dublin comeback in the second half to win by two points. The subsequent All-Ireland final was an historic occasion as Kerry faced Cork in the very first all-Munster championship decider. While the first half was played on an even keel, 'the Kingdom' ran riot in the second half and a rout ensued. Cork goalkeeper Alan Quirke came in for much criticism after conceding some easy goals. At the full-time whistle Cork were trounced by 3–13 to 1–9.[28] It was a third All-Ireland medal for Galvin and the first completion of back-to-back All-Ireland titles since Cork in 1989 and 1990.
In 2008 Galvin was appointed captain of the Kerry team. It was a great honour, . What should have been a dream season for the Finuge man, particularly since Kerry were attempting to capture a first three-in-a-row of All-Ireland titles since 1986, 'the Kingdom's' championship opener against Clare was a dark moment for Galvin. The game was a largely low-key affair except for one controversial incident between referee Paddy Russell and Galvin. Russell was attempting to book the team captain when he slapped the notebook out of Russell's hand. Galvin then remonstrated with the linesman who had recommended his second yellow card. The incident has been described as due to the "frustration" he felt at being booked "for highlighting to the linesman the blatant and protracted pulling and dragging he was subjected to off the ball by his Clare marker".[29] Galvin received a six-month suspension, however, this was later reduced to twelve weeks. It looked at this stage that Galvin's dream season was in tatters. Kerry drove on without him and reached the All-Ireland final for a fifth successive year. Conveniently, Galvin's suspension ended on the day of the championship decider against Tyrone. While he did not start the game he came on as a substitute. An exciting game developed, one that was more competitive than the routs that had taken place at the same stage of the championship over the previous two years. The sides were level seven times before Colm Cooper nudged Kerry 0–8 to 0–7 ahead before the interval. Tyrone simply wore Kerry into the ground in the second half as a priceless goal from Tommy McGuigan and a string of late points inspired Tyrone to their third All-Ireland title of the decade.[30]
2009 saw Galvin return to the half-forward line for Kerry's opening Munster semi-final meeting with Cork. That game ended in a draw, however, Kerry were well beaten in the replay. 'The Kingdom' were subsequently banished to the qualifiers where they had some unimpressive wins over Longford, Sligo and Antrim. Galvin and his squad later lined out in the All-Ireland quarter-final and thrashed Dublin before overcoming Meath in a disappointing semi-final. For the second year in-a-row Kerry faced Cork in the All-Ireland final. Surprisingly, the men from 'the Kingdom' went into the game as slight underdogs. This tag appeared to be justified when Galvin's side trailed by 1–3 to 0–1 early in the opening half. The Kerry team stuck to their gameplan while Cork recorded fourteen wides, and at the final whistle Kerry were the champions again by 0–16 to 1–9.[31] It was Galvin's fourth All-Ireland medal. He subsequently won an All-Star and the Footballer of the Year award.
In June 2010, Galvin was given an eight-week ban after the 2010 Munster Senior Football Championship semi-final replay win over Cork.[32] The GAA's Central Competitions Control Committee proposed the suspension after reviewing video evidence of Galvin putting his finger into Eoin Cadogan's mouth.[33]
On 1 February 2014, Galvin unexpectedly announced his retirement from inter county football in the aftermath of Kerry's opening round game of the 2014 National Football League.[34] Kerry had lost by one point to Dublin in a game in which Galvin had not been involved.[35][36][37][38]
On 3 March 2015, Galvin returned to the Kerry senior football panel.[39]

Personal life[edit]
Galvin was a secondary school teacher of Geography and Gaeilge in Coláiste Chríost Rí, Cork and St. Brendan's College, Killarney. He coached the senior school team to the All-Ireland in 2009.[40]
In February 2012, he came third in a poll to find Ireland's most desirable Valentines.[41]
In February 2013, he took delivery of a €60,000 Audi A5.[42]
In April 2013 it was reported he had been sued for €8,000 in damages for throwing a blackboard duster at one of his students.[43]
Paul Galvin got engaged to Louise Duffy on a trip to New York in March 2014.[44] They got married on New Year's Eve 2015.[45]
Controversy[edit]
In October 2011, Galvin allegedly assaulted the impressionist Oliver Callan and his producer James McDonald[46][47] late at night in Kehoe's Pub, Central Dublin. Among witnesses to the alleged incident were a Government Minister, a TD, a senator and several journalists. One witness alleged Galvin called Callan a "Fucking Cunt".[48] Callan later described how Galvin approached him with "his eyes bulging" and looking "crazy".[49] The incident was investigated by the Garda Síochána.[1] The media speculated on the reason behind the alleged incident, reporting that Callan had recently mimicked Galvin asking Taoiseach Enda Kenny to man-up by giving him a body-wax on Green Tea[50] and that Galvin had texted Callan before an appearance on The Saturday Night Show in relation to "gay jibes" the satirist had directed at him.[51] It was eventually revealed that Galvin had complained (or not complained at all)[52] to RTÉ after what he described as "the most excruciating night of my life" at home on his sofa between his parents in Kerry watching The Saturday Night Show when Callan referred to Galvin's "years spent in the closet".[53]
On 6 December 2011, Galvin spoke of the encounter during an interview on The Ray D'Arcy Show on Today FM.[54][55]

Playing career[edit]
Club[edit]
Born in Lixnaw, County Kerry, Galvin plays his club football with his local club Finuge and with his divisional side Feale Rangers and has enjoyed much success. He also plays hurling with his local club Lixnaw.
In 2002 Galvin tasted victory for the first time as a footballer when Finuge qualified for the final of the county junior championship. The opponents on that occasion were Castlegregory. After two defeats at the same stage of the competition in 1998 and 2000, Galvin's side made no mistake at the third time of asking. A merited 0–12 to 1–6 victory gave Finuge the victory and gave Galvin a county junior winners' medal.[4] Finuge subsequently represented Kerry in the provincial junior championship and even reached the final. Cork champions Kiskeam provided the opposition, however, the dream season continued for the Kerry men. Galvin added a Munster junior winners' medal to his collection following a 0–14 to 0–11 victory.[5]
After surrendering their county title for a year, Finuge were back in the county junior final again in 2004. Lispole were the opponents this time around and a close game developed once again. Galvin's side nearly kicked the match away with an enormous wides tally, however, after a period of extra-time Finuge regained the title on a score line of 1–10 to 1–7.[6] Another provincial decider beckoned for Galvin's side, with Cork champions Aghabullogue providing the opposition. The game was an exciting but one-sided affair, and Galvin picked up a second Munster junior winners' medal after a 2–13 to 3–4 victory.[7] On this occasion the Kerry side went all the way to the All-Ireland final where Stewartstown Harps of Tyrone were waiting. Galvin gave an outstanding display in that game and the northerners were easily brushed aside on a score line of 1–14 to 0–6.[8] This win gave Galvin an All-Ireland club winners' medal in the junior grade.
In 2007 Galvin lined out with divisional side Feale Rangers in the final of the county senior championship. A divisional side from the other half of the county, South Kerry provided the opposition. Furthermore, South Kerry were going for a remarkable fourth county title in succession. The game was an extremely close affair, however, Galvin's side pulled through to win by 1–5 to 0–6.[9] With that he added a county senior winners' medal to his collection. It was Rangers' first county triumh in twenty-seven years.
Galvin is also a hurler of note and has enjoyed much success with Lixnaw. In 1999 he was a key member of the team that lined out against Crotta O'Neill's in the final of the countys enior championship. After a 2–8 apiece draw, Lixnaw made no mistake in the replay and secured a narrow 0–9 to 1–5 victory. It was his first senior winners' medal in hurling.
After back-to-back county final defeats in 2002 and 2003, Lixnaw were back in 2005 and faced Abbeydorney. A third defeat in four years looked extremely likely, however, Galvin was the hero of the day. In the second minute of injury-time he sent over the equalising point and secured a 1–11 to 2–8 draw and a second chance in the replay.[10] Lixnaw made no mistake on the second occasion and blew the opposition off the pitch. An enormous 0–17 to 0–6 victory gave Galvin a second county winners' medal.[11]
After surrendering the hurling title the following year, Lixnaw were back to reclaim it in 2007. Kilmoyley provided the opposition in another final as Galvin's side went into the game as underdogs. The form book was torn up as Lixnaw powered to a 1–12 to 2–6 victory and a third county winners' medal for Galvin.
On 21 January 2011, media reports suggested that Galvin was poised for a club transfer from Finuge to St Vincent's in Dublin, but his club team-mate and former member of the Kerry management team, Éamonn Fitzmaurice, rubbished those reports via Twitter.[12]
Minor and under-21[edit]
Galvin first came to prominence on the inter-county scene as a member of the Kerry minor football team in the late 1990s. He lined out in his only provincial decider in that grade in 1997 with Limerick providing the opposition. The game was a huge triumph for 'the Kingdom' as Galvin's side won by 4–12 to 1–7. It was his first Munster winners' medal at minor level.[13] Kerry were later defeated in the subsequent All-Ireland semi-final. The same year he won an All-Ireland Vocational Schools Championship with the Kerry Vocational Schools team following victory over Tyrone in the final.
Galvin's performances at minor level made him an automatic choice for the Kerry under-21 team in 1999. The provincial decider that year pitted Kerry against archrivals Cork. A close game developed, however, after the sixty minutes Kerry were the champions by 1–10 to 0–7. It was Galvin's only Munster under-21 winners' medal.[14] An All-Ireland final appearance followed for Galvin, with Westmeath providing the opposition. Kerry were the favourites going into the game, however, the Leinster minnows proved that they were no pushovers. A narrow 0–12 to 0–9 score line resulted in defeat for Galvin's side.
Galvin continued to play for the Kerry under-21 team for another two seasons, however, he enjoyed little further success.
Senior[edit]
Galvin first played at intercounty senior level for Kerry not with the footballers but the hurlers in the late 90s. He made a number of appearances with the team during the NHL during this time.
Galvin joined the Kerry senior football team in the early 2000s, however, he had to wait for a number of years before establishing himself on the starting fifteen. In 2003 he renewed his rivalry with Limerick when he came on as a substitute in the provincial decider. A 1–11 to 0–9 victory gave Galvin a first Munster winners' medal in the senior grade.[15] After an exciting game with Roscommon, Kerry advanced to an All-Ireland semi-final meeting with Tyrone. After being shocked in the latter stages of the two previous championships, Kerry were out to atone and were favourites going into the match. The whole team struggled and Kerry looked like they were going to be left behind with the new "blanket defence" that was introduced by teams like Armagh and perfected by Tyrone. Many criticised this tactic as a means of stopping talented footballers like Ó Sé and Colm Cooper from playing but few could deny its effectiveness. A humiliating 0–13 to 0–6 defeat saw Tyrone advance to the All-Ireland final while Kerry were unceremoniously dumped out of the championship.[16]
2004 saw Galvin become an integral part of the Kerry team. The year began well with Kerry reaching the final of the National League. An exciting 3–11 to 1–6 victory saw Kerry claim the title and Galvin picked up a first National Football League winners' medal.[17] Kerry later booked their almost annual spot in the provincial final and, for the second year in succession, Limerick were the opponents. Surprisingly, that game ended in a 1–10 apiece draw.[18] The replay was also a close-run affair; however, Kerry never really looked in danger of losing. A 3–10 to 2–9 victory gave Galvin a second Munster winners' medal.[19] The All-Ireland series proved no difficulty for Kerry, and 'the Kingdom' booked their place in the All-Ireland final against Mayo. An early goal from Alan Dillon gave the Connacht men some hope, however, the game was effectively over after twenty-five minutes when Colm Cooper scored Kerry's only goal of the day. The points kept coming from Galvin's team and an injury-time Michael Conroy goal was nothing but a consolation for Mayo. A 1–20 to 2–9 victory gave Galvin an All-Ireland winners' medal.[20] Galvin was later presented with his first All-Star, the 1000th award since the scheme began in 1971.[21]
In 2005 Kerry were hot favourites to retain their All-Ireland title. All was going to plan as Galvin's side reached yet another provincial final. In a return to tradition, Cork were the opponents. A close game developed, however, in the end Kerry were the narrow winners by 1–11 to 0–11.[22] It was Galvin's third consecutive Munster winners' medal. Following this win Kerry cruised through the All-Ireland series to reach another championship decider with Tyrone providing the opposition. In one of the great finals of the decade, the result remained in doubt until the final whistle. Dara Ó Cinnéide powered Kerry ahead with a goal after just six minutes. Tyrone responded in kind with a Peter Canavan goal just before half-time. Tomás Ó Sé launched the Kerry comeback in the 57th minute with Kerry's second goal; however, it was too later. Tyrone hung on to win by 1–16 to 2–10. It was Galvin's first defeat in an All-Ireland final.[23]
In 2006 Kerry reached the final of the National League and played Galway. Galvin's side could only manage three points in the opening half, however, the introduction of Eoin Brosnan transformed the team. At the end of the seventy minutes a 2–12 to 0–10 score line gave Kerry their 18th National League title and a second for Galvin.[24] The league win was a false dawn as Kerry went out tamely to Cork in a replay of the Munster final. The team, however, bounced back against Longford to set up a meeting with Armagh in the All-Ireland quarter-final. At half-time it looked as though the Ulser hoodoo would strike again but Kerry blitzed the men from the orchard county in the second half and won by a score of 3–15 to 1–13. The game was not without incident as Galvin was red-carded for an altercation with the Armagh water carrier.[25] Kerry again beat Cork in the subsequent semi-final before lining out against Mayo in the All-Ireland final. An unbelievable opening first-half saw Kerry go 2–4 to no score ahead after just ten minutes, courtesy of goals by Declan O'Sullivan and Kieran Donaghy. Colm Cooper slotted a third Kerry goal, however, Mayo settled and reduced the deficit to 3–8 to 3–2 at half-time. The second thirty-five minutes saw Kerry run riot while the westerners could only muster three points. A final score of 4–15 to 3–5 gave Kerry another All-Ireland title and gave Galvin a second All-Ireland winners' medal.[26] Galvin finished off the year with a second All-Star award.
2007 saw Kerry face Cork in the provincial decider once again. A close game developed, however, at the full-time whsitle Kerry were the champions by 1–15 to 1–13.[27] It was Ó Galvin's fourth Munster winners' medal. Kerry then had the narrowest of victories in their All-Ireland quarter-final against Monaghan, setting up a glamour All-Ireland semi-final tie with Dublin. Kerry saw off a great Dublin comeback in the second half to win by two points. The subsequent All-Ireland final was an historic occasion as Kerry faced Cork in the very first all-Munster championship decider. While the first half was played on an even keel, 'the Kingdom' ran riot in the second half and a rout ensued. Cork goalkeeper Alan Quirke came in for much criticism after conceding some easy goals. At the full-time whistle Cork were trounced by 3–13 to 1–9.[28] It was a third All-Ireland medal for Galvin and the first completion of back-to-back All-Ireland titles since Cork in 1989 and 1990.
In 2008 Galvin was appointed captain of the Kerry team. It was a great honour, . What should have been a dream season for the Finuge man, particularly since Kerry were attempting to capture a first three-in-a-row of All-Ireland titles since 1986, 'the Kingdom's' championship opener against Clare was a dark moment for Galvin. The game was a largely low-key affair except for one controversial incident between referee Paddy Russell and Galvin. Russell was attempting to book the team captain when he slapped the notebook out of Russell's hand. Galvin then remonstrated with the linesman who had recommended his second yellow card. The incident has been described as due to the "frustration" he felt at being booked "for highlighting to the linesman the blatant and protracted pulling and dragging he was subjected to off the ball by his Clare marker".[29] Galvin received a six-month suspension, however, this was later reduced to twelve weeks. It looked at this stage that Galvin's dream season was in tatters. Kerry drove on without him and reached the All-Ireland final for a fifth successive year. Conveniently, Galvin's suspension ended on the day of the championship decider against Tyrone. While he did not start the game he came on as a substitute. An exciting game developed, one that was more competitive than the routs that had taken place at the same stage of the championship over the previous two years. The sides were level seven times before Colm Cooper nudged Kerry 0–8 to 0–7 ahead before the interval. Tyrone simply wore Kerry into the ground in the second half as a priceless goal from Tommy McGuigan and a string of late points inspired Tyrone to their third All-Ireland title of the decade.[30]
2009 saw Galvin return to the half-forward line for Kerry's opening Munster semi-final meeting with Cork. That game ended in a draw, however, Kerry were well beaten in the replay. 'The Kingdom' were subsequently banished to the qualifiers where they had some unimpressive wins over Longford, Sligo and Antrim. Galvin and his squad later lined out in the All-Ireland quarter-final and thrashed Dublin before overcoming Meath in a disappointing semi-final. For the second year in-a-row Kerry faced Cork in the All-Ireland final. Surprisingly, the men from 'the Kingdom' went into the game as slight underdogs. This tag appeared to be justified when Galvin's side trailed by 1–3 to 0–1 early in the opening half. The Kerry team stuck to their gameplan while Cork recorded fourteen wides, and at the final whistle Kerry were the champions again by 0–16 to 1–9.[31] It was Galvin's fourth All-Ireland medal. He subsequently won an All-Star and the Footballer of the Year award.
In June 2010, Galvin was given an eight-week ban after the 2010 Munster Senior Football Championship semi-final replay win over Cork.[32] The GAA's Central Competitions Control Committee proposed the suspension after reviewing video evidence of Galvin putting his finger into Eoin Cadogan's mouth.[33]
On 1 February 2014, Galvin unexpectedly announced his retirement from inter county football in the aftermath of Kerry's opening round game of the 2014 National Football League.[34] Kerry had lost by one point to Dublin in a game in which Galvin had not been involved.[35][36][37][38]
On 3 March 2015, Galvin returned to the Kerry senior football panel.[39]

Personal life[edit]
Galvin was a secondary school teacher of Geography and Gaeilge in Coláiste Chríost Rí, Cork and St. Brendan's College, Killarney. He coached the senior school team to the All-Ireland in 2009.[40]
In February 2012, he came third in a poll to find Ireland's most desirable Valentines.[41]
In February 2013, he took delivery of a €60,000 Audi A5.[42]

Paul Galvin got engaged to Louise Duffy on a trip to New York in March 2014.[44] They got married on New Year's Eve 2015.[45]
Controversy[edit]
In October 2011, Galvin allegedly assaulted the impressionist Oliver Callan and his producer James McDonald[46][47] late at night in Kehoe's Pub, Central Dublin. Among witnesses to the alleged incident were a Government Minister, a TD, a senator and several journalists. One witness alleged Galvin called Callan a "Fucking Cunt".[48] Callan later described how Galvin approached him with "his eyes bulging" and looking "crazy".[49] The incident was investigated by the Garda Síochána.[1] The media speculated on the reason behind the alleged incident, reporting that Callan had recently mimicked Galvin asking Taoiseach Enda Kenny to man-up by giving him a body-wax on Green Tea[50] and that Galvin had texted Callan before an appearance on The Saturday Night Show in relation to "gay jibes" the satirist had directed at him.[51] It was eventually revealed that Galvin had complained (or not complained at all)[52] to RTÉ after what he described as "the most excruciating night of my life" at home on his sofa between his parents in Kerry watching The Saturday Night Show when Callan referred to Galvin's "years spent in the closet".[53]
On 6 December 2011, Galvin spoke of the encounter during an interview on The Ray D'Arcy Show on Today FM.[54][55]

Playing career[edit]
Club[edit]
Born in Lixnaw, County Kerry, Galvin plays his club football with his local club Finuge and with his divisional side Feale Rangers and has enjoyed much success. He also plays hurling with his local club Lixnaw.
In 2002 Galvin tasted victory for the first time as a footballer when Finuge qualified for the final of the county junior championship. The opponents on that occasion were Castlegregory. After two defeats at the same stage of the competition in 1998 and 2000, Galvin's side made no mistake at the third time of asking. A merited 0–12 to 1–6 victory gave Finuge the victory and gave Galvin a county junior winners' medal.[4] Finuge subsequently represented Kerry in the provincial junior championship and even reached the final. Cork champions Kiskeam provided the opposition, however, the dream season continued for the Kerry men. Galvin added a Munster junior winners' medal to his collection following a 0–14 to 0–11 victory.[5]
After surrendering their county title for a year, Finuge were back in the county junior final again in 2004. Lispole were the opponents this time around and a close game developed once again. Galvin's side nearly kicked the match away with an enormous wides tally, however, after a period of extra-time Finuge regained the title on a score line of 1–10 to 1–7.[6] Another provincial decider beckoned for Galvin's side, with Cork champions Aghabullogue providing the opposition. The game was an exciting but one-sided affair, and Galvin picked up a second Munster junior winners' medal after a 2–13 to 3–4 victory.[7] On this occasion the Kerry side went all the way to the All-Ireland final where Stewartstown Harps of Tyrone were waiting. Galvin gave an outstanding display in that game and the northerners were easily brushed aside on a score line of 1–14 to 0–6.[8] This win gave Galvin an All-Ireland club winners' medal in the junior grade.
In 2007 Galvin lined out with divisional side Feale Rangers in the final of the county senior championship. A divisional side from the other half of the county, South Kerry provided the opposition. Furthermore, South Kerry were going for a remarkable fourth county title in succession. The game was an extremely close affair, however, Galvin's side pulled through to win by 1–5 to 0–6.[9] With that he added a county senior winners' medal to his collection. It was Rangers' first county triumh in twenty-seven years.
Galvin is also a hurler of note and has enjoyed much success with Lixnaw. In 1999 he was a key member of the team that lined out against Crotta O'Neill's in the final of the countys enior championship. After a 2–8 apiece draw, Lixnaw made no mistake in the replay and secured a narrow 0–9 to 1–5 victory. It was his first senior winners' medal in hurling.
After back-to-back county final defeats in 2002 and 2003, Lixnaw were back in 2005 and faced Abbeydorney. A third defeat in four years looked extremely likely, however, Galvin was the hero of the day. In the second minute of injury-time he sent over the equalising point and secured a 1–11 to 2–8 draw and a second chance in the replay.[10] Lixnaw made no mistake on the second occasion and blew the opposition off the pitch. An enormous 0–17 to 0–6 victory gave Galvin a second county winners' medal.[11]
After surrendering the hurling title the following year, Lixnaw were back to reclaim it in 2007. Kilmoyley provided the opposition in another final as Galvin's side went into the game as underdogs. The form book was torn up as Lixnaw powered to a 1–12 to 2–6 victory and a third county winners' medal for Galvin.
On 21 January 2011, media reports suggested that Galvin was poised for a club transfer from Finuge to St Vincent's in Dublin, but his club team-mate and former member of the Kerry management team, Éamonn Fitzmaurice, rubbished those reports via Twitter.[12]
Minor and under-21[edit]
Galvin first came to prominence on the inter-county scene as a member of the Kerry minor football team in the late 1990s. He lined out in his only provincial decider in that grade in 1997 with Limerick providing the opposition. The game was a huge triumph for 'the Kingdom' as Galvin's side won by 4–12 to 1–7. It was his first Munster winners' medal at minor level.[13] Kerry were later defeated in the subsequent All-Ireland semi-final. The same year he won an All-Ireland Vocational Schools Championship with the Kerry Vocational Schools team following victory over Tyrone in the final.
Galvin's performances at minor level made him an automatic choice for the Kerry under-21 team in 1999. The provincial decider that year pitted Kerry against archrivals Cork. A close game developed, however, after the sixty minutes Kerry were the champions by 1–10 to 0–7. It was Galvin's only Munster under-21 winners' medal.[14] An All-Ireland final appearance followed for Galvin, with Westmeath providing the opposition. Kerry were the favourites going into the game, however, the Leinster minnows proved that they were no pushovers. A narrow 0–12 to 0–9 score line resulted in defeat for Galvin's side.
Galvin continued to play for the Kerry under-21 team for another two seasons, however, he enjoyed little further success.
Senior[edit]
Galvin first played at intercounty senior level for Kerry not with the footballers but the hurlers in the late 90s. He made a number of appearances with the team during the NHL during this time.
Galvin joined the Kerry senior football team in the early 2000s, however, he had to wait for a number of years before establishing himself on the starting fifteen. In 2003 he renewed his rivalry with Limerick when he came on as a substitute in the provincial decider. A 1–11 to 0–9 victory gave Galvin a first Munster winners' medal in the senior grade.[15] After an exciting game with Roscommon, Kerry advanced to an All-Ireland semi-final meeting with Tyrone. After being shocked in the latter stages of the two previous championships, Kerry were out to atone and were favourites going into the match. The whole team struggled and Kerry looked like they were going to be left behind with the new "blanket defence" that was introduced by teams like Armagh and perfected by Tyrone. Many criticised this tactic as a means of stopping talented footballers like Ó Sé and Colm Cooper from playing but few could deny its effectiveness. A humiliating 0–13 to 0–6 defeat saw Tyrone advance to the All-Ireland final while Kerry were unceremoniously dumped out of the championship.[16]
2004 saw Galvin become an integral part of the Kerry team. The year began well with Kerry reaching the final of the National League. An exciting 3–11 to 1–6 victory saw Kerry claim the title and Galvin picked up a first National Football League winners' medal.[17] Kerry later booked their almost annual spot in the provincial final and, for the second year in succession, Limerick were the opponents. Surprisingly, that game ended in a 1–10 apiece draw.[18] The replay was also a close-run affair; however, Kerry never really looked in danger of losing. A 3–10 to 2–9 victory gave Galvin a second Munster winners' medal.[19] The All-Ireland series proved no difficulty for Kerry, and 'the Kingdom' booked their place in the All-Ireland final against Mayo. An early goal from Alan Dillon gave the Connacht men some hope, however, the game was effectively over after twenty-five minutes when Colm Cooper scored Kerry's only goal of the day. The points kept coming from Galvin's team and an injury-time Michael Conroy goal was nothing but a consolation for Mayo. A 1–20 to 2–9 victory gave Galvin an All-Ireland winners' medal.[20] Galvin was later presented with his first All-Star, the 1000th award since the scheme began in 1971.[21]
In 2005 Kerry were hot favourites to retain their All-Ireland title. All was going to plan as Galvin's side reached yet another provincial final. In a return to tradition, Cork were the opponents. A close game developed, however, in the end Kerry were the narrow winners by 1–11 to 0–11.[22] It was Galvin's third consecutive Munster winners' medal. Following this win Kerry cruised through the All-Ireland series to reach another championship decider with Tyrone providing the opposition. In one of the great finals of the decade, the result remained in doubt until the final whistle. Dara Ó Cinnéide powered Kerry ahead with a goal after just six minutes. Tyrone responded in kind with a Peter Canavan goal just before half-time. Tomás Ó Sé launched the Kerry comeback in the 57th minute with Kerry's second goal; however, it was too later. Tyrone hung on to win by 1–16 to 2–10. It was Galvin's first defeat in an All-Ireland final.[23]
In 2006 Kerry reached the final of the National League and played Galway. Galvin's side could only manage three points in the opening half, however, the introduction of Eoin Brosnan transformed the team. At the end of the seventy minutes a 2–12 to 0–10 score line gave Kerry their 18th National League title and a second for Galvin.[24] The league win was a false dawn as Kerry went out tamely to Cork in a replay of the Munster final. The team, however, bounced back against Longford to set up a meeting with Armagh in the All-Ireland quarter-final. At half-time it looked as though the Ulser hoodoo would strike again but Kerry blitzed the men from the orchard county in the second half and won by a score of 3–15 to 1–13. The game was not without incident as Galvin was red-carded for an altercation with the Armagh water carrier.[25] Kerry again beat Cork in the subsequent semi-final before lining out against Mayo in the All-Ireland final. An unbelievable opening first-half saw Kerry go 2–4 to no score ahead after just ten minutes, courtesy of goals by Declan O'Sullivan and Kieran Donaghy. Colm Cooper slotted a third Kerry goal, however, Mayo settled and reduced the deficit to 3–8 to 3–2 at half-time. The second thirty-five minutes saw Kerry run riot while the westerners could only muster three points. A final score of 4–15 to 3–5 gave Kerry another All-Ireland title and gave Galvin a second All-Ireland winners' medal.[26] Galvin finished off the year with a second All-Star award.
2007 saw Kerry face Cork in the provincial decider once again. A close game developed, however, at the full-time whsitle Kerry were the champions by 1–15 to 1–13.[27] It was Ó Galvin's fourth Munster winners' medal. Kerry then had the narrowest of victories in their All-Ireland quarter-final against Monaghan, setting up a glamour All-Ireland semi-final tie with Dublin. Kerry saw off a great Dublin comeback in the second half to win by two points. The subsequent All-Ireland final was an historic occasion as Kerry faced Cork in the very first all-Munster championship decider. While the first half was played on an even keel, 'the Kingdom' ran riot in the second half and a rout ensued. Cork goalkeeper Alan Quirke came in for much criticism after conceding some easy goals. At the full-time whistle Cork were trounced by 3–13 to 1–9.[28] It was a third All-Ireland medal for Galvin and the first completion of back-to-back All-Ireland titles since Cork in 1989 and 1990.
In 2008 Galvin was appointed captain of the Kerry team. It was a great honour, . What should have been a dream season for the Finuge man, particularly since Kerry were attempting to capture a first three-in-a-row of All-Ireland titles since 1986, 'the Kingdom's' championship opener against Clare was a dark moment for Galvin. The game was a largely low-key affair except for one controversial incident between referee Paddy Russell and Galvin. Russell was attempting to book the team captain when he slapped the notebook out of Russell's hand. Galvin then remonstrated with the linesman who had recommended his second yellow card. The incident has been described as due to the "frustration" he felt at being booked "for highlighting to the linesman the blatant and protracted pulling and dragging he was subjected to off the ball by his Clare marker".[29] Galvin received a six-month suspension, however, this was later reduced to twelve weeks. It looked at this stage that Galvin's dream season was in tatters. Kerry drove on without him and reached the All-Ireland final for a fifth successive year. Conveniently, Galvin's suspension ended on the day of the championship decider against Tyrone. While he did not start the game he came on as a substitute. An exciting game developed, one that was more competitive than the routs that had taken place at the same stage of the championship over the previous two years. The sides were level seven times before Colm Cooper nudged Kerry 0–8 to 0–7 ahead before the interval. Tyrone simply wore Kerry into the ground in the second half as a priceless goal from Tommy McGuigan and a string of late points inspired Tyrone to their third All-Ireland title of the decade.[30]
2009 saw Galvin return to the half-forward line for Kerry's opening Munster semi-final meeting with Cork. That game ended in a draw, however, Kerry were well beaten in the replay. 'The Kingdom' were subsequently banished to the qualifiers where they had some unimpressive wins over Longford, Sligo and Antrim. Galvin and his squad later lined out in the All-Ireland quarter-final and thrashed Dublin before overcoming Meath in a disappointing semi-final. For the second year in-a-row Kerry faced Cork in the All-Ireland final. Surprisingly, the men from 'the Kingdom' went into the game as slight underdogs. This tag appeared to be justified when Galvin's side trailed by 1–3 to 0–1 early in the opening half. The Kerry team stuck to their gameplan while Cork recorded fourteen wides, and at the final whistle Kerry were the champions again by 0–16 to 1–9.[31] It was Galvin's fourth All-Ireland medal. He subsequently won an All-Star and the Footballer of the Year award.
In June 2010, Galvin was given an eight-week ban after the 2010 Munster Senior Football Championship semi-final replay win over Cork.[32] The GAA's Central Competitions Control Committee proposed the suspension after reviewing video evidence of Galvin putting his finger into Eoin Cadogan's mouth.[33]
On 1 February 2014, Galvin unexpectedly announced his retirement from inter county football in the aftermath of Kerry's opening round game of the 2014 National Football League.[34] Kerry had lost by one point to Dublin in a game in which Galvin had not been involved.[35][36][37][38]
On 3 March 2015, Galvin returned to the Kerry senior football panel.[39]

In February 2012, he came third in a poll to find Ireland's most desirable Valentines.[41]
In February 2013, he took delivery of a €60,000 Audi A5.[42]

Paul Galvin got engaged to Louise Duffy on a trip to New York in March 2014.[44] They got married on New Year's Eve 2015.[45]
Controversy[edit]
In October 2011, Galvin allegedly assaulted the impressionist Oliver Callan and his producer James McDonald[46][47] late at night in Kehoe's Pub, Central Dublin. Among witnesses to the alleged incident were a Government Minister, a TD, a senator and several journalists. One witness alleged Galvin called Callan a "Fucking Cunt".[48] Callan later described how Galvin approached him with "his eyes bulging" and looking "crazy".[49] The incident was investigated by the Garda Síochána.[1] The media speculated on the reason behind the alleged incident, reporting that Callan had recently mimicked Galvin asking Taoiseach Enda Kenny to man-up by giving him a body-wax on Green Tea[50] and that Galvin had texted Callan before an appearance on The Saturday Night Show in relation to "gay jibes" the satirist had directed at him.[51] It was eventually revealed that Galvin had complained (or not complained at all)[52] to RTÉ after what he described as "the most excruciating night of my life" at home on his sofa between his parents in Kerry watching The Saturday Night Show when Callan referred to Galvin's "years spent in the closet".[53]
On 6 December 2011, Galvin spoke of the encounter during an interview on The Ray D'Arcy Show on Today FM.[54][55]

Mr. Galvin, 52, is the chairman, chief executive and a founder of SG Blocks, a publicly traded company that repurposes maritime-grade steel cargo shipping containers into green building blocks for use in commercial, industrial and residential building construction. The containers are provided by ConGlobal Industries, a partner.The company, which was started in 2007, is based in New York.Interview conducted and condensed by
VIVIAN MARINOQ. Why did you start this company?A. I had gotten into real estate development through a charity that I co-founded and was involved in running, and we were developing housing programs for individuals and families with AIDS. So we had to figure out a way to give them continuum care — we had to get good at real estate. And we started to develop affordable housing.If you’ve ever done any development in New York, you know that the construction process is not always as predictable as you would like, and so I saw this as a way to create a sustainable alternative in the marketplace and eliminate some of the risk of site-base construction.

Q. Where did you do work for the charity?A. Throughout Brooklyn and the Bronx.Q. Have you thought about reaching out to Mayor Bill de Blasio’s office about providing affordable housing alternatives using these containers?A. Yeah. The marketplace seems to be heading toward smaller-footprint living and working spaces, particularly for millennials who are coming into the economy and having a rough time of it. We think our product lends itself to those kinds of creative spaces.We worked with the last administration, especially after Sandy. We actually had proposed providing 400 or 500 temporary stores in impacted areas with a private sponsor, but that never went off.Q. You just finished a container-based project in Nashville.A. Yes, that was a retail project.Q. You’re working with other partners, including Palladium Management, on a mixed-use, multifamily project in New York. A. Our product is engineered to go nine stories high, so right now we’re vetting one site in particular very closely in Manhattan for a mixed-use project.

We think, plus or minus, the building will be somewhere around 16,000 to 17,000 square feet. We don’t make one container an apartment — maybe we’ll engineer four or five to create four apartments, and we take out the side walls to facilitate that.That building will probably be one floor commercial and seven apartments, a few of which will be duplexes.We have a letter of intent signed and partnership documents are being finalized. It would be a partnership with the landowner. I’m under an agreement; I can’t say who.

Q. Assuming everything is finalized as planned, when would you like to see the project completed?A. We’d like to have the building delivered by late fall of this year.Q. That’s pretty fast.A. We’re doing a restaurant today — Do you know Bareburger? — in Oyster Bay Cove. It’s an 11-container restaurant, so around 2,300 square feet. We just did the first seven containers between 8 o’clock and 12 o’clock today. And then tomorrow morning the last four will come. And the building will be closed in a day and a half.Q. How strong are these container foundations?A. The containers are originally engineered to a very strict criteria — it’s called a Convention for Safe Containers. So that sounds boring, and it is. But every container in the world has to be built to that specification because they self-center and lock when they’re at sea.Q. And they meet all of the requirements from the Buildings Department? A. We meet or exceed all of the structural codes. And we have spent the better part of our existence getting permitted and approved in the biggest cities and the biggest jurisdictions as well as creating engineering tools that will help predict our building’s behavior in the built environment.Just to note that containers are 8,000 pounds. They can hold up to 50,000 pounds of cargo. So at sea that bottom container is holding up eight of its brothers and sisters. That’s 600,000 pounds of load at the dynamic forces at sea. It’s a highly oxidized steel and it’s engineered to be beaten up by saltwater at sea and to take a pounding.Q. Is it cheaper to build this way?A. I would say in Manhattan and the tristate area definitely. We quantify it in terms of economic impact. We just don’t go on price. We’re going to finish the construction in half the time, so that all of your soft costs — construction interest, builders risk, site security, building utilities — are going to be halved. And in addition to saving all that money and time, you’re getting your revenue in half the time, so if a traditional build is 24 months, and we open you in 12, you get a whole year of income.

Q. How much do the containers cost?A. A brand new one could be $5,500 and an older one could be $2,000. Over time they could be a little more banged up or dented. But we know which walls are coming out so we can buy containers where half the walls are all banged up because we know that wall is coming out.Q. Is it harder designing a structure using containers as the foundation? A. We’ve really approached this as an engineered building system. Every building system has some constrictions. Every product and every site works for containers. I would say that within reason we’ve been able to date to create the structure and the space plan that the structure affords. We’ve been able to successfully do that so far.A building that would be, say, 100 percent curved wall glass on every side we would not recommend you use the containers.Q. Could you ever see yourself living in a container-built home?A. I’m designing one for a second home as we speak. I’m also looking at lots now. According to my wife these are the finalists: the Hamptons, the Hamptons, the Hamptons and maybe the Berkshires.It’s like midcentury modern architecture.

Galvin: ‘I don’t deserve to die’




The convicted killer’s plea for his life doesn’t deter a Berks County judge from formally imposing the death sentence for the murder.

Berks County, PA -

Bryan S. Galvin



Bryan S. Galvin broke his silence Thursday in Berks County Court when he told a judge that he should not die for the January 2006 slaying of his friend.

“The jury convicted me of first-degree murder, but I don’t deserve to die,” Galvin said before Judge Paul M. Yatron formally imposed the death sentence.

“I want to thank my friends and family for their love and support,” Galvin said.

Galvin did not testify during his trial, which concluded Aug. 13 when a Luzerne County jury imposed the death sentence.

The same jury had convicted Galvin, 42, of the 300 block of South 18th Street of first-degree murder for the killing of Kristofer Kolesnik, 32, of 21 S. 11th St.

Galvin told his lawyers, Chief Public Defender Glenn D. Welsh and Assistant Public Defender Timothy Biltcliff, not to present evidence during the penalty phase of the trial to convince the jury to spare his life.

Death penalty cases are automatically appealed to the state Supreme Court.

“Bryan Galvin is a poster child for the death penalty,” District Attorney Mark C. Baldwin said. “I am confident that one day a governor will sign a death warrant for Bryan Galvin.”

Kolesnik’s girlfriend, Wendy Hess of Reading, wept as she told the judge that Kolesnik’s life should never have been taken.

“Justice needs to be served,” Hess said. “His life was taken for no reason.”

Yatron noted that there are few executions in Pennsylvania.

“We have had about three death sentences carried out in 30 years,” he said.

The last execution in Pennsylvania occurred July 6, 1999, when Gary Heidnick received a lethal injection for killing two women he had imprisoned in his Philadelphia home.

In the Galvin trial, witnesses testified Galvin shot Kolesnik in the head Jan. 30, 2006, then wrapped the body in a tarp and put it in a van.

Galvin was on his way to dump the body in a remote area when police stopped him in Kenhorst for driving at night without headlights.

During the trial, Baldwin was not permitted to tell the jury that Galvin was accused of killing a friend, Todd Heck, in 1991.

After three trials, Galvin was acquitted in May 1999. By then, he had already served eight years in prison.

Galvin was sentenced July 13, 1983, to four to 16 years in state prison after he was convicted of a robbing and assaulting a 73-year-old Reading woman who suffered broken bones in her face.

In the recent trial, the jury was bused daily from Wilkes-Barre because of extensive pretrial publicity in Berks.

                  I have taken Galvin for 4 classes and while his lectures can get mundane, he is a wise teacher who knows a lot about psychology. He makes you think critically and challenges your thought processes to make you figure out the solution on your own (like a psychologist should). I recommend trying to connect with him, you will get more out of the class

                  I took health psych online with Dr. Galvin. I learned so much and the activities he had for us made me learn and retain the informatikn better than any other class. He is outstanding and I highly recommend him for any class not just health psych. He is great in every class. I would take another class with him.

CARING


                  Prof Galvin is a wonderful person.  took Health Psychology with him and the book was only used for weekly online quizzes that you could totally BS through.  While the class itself was whatever and very easy I'm happy i got to take it with Galvin, the man is there for his students, being Psych related or just anything in general and thats great

                  Class was a joke. You pretty much get an A if you do the work (regardless of quality of your work). Good for a GPA booster, bad if you actually care about your education and want to get something meaningful out of a class.

                  Participation definitively is a huge part of this class, but he was very understanding to absences if you let him know by email and reached out to talk to him. He didn't lecture much, the class was based on class discussion. He would have us read articles and a few students would lead the discussion. I loved this class! He was a great resource!

                  His attendance rule is crazy, but going to class is a total waste of time. He doesn't ever teach, he just drones on and isn't good for anything except as a cure for insomnia. Listening to him talk is worse than listening to a Nickelback album on repeat.

                  He is awful. I refuse to take another class with him. When he's instructing a class he will not give any relevant information and is unhelpful. He does not respond to emails and does not helpsupport his students. He's extremely passive aggressive and does not take students personal lives into consideration. He leaves you wondering where you stand.

                  Being in a class with him is just painful. He doesn't use class time effectively, can't convey his thoughts articulately, and offers very little assistance if you ask for help, even if it's a simple yesno question. I definitely don't recommend him.

                  I have to say this is the worst professor I ever had. This was an online course and he had NO involvement whatsoever. Assignments were rarely posted on time, emails were never answered and involvement in the discussions was non-existent. The class basically taught itself. Tests had obscure answers and no feedback was available. Stay away!

                  Mixed feelings about this guy. He encourages creativity and "thinking like a researcher" which is really nice, but when it comes to the technical aspects of the material (SPSS), the entire class is left defenseless. This gets exceedingly frustrating. I do not feel prepared to take a higher level research course.

                  I graduated a number of years ago & still continue to think of Dr. Galvin as the best prof I had as an undergrad.  He pushes his students to internalize and work with the material, not just regurgitate it for an exam.

                  Health psych was fairly interesting but I think what he lectured on in two hours could have been done in 1 to 1 1/2 hrs max. Very nice person but sort of mundane teaching style. Pretty relaxed class, with weekly quizzes online and weekly journal assignments.

                  Great for an intership.  Keeps it simple and just requires monthly reports.  Only meet once a month.  Really great guy, super nice and understanding!
