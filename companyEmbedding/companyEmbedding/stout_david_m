Phil Murray / Otterbase
David worked for us as a contractor. We received numerous praise from his managers on his work ethic and his technical skills.
													David was very easy to work with and we knew that he did an amazing job with our client. I would highly recommend David and hope to work 
													with him again.






Ian Coburn / Universal Forest Products
I'm really glad to have met and worked with Dave - he's a pleasure to work with, besides being very technically skilled and a
													formidable designer. In the time we worked together I noticed how capable Dave was, whether it was on his own going out of his way to

													of the work he'd do. I'd definitely look forward to working with Dave again on any project, and I'd recommend him any time.

If you are browsing this page, you more than likely are here by a referral, most likely a job application. Feel free to take a look around.
														This website was completely customized in Notepad++ so this wasn't done in a WYSIWYG editor 
														and the design was customized in CSS. For most of my web projects, my preference is to work in the code because not only are there some limitations
														to WYSIWYG editors, they often code poorly.
Anyways, look the site over, hope it's a relatively enjoyable experience ... at least as much as one can have looking at a website about a guy.
