How the BuildZoom Score works








Follow this contractor

















Before you Hire

Here are some rules, regulations, and laws governing general contractors
in Maine:













Does Richard S. Mahoney carry a valid contracting license?



Maine requires contractors to be licensed to perform work on manufactured or modular homes. A contractors license is not needed to do remodeling or new construction work on typical residential homes
Richard S. Mahoney currently holds license LM50017193 (Limited Electrician), which was Inactive when we last checked. 











Your liability risk when hiring Richard S. Mahoney



Maine does not require contractors to carry general liability or workers' compensation insurance. Regardless, it is advisable to hire contractors with active policies for both forms of insurance. Request a copy of the insurance certificates for your records.











How is the BuildZoom score calculated?



The BuildZoom score is based on a number of factors including the contractor's license status, insurance status, verified work history, standing with local consumer interest groups, verified reviews from other BuildZoom users and self-reported feedback from the contractor.











Why you should hire through BuildZoom



When it comes to major construction work or even minor alterations to your home, hiring the wrong contractor could result in incomplete or defective work.You may even find yourself dealing with huge liability claims. BuildZoom does the homework for you and helps you hire the right contractor.











You should get several bids before hiring a contractor



Before hiring a contractor in Maine, be sure to get at least 3 detailed bids. Quality contractors will take the time to explain their budget proposal, and help guide you through the estimate process. Be wary of an abnormally low bid, they are not worth the risk.These underpriced projects often do not end well for the homeowner, so choose a contractor you trust and can clearly communicate with. BuildZoom has made the bid collection process extremely simple (and free). Click here to get started.

Richard C. Mahoney joined Kenny, Brimmer & Mahoney, LLC in 1979, later becoming a principal in the firm in 1986.  Mr. Mahoney has experience in diverse areas of law, including personal injury and pedestrian accidents; wrongful death; medical malpractice actions; insurance defense; premises liability; insurance coverage issues; real estate; probate; business organization; contract litigation; landlord / tenant matters; workers compensation; foreclosure mediation; wills, trusts and estates; and will contests.  He has been practicing law for 35 years, and has conducted many trials and appeals, representing plaintiffs and defendants in virtually all types of litigation.
Mr. Mahoney has argued cases before the Connecticut Supreme Court and Connecticut's appellate courts, concerning issues which have contributed significantly to the development of Connecticut law including: Cora Sokolowski v. Medi Mart, Inc., 24 Conn. App. 276, 587 A.2d 1056 (1991); Andrew Dawson, et al. v. David Farr, et al., 227 Conn. 780, 632 A.2d 41 (1993); Puchalsky v. Rappahahn, 63 Conn. App.72 774 A.2d 1029 (2001); Stanley v. Lincoln, 75 Conn. App. 781 818 A.2d 783 (2003); and Gordon and Downs v. HNS Management Company, Inc., 272 Conn. 81, 861 A.2d 1160 (2004).  He has attained the highest possible rating of "AV" from Martindale-Hubbell, the national directory of attorneys, indicating preeminent legal ability and the highest ethical standards in the practice of law.
In 1999, the judges of the Superior Court of Connecticut appointed Mr. Mahoney a state mediator, fact finder, and arbitrator and he continues to serve in that capacity. He has also acted as a private mediator and arbitrator for attorneys from Connecticut, Massachusetts, and New York.  In 2014, Attorney Mahoney was invited to join the National Academy of Distinguished Neutrals of which he is now a member due to his expertise in arbitrations and mediations. He continues his dedication to the community through his involvement in civic and community work.
