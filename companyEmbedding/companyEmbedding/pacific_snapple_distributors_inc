These factors are similar to those you might use to determine which business to select from a local Yellow Pages directory, including proximity to where you are searching, expertise in the specific services or products you need, and comprehensive business information to help evaluate a business's suitability for you. “Preferred” listings, or those with featured website buttons, indicate YP advertisers who directly provide information about their businesses to help consumers make more informed buying decisions. YP advertisers receive higher placement in the default ordering of search results and may appear in sponsored listings on the top, side, or bottom of the search results page.Sort:DefaultDefaultDistanceRatingName (A - Z)Sponsored LinksAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your other collection!Error when adding to other collectionThis business was removed from the other collection1. Pacific Snapple Distributors3220 E 26th StVernon, CA 90058(323) 268-7779Beverages-Distributors & BottlersWebsiteBusinesses in related categories to Beverages-Distributors & BottlersAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your home collection!Error when adding to home collectionThis business was removed from the home collectionPREFERRED2. Mountain Valley Water CoBBB Rating: A+Serving the Vernon Area.(800) 499-9982Beverages-Distributors & BottlersWebsiteMore InfoFrom Business: Spoken Languages: English/SpanishAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your other collection!Error when adding to other collectionThis business was removed from the other collection3. Kaufman Container Company(1)BBB Rating: A+Cleveland, OH 44135(888) 489-7720Bottle Caps & SealsWebsiteMore InfoI run a small business and want to continue to meet my customers needs at a high level.
