Q2Earth – Quality Products, Quality Service
































Quality Products, Quality Service












The Problem
33% of the Earth’s farmable land has degraded from overuse, extreme climate and chemical application. This impacts the food we eat, the water we drink and the air we breathe.





The Solution
Compost and other manufactured soils are proven, natural, sustainable solutions for restoring Soil Health, conserving water, reducing chemical usage and limiting pollution.





Our Approach
Q2Earth contributes to restoring soil health by manufacturing the highest quality Compost and Engineered Soils for use in farming, landscaping, construction and other sectors.









 



What is Compost?
Compost is made from the natural decomposition of organic waste. Given the right time, temperature and touch, yard waste, biosolids from water treatment facilities, and food waste can become a nutrient rich soil additive.


What are Engineered Soils?
Using Compost as the nutrient-rich primary building block, Engineered Soils combine compost, sand, clay and other aggregates/organics in a prescribed recipe to meet the needs of customers from farmers and landscapers to contractors and builders.


Why Compost?
Composting is one of the best ways to divert waste from landfills and convert it into beneficial reuse products. From a business perspective, it provides multiple revenue sources using proven, low-tech processes.
Learn more about The Compost Story.











The Opportunity
Q2Earth sees a great opportunity to consolidate a highly fragmented compost manufacturing industry, work closely with compost facility owners and, under experienced leadership, deliver quality soil products and quality service to customers nationwide.

 










 




Our Approach
Q2Earth will grow and optimize operations of acquired and developed compost facilities by:

Making the owners of acquired facilities part of Q2Earth’s success
Introducing top management and access to growth capital
Transitioning facilities to focus on quality product manufacturing
Cross-pollinating best operating practices to increase efficiencies and profitability
Expanding product selection, differentiation and distribution channels
Building the broadest national footprint to service large customers in multiple sectors









 



Our Mission
Our mission is to do good for planet Earth by making and promoting sustainable soils that replenish the land, conserve water, boost food supply and reduce pollution.
In our pursuit of sustainability, we want to build the preeminent soil manufacturing company selling the highest quality products to the agriculture, horticulture and construction sectors.

(  OTCQB :  QPWR ) announced today that it has signed a term sheet with ERTH Products LLC of Metro Atlanta, GA, to expand throughout the United States the markets for certified compost and engineered soils utilizing bio-solids from waste water treatment plants that are usually landfilled or land applied.ERTH Products owns and operates a large compost manufacturing facility in Plains, GA, from which it has serviced multiple waste water treatment plants for over 20 years. From these waste resources, ERTH produces high quality compost and engineered soils formulated to improve the control of storm water runoff, conserve water during the low-flow periods, and reduce pollution associated with runoff. These soils are used in commercial and municipal construction and infrastructure projects, rooftop gardens, water retaining structures and other landscapes designed to increase urban greenspace, reduce urban heat island effects, improve air quality, and provide a more aesthetically pleasing and sustainable environment.The term sheet includes provisions for a worldwide license for Q2Power to utilize ERTH's knowhow, formulas and blends, business processes, product brands and other intellectual property to expand the composting and engineered soils opportunity to other waste water treatment plants. This license and other terms are subject to the completion of final agreements."We are pleased to take this important first step with ERTH Products, one of the leading bio-solids composting companies in the Unites States," stated Kevin Bolin, Chairman of Q2Power. "This proposed partnership could greatly expand Q2Power's offerings to waste water treatment plants, create additional revenue streams, and provide us with the expertise and reputation to implement our growth strategy in this field.""We are thrilled to work with Q2Power, as we see a mutually beneficial relationship in expanding not only the ERTH brand and market share, but also growing our composting and recycled soils market nationwide," stated Wayne King Sr., Chairman of ERTH and former President of the United States Composing Counsel. "Giving waste water treatment facilities the power to become renewable resource recovery centers is a long term vision of ours, which we believe to be critical in building sustainable platforms to conserve water, nutrients and resources for our environment."ERTH (which stands for Environmental Resource and Technology for Humanity) sells its compost under the tradename ERTH FOOD®, an all-purpose slow-release fertilizer and soil amendment with a guaranteed nutrient analysis. ERTH FOOD® is a Class A "Exceptional Quality" bio-solid compost as regulated by the EPA, and further, contains a United States Composting Council's (USCC) Seal of Testing Assurance documenting that it is a certified compost meeting the high contractual testing standards required by the USCC.Mr. Bolin continued: "The business of bio-solid composting can provide Q2Power with tipping fees from waste water treatment plants which typically cover the costs of transporting the materials to a partnering compost facility and production of the primary compost product. This finished product can be sold into the agricultural industry, or upgraded to engineered soils used in the construction industry. While a smaller but growing market, engineered soils for construction and state or federal infrastructure projects provides the greatest margins and, in our opinion, the most beneficial use for bio-solid compost products. We intend to pursue that market strongly."About Q2Power TechnologiesQ2Power seeks to become a leading provider of waste management services for small-scale waste water treatment plants and other producers of methane and organic waste. Q2Power's current combined heat and power technology can be deployed with minimal time and expense at thousands of small-scale facilities that must dispose of waste such as methane, biogas and other used fuels at increasingly greater costs. Through an association with ERTH Products, Q2Power plans to also convert bio-solid waste from water treatment plants into beneficial reuse products such as compost and engineered soils. Q2Power installed its first power system this summer at an Ohio wastewater treatment plant and is on track to deploy commercial units and bio-solid solutions to meet customer demand in 2016.Read MoreFor more information about Q2Power, please visit: www.q2p.comLegal Notice Regarding Forward-Looking Statements: This news release contains "Forward-looking Statements".

(OTCMKTS:QPWR) Q2Power Technologies, Inc., formerly Anpath Group, Inc., is a holding company for its subsidiary, Q2Power Corp. (Q2P). The Company, through Q2P, operates a renewable power company focused on the conversion of waste to energy and other reuse products. In May 2016, the Company began exploring other synergistic business lines, such as composting from waste water biosolids. Its system harvests waste biogas from waste water treatment facilities, landfills and livestock farms. Through an external combustion process, it converts these resources into green electricity for use at the host facility or back to the grid. The Company’s pilot installation is located at the waste water treatment plant in Lancaster, Ohio. The Company’s technology includes a reciprocating piston external heat engine (the Q2P Engine). It has also developed other technologies to support a total combined heat and power (CHP) system around the Q2P Engine, such as waste fuel burners, controls and other subcomponents.

P/E Ratio (TTM) The Price to Earnings (P/E) ratio, a key valuation measure, is calculated by dividing the stock's most recent closing price by the sum of the diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the trailing 12 month period.  Earnings Per Share (TTM) A company's net income for the trailing twelve month period expressed as a dollar amount per fully diluted shares outstanding. Market Capitalization Reflects the total market value of a company. Market Cap is calculated by multiplying the number of shares outstanding by the stock's price. For companies with multiple common share classes, market capitalization includes both classes. Shares Outstanding Number of shares that are currently held by investors, including restricted shares owned by the company's officers and insiders as well as those held by the public. Public Float The number of shares in the hands of public investors and available to trade. To calculate, start with total shares outstanding and subtract the number of restricted shares. Restricted stock typically is that issued to company insiders with limits on when it may be traded. Dividend Yield A company's dividend expressed as a percentage of its current stock price.

Money Flow Uptick/Downtick Ratio Money flow measures the relative buying and selling pressure on a stock, based on the value of trades made on an "uptick" in price and the value of trades made on a "downtick" in price. The up/down ratio is calculated by dividing the value of uptick trades by the value of downtick trades. Net money flow is the value of uptick trades minus the value of downtick trades.
