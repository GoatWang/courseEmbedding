Prospective Home Buyers
A very important step in the home-buying process is to get pre-qualified for a mortgage:This will give us an idea of the price range that you can afford so that we can go out and find the best deal on a home that is right for you.
Getting pre-qualified will require that you provide a lender with some basic information on your income, assets, and debt. We can arrange to have this done for you at no cost.
Another benefit in getting pre-qualified is that it is an expression of your seriousness in purchasing a home, which may be a deciding factor in a situation of competing offers from other not-yet qualified buyers on your dream home.

		SERVICES

LG Property Management is committed to their customers and the properties to which they are entrusted to manage. With the help of their loyal, well-trained staff, they have managed countless projects including small to large residential and small to large commercial properties. Listed below are services we provide:

Condominium Management Skilled in budgeting and negotiations, we are able to provide quality management services to Condominiums Associations while keeping costs to a minimal. We work hard to safe guard your expenses while keeping your Building safe, clean and fully operational.

Tenant placement We run ads continually to generate interest in our properties. 100% of our prospective tenants complete application forms. We follow up to verify employment, rental history, credit and criminal history. This reduces the chance that the tenant might be problematic.

Regular property inspections We conduct an inspection of the grounds and all units in the property approximately every 30 days. This is to ensure the property is being well kept and we pro-actively address any issues before they become too large or expensive to manage.

Collections/Accounting We assume the burden of collection and reconciliation. We report back once per month with financials to show both collections as well as cash disbursements. We can customize our reports to illustrate tenant payment histories or tax information. Condominium Boards receive monthly accounting reports.

Maintenance services During our inspections or prompted by tenants we record all repairs that are required so that the property remains well kept. We try, whenever possible, to maintain the property using in-house personnel. Our talented handymen deliver quality work at a fraction of the going rate.

Evictions We collect and record all rent from tenants. Tenants are apprised of the expectations in regards to payment from the onset. If rent is not paid by the 6th of every month, we begin the process necessary to collect rent or evict tenant.

 Who We Are & What We Do
Welcome to LG Property Investment LLC, where good folks make extra money, in their spare time, on their own schedule, with no strings attached.

	We are private Real Estate Investors in the business of buying Vacant Properties. We are associated with a national network of similar professionals and have tremendous buying power.

	Because of this significant buying power we are constantly in need of a fresh and on-going supply of properties to buy. Our criteria is really quite simple. We look for Vacant Houses & Commercial Properties with NO "For Sale" sign on them. We don't need help finding properties listed with Realtors and we generally don't need help finding properties that are For Sale By Owner (FSBO). There is an occasional exception to this that we can examine later.
 
Where you fit in is helping us to find those properties. All you need is transportation, a digital camera, a little time - on your schedule and a desire to make extra money.

	We then buy many of those properties for investment. The good news is, that whether we buy or not, you make your money.
 
How You Will Make Money
There are two ways you can make money with us.

	The first way you will make money is by finding us "leads" or houses that fit our criteria. We provide all the training and guidance you need, so that your time and effort is maximized and you receive the greatest reward for your effort.

	For leads that you find which meet our simple criteria within a 20-mile radius of our location, we pay a minimum of $5 each, and in some cases, more. From 20 to 40 miles, we pay $10 or more per lead. All you do is spot the vacant property, take a few digital photos, jot down a little information and you're on your way to the next lead. If you keep up the pace, you can easily earn $40 to $100 per hour for your time. That's why we say "You Set The Pay Rate".

	The second way to make money with us is to do a "drive by evaluation" on leads we provide in our lead pool. All you have to do is drive to the property, verify it's vacant, take a few pictures and estimate it's condition based on what you see when you're there. We pay a flat $5.00 per completed evaluation for this lead source.

	Once you join our team, you'll get training and guidance on the most effective ways to easily find vacant houses, how to canvas specific areas without back tracking or wasting time, how to easily submit your leads and how you'll get paid promptly for your effort.

	Are there vacant properties out there for you to spot? Yes!! There are more now than ever, and this is why it's so easy for you to make extra money. They're everywhere and... the environment is always changing. New vacancies are happening all the time, providing you new income all the time. We'll provide you with the areas to canvas in such a way that they are in constant rotation. This means you'll never run out of neighborhoods to canvas and leads to make money on.

	All you need is transportation, a digital camera, a little time on your schedule and a desire to be the best you can be.

	There is no cost to you to join our team, you make no commitment of production and we provide the training and guidance so that you can succeed.

You can think of these as two different company structures with very different tax requirements. Whichever way you choose to go, you're going to look more legit than the other guys. So just take a minute to consider your short-and long-term business goals to figure out which structure is best for you.
Advantages and Disadvantages
A limited liability company is a type of business structure that offers personal liability protections and a few tax advantages to boot. The "LL" in LLC is what protects your personal assets in the event of a judgment against your company. Corporations offer limited liability as well, so we're going to focus on the structural and taxation differences in the chart below.



Advantages of an LLC
Advantages of a Corporation




 No limit on the number of owners
 May issue shares of stock to attract investors


 Profit and loss are passed through to the owners' individual tax returns
 Corporate income splitting may help lower overall tax liability


 No annual meeting or minute book requirements
 






Disadvantages of an LLC
Disadvantages of a Corporation




 Cannot engage in corporate income splitting to lower tax liability
 C corp tax structure requires double taxation of corporate profits (s corp's does not)


 Cannot issue stock
 Must hold annual meetings and record minutes


 
 S corporations have restrictions on the number of owners



LLC or Corporation: Which One Is Right for Me?
Business goals aren't one size fits all, and neither is incorporating. When deciding which kind of corporation fits your business strategy, consider some of the differences that each kind offers. And take a deeper dive with our comprehensive comparison chart.
Find out which corporation is right for your business with our business wizard!

Along with picking the right entity type for your business, it's important to consider which state to incorporate in.
For most small business owners, the choice is simple: they incorporate in the state where their company is physically located, known as 'home state incorporation.' However, there are good reasons to consider forming your corporation or LLC in certain other states, including tax advantages, streamlined judicial processes, and easier business filing requirements.
For example, many business owners choose to incorporate in Delaware, which is a favored business jurisdiction for the previously mentioned and other reasons.

Delaware is widely considered to be one of the nation's most business-friendly jurisdictions. There are a number of reasons to incorporate your small business in Delaware, including:

Well-established and flexible business laws
Low franchise tax on small businesses
No tax on capital stock or assets
No state sales tax
A special business court (Court of Chancery) that minimizes the time and cost of commercial litigation
No residency requirement for shareholders, directors, and officers of a corporation or members or managers of an LLC
