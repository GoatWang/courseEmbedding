1. Organization


ASGI Aurora Opportunities Fund, LLC (the “Fund”), a Delaware limited liability company, has been registered as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “1940 Act”) since January 3, 2011.  The Fund is a closed-end management investment company.  Alternative Strategies Group, Inc. (the “Adviser”), a North Carolina corporation, is the investment adviser to the Fund.


The Fund’s investment objective is to generate consistent long-term capital appreciation with diversification of risk through the use of a “multi-manager, multi-strategy” global investment strategy.  The Fund seeks to accomplish this objective by allocating its capital primarily among a select group of collective investment vehicles (“Investment Funds”) managed by experienced investment managers (“Investment Managers”) that implement a number of different alternative investment strategies and invest in a variety of worldwide markets.


2. Fair Value Measurements
 
The Fund measures fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are:


● Level 1 – Unadjusted quoted prices for identical securities in an active market. Since valuations are based on quoted prices that are readily-accessible at the measurement date, valuation of these securities does not entail a significant degree of judgment.
● Level 2 – Quoted prices in non-active markets for which all significant inputs are observable either directly or indirectly. Level 2 inputs may also include pricing models whose inputs are observable or derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data.
● Level 3 – Prices or valuation techniques that require inputs that are both significant to the fair value and unobservable. Little if any market activity exists for Level 3 securities.


 


  


  





  


 

ASGI Aurora Opportunities Fund, LLC


Schedule of Investments (unaudited) (continued)
As of December 31, 2011

 
The Adviser considers subscriptions and redemption rights, including any restrictions on the disposition of the interest, in its determination of fair value.  Investments in the Investment Funds are included in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy if the Fund has the ability to redeem its investment within 90 days of fiscal period end by providing a redemption notice within 90 days of fiscal period end.  All other investments in Investment Funds are classified as Level 3.


The Fund recognizes transfers into and out of the levels indicated above at the end of the reporting period.
 
The inputs or methodology used for valuing securities are not necessarily an indication of the risk associated with investing in those securities.  A summary of the inputs used to value the Fund's members' capital as of December 31, 2011 is as follows:

There were no transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 investments in Investment Funds for the period ended December 31, 2011.  The net transfers out of Level 3 and into Level 2 investments in Investment Funds for the period ended December 31, 2011 was $908,665.  The net change in unrealized depreciation of Level 3 investments in Investment Funds still held as of December 31, 2011 was $2,112,736.


Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2009-12 permits a reporting entity to measure the fair value of an investment that does not have a readily determinable fair value, based on the net asset value per share (the “NAV”) of the investment as a practical expedient, without further adjustment, unless it is probable that the investment will be sold at a value significantly different than the NAV.  If the practical expedient NAV is not as of the reporting entity’s measurement date, then the NAV should be adjusted to reflect any significant events that may change the valuation.  In using the NAV as a practical expedient, certain attributes of the investment, that may impact the fair value of the investment, are not considered in measuring fair value.  Attributes of those investments include the investment strategies of the investees and may also include, but are not limited to, restrictions on the investor’s ability
to redeem its investments at the measurement date and any unfunded commitments.  The Fund is permitted to invest in alternative investments that do not have a readily determinable fair value, and as such, has elected to use the NAV as calculated on the reporting entity’s measurement date as the fair value of the investment.
 
 


  


  





  


 


ASGI Aurora Opportunities Fund, LLC


Schedule of Investments (unaudited) (continued)
As of December 31, 2011
 


The following is a summary of the investment strategies of the investments in the Investment Funds held in the Fund as of December 31, 2011:


Long/Short Equities strategies generally involve taking both long and short positions in equity securities that are deemed to be under or overvalued.  Although the combination of long and short investing can provide an element of protection against (but not eliminate) directional market exposure, long/short equities Investment Managers generally do not attempt to neutralize the amount of long and short positions (i.e., they will be net long or net short).  Investment Managers may specialize in a particular industry or geographic region, or they may diversify holdings across industries or geographic regions.  Investment Managers in this strategy usually employ a low to moderate degree of leverage.


Multi-Strategy Opportunistic strategies generally involve Investment Managers exercising discretion in allocating capital among several types of arbitrage, event-driven and directional strategies (e.g., long/short equities, relative value, long/short credit, activist, volatility trading and capital structure arbitrage).  Capital is opportunistically allocated as such Investment Managers perceive each strategy’s opportunity set changing with market conditions.


Event Driven strategies generally include investments in securities of companies involved in identifiable corporate actions, such as mergers, acquisitions, restructurings, spin-offs, shareholder activism, or other special situations which alter a company’s financial structure or operating strategy.  Risk management and hedging techniques may be employed to protect the portfolio from events that fail to materialize.  In addition, accurately forecasting the timing of an event is an important element impacting the realized return.  The use of leverage varies considerably.


Macro strategies generally involve fundamental, discretionary, directional trading in currencies, commodities, bonds and equities.  Investment Managers utilizing macro strategies invest in a wide variety of strategies and instruments, often assuming an aggressive risk posture.  Most Investment Managers rely on macro-economic analyses to invest across countries, markets, sectors and companies, and have the flexibility to invest in numerous financial instruments.  Futures, options and other derivative instruments are often used for hedging and speculation and the use of leverage varies considerably.


Long/Short Credit strategies generally involve Investment Managers taking both long and short positions in credit related instruments, such as corporate bonds, bank loans, trade claims, emerging market debt and credit derivatives (e.g., credit default swaps).  Investment Managers utilizing this strategy usually invest in companies in financial difficulty, reorganization or bankruptcy and their portfolios often are concentrated in debt instruments.  The use of leverage varies considerably.  Investment Managers differ in their preference for actively participating in the workout and restructuring process and the extent to which they use leverage.  Although Long/Short Credit strategies typically involve positions in debt instruments and credit derivatives, the Investment Managers implementing this strategy generally perform extensive research on companies and may use this information to invest both long and short in the equity
securities of such companies.
