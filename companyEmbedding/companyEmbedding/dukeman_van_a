About American Van Equipment

American Van Equipment began manufacturing and supplying local companies with ladder racks and van shelving in 1978. From the very start our goal was to provide top quality products at fair prices which when selling to a small community of customers is essential if you are going to build a successful business. As the company grew the merchandise line was expanded and the decision was made to develop a catalog displaying all our products that would enable us to broaden our market by mailing into other areas. This single decision enabled us to take our local small town ethic of top quality and fair prices to servicemen and contractors all across America. CONTINUE READING...

Ladder Racks





Ladder Racks



Van roof racks add additional cargo space by allowing ladders and other materials to be secured outside of the vehicle, on its roof. Ladder racks can be mounted on the top or side of the van and keep ladders secure during transit. They are also useful when a ladder is longer than the cargo area of the van. The ladder or other materials are secured to the outside, allowing for more room.
Truck racks are mounted over the bed of the truck and extend over the exterior of the cab. Ladders and other materials can be transported safely without the danger of sticking too far out of the bed of the truck or falling out while in transit. Truck ladder racks also keep the materials from shifting while the vehicle is in motion, making it safer for the driver, as well as for other drivers on the road. Shifting cargo or equipment can interfere with a driver’s ability to effectively operate the vehicle and that can become a road hazard. By keeping everything secure, this device is also an effective safety feature.
Van racking is easily installed and is usually bolted in place, then secured with brackets. This makes it easy to adjust as necessary, or remove and install on another vehicle. The rack may come as one piece, or as several individual pieces that are installed at interval along the roof. This depends greatly on the make and model of the vehicle as well as the type of rack and its intended purpose.

Accessories



There are many options when choosing van and truck accessories for a work vehicle. There are van accessories like racking that holds ladders, PVC pipes, lumber, and other items, keeping them secure and out of the cargo area. Tool storage is another common concern and there are many different drawers, bins, shelving, and modular units from which to choose.
Tool storage is one of the most commonly sought after types of van equipment, but safety features come in at a close second. Experts advise carrying warning and search lights in any personal or work vehicle so that in the event of an emergency they are available. It is a requirement for most work vehicles to have certain types of warning or emergency lights in or on the vehicle.
Interior lighting is another popular van accessory. Van interior lighting is used for mobile offices as well as the cargo area of a work van. Proper lighting allows for adequate visibility of items, materials, and tools that are stored in the bins, drawers, and shelves.
When thinking about van equipment, van tool storage is usually what comes to mind first, but other items such as power inverters, tie downs, vents, and work carts are all integral pieces to be included as well.
For vehicles that make stops on the roadway, triangle reflector kits and front bumper cone holders are a necessity. Another smart safety feature is a good back up alarm. It is also wise to include a good first aid kit in any work truck or van. Safety is always a priority.

Shelf And Bin Systems





Shelf And Bin Systems



Van Bin Systems keep tools, equipment, and materials organized inside the vehicle and prevent work materials from moving and shifting while the vehicle is in motion. Bin Systems can be contained in one part of the van, or can line both walls from floor to ceiling,  the entire length of the cargo area. The arrangement depends upon the demands of the business and personal taste of the individual.
Van shelving can be mounted on either side of your van, even over the wheel wells. Each shelf has a high front and rear lip to keep items from falling while the van is in motion. With a wide variety of shelving and bins combinations available, these shelving systems can typically be laid out to fit your individual needs.
Our Bins are not exclusively van equipment. Truck bin systems can also use these types of bins to organize the truck bed or the area behind the seats. This type of modular storage is used in both vans and trucks because the system can be built to the user’s specifications.
With Modular Storage and Truck Shelving, it is easy to turn a regular truck or van into a work vehicle or "Mobile Workshop". Keeping your tools and parts organized and easily available will save you time and money on each and every job!

Racks and Holders





Racks and Holders



Organizing a work van is no easy task. When juggling tools, equipment, and materials as well as invoices, books, and brochures it is easy for one to overwhelm the other. Van organizers help to keep brochures from being overrun by tools and invoices from getting lost among the materials. Using job specific holders it is much easier to keep both cabin and cargo area neat and organized. Form and book racks fit in the cabin and are attached to the partition. They keep invoices, brochures, and books organized. More importantly, they keep them off of the floor and out of the cargo area where they can become lost or damaged. Other job specific "holders" may have places for holding spools of wire, pipes, cleaning materials, tools, or caulk tubes. There are also free standing tank holders and pipe and conduit holders that sit in the cargo area of a van or the bed of a truck.
Door storage trays fit on the van’s rear doors providing additional storage space. Some racks have several shelves for materials or optional bins may be added to more securely contain items. They are typically bolted on, although some have brackets making installation fast and easy. The brackets make removal or transfer to another vehicle easy to do.
Van and truck organizers are a vital piece of truck and van equipment. From van racks to truck boxes and van holders to truck ladder racks - these truck and van accessories are what keep work vehicles organized and efficient.
