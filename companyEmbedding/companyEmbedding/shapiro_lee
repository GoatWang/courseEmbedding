Here are some of the more common dentists people seek out to improve their oral health:General Dentist
These dentists generally serve as the primary provider of dental care. If you need your teeth cleaned, crowns and bridges placed or any number of cosmetic procedures, book an appointment with a general dentist. Though not as common, these dentists will also provide more specialized services, including some forms of oral surgery - chief among them root canals and restorative care - fitting patients with a mouthguard and counseling people on how to stop smoking and what constitutes proper nutrition.Endodontist
To become an endodontist means undergoing an additional two years of training beyond dental school. As a result, these specialized dentists perform more specific procedures beyond general teeth cleaning and repair work. While a dentist may perform a handful of root canal treatments in a week, an endodontist may end up working on 20 or more in the same timespan. Your average endodontist also repairs teeth damaged by trauma and performs endodontic retreatments, which is repeat root canal procedure. Their added training also means that the endodontist is much more adept at utilizing complex dental equipment - especially ultrasonic instruments or microscopes. Most of that equipment is used to improve the health of teeth that are affected by disease and even congenital deformities.Pediatric Dentist
Proper oral care starts when you're young, and that's why pediatric dentists are so important. These dentists treat people under the age of 13, though there are exceptions based on a child's unique dental background. Pediatric dentists face unique challenges, because they must treat newly teething babies and children losing their primary teeth.Though cleanings are an integral part of their job, pediatric dentists are mostly concerned with planning ahead. That means working to ensure the child has straight teeth and correcting an improper bite. However, they also help address more child-specific conditions of thumb sucking and an over-reliance on pacifiers. As a result, pediatric dentists usually require an additional two-year residency working with infants and children.Oral Pathologist
Pathology refers to the study of disease, specifically as it presents in tissue. Oral pathologists, then, are responsible for studying the diseases that affect the tissue of the mouth and other surrounding muscle groups. These experts are considered to be true specialists, having focused their work on very niche areas of both dentistry and pathology. Though oral pathology is rather specialized, it's a vital component of the oral health industry. By analyzing tissue taken from biopsies, oral pathologists can help diagnose and eventually treat a number of oral diseases, including leukoplakia, cementoma and squamous cell carcinoma, among others.Periodontist
Similar to the endodontist, periodontists receive several additional years of training beyond dental school. However, whereas endodontists study advanced treatments, periodontists generally have a very specific field of interest. Your average periodontist focuses less on cleanings and more on diagnosing and treating gingivitis, periodontitis, which is an untreated form of the aforementioned ailment, and other periodontal diseases. Periodontists treat patients with more complicated oral care backgrounds, those people who require root planing - where dentists clean any infected surfaces - and root debridement, or the removal of dead tissue. Periodontists are especially concerned with proper gum health, including painful recession and teeth alignment.Cosmetic Dentist
Most of the aforementioned dentists are concerned with the health and well-being of a patient's teeth. While that is important to cosmetic dentists, they specialize in a number of different treatments meant to enhance the look or aesthetic of your teeth. To begin the average appointment, cosmetic dentists will examine your teeth for any imperfections or irregularities, and then suggest ways to make your teeth more white or properly aligned. The most popular such treatments are bleaching - where special chemicals are used to whiten your teeth - placing veneers or caps to alter the appearance of teeth, and bonding, where dentists fill unappealing gaps with structural replacement material.Orthodontist
Orthodontists are responsible for treating most dental irregularities, which includes everything from misaligned jaws - like an under or overbite - to overcrowding teeth and even certain cosmetic issues. Following dental school, the would-be orthodontist then has another three years of schooling, most of which is clinical experience in an orthodontic residency program. To properly diagnose and treat most dentofacial issues, the orthodontist relies on a collection of corrective gear. That includes braces, retainers and various facemask configurations. Though orthodontists work with people of all ages, the bulk of patients are young children and teens.Prosthodontist
Similar to the field of orthodontics, the average prosthodontist receives an additional three years of training following dental school. And though prosthodontics is something of a cosmetic field like orthodontics, it's primarily concerned with replacing missing teeth. Prosthodontists have a number of teeth-replacing procedures to implement, including filling veneers, onlays and inlays, bridges, crowns and complete or partial dentures. Beyond their work in implant dentistry, these experts treat a number of other mouth-related ailments, namely snoring, post-cancer jaw reconstruction, traumatic injuries and pain related to lock jaw and other temporomandibular joint disorders.Oral and Maxillofacial Radiologist
Similar to endodontists, these specialists - one of nine such unique fields recognized by the American Dental Association - utilize machinery to treat and diagnose patients. Specifically, these dentists make use of radiographic imaging to treat those diseases and ailments that impact the teeth, mouth and the maxillofacial region, which consists of the face and jaw. While X-rays are a popular option, OMRs also rely on plain and computed tomography, MRIs, ultrasounds and other forms of digital imaging. OMRs are among the first adaptors of new technology, using innovations in the field of imaging to find increasingly effective ways at understanding the impact of oral disease and what that means to patients.Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeon
Your primary dentist may refer you to an oral and maxillofacial surgeon if you experience facial pain, or if he or she suspects you have some variety of oral cancer. OMSs are also your primary source when planning most oral surgeries, like tooth extractions, cyst repairs and removals, and dental implants. However, an OMS can also treat a number of other ailments and diseases related to the maxillofacial region. For instance, malformations in your facial bones can cause sleep apnea, and an OMS can perform corrective surgery that removes or shapes bone. Many of these experts are also involved with more cosmetic procedures, performing or assisting with facial implants and rhinoplasty, in which the nose bone is modified.Dental Public Health Clinics
These clinics are available in most cities across the U.S., and they're meant to offer affordable health care to many low-income families and individuals. Though it differs depending on the specific clinic, the average clinic offers only the most essential oral care services, including X-rays, teeth cleaning, basic root canals and repairs, and tooth extractions. The fees an individual pays depend on a number of different factors, and most clinics have a sliding-fee that is determined equally by income and family size.Most Common Oral Care IssuesThere are several different kinds of dentists, each one with his or her own specialty. However, there are a core group of ailments all dentists treat. Conditions include:Tooth Decay: When your teeth fall out or begin to disintegrate in your mouth, improper brushing is often to blame. Certain infections also cause tooth loss or decay. One of the most affective ways to prevent tooth decay is with regular brushing and flossing right at home.Bad Breath: As your teeth fall out or you don't brush properly, your gums and teeth begin to break down and cause foul odors. Other causes of bad breath include gum disease and oral infections. As with tooth decay, brushing and flossing are vital, as is regular tongue scraping and the use of mouthwash.Teeth Sensitivity: Some people are born with teeth that are naturally sensitive to cold. A lack of brushing can also comprise your teeth's natural protection. The best method to help protect otherwise sensitive teeth is to use specialized toothpaste geared toward people with worn or damaged teeth.Dry Mouth: Certain medications will cause your salivary glands to stop producing spit. This in turn can harm the structure of your teeth and gums. There are several at-home measures you can take to combat dry mouth. These include regular hydration, chewing sugar-free gum, which also hydrates your mouth, and avoiding mouthwash with alcohol in it, which dries out your entire mouth.Teeth Grinding: For many people, grinding their teeth - also known as bruxism - is a subconscious behavior, usually the result of stress. It can eventually damage your teeth. The only way to treat your grinding habit is to meet with an endodontist, who will fit you with with a bite plate to mitigate the damage to your teeth.Mouth Sores: Also called canker sores, these painful bumps are the result of irritation to the soft tissue of your mouth. These sores can make brushing almost impossible. There are a number of different causes for sores, including anemia or a vitamin B-12 deficiency. As a result, your primary physician will have to examine the bump, find its root cause and then help develop a specific treatment plan, including the use of corticosteroids to reduce inflammation or antimicrobial mouthwash.Discoloration: Yellow teeth are the result of a number of bad habits, mainly smoking, drinking too much coffee and improper nutrition. Proper brushing can usually prevent discolored teeth before they happen. However, if your teeth become worse, many dentists will treat with a whitening procedure.A Guide for Dental Care BasicsProper oral care begins at home. The following are a few preventative measures you can take to keep your teeth and gums healthy. They just may reduce your time spent in your dentist's chair.Remember Your Angles
When brushing your teeth, always place the brush at a 45-degree angle. That way, you're able to hit every surface of each tooth.Don't Forget the Tongue
Within your mouth, your tongue is the largest source of bacteria. Be sure to brush it front to back and don't forget the sides.Floss Everyday
Brushing alone isn't enough to keep your mouth healthy, and that's why flossing is so important. Each time you floss, be sure to have at least 18 inches of floss available, which is what you should go through if you use proper technique. For optimal control, hold the floss between your thumbs and forefingers.Watch What You Eat
Sugar, alcohol and coffee all contain phosphorus. While some can prove beneficial, too much of this chemical can eat away at your teeth and gums.Keep in Mind the Mouthwash
Though not a requirement, mouthwash can be helpful if used to supplement proper brushing and flossing. Most mouthwash brands contain chlorine dioxide, a chemical that targets the majority of oral bacterial strains. However, don't overuse mouthwash, as it can cause a number of ailments.How to Choose The Right DentistProper oral care is an integral component of your greater well-being, which highlights why having the right dentist is of the utmost importance. Consider the following as you make an effort to find a dentist who will fit your unique medical history:Find a Recommendation
It's important to use a dentist whom you feel comfortable with. Because that's difficult to achieve by simply choosing names out of a phone book, you should always seek out a recommendation. Whether it's a friend, family member or co-worker, this individual can offer intimate details about a dentist's demeanor, operating style and approach to patient care. Be sure to always ask plenty of questions.Vet Your Dentist
Once you get a recommendation from a friend, don't simply book your first cleaning right away. Instead, meet with any prospective dentists to conduct a series of pretreatment interview. During this session, you can ask them about what treatments they perform most often, procedures they're not as familiar with, what accreditation they have or any organizations they belong to and how their offices handles insurance and payments. Just be aware that booking this time can be difficult based on a dentist's schedule.Consider Accessibility and Other Factors
Perhaps you've met a dentist with whom you feel comfortable. Not only that, but this dentist's payment options are suitable for your finances. However, don't be so quick to make a final decision, as other factors may influence your choice. Is the dentist's office nearby, or do you have to drive out of your way? Is the office open at a time that will fit the rest of your schedule? How much flexibility will the dentist's staff offer in booking appointments? Though seemingly trivial, these factors are nonetheless important.Check With Your State Board
One of the last things you should do before coming to a decision is to check with your state's dental board. Dentists must abide by different rules and regulations depending on where they practice, and the state board can outline what requirements your candidate must meet. These organizations can also offer information about any discrepancies in the dentist's background and if he or she has faced any disciplinary actions.Picking the Right Dental InsuranceAs with other forms of health care, insurance is a great way to both reduce associated costs and ensure you and your dependents receive the best care possible. However, you don't want to simply buy the first such plan you see. Here are some factors to consider when shopping for dental insurance:Pick Your Plan
There is no such thing as a one-size-fits-all dental insurance plan. Instead, most people purchase three main varieties, usually through their employers. An indemnity or fee-for-service plan is just as it sounds and means you'll have to pay for annual deductibles and co-insurance payments out of pocket. A preferred provider organization is less costly, and you choose from a network of dentists. However, PPOs have some limitations and accompanying deductibles. Similarly, a dental health maintenance organization plan limits you to just a few choices of dentists, and one doctor handles all of your oral care needs. However, these HMO are usually much less costly.Examine the Networks
As noted, PPO plans and dental HMOs work with only a select number of doctors. While that usually means fewer costs compared to other insurance plans or payment options, it also means you don't have quite as much say in the dentist who can treat you. That doesn't necessarily have to be a bad thing, especially if you know who is in the network. Before purchasing the plan, you'll receive a list of dentists in each network. Do research on each doctor - just as you would when picking a dentist otherwise. From there, you can then pick a plan with doctors who meet your standards and requirements.Consider Your Coverage
Sometimes, it's not just the doctor that you want to consider. For many people, even the plans with the best doctors are deemed a bad choice. The reason? The coverage is less-than-stellar. When picking a plan, you need to look at just how much you'll pay for each and every service. For instance, some plans won't cover your fillings or X-rays, while others may charge more or less for a crown or tooth extraction. Knowing just what you'll be responsible for is important, as you don't want to be caught off-guard by unforeseen charges. Depending on your employer, a human resources specialist can walk you through specific coverage options.Make Your Plan Work for You
It's a sad fact that the dentist you want most might not be covered by the plan you've purchased. However, that doesn't mean that you have to look for dental services elsewhere. If you're truly comfortable with a dentist and you feel he or she can be an ally in your ongoing oral care regimen, then consider signing a plan to just keep that dentist available. That means potentially deal with costs and other insurance-related factors that you might have wanted to. If need be, you might be able to work with the dentist's office to address some of the plan-specific concerns.

Dentists also cover the other parts of your body with a lead vest, deflecting radiation.See more Tips & AdviceSponsoredMedRite Urgent Care - Westside(1)330 W 42nd St, New York, NY 10036(888) 639-9825Walk In Medical Care-Emergency/General HealthcareWebsiteMake an AppointmentDirectionsVideoMore InfoDr. Marina Gafanovich, MD(42)1550 York Ave, New York, NY 10028(212) 249-6218Voted #1 Internist in NYC by Healthgrades.com!WebsiteCouponsDirectionsMore InfoMedRite Urgent Care-Gramercy380 2nd Ave, New York, NY 10010(888) 660-2766Walk In Medical Care-Emergency/General HealthcareWebsiteMake an AppointmentDirectionsVideoMore InfoMedRite Urgent Care - Eastside(9)919 2nd Ave, New York, NY 10017(888) 984-0253Walk In Medical Care-Emergency/General HealthcareWebsiteMake an AppointmentDirectionsVideoMore InfoAllergy & Asthma Referral Service642 Park Ave, New York, NY 10065(347) 504-6184WebsiteDirectionsMore InfoHaber Sol D139 Clinton St, Brooklyn, NY 11201(718) 717-8613WebsiteMake AppointmentDirectionsMore InfoIsland Rehabilitative Services470 Seaview Ave, Staten Island, NY 10305(718) 407-4645State-of-the-Art HemodialysisWebsiteDirectionsMore InfoIsland Nephrology Services, PC470 Seaview Ave, Staten Island, NY 10305(718) 395-9238WebsiteDirectionsMore InfoLaser Spine InstituteServing the New York area.(866) 382-7494WebsiteLocal ListingsVideoMore InfoDidn't find what you were looking for?magnifying glassHelpful Reviews Dr. Michael J. Wei, DDSJason L. ratedThere isn’t much more to say about the “Dr. Wei experience” that hasn’t been said already. Dr. Wei and staff exceed all the standard requirements of what you want in a dental office and then some. Of course you get a friendly and courteous staff, accurate scheduling, (I never wait), clean office, state of the art technology (the needle vibrates to mitigate pain, watch a movie during dental procedures) and very reasonable pricing for the high quality of work.But what makes Dr. Wei a great dentist, in addition to his precise craftsmanship and desire for perfection, is he is a great person. His demeanor and warm personality which can only come naturally, literally takes away the entire anxiety of a dentist visit. You don’t feel like you are visiting a dentist, you are visiting a friend that does dental work.Additionally, despite his often full schedule, his attentiveness always makes me feel like I am his first and only patient on every visit. Examples:Knowing I needed extensive work and that I travel 30+ miles from work for each visit (worth the trip), he immediately calendared me in for multiple future visits and precisely calculated the procedures he’d perform each visit so to minimize my visits. Of course, each visit went according to plan.He knew I had a wedding to attend thus needed my cracked veneer replaced (cracked veneer was from a FORMER dentist), concerned that the veneer would not be shipped to his office in time, Dr. Wei went out of his way on his day off to pick up the veneer from the lab so that I would have it in time for the wedding! I am quite confident that none of my previous dentists would have even considered doing that.Lastly, the customer service provided by the staff is First Class. As of the very first visit, they said that I would receive reimbursement from my dental insurance within 2 weeks and though I forgot about them (I am skeptic with insurance companies), it was a pleasant surprise the checks arrived! The team is also very diligent with following up the very next day on any procedures performed to ensure I am comfortable. They never miss a beat.As such, my search for a dedicated, punctual, reliable, flexible, honest, knowledgeable, caring, pride in their work, quality, dentist has ended at Dr. Wei and team. Like others, I highly recommend Dr. Wei. If you are skeptical, just chat with him for yourself.Dr. Michael J. Wei, DDSPaula M. ratedFirst let me start by saying i am a very honest reviewer and live my life by reviews for everything i do so this is my honest opinion.Dr Wei and his staff are so amazing!! I went to several dentists to make my decision about who is going to do my Veneer procedure, as I was SO embarrassed of my smile for years!  For me this was a big decision since it can get very costly depending on your needs. After seeing around 8 different dentists i decided to go with Dr. Wei I did as much research as i could on him and found with his credentials and the way he presented himself at my consolation won me over. Dr. Wei has a trusting caring way about him that made me so at ease from my first consultation up to the last day of my veneer procedure he offers different financial options that can help you pay for treatment and he ALWAYS works with your schedule. Dr. Wei is so gentle and makes you feel so calm you wish you would have found him years ago as that is how I feel.  Also Amanda his assistant is so wonderful with your needs. If i had any needs or concerns they would fit me in the same day with no problem just to make me feel happy and satisfied. My new veneers look so beautiful and natural it will really amaze you to see the before and after. I am no longer embarrassed to smile as i was or covering my mouth when I talk I am so much more confident and I can really cry when i think of what Dr. Wei corrected that i was most self conscious about. I will continue to see Dr. Wei even if my dental insurance wont cover anything ! That is how amazing he is. If you are having any hesitations with who you should go see please go at least for a consultation with him, you will not be disappointed and i know you will LOVE him! And he did veneers , cavities, cleaning and much much more with the time frame i gave him and finished before my BIRTHDAY as i asked even with his busy schedule!!! He honestly made me so happy. I cant thank him enough. Thanks Dr. Wei & staff!Dr. Michael J. Wei, DDSAllie M. ratedAfter 3 different dentists botched up my veneers three times, I was reluctant to go ahead for the fourth time.  The time, the energy, and pain of those three times almost made me throw in the towel and I went to Dr.Wei to see what he could do.  I found Dr.Wei online and found him impressive with the many awards and positive reviews.I went in for a consultation and starting from his receptionist to his dental assistant, I felt that they were very professional and I was comforted.  Dr.Wei came to go over my teeth and he was very thorough with the exam.  After the hellish experience of getting veneers done 3 times I did not want to do veneers again and I asked him about lumineers.  He advised that it would be better for me to get veneers even though I was insistent that I get lumineers.  While he was understanding about my previous experiences, he explained to me the reasons why he would re-do the veneers.  Our conversation gave me the confidence that it will be okay and I went ahead with the veneers.  I'm so glad I did!Dr.Wei is a perfectionist.  He does not want you to look anything but fabulous.  He is very caring about his patients and his work.  My case was quite difficult because I had missing teeth but the end result is positively amazing!  It looks natural but very nice.  I had headphones the whole time and I wasn't in pain at all.  Dr.Wei does a thorough job but he's quick so I didn't feel like it was taking forever.  Honestly, I've never felt so comfortable at a dental office before.On top of all of this, his prices are very reasonable.  You would think for such an in demand dentist in a prime location it would cost an arm and a leg to do veneers but I didn't find that to be the case at all.  Thank you, Dr.Wei!Charles M. Marks, DDSAdam E. ratedHaving moved from London UK, I had many bad experiences in the past with negligent dentists. As a result I went to Dr Marks with several procedures requiring attention: 3 dental implants with crowns, 4 porcelain crowns, 3 veneers, and 3 or 4 root canal treatments. I also had my teeth whitened and regularly cleaned. It has been around a year and a half since we began undertaking all of these treatments and I can tell you that I am absolutely delighted with the service I have received from Dr Marks and his associates. They were always flexible with my appointments, but what was the most important thing for me is that all the work has been completed to a very high standard in a friendly environment. Every procedure has been explained to me in full, sometimes even with diagrams, the positives and the negatives explained, and any fees have always been explained to me BEFORE doing any treatment, they also accepted my dental insurance (Cigna) with pleasure. Dr Marks has a fun manner and friendly manner in the way he approaches his work and this is very welcome for me. The implant work is flawless, the crowns are flawless, zero complications. Dr Marks even fitted me with 3 veneers and color matched them to my natural teeth perfectly, no one can tell the difference. He could have easily recommended that I veneer the whole front but he was honest and always has been. He gave me the treatment that was necessary. Is it cheap, no of course not, but quality never is! For the first time in many years I have a flawless mouth, flawless smile, no headaches, no worries, and I can not recommend Dr Marks highly enough. Yes this is a real review, and if you contact me you are welcome to come and look at my smile as well.. Adam El-HoutDr. Michael J. Wei, DDSIvy S. ratedI never write reviews for people; not only that I do not have the time, but also I never had any strong urge to share the experience to anybody else. I have bad teeth genetic. I have been to many different dentists, and I have done all kinds of dental work ever since I was four year old; however my experience haven't been pleasant and the works were done poorly. I started to avoid going to dentist, until I finally had no choice and started to do some research about New York City top rated dentist. Exactly one year ago I met Dr. Wei, first impression he was extremely nice, warm and caring, especially with someone extremely nervous like me. He took an X-ray of my teeth, and examined with me together. He explained everything in detail, works that need to be done, and works that suggested to be done. I was overwhelmed by the complications that I have. He told me that we can start with something small first, such as cavities, and when I feel more comfortable he could go further from there. I love how he is never been pushy and hard on his patient, you can work everything out with him, financially and time wise. I started to built trust with him immediately, from the works he had done. Dental works are never pleasant, but I felt comfortable with Dr. Wei. It's been a wonderful year, and I have finally decided to the smile makeover. My mom with impressed with how perfect the temps look already, and I have dreamed for this beautiful smile ever since a little kid. I can't thank Dr. Wei enough, for everything that he's done for me. I'm writing this from the bottom of my heart, and I promise that you will never regret visiting him!  Dr. Michael J. Wei, DDSAnn H. ratedThe Best Manhattan Cosmetic Dentist in New York City! Having not been to the dentist in over 10 years, I knew I was in need of some serious dental work. I knew I needed a great cosmetic dentist and was referred to Dr. Wei by my friend. I just want to say that Dr. Wei is truly an amazing dentist who ensures that the work he does is the best that it can possibly be. He is professional and his equipment is up to date. He is meticulous and perfectionist on his work thus I knew that I was in greatest hands! Thanks to his skill and expertise, I now know that the health of my teeth. Dr.Wei genuinely cares about his patients, you will feel that in the way he treats you. His bedside manner is fantastic and his staff are excellent.I am so glad that I found him. I wouldn’t go anywhere else and I highly recommend him!  Dr. Wei is someone you can trust which is hard to find in New York City. The happiness of his patients is his number one priority. He provides excellent dental care with a state of the art office and a staff which is always extremely professional and courteous. Dr. Wei discovered several deep cavities underneath the old porcelain crowns of my front teeth because the crowns started to move away from the gums due to poor installation and bad work from previous dentist. However, Dr. Wei performed a miracle! He gave me a new beautiful white smile and healthier teeth. I love my new smile. Thank you very much, Dr. Wei.  I give Dr. Wei a 5-star rating across the board and shall continue to recommend him highly!Dr. Charles MarksKrissy S. ratedMy first appointment with Dr. Marks was after I chipped my front tooth on a holiday weekend.  I left a message with his answering service and he called me back personally within 15 minutes and booked me an appointment for first thing the following day.  While discussing how to repair my chipped tooth, I expressed that I was unhappy with other aspects of my smile and Dr. Marks outlined various options for me.  I chose to cap both of my front teeth and bond two others.  He was very thorough, clearly took pride in his work, and was intent on making sure that I was satisfied and happy with the results.  And when all was said and done, my smile is now straighter and better looking than ever before! I’m extremely happy that my friend recommended Dr. Marks.  His staff is friendly and professional and I enjoyed my visits to his office so much that I will miss spending time there now that I only need to go in for the occasional cleaning.  I highly recommend Dr. Marks for all of your dentistry needs!Dr. Michael J. Wei, DDSChris E. ratedI used to fear going to a dentist as a child, but Dr. Wei has truly made those childhood fears disappear. He is so professional by being extremely informative and sensitive to his patients. I've been to some dentists in the past who do not seem very caring, but he definitely makes sure you are comfortable in every situation, whether it be a teeth cleaning, cavity filling or something more serious. During procedures, if you feel the slightest discomfort he informs you to raise your hand immediately and stop, but during my cavity filling everything was smooth and perfect.His staff is just as kind and their service is great. I got to my appointment at 5pm and I got taken care of right away with no wait. You can't substitute for service like that these days. I know how difficult it is to find a good dentist considering how many people fear it, but I am so thankful I found Dr. Wei. I not only plan on going to him in the future, but I am also looking forward to future appointments!Dr. Michael J. Wei, DDSCheryl C. ratedI am a nurse and I chose this profession because of my passion to provide optimum patient care.  So needless to say, when the table is turned and I become the patient, I am the worst critic because I expect nothing but excellent care from my clinician.  Dr. Wei has shown me that and much more.   I have suffered from periodontal disease for the last 15 years and have made many visits to dentists for a rather uncomfortable procedure that takes about 45 min and requires getting numbed up.  Dr. Wei is by far the only dentist who has made this process comfortable for me.   Being in the healthcare field, I am always surrounded by healthcare professionals so I know a great provider when I see one. And Dr. Wei is indeed the best!  He is passionate about dentistry and genuinely cares about his patients. I have complete confidence in everything Dr. Wei does and have always been satisfied with my experience.   - CherylUsa DentalSamantha T. ratedI currently am visiting from Europe and I had a dental emergency. I was walking down the street and their dental sign caught my eye. I walked into the office and the front staff greeted me so promptly and in such a friendly and welcome manner. They accommodated me straight away and advised I can be seen by Dr.Fendrich that same day. After not even waiting 5 minutes an assistant called me in the room. Assistant was very nice and knowledgeable about dentistry. Dr. Fendrich  entered the room and was so welcoming and friendly.. He explained in full detail what was causing my emergency and also showed me from x-rays and pictures what was going on. He made me feel at ease and also made me aware of how important it is to follow up on dental visits. I recommend everyone to go and visit Dr. Fendrich. Apart from being very very knowledgeable about dentistry, he is also a very down to earth dentist. Did You Know?Types of DentistsThe human mouth is a complex biological system, and no two individuals have the same oral care needs. Here are some of the more common dentists people seek out to improve their oral health:General Dentist
These dentists generally serve as the primary provider of dental care. If you need your teeth cleaned, crowns and bridges placed or any number of cosmetic procedures, book an appointment with a general dentist. Though not as common, these dentists will also provide more specialized services, including some forms of oral surgery - chief among them root canals and restorative care - fitting patients with a mouthguard and counseling people on how to stop smoking and what constitutes proper nutrition.Endodontist
To become an endodontist means undergoing an additional two years of training beyond dental school. As a result, these specialized dentists perform more specific procedures beyond general teeth cleaning and repair work. While a dentist may perform a handful of root canal treatments in a week, an endodontist may end up working on 20 or more in the same timespan. Your average endodontist also repairs teeth damaged by trauma and performs endodontic retreatments, which is repeat root canal procedure. Their added training also means that the endodontist is much more adept at utilizing complex dental equipment - especially ultrasonic instruments or microscopes. Most of that equipment is used to improve the health of teeth that are affected by disease and even congenital deformities.Pediatric Dentist
Proper oral care starts when you're young, and that's why pediatric dentists are so important. These dentists treat people under the age of 13, though there are exceptions based on a child's unique dental background. Pediatric dentists face unique challenges, because they must treat newly teething babies and children losing their primary teeth.Though cleanings are an integral part of their job, pediatric dentists are mostly concerned with planning ahead. That means working to ensure the child has straight teeth and correcting an improper bite. However, they also help address more child-specific conditions of thumb sucking and an over-reliance on pacifiers. As a result, pediatric dentists usually require an additional two-year residency working with infants and children.Oral Pathologist
Pathology refers to the study of disease, specifically as it presents in tissue. Oral pathologists, then, are responsible for studying the diseases that affect the tissue of the mouth and other surrounding muscle groups. These experts are considered to be true specialists, having focused their work on very niche areas of both dentistry and pathology. Though oral pathology is rather specialized, it's a vital component of the oral health industry. By analyzing tissue taken from biopsies, oral pathologists can help diagnose and eventually treat a number of oral diseases, including leukoplakia, cementoma and squamous cell carcinoma, among others.Periodontist
Similar to the endodontist, periodontists receive several additional years of training beyond dental school. However, whereas endodontists study advanced treatments, periodontists generally have a very specific field of interest. Your average periodontist focuses less on cleanings and more on diagnosing and treating gingivitis, periodontitis, which is an untreated form of the aforementioned ailment, and other periodontal diseases. Periodontists treat patients with more complicated oral care backgrounds, those people who require root planing - where dentists clean any infected surfaces - and root debridement, or the removal of dead tissue. Periodontists are especially concerned with proper gum health, including painful recession and teeth alignment.Cosmetic Dentist
Most of the aforementioned dentists are concerned with the health and well-being of a patient's teeth. While that is important to cosmetic dentists, they specialize in a number of different treatments meant to enhance the look or aesthetic of your teeth. To begin the average appointment, cosmetic dentists will examine your teeth for any imperfections or irregularities, and then suggest ways to make your teeth more white or properly aligned. The most popular such treatments are bleaching - where special chemicals are used to whiten your teeth - placing veneers or caps to alter the appearance of teeth, and bonding, where dentists fill unappealing gaps with structural replacement material.Orthodontist
Orthodontists are responsible for treating most dental irregularities, which includes everything from misaligned jaws - like an under or overbite - to overcrowding teeth and even certain cosmetic issues. Following dental school, the would-be orthodontist then has another three years of schooling, most of which is clinical experience in an orthodontic residency program. To properly diagnose and treat most dentofacial issues, the orthodontist relies on a collection of corrective gear. That includes braces, retainers and various facemask configurations. Though orthodontists work with people of all ages, the bulk of patients are young children and teens.Prosthodontist
Similar to the field of orthodontics, the average prosthodontist receives an additional three years of training following dental school. And though prosthodontics is something of a cosmetic field like orthodontics, it's primarily concerned with replacing missing teeth. Prosthodontists have a number of teeth-replacing procedures to implement, including filling veneers, onlays and inlays, bridges, crowns and complete or partial dentures. Beyond their work in implant dentistry, these experts treat a number of other mouth-related ailments, namely snoring, post-cancer jaw reconstruction, traumatic injuries and pain related to lock jaw and other temporomandibular joint disorders.Oral and Maxillofacial Radiologist
Similar to endodontists, these specialists - one of nine such unique fields recognized by the American Dental Association - utilize machinery to treat and diagnose patients. Specifically, these dentists make use of radiographic imaging to treat those diseases and ailments that impact the teeth, mouth and the maxillofacial region, which consists of the face and jaw. While X-rays are a popular option, OMRs also rely on plain and computed tomography, MRIs, ultrasounds and other forms of digital imaging. OMRs are among the first adaptors of new technology, using innovations in the field of imaging to find increasingly effective ways at understanding the impact of oral disease and what that means to patients.Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeon
Your primary dentist may refer you to an oral and maxillofacial surgeon if you experience facial pain, or if he or she suspects you have some variety of oral cancer. OMSs are also your primary source when planning most oral surgeries, like tooth extractions, cyst repairs and removals, and dental implants. However, an OMS can also treat a number of other ailments and diseases related to the maxillofacial region. For instance, malformations in your facial bones can cause sleep apnea, and an OMS can perform corrective surgery that removes or shapes bone. Many of these experts are also involved with more cosmetic procedures, performing or assisting with facial implants and rhinoplasty, in which the nose bone is modified.Dental Public Health Clinics
These clinics are available in most cities across the U.S., and they're meant to offer affordable health care to many low-income families and individuals. Though it differs depending on the specific clinic, the average clinic offers only the most essential oral care services, including X-rays, teeth cleaning, basic root canals and repairs, and tooth extractions. The fees an individual pays depend on a number of different factors, and most clinics have a sliding-fee that is determined equally by income and family size.Most Common Oral Care IssuesThere are several different kinds of dentists, each one with his or her own specialty. However, there are a core group of ailments all dentists treat. Conditions include:Tooth Decay: When your teeth fall out or begin to disintegrate in your mouth, improper brushing is often to blame. Certain infections also cause tooth loss or decay. One of the most affective ways to prevent tooth decay is with regular brushing and flossing right at home.Bad Breath: As your teeth fall out or you don't brush properly, your gums and teeth begin to break down and cause foul odors. Other causes of bad breath include gum disease and oral infections. As with tooth decay, brushing and flossing are vital, as is regular tongue scraping and the use of mouthwash.Teeth Sensitivity: Some people are born with teeth that are naturally sensitive to cold. A lack of brushing can also comprise your teeth's natural protection. The best method to help protect otherwise sensitive teeth is to use specialized toothpaste geared toward people with worn or damaged teeth.Dry Mouth: Certain medications will cause your salivary glands to stop producing spit. This in turn can harm the structure of your teeth and gums. There are several at-home measures you can take to combat dry mouth. These include regular hydration, chewing sugar-free gum, which also hydrates your mouth, and avoiding mouthwash with alcohol in it, which dries out your entire mouth.Teeth Grinding: For many people, grinding their teeth - also known as bruxism - is a subconscious behavior, usually the result of stress. It can eventually damage your teeth. The only way to treat your grinding habit is to meet with an endodontist, who will fit you with with a bite plate to mitigate the damage to your teeth.Mouth Sores: Also called canker sores, these painful bumps are the result of irritation to the soft tissue of your mouth. These sores can make brushing almost impossible. There are a number of different causes for sores, including anemia or a vitamin B-12 deficiency. As a result, your primary physician will have to examine the bump, find its root cause and then help develop a specific treatment plan, including the use of corticosteroids to reduce inflammation or antimicrobial mouthwash.Discoloration: Yellow teeth are the result of a number of bad habits, mainly smoking, drinking too much coffee and improper nutrition. Proper brushing can usually prevent discolored teeth before they happen. However, if your teeth become worse, many dentists will treat with a whitening procedure.A Guide for Dental Care BasicsProper oral care begins at home. The following are a few preventative measures you can take to keep your teeth and gums healthy. They just may reduce your time spent in your dentist's chair.Remember Your Angles
When brushing your teeth, always place the brush at a 45-degree angle. That way, you're able to hit every surface of each tooth.Don't Forget the Tongue
Within your mouth, your tongue is the largest source of bacteria. Be sure to brush it front to back and don't forget the sides.Floss Everyday
Brushing alone isn't enough to keep your mouth healthy, and that's why flossing is so important. Each time you floss, be sure to have at least 18 inches of floss available, which is what you should go through if you use proper technique. For optimal control, hold the floss between your thumbs and forefingers.Watch What You Eat
Sugar, alcohol and coffee all contain phosphorus. While some can prove beneficial, too much of this chemical can eat away at your teeth and gums.Keep in Mind the Mouthwash
Though not a requirement, mouthwash can be helpful if used to supplement proper brushing and flossing. Most mouthwash brands contain chlorine dioxide, a chemical that targets the majority of oral bacterial strains. However, don't overuse mouthwash, as it can cause a number of ailments.How to Choose The Right DentistProper oral care is an integral component of your greater well-being, which highlights why having the right dentist is of the utmost importance. Consider the following as you make an effort to find a dentist who will fit your unique medical history:Find a Recommendation
It's important to use a dentist whom you feel comfortable with. Because that's difficult to achieve by simply choosing names out of a phone book, you should always seek out a recommendation. Whether it's a friend, family member or co-worker, this individual can offer intimate details about a dentist's demeanor, operating style and approach to patient care. Be sure to always ask plenty of questions.Vet Your Dentist
Once you get a recommendation from a friend, don't simply book your first cleaning right away. Instead, meet with any prospective dentists to conduct a series of pretreatment interview. During this session, you can ask them about what treatments they perform most often, procedures they're not as familiar with, what accreditation they have or any organizations they belong to and how their offices handles insurance and payments. Just be aware that booking this time can be difficult based on a dentist's schedule.Consider Accessibility and Other Factors
Perhaps you've met a dentist with whom you feel comfortable. Not only that, but this dentist's payment options are suitable for your finances. However, don't be so quick to make a final decision, as other factors may influence your choice. Is the dentist's office nearby, or do you have to drive out of your way? Is the office open at a time that will fit the rest of your schedule? How much flexibility will the dentist's staff offer in booking appointments? Though seemingly trivial, these factors are nonetheless important.Check With Your State Board
One of the last things you should do before coming to a decision is to check with your state's dental board. Dentists must abide by different rules and regulations depending on where they practice, and the state board can outline what requirements your candidate must meet. These organizations can also offer information about any discrepancies in the dentist's background and if he or she has faced any disciplinary actions.Picking the Right Dental InsuranceAs with other forms of health care, insurance is a great way to both reduce associated costs and ensure you and your dependents receive the best care possible. However, you don't want to simply buy the first such plan you see. Here are some factors to consider when shopping for dental insurance:Pick Your Plan
There is no such thing as a one-size-fits-all dental insurance plan. Instead, most people purchase three main varieties, usually through their employers. An indemnity or fee-for-service plan is just as it sounds and means you'll have to pay for annual deductibles and co-insurance payments out of pocket. A preferred provider organization is less costly, and you choose from a network of dentists. However, PPOs have some limitations and accompanying deductibles. Similarly, a dental health maintenance organization plan limits you to just a few choices of dentists, and one doctor handles all of your oral care needs. However, these HMO are usually much less costly.Examine the Networks
As noted, PPO plans and dental HMOs work with only a select number of doctors. While that usually means fewer costs compared to other insurance plans or payment options, it also means you don't have quite as much say in the dentist who can treat you. That doesn't necessarily have to be a bad thing, especially if you know who is in the network. Before purchasing the plan, you'll receive a list of dentists in each network. Do research on each doctor - just as you would when picking a dentist otherwise. From there, you can then pick a plan with doctors who meet your standards and requirements.Consider Your Coverage
Sometimes, it's not just the doctor that you want to consider. For many people, even the plans with the best doctors are deemed a bad choice. The reason? The coverage is less-than-stellar. When picking a plan, you need to look at just how much you'll pay for each and every service. For instance, some plans won't cover your fillings or X-rays, while others may charge more or less for a crown or tooth extraction. Knowing just what you'll be responsible for is important, as you don't want to be caught off-guard by unforeseen charges. Depending on your employer, a human resources specialist can walk you through specific coverage options.Make Your Plan Work for You
It's a sad fact that the dentist you want most might not be covered by the plan you've purchased. However, that doesn't mean that you have to look for dental services elsewhere. If you're truly comfortable with a dentist and you feel he or she can be an ally in your ongoing oral care regimen, then consider signing a plan to just keep that dentist available. That means potentially deal with costs and other insurance-related factors that you might have wanted to. If need be, you might be able to work with the dentist's office to address some of the plan-specific concerns.
