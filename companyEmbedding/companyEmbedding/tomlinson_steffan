SANTA CLARA, Calif., Feb. 2, 2012 /PRNewswire/ -- Palo Alto Networks™, the network security company, today announced that it has appointed Steffan Tomlinson as its new chief financial officer (CFO), effective immediately. 
During his career, Steffan has worked at a number of high-growth market leading companies.  Most notably, from 2005 to 2011, he served as chief financial officer of Aruba Networks and was instrumental in both their Initial Public Offering and helping the company scale to facilitate growth. From 2000 to 2005, he was the first non-founder employee and, ultimately, chief financial officer of Peribit Networks.
"Palo Alto Networks has experienced tremendous growth over the past years and is well-positioned for the future," said Mark McLaughlin, chief executive officer and president at Palo Alto Networks. "I am delighted that Steffan is joining us.  His proven ability to manage growth through a transition from the private to the public markets, combined with his passion for innovation and focus on customer success, make him a great fit for our long-term strategy."
"I am excited to join the team at Palo Alto Networks and help build on what is already a great foundation," said Steffan Tomlinson. "The company is uniquely positioned in the network security market and its family of next-generation firewalls has enabled the company to become the market leader."
Michael Lehman, Palo Alto Networks CFO since April 2010, will assist during the transition. "Michael has been a highly effective leader during his nearly two years here; he has hired and developed an excellent team and has helped us markedly improve our business, processes, and infrastructure. On behalf of everyone at Palo Alto Networks, I want to thank him for his many contributions and wish him well in his future endeavors," added Mark McLaughlin.

Palo Alto Networks Appoints Steffan Tomlinson as Chief Financial Officer


















Palo Alto Networks

Santa Clara, CA
Feb 11, 2012 at 05:00 AM



New research published by Palo Alto Networks™, the network security company, indicates explosive growth in global social networking and browser-based file sharing on corporate networks, with a 300 percent increase in active social networking (e.g., posting, applications) compared with activity during the same period in the latter half of 2010. The Palo Alto Networks Application Usage and Risk Report provides a global view into application usage based on assessments of the raw application traffic from more than 1,600 enterprises between April 2011 and November 2011.
"Whether or not employees are using social networks or sharing files at work is no longer a question; this data clearly demonstrates that users are embracing and actively using such applications," said René Bonvanie, chief marketing officer at Palo Alto Networks. "Companies must determine how to safely enable these technologies on their networks so that users can maintain the levels of productivity that many of these applications can afford, while at the same time ensuring that their corporate networks and users are protected against all threats."
The report focuses on three primary findings:

Social media use is more active; Twitter has gained significant mainstream traction in the workplace: Since October 2010, social networking usage patterns have become more active with bandwidth consumption for Facebook Apps, Social Plugins, and posting increasing from 5 percent (October 2010) to 25 percent (December 2011) when measured as a percentage of total social networking bandwidth. Twitter browsing at work alone grew by more than 700 percent year-over-year.
Widespread file sharing use requires a balanced response: File sharing sites continue to be used on most networks, appearing on the networks of 92 percent of the participating organizations. In total, 65 different browser-based file-sharing variants were found with an average of 13 being used in each of the analyzed organizations. The report also explores a variety of risks associated with browser-based file-sharing applications, which varies by application and use case. However, the use of evasive techniques by these applications implies that they are often operating unchecked on corporate networks.
The types of traffic on enterprise networks is changing: Web applications that use TCP port 80, the standard port associated with HTTP web browsing traffic, actually represent a minority of the traffic on enterprise networks for the first time ever. The 297 applications that use only TCP port 80 and no other port by default represent a mere 25 percent of the applications and 32 percent of the bandwidth observed, meaning that a standard web browsing-focused security model actually protects a minority of an organization's traffic.

"This is the largest sample size of actual application traffic from enterprises worldwide that we have analyzed since we began this area of research in Spring 2008," said Matt Keil, senior research analyst at Palo Alto Networks. "The most surprising finding from this data is the one that is most counter-intuitive: non-web-based traffic and application use is much more significant than most people think.
Application and Threat Information
Information on the more than 1,400 applications that are identified by Palo Alto Networks can be found in Applipedia, part of the company's Application and Threat Research Center. Visit the online resource to find the latest news, commentary, and discoveries on applications and threats at http://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com
