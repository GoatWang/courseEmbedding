Herbal Compliance Co. Launches its Public Funding Effort with GrowthFountain

HORSESHOE LAKE, Ark., Jun 12, 2017 (SEND2PRESS NEWSWIRE) — The Herbal Compliance Co. announces the launch of its compliance consulting services for legal medical cannabis and hemp businesses. This unique company will also be partnering with GrowthFountain to raise $1 million in funds through a unique form of investor funding called Regulation Crowdfunding.
Interested investors can see the offering and make an investment by visiting Growth Fountain at https://growthfountain.com/herbal-compliance .
Herbal Compliance fills a need created by differences in marijuana legislation at the state and federal levels. While it is currently legal in 26 states and the District of Columbia to grow and sell marijuana for medical purposes, it is still illegal on a federal level, resulting in thousands of conflicts between state and federal regulations. 
“Understanding the laws governing medical marijuana and hemp is our core competency,” explains Chuck Carpenter, president of Herbal Compliance. “But we also offer other types of business consulting like inventory management, branding, and employee education. Our mission is to help companies in this new area of American enterprise to grow and thrive.”
To fully fund their startup, Herbal Compliance is using a new form of funding enabled by recent changes in securities law in the JOBS Act called Regulation Crowdfunding. The rules for this sort of investing went into effect May 2016, allowing non-accredited investors to participate in a funding round for a private company for the first time in history.
“We’re excited to help Herbal Compliance raise the money they need to grow,” says Abe Orden, operations manager of GrowthFountain. “For the first time in 80 years, average Americans now have the opportunity to support and invest in local businesses and entrepreneurs they believe in.”
Herbal Compliance’s campaign started on June 6, 2017 and will continue through Oct. 4, 2017. Their aim is to raise between $100,000 and $1 million with a minimum buy-in of $100 per investor.
About Herbal Compliance:
Launched in January 2017, The Herbal Compliance Co. provides companies in the legal medical cannabis and hemp business with services to ensure that they remain compliant with the law. Services include design and buildout, equipment fulfillment, regulator compliance, remote inventory control and reporting, vendor relationships, brand and marketing, and tax management and education. Learn more at http://www.herbalcompliance.com/.
About GrowthFountain:
GrowthFountain Capital LLC is a Regulation Crowdfunding platform aimed at simplifying fundraising and helping businesses build collateral. GrowthFountain is registered with the SEC and a member of FINRA. Learn more at https://growthfountain.com/.

Our Products
Total Return High Yield
Fountain’s core Total Return High Yield product invests in high yield bonds and leveraged bank loans. Fountain selects securities issues by companies with improving credit profiles and aims to avoid those with a high probability of default. The objective of this strategy is to maximize total return while limiting risk by concentrating on the middle-to-higher credit quality sectors of the high yield universe.
Short Duration High Yield
Fountain was a pioneer in the management of Short Duration High Yield portfolios. Fountain’s Short Duration strategy invests in the higher quality BB and B rated sectors of the non-investment grade corporate bond and loan markets. The strategy focuses on seasoned credits with maturities of seven years or less. As a result, portfolio duration is typically around two years.
Bank Loans
Fountain offers leveraged Bank Loan management in both dedicated portfolios and as a supplement to its Total Return and Short Duration strategies.



 

Products


Fountain’s products are all based on the firm’s core investment philosophy and disciplined investment process. Fountain offers separate account management, which allows clients to tailor guidelines and objectives to meet their needs. The firm also offers commingled funds for smaller accounts in its Total Return and Short Duration products.

Gold Medal (92 rating) from the Beverage Tasting Institute
Third generation family recipe using only real cherries from Traverse city, MI
Signed with 5 Illinois distributors and the largest distributer of Michigan
http://www.omasspirits.com50% FundedCommitted $12,504Target$25,000 - $100,000Minimum Investment$100InvestAbout Oma's Spirits, LLCOma's Spirits was launched to bring Hedy Steinbart's (our "Oma") family recipe for cherry infused vodka into the marketplace.  My Oma has been making cherry infused vodka since 1952 when she immigrated to the United States after WWII.  To this day, she still handcrafts her speciality product in her kitchen in Lansing, Michigan to share with friends and family.The product pays homage to Oma's Midwest roots as the grains for the vodka are grown in Michigan, the cherries are from Traverse City, Michigan and the product is handcrafted in Gurnee, Illinois.  By teaming up with industry veterans the branding, marketing, and go-to-market strategy is being overseen by experts who have 20+ years in their respective disciplines and have launched and help develop prominent brands such as Malibu Rum, Seagram's Gin, Jameson Irish Whisky, Bushmills Irish Whisky, Wild Turkey, Beefeater Wet Gin, Glen Parker Single Malt Scotch, Smirnoff Vodka.  Why You Should InvestOma's is a premium product backed by industry experts in the fast growing artisan spirits space.  Oma's is unique to the market in that it is infused with natural cherries.  The infusion process creates a full mouthful of flavor, lush mouthfeel, and a deep ruby red color.   This is in contrast to today's market of flavored vodka's which is overcrowded, made with chemicals, is of poor quality, and is experiencing a declining market.  In a professional tasting competition, Oma's received a Gold Medal (92 rating) from the Beverage Tasting Institute. They describe it as "medium reddish, mahogany color. Attractive aromas and flavors...a tingling, elegant medium - long, allspice finish...true to fruit vodka". You can go to www.tastings.com, enter 'Oma's" to see the placement.The authenticity and heritage behind the brand has wide appeal to millennials (21-34 year olds) who are most likely to change their drinking habits.  We are starting with a soft launch in millennial concentrated areas in Chicago before bringing the brand to Michigan and the tri-state area (NY, NJ, CT) where 22 million millennials live within a 200 mile radius.  Oma's teamed up with a strategic alliance of five Illinois distributors who cover the entire state of Illinois to launch on February 13th, 2017.   These distributors include Burke Beverage, Chicago Beverage Systems, Lamonica Beverage, G&M, Rinella Company and Koerner Distribution.  In addition to the launch in Chicago, Oma's will be sold throughout Michigan in March, and will be offered online with a number of online retailers focused on the artisan space.  How We Intend to Make MoneyOma's has signed with distributors in Illinois and the largest distributor in the state of Michigan, Great Lakes Wine and Spirits.  We are also  finalizing agreements with online retailers throughout March, 2017.  Our recipe and label have been approved by the TTB and we have licenses to produce and sell our product in Illinois.  We have spent nine months getting to this point and are in a great position to start generating revenue.  Our first PO's have been processed in January and given our online presence, and established distributor relationships, Oma's is on track to be selling in multiple states by the end of 2017.We will be selling Oma's to distributors for $18.50 so the investor pool can expect to receive 92.5 cents for every bottle sold.   With a limited launch focused on Chicago, we are forecasting 3,000 cases (6 750ml bottles) to be sold in 2017.Try Oma's Cherry Infused Vodka today at:https://www.ezras.com/products/oma-s-cherry-infused-vodkaWhy We are Raising Capital, and What We’ll Do with ItThe partners of Oma's Spirits have been perfecting our product, market testing our label, and planning our go-to-market strategy since March of 2016.  Since then, we have successfully raised $350,000 for our soft launch in Chicago.   This covers the cost of a brand ambassador in Chicago, and marketing costs for bars and restaurants who have pre-ordered our product. The additional capital will be used to make our second production run which will be needed to fill PO's and support our marketing efforts online and in the Chicago marketplace.  If the capital raise is successful, and we are able to raise $100,000, we will have the necessary marketing support to expand throughout Michigan and prepare for our launch in the tri-state area.TeamKyle MillerCEO / Omas Grandson Kyle grew up in Okemos, Michigan before getting a double major in Finance and Entrepreneurship at Indiana Universitys Kelley School of Business.

    New Cannabis Compliance Company Launches Public Funding Effort with GrowthFountain  

    The Herbal Compliance Co. Uses New Investment Rules to Raise Funds

HORSESHOE LAKE, Ark., June 12, 2017 (SEND2PRESS NEWSWIRE) — The Herbal Compliance Co. announces the launch of its compliance consulting services for legal medical cannabis and hemp businesses. This unique company will also be partnering with GrowthFountain to raise $1 million in funds through a unique form of investor funding called Regulation Crowdfunding.

Interested investors can see the offering and make an investment by visiting Growth Fountain at https://growthfountain.com/herbal-compliance .
Herbal Compliance fills a need created by differences in marijuana legislation at the state and federal levels. While it is currently legal in 26 states and the District of Columbia to grow and sell marijuana for medical purposes, it is still illegal on a federal level, resulting in thousands of conflicts between state and federal regulations.
“Understanding the laws governing medical marijuana and hemp is our core competency,” explains Chuck Carpenter, president of Herbal Compliance. “But we also offer other types of business consulting like inventory management, branding, and employee education. Our mission is to help companies in this new area of American enterprise to grow and thrive.”
To fully fund their startup, Herbal Compliance is using a new form of funding enabled by recent changes in securities law in the JOBS Act called Regulation Crowdfunding. The rules for this sort of investing went into effect May 2016, allowing non-accredited investors to participate in a funding round for a private company for the first time in history.
“We’re excited to help Herbal Compliance raise the money they need to grow,” says Abe Orden, operations manager of GrowthFountain. “For the first time in 80 years, average Americans now have the opportunity to support and invest in local businesses and entrepreneurs they believe in.”
Herbal Compliance’s campaign started on June 6, 2017 and will continue through Oct. 4, 2017. Their aim is to raise between $100,000 and $1 million with a minimum buy-in of $100 per investor.
