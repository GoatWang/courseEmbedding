Transcontinental Realty Investors  (TCI)





 
From its beginning in 1991, Transcontinental Realty Investors has created greater shareholder value through acquisition, financing, operation and sale of real estate across every geographic region in the United States. A New York Stock Exchange company, Transcontinental is traded under the symbol "TCI".
 
Transcontinental produces revenue through the professional management of apartments, office buildings, warehouses, hotels and retail centers that are "undervalued" or "under-performing" at the time of acquisition. Value is added under TCI ownership and the properties are transformed into a higher classification through physical improvements and proven management techniques. TCI also develops new properties, such as luxury apartment homes, on its land holdings.

Transcontinental Realty Advisors and Pillar Income Asset Management 
      Show Some Love to Family Gateway






March 02, 2016 08:00 AM Eastern Standard Time



DALLAS--(BUSINESS WIRE)--TCI and its management company, Pillar Income Asset 
      Management, recently held their annual “Show Some Love” Valentine event 
      for Family Gateway of Dallas, Texas.
    


      Pillar donated over 200 items to Family Gateway, Inc. in response to the 
      organization’s urgent need for a few basic necessities. Items included 
      towels, sheets, detergent, toothpaste and toothbrushes. “Year after year 
      Pillar employees come through with donations to various Dallas 
      organizations,” said Chris Childress, Manager of Pillar’s non-profit 
      initiative. “This past Thanksgiving they also donated enough food to 
      provide over 800 meals to North Texas Food Bank. I’m always impressed by 
      how generous our employees are.”
    

      Kathy Kidwell, Family Gateway’s Director of Volunteers, accepted 
      Pillar’s donation. “Simply put, if it wasn’t for faithful supporters 
      like you, we wouldn’t exist. So thank you and every employee of Pillar 
      Income for supplying all the sheets, towels, bedding, detergent, hygiene 
      products and many, many more amazing ‘in-kind’ donations that we need 
      each and everyday to make a difference in the lives of the homeless 
      children and their families we help each and everyday...truly from the 
      bottom of our hearts ‘Thank you.’”
    

Family 
      Gateway is a registered 501 (c)(3) non-profit organization that 
      relies on the generosity of the Dallas community to help provide 
      transitional housing and a comprehensive continuum of care to families 
      with children experiencing homelessness. Since 1986, Family Gateway has 
      been uniquely focused on family homelessness in Dallas County, offering 
      over 10,000 children and their parents the help they need to recover 
      from crisis and make positive choices for their future. For more
