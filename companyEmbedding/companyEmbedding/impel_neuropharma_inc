      Impel NeuroPharma Announces $36M Funding to Advance Novel Drug Delivery 
      Platform for Central Nervous System Disorders
    



New investors’ funding supports clinical development of the company’s 
      lead compounds






December 02, 2016 05:30 AM Eastern Standard Time



SEATTLE--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Impel NeuroPharma, Inc., a Seattle-based clinical stage biotechnology 
      company developing first-in-class intranasal drug treatments for central 
      nervous (CNS) disorders, today announced that it has closed a Series C 
      funding round in an amount up to $36M. venBIO, 5AM Ventures and Vivo 
      Capital, all life science focused firms, each made equal investments to 
      be funded in two tranches. Impel NeuroPharma received $21M in the 
      initial tranche with the remaining $15M to be received upon 
      accomplishment of certain development and business milestones.
    


      Impel NeuroPharma is developing a pipeline of drug-device combination 
      products built upon its Precision Olfactory Delivery™ (POD™) nasal 
      delivery platform. These new nasal drug delivery devices are intended to 
      achieve superior biodistribution, bioavailability, and decreased 
      dose-to- dose variability of both small molecules and biologic drugs in 
      patients. The company intends to continue developing combination 
      products both internally and through pharmaceutical company partnerships 
      for migraine, Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease. Impel expects that 
      new, additional indications will enter the clinic in 2017.
    

      “The nasal cavity is a vastly underutilized entry point for therapeutics 
      into the circulation,” said Impel NeuroPharma CEO John Hoekman. “Our 
      POD™ nasal delivery platform is designed to deliver therapeutics into 
      the deep nasal cavity. This form of administration may allow for an 
      improvement in biodistribution and consistency compared to current 
      delivery methods. Impel NeuroPharma is striving to use the POD™ system 
      to develop improved drug-device combination products in underserved 
      patient populations.”
    

      “We are especially pleased that our new investors recognized the value 
      in the POD™ technology. Their support allows us to move our lead 
      products closer to FDA approval,” Hoekman added.
    

      “We believe the quality and caliber of our new investor group is a 
      testimony to Impel NeuroPharma’s progress and to the potential of its 
      technology base,” added Stewart Parker, Impel NeuroPharma Executive 
      Chair. “We look forward to working with them to bring Impel 
      NeuroPharma’s exciting products to fruition.”
    

      “The biodistribution data that Impel NeuroPharma has generated with the 
      POD delivery platform demonstrates its potential to improve our approach 
      to treating multiple diseases. We’re excited to use the platform to 
      bring new treatments to patients,” said Aaron Royston of venBIO.
    

About POD technology


      Impel NeuroPharma’s POD™ nasal drug delivery platform is designed to 
      deliver drugs to the upper nasal cavity for improved biodistribution. By 
      delivering therapeutics to the upper nasal cavity, the POD nasal 
      delivery platform takes advantage of the vascular rich olfactory region 
      for improved bioavailability and has the potential to target the brain 
      via the olfactory and trigeminal nerves. Delivery of therapeutically 
      meaningful levels of drugs may allow for development of more effective 
      drugs and expand the range of treatment options available to patients.

  "Impel’s POD technology provides an important solution to an unmet need        in the drug delivery marketplace" 



ST. PAUL, Minn. & SEATTLE--(BUSINESS WIRE)--3M Drug Delivery Systems (3M) and Impel NeuroPharma Inc (Impel) today 
      announced a strategic alliance aimed at advancing Impel’s revolutionary 
      Precision Olfactory Delivery (POD) technology for the enhanced Central 
      Nervous System (CNS) delivery of drug products. The alliance further 
      solidifies 3M’s presence as a clear leader in the drug delivery sector 
      and shows its continued commitment to cutting-edge technology.
    

      The alliance with 3M will enable Impel to expedite the development and 
      commercialization of the POD technology and accelerate Impel’s internal 
      pipeline into late-stage clinical trials and subsequent global 
      regulatory submissions. As part of the deal, 3M and Impel will 
      collaborate on programs directed to the continued development and 
      commercialization of POD technology. The alliance will leverage 3M’s 
      experience with inhaled and nasal drug delivery devices. Other details 
      of the transaction were not disclosed.
    

      “We are pleased to have 3M join our team,” said Impel CEO Michael Hite. 
      “We’ve successfully shown that the POD technology is highly effective in 
      the clinic in our ongoing development programs and across diverse 
      therapeutic areas including Alzheimer's disease, migraine, and pain 
      management. We are proud to have 3M’s key strategic collaboration to 
      support the development and commercialization of the POD platform. With 
      3M, Impel is better able to empower researchers, physicians, patients, 
      and their families.”
    

      Impel’s POD technology deposits drugs deep into the upper nasal cavity 
      where it can achieve delivery into the brain and central nervous system. 
      POD is a handheld, cost-effective, non-invasive means for delivering CNS 
      therapeutics that can be self-administered by a patient, caregiver, 
      physician, or even family member.
    

      The World Health Organization (WHO) has estimated that neurological 
      diseases affect over 450 million people globally, making up 
      approximately 40 percent of total disease burden (based on disability 
      adjusted life years), compared to 13 percent for cancer and 12 percent 
      for cardiovascular disease. The CNS market is valued at over $80 billion 
      in 2015 (BCC Research) and the drug delivery market is expected to reach 
      a value of $25.5 billion by 2017 (Jain, PharmaBiotech).
    

      “Impel’s POD technology provides an important solution to an unmet need 
      in the drug delivery marketplace,” said Cindy Kent, President and 
      General Manager – 3M Drug Delivery Systems. “We look forward to 
      supporting Impel as they commercialize the POD technology and expand 
      upon 3M’s leadership in developing novel approaches to major problems 
      confronting the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries.”

Migraine Treatment

 


INP-104 or POD-dihydroergotamine mesylate (DHE) targets Migraine where it starts. Impel is developing a nasal DHE product with improved bioavailability and reproducibility. If successful, INP-104 would be a viable alternative to traditional triptan drugs and an effective outpatient treatment option that would make it highly desirable in the migraine market.

 








Patient populations who may benefit from INP-104 include:


 


 • Those with low tolerance or contraindication for triptan drugs
 • Triptan non-responders
 • Those with sustained or highly frequent migraines (5>15 per month)
 • Those with resistant or recurring migraines (e.g. menstrual migraine)
 • Those currently prescribed Migranal or injectable DHE
 • Allodynial migraineurs
 • Those experiencing cluster headaches & recurrent severe tension headaches
 • Dissatisfied triptan-users (e.g. those experiencing triptan headaches; those experiencing onset of migraine “late” where triptans are less effective)

 


DHE has several potential benefits when delivered in POD technology.
 
 Impel is currently engaged in clinical trials to bring this improved migraine product to the market.

About Impel

 


Impel NeuroPharma, Inc. is a Seattle-based company developing intranasal drug treatments for central nervous system (CNS) disorders. We have developed a novel drug delivery platform, the POD™ technology, that administers drug to the deep nasal cavity to improve the biodistribution of many drugs. This innovation enables entirely new categories of drugs, including biologics, to be administered using a cost-effective, disposable, non-invasive intranasal drug delivery device.

 








Philosophy
________________________
The goal at Impel is simple: we want to develop the next generation of therapeutics for central nervous system (CNS) disorders. Patients with CNS disorders are vastly underserved by current therapeutics and we are working hard to change that. Our POD™ nasal delivery platform is designed to deliver therapeutics into the deep nasal cavity. This form of administration may allow for an improvement in biodistribution and consistency compared to current delivery methods. Impel NeuroPharma is striving to use the POD™ system to develop improved drug-device combination products in underserved patient populations. We take a comprehensive approach to development and design considering patient comfort, regulatory approval pathways, and cost effectiveness. Treatments currently under development include therapies for Alzheimer’s disease, Migraine and Parkinson’s disease.

 JOIN IMPEL


How it started
Impel was founded in Seattle by John Hoekman, Ph.D., Rodney Ho, Ph.D., and Michael Hite, MBA. At the University of Washington, Hoekman and Ho began researching the pharmacokinetics of drugs delivered to the upper nasal cavity. They discovered that targeting the upper nasal cavity could result in greatly improved drug distribution to the brain. At the same time, Hoekman began developing an intranasal device platform that could utilize this pathway and become commercially viable. Impel was founded in 2008 and spun out of the University of Washington in 2010. Impel has since developed the POD™ drug delivery platform and become a world leader in the development of nasally administered therapies for CNS disorders.

POD Technology

 


Impel NeuroPharma’s POD™ nasal drug delivery platform is designed to deliver drugs to the upper nasal cavity for improved biodistribution. By delivering therapeutics to the upper nasal cavity, the POD™ nasal delivery platform takes advantage of the vascular rich olfactory region for improved bioavailability and has the potential to target the brain via the olfactory and trigeminal nerves. Delivery of therapeutically meaningful levels of drugs may allow for development of more effective drugs and expand the range of treatment options available to patients.
The nasal cavity is a vastly underutilized entry point for therapeutics into the circulation. The primary challenge in achieving significant nasal drug delivery is depositing drugs in the deeper regions of the nasal cavity. Due to the complex architecture of this area, drugs delivered with standard nasal devices such as droppers, sprays, or pumps typically deposit less than 5% of the compound in the olfactory region and thus, do not provide a significant level of nasal delivery to treat CNS disorders. Impel’s POD™ technology results in a large fraction of drug deposition in this region which can lead to direct uptake along the olfactory pathways as well as greater uptake into the vasculature depending on the drug.

About Impel

 


Impel NeuroPharma, Inc. is a Seattle-based company developing intranasal drug treatments for central nervous system (CNS) disorders. We have developed a novel drug delivery platform, the POD™ technology, that administers drug to the deep nasal cavity to improve the biodistribution of many drugs. This innovation enables entirely new categories of drugs, including biologics, to be administered using a cost-effective, disposable, non-invasive intranasal drug delivery device.

 








Philosophy
________________________
The goal at Impel is simple: we want to develop the next generation of therapeutics for central nervous system (CNS) disorders. Patients with CNS disorders are vastly underserved by current therapeutics and we are working hard to change that. Our POD™ nasal delivery platform is designed to deliver therapeutics into the deep nasal cavity. This form of administration may allow for an improvement in biodistribution and consistency compared to current delivery methods. Impel NeuroPharma is striving to use the POD™ system to develop improved drug-device combination products in underserved patient populations. We take a comprehensive approach to development and design considering patient comfort, regulatory approval pathways, and cost effectiveness. Treatments currently under development include therapies for Alzheimer’s disease, Migraine and Parkinson’s disease.

How it started
Impel was founded in Seattle by John Hoekman, Ph.D., Rodney Ho, Ph.D., and Michael Hite, MBA. At the University of Washington, Hoekman and Ho began researching the pharmacokinetics of drugs delivered to the upper nasal cavity. They discovered that targeting the upper nasal cavity could result in greatly improved drug distribution to the brain. At the same time, Hoekman began developing an intranasal device platform that could utilize this pathway and become commercially viable. Impel was founded in 2008 and spun out of the University of Washington in 2010. Impel has since developed the POD™ drug delivery platform and become a world leader in the development of nasally administered therapies for CNS disorders.
