ESG Completes First OPC Milestone On Schedule, Within Budget

2 days ago

                Panama City, FL, Eastern Shipbuilding has successfully completed its Initial Critical Design Review (ICDR) milestone with the United States Coast Guard on 21 July, 2017 for the Offshore Patrol Cutter (OPC) Program.   ESG’s accomplishment is noteworthy as it occurred on schedule and within the budget constraints set forth by USCG acquisition, and cleared the way to proceed to the next critical milestone known as Final Critical Design Review (FCDR). This accomplishment comes after a weeklong group of discussions, demonstrations, and design presentations by ESG’s design team to the USCG Ship Design Team, Project Management Staff, and Department of Homeland Security.
            



U.S. Sanctions Vens as Pressure Builds on Maduro

2 days ago

                The Trump administration imposed sanctions on 13 senior Venezuelan officials as the country's opposition launched a two-day strike on Wednesday, heaping pressure on unpopular President Nicolas Maduro to scrap plans for a controversial new congress.   Venezuela's long-time ideological foe the United States targeted the country's army and police chiefs, the national director of elections, and a vice president of the state oil company for alleged corruption and rights abuses.   U.S. President Donald Trump spared Venezuela for now from broader sanctions against its vital oil industry, although such actions were still under consideration.   U.S.

US-built Liquefied Gas Barge Delivered

3 days ago

                Harvest, an ABS-classed articulated tug barge (ATB) purpose-built to transport liquefied anhydrous ammonia, has been delivered to a subsidiary of Savage Companies by U.S. shipbuilder Vigor.    Harvest is the first complex liquefied ammonia transport barge built in the U.S. since 1982.   “The delivery of this ATB represents a landmark achievement for all of the project stakeholders as well as the U.S. shipbuilding industry,” said ABS Americas Division President Jamie Smith. “The first-of-its-kind in over three decades, the Harvest will help reshape the U.S. fleet and support safer trading in U.S. waters.
            




The Marshall Islands Move to Head of the Class

3 days ago

                Leveraging 27 worldwide offices, the RMI Registry has been gaining market share year-on-year. Surging tonnage and a solid record for safety has pushed the registry to the head of the class.   When the Marshall Islands Registry announced that it had become the world’s second largest – at a whopping 223,262,177 deadweight tons – the registry’s leadership was quick to emphasize quality as the leading reason. International Registries (IRI) President Bill Gallagher didn’t discount the importance of the deadweight milestone, but quickly moved the conversation towards why it had happened.
