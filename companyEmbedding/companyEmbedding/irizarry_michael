Features

While statistics textbooks focus on mathematics, this book focuses on using a computer to perform data analysis
Focuses on the practical challenges faced by data analysts in the life sciences and introduces mathematics as a tool that can help us achieve scientific goals
All sections of this book are reproducible as they were produced by R markdown documents that include R code used to produce the figures, tables and results shown in the book
Summary
                            This book covers several of the statistical concepts and data analytic skills needed to succeed in data-driven life science research. The authors proceed from relatively basic concepts related to computed p-values to advanced topics related to analyzing highthroughput data. They include the R code that performs this analysis and connect the lines of code to the statistical and mathematical concepts explained.
                                            

Table of Contents
Introduction. Getting started. Inference. Exploratory data analysis. Robust summaries. Matrix algebra. Linear models. Inference for high dimensional data. Statistical models.
