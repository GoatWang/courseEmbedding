JOHN JR. HUSTON	John Jr. Huston, age 60, of rural Kahoka, MO, passed away Saturday, January 3, 2015 at Blessing Hospital in Quincy, Illinois.	John was born July 17, 1954 at Memphis, MO, to John W. and I. Cathern Dean Huston.	John was “the definition of a man” to his family and friends. He battled complications from cancer for ten years.	He is survived by his five loving daughters: Charity (Mrs. Josh) Heusel of Lowell, IA, Jessica (Mrs. Corey) Feilen , Trinity Hope (Mrs. Mike) Banes, Sherrie Erhardt, and Nicholle (Mrs. Bryan) Ball, all of Kahoka, MO; his mother and father, John and Cathern Huston of Kahoka, MO; his brothers and sisters: Patricia Londrie of Kahoka, MO, Nora Lucinda Martin of Winchester, MO, Beth and Gail Hopkins, Terry and Lisa Huston and David and Kris Huston all of Kahoka, MO and Vickie and Doug Matlick of Keokuk, IA; his ex-wife and life-long love, Judy Stice Huston Thompson of the home; seventeen grandchildren: Randi Hardy and fiancé, Dustin Barnett, of Troy, MO, Dallas Boudreau of Fort Madison, IA, and Nick Ball, Lori Boudreau, Lonnie, Georgia, and Virginia Feilen, Katie Banes, Madisyn Cassady, Kori Feilen, Eva Cassady, Marissa and John Ann Banes, Ryker and Judith Feilen, Constance Banes and Journey Feilen all of Kahoka, MO; three great-grandchildren, Sophia Hardy and Jax Hardy-Barrett of Troy, MO and Karma Batley of Kahoka, MO; as well as numerous nieces and nephews, aunts, uncles, cousins, and other relatives.	He was preceded in death by his paternal and maternal grandparents; a step grandson, Derrick Ball; and a nephew, Brian Stice.	John was a graduate of Clark Co. R-1 High School. He was an employee of Keokuk Steel Castings for 42 years and a member of the US Local 3311 Steelworkers. At work, they knew that John had to be really sick if he missed work.	“Follow That Dream” was one of his favorite Elvis Presley movies out of the 31 in his collection. He loved to watch westerns which he instilled in his childrens and grandchildrens’ lives. He loved to torment his family and friends and loved horses and the Kansas City Chiefs. However, his main focus was to instill morals and principles into any child that would watch or listen. For his daughters, not only was he the perfect definition of a man, but he sacrificed so much to be with and provide for his family. He was unselfish to a fault. He would give the very shirt off his back to anyone who needed anything, especially his daughters. He taught them that two wrongs did not make a right!	Fond memories were of “dad” taking his girls on family vacations to Six Flags each summer. Dad’s lectures of principles and morals, his planting trees for him and mom to sit under one day with the grandkids, provided individual and personal relationships with each one of his girls. He could not have perceived the number of grandchildren he would be blessed with and the influence he would have over his nieces and nephews. He was dedicated to caring for his mom and dad daily as long as he felt well enough. He always said “it’ll feel good when it stops hurting”.	At his request, he has been cremated. Memorial services were held Saturday, January 10, 2015 at 3 p.m. at Wilson Funeral Home with Pastors Kim McNamar and Glen Yoder officiating. Family received friends from 1 p.m. Saturday until time of services at Wilson Funeral Home.	Memorials are suggested to the family with checks being made to Charity Heusel.

Natasha, Oklahoma
Nursing Student
"My daughter recently went out for soccer. I decided it would be a good idea to run another player’s father through BeenVerified. Turns out this guy had been charged with indecent exposure and was on parole."


Maryann, New Jersey
Analyst
"I used BeenVerified to check into a guy that I had met online. It turns out he had lied to me about where he lived and his family. Needless to say, thanks to BV I severed contact with him and have not heard from him since. Thank you BV!"


Bob M, New Jersey
Retired Detective
"I am retired and have a ministry helping the dying and sick. I found a son and the mother was dying of cancer. She held on waiting for her son who had not been in touch for years."
