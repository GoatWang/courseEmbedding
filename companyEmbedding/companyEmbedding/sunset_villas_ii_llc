These factors are similar to those you might use to determine which business to select from a local Yellow Pages directory, including proximity to where you are searching, expertise in the specific services or products you need, and comprehensive business information to help evaluate a business's suitability for you. “Preferred” listings, or those with featured website buttons, indicate YP advertisers who directly provide information about their businesses to help consumers make more informed buying decisions. YP advertisers receive higher placement in the default ordering of search results and may appear in sponsored listings on the top, side, or bottom of the search results page.Sort:DefaultDefaultDistanceRatingName (A - Z)Sponsored LinksAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your home collection!Error when adding to home collectionThis business was removed from the home collection1. Villa Patricia II7835 NE 2nd AveMiami, FL 33138(305) 722-8090ApartmentsFurnished ApartmentsAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your other collection!Error when adding to other collectionThis business was removed from the other collection2. Villa Capri Ii14450 SW 280th StHomestead, FL 33032(786) 410-8948No Internet Heading AssignedAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your health collection!Error when adding to health collectionThis business was removed from the health collection3. Paradise Villas Retirement Home II2560 NW 83rd AveSunrise, FL 33322(954) 749-0538Assisted Living FacilitiesAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your travel collection!Error when adding to travel collectionThis business was removed from the travel collection4. Beach Side Villa II2111 NE 33rd AveFort Lauderdale, FL 33305(954) 565-4254MotelsLodgingAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your other collection!Error when adding to other collectionThis business was removed from the other collection5. Sunrise Island Condo II Assoc3955 N Nob Hill RdSunrise, FL 33351(954) 618-4016Condominium ManagementCondominiumsAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your shopping collection!Error when adding to shopping collectionThis business was removed from the shopping collection6. US Outlet Stores Sunrise II4668 N Hiatus RdSunrise, FL 33351(954) 572-1900Outlet MallsDepartment StoresAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your home collection!Error when adding to home collectionThis business was removed from the home collection7. Sunrise Lakes Phase II Satellite 1 - CLOSED8315 Sunrise Lakes BlvdSunrise, FL 33322Satellite & Cable TV Equipment &...Businesses in related categories to ApartmentsAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your home collection!Error when adding to home collectionThis business was removed from the home collection8. Sundance Village Apartments(1)11325 NW 7th StMiami, FL 33172(305) 559-9990ApartmentsReal Estate Rental ServiceDirectionsMore InfoIf you are attempting to check this place out don't the apartments don't last after 3 months living in them they start falling apart from the day yo…Add to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your home collection!Error when adding to home collectionThis business was removed from the home collection9. Waterford Landing(1)9052 SW 142nd AveMiami, FL 33186(305) 386-6696ApartmentsWebsiteDirectionsMore InfoI am so happy and impressed with the level of excellence in management and leasing at this location.
