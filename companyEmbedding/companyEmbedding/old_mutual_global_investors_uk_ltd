3. Investment information
3.1 General
The distribution of the information contained on this website in certain countries may be restricted by law and, accordingly, persons who access it are required to inform themselves of and to comply with any such restrictions. The information on this website does not constitute an offer or solicitation in any jurisdiction in which such an offer or solicitation is not authorised or to any person to whom it is unlawful to make such an offer or solicitation. Persons interested in acquiring any investment should inform themselves as to (i) the legal requirements within the countries of their nationality, residence, ordinary residence or domicile; (ii) any foreign exchange control requirement which they might encounter; and (iii) the income tax and other tax consequences which might be relevant to the acquisition, holding or disposal of any investment.
Where access to any part of this website is restricted or requires possession of a valid password, no other person should attempt to gain access to such part of this website. Any prices and other information on this website are provided solely to enable you to make your own investment decisions and do not constitute personal recommendations or investment advice.
3.2 Risk factors
Investors should remember that investment involves risk and that the price and value of units and shares can go down as well as up as a result of changes in the value of underlying securities and currency movements. Investors may not get back the original amount invested and past performance is not a guide to future performance. Tax assumptions may change if the law changes, and the value of tax relief (if any) will depend upon your individual circumstances. Investors should consult their own tax advisers in order to understand any applicable tax consequences.
Information included herein (including any expression of opinion or forecast) has been obtained from, or is based on, sources believed by Old Mutual to be reliable, but is not guaranteed as to its accuracy or completeness.
The content of this website is not intended to provide financial, legal, accounting or tax advice to any user and nothing on this website shall constitute investment advice or any recommendation to buy, sell or otherwise transact in any investment product, and should not be relied upon in that regard. Old Mutual neither provides investment advice to, nor receives and transmit orders from, investors in products, nor do they carry on any other activities with or for such investors that constitute MiFID or equivalent third country business for the purpose of the FCA Rules. The information on this website is provided solely on the basis that you make your own investment decisions. You should obtain relevant and specific professional advice before making any decision to enter into an investment transaction.
The foregoing list of risk factors is not complete and you should refer to the relevant offering documents with respect to individual investment products.
3.3 Investment products
(A) Investment products for private investors
An application for any Old Mutual investment products which are made available to retail clients (within the meaning of the FCA Rules) should be made having read fully not only the relevant application form but also the relevant Prospectus, Annual Report, Constitutional Document and the Key Investor Information Document applicable to the chosen product. All these relevant documents can be found on and printed from this website. Tax concessions on ISAs are not guaranteed and can change at any time. Their value will depend on individual circumstances.
(B) Unregulated collective investment schemes
To the extent that information on the Professional Client pages of this website refers to unregulated collective investment schemes (as defined in the FCA rules):
(1) such information is directed only at persons who are categorised as either a professional client or an eligible counterparty (within the meaning of the FCA Rules) and the information in relation thereto is therefore exempt from the scheme promotion restriction on the communication of invitations or inducements to participate in unregulated collective investment schemes;
(2) investments in such funds are only available to persons who are categorised as either a professional client or an eligible counterparty and information on this website must not be relied or acted upon by any other persons. In particular, any investments referred to on this website are not intended for retail clients and will not be made available to retail clients;
(3) investments in such funds do not carry the protection provided by the UK regulatory system and investors in such funds may not benefit from the rules and regulations made under the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 ("FSMA") for the protection of investors, from the Financial Services Compensation Scheme, or from the Financial Ombudsman Service; and
(4) shares in such investment funds are not dealt in or on a recognised or designated investment exchange for the purposes of FSMA, nor is there a market maker in such shares, and it may therefore be difficult for an investor to dispose of his shares otherwise than by way of redemption.
The information contained on this website relating to unregulated collective investment schemes is provided for information purposes only and does not constitute an offer to buy or sell, or amount to a solicitation or incitement or offer to buy or sell, any securities referred to herein.

                  Alt Turnover is calculated by taking either the total MV of new purchases or
                   the MV of securities sold, whichever is less,
                   divided by the total MV of the fund.

Hedging Strategies

Simple Short Exposure. This strategy effectively shorts the S&P 500 by
        buying shares in the S&P 500 Short ETF.
        Simple Hedging will assume that 100%
        of the backtest's invested principal is always in the backtest's long positions.

        For example, if you choose a 25% hedging rate, then for a $10,000 portfolio,
        you will be long $10,000 and have a $2,500 short on the S&P 500.
        The short position will adjust each rebalancing period to match 25% of the total portfolio.
        Any gains/losses from the short are added to the overall available capital for the long positions in the
        portfolio.
      

Moving Average Hedge.  With this strategy, your portfolio will be hedged
        by shorting the S&P 500 whenever your long portfolio's performance drops below the monthly moving average.
        So if you set a 25% hedge, 25% of your long portfolio will be sold and the funds reallocated to the short
        whenever the hedge is in effect.
        Once your long portfolio performance goes back over the moving average, the short hedge will be removed
        and the funds from the short will be reallocated to your long positions.
      

        When hedging strategies are being used, backtests can only go back as far as 2006.  This is the date
        the S&P 500 Short ETF first appeared.

Stock Sell Buffer

      You can optionally include a stock sell buffer in your backtesting model.
      It works by keeping a stock in your portfolio even when it would otherwise drop out
      during rebalancing as long as it remains within your sell buffer threshold.
      For example, you are backtesting with the top 20 stocks each quarter and set a sell buffer of 50.
      In the first quarter, AAPL is one of the top 20 stocks and is included in the portfolio.
      In quarter 2, AAPL drops down to number 25. Without the sell buffer, AAPL would drop out
      for that quarter, but since it is still within the sell buffer threshold of 50,
      it will remain in the portfolio.
      Your portfolio size remains the same. The stocks that would have fallen out stay in and the
      stocks that would otherwise have been added stay out. Using the sell buffer may
      help produce a lower turnover rate.
    

      Sell Buffer Size (must be greater than # of holdings in portfolio to work):
      
No sell buffer
10
25
35

Rebalancing Frequency

      By default backtester rebalances quarterly using new 13F filing data. You can
      adjust the rebalancing frequency using the dropdown below. Reasons for
      changing the frequency include lower turnover and possible tax advantages
      by keeping stocks at least one year before selling.
    


        Do not rebalance after each quarter

or rebalance:
        
Every quarter (default)
 Every other quarter
 Once a year

      By default backtester will test your strategy using all available dates going back to 2001 (for subscribers only).
      You can optionally adjust when the backtest actually starts.
