PEORIA, Ill., April 8, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE:   CAT) announced today that the Caterpillar Board of Directors has nominated Debra L. Reed to join the Board, with the election to occur at the June 2015 annual stockholders meeting.
Reed, 58, is the Chairman and CEO of Sempra Energy, a San Diego, California-based energy company.  She began her Sempra Energy career in 1978 as an engineer and worked her way into leadership positions at Sempra Energy, as well as Southern California Gas Co. and San Diego Gas & Electric, Sempra Energy's two regulated California utilities. 
"Energy is core to our business at Caterpillar, so having a Board member who has spent her entire 37-year-career at one company in this industry will greatly benefit our company," said Caterpillar Chairman and CEO Doug Oberhelman. "Debbie understands the opportunities and challenges facing the energy industry today, and she knows how to successfully run and grow an international business. She will offer a valuable and unique perspective on our Board." 
Reed's exemplary resume hasn't gone unnoticed; she has been repeatedly named to Fortune magazine's 50 Most Powerful Women in Business (2011 – 2014).  She is also a board member of Halliburton Company, a supplier to the oil and gas production industries, where she serves as the chair of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee and is a member of the Compensation Committee.

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
