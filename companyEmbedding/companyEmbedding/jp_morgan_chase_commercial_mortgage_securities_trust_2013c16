                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

	(1) Debt Service Coverage Ratios are updated periodically as new NOI figures become available from borrowers on an asset level. In all cases the most current DSCR provided by the Servicer is used. To the extent that no DSCR is provided by the Servicer, information from the offering document is used. The debt service coverage ratio information was provided to the Certificate Administrator by the Master Servicer and the Certificate Administrator has not independently confirmed the accuracy of such information.






	(2) Anticipated Remaining Term and WAM are each calculated based upon the term from the current month to the earlier of the Anticipated Repayment Date, if applicable, and the Maturity Date.






	(3) Data in this table was calculated by allocating pro-rata the current loan information to the properties based upon the Cut-Off Date Balance of the related mortgage loan as disclosed in the offering document. The Scheduled Balance Totals reflect the aggregate balances of all pooled loans as reported in the CREFC Loan Periodic Update File. To the extent that the Scheduled Balance Total figure for the “State” and "Property” stratification tables is not equal to the sum of the scheduled balance figures for each state or property, the difference is explained by loans that have been modified into a split loan structure. The “State” and “Property” stratification tables do not include the balance of the subordinate note (sometimes called the B-piece or a “hope note”) of a loan that has been modified into a split-loan structure. Rather, the scheduled balance for each state or property only reflects the balance of the senior note (sometimes called the A-piece) of a loan that has been modified into a split-loan structure.






	(4) All stratification tables include the Pooled and Non-Pooled Component balances.
