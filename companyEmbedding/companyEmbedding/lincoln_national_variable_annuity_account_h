Participation and Protection: With No Annual Fees




When planning for retirement, you can’t risk everything and you can’t protect everything.
But there is a way to have some of both.










A Shield Annuity from Brighthouse Financial can help you use a portion of your assets to take advantage of market
            growth with a level of downside protection that other options may not provide. Shield is designed to provide
            some protection in an unpredictable endeavor — investing.





Protect your retirement assets
A Brighthouse Shield Annuity is designed to provide a level of protection that, when markets inevitably turn volatile,
            ensures your losses are limited.



Participate in growth opportunities
With a Shield Annuity, balance is built-in. This means that even with the protection you enjoy, you can still take
            advantage of growth opportunities in the market up to a certain percentage.



Pay no annual fees
Unlike many financial products, you pay no annual fees with a Shield Annuity.

                                            Your Retirement Big Picture: Where Do Annuities Fit?

1 Guarantees are subject to the financial strength and claims-paying ability of the issuing insurance company.
2 Shield annuities do not invest directly in any index.
3 Product guarantees are subject to the financial strength and claims-paying ability of the issuing insurance company and are solely the responsibility of the issuing insurance company. Annuities and life insurance are issued by Brighthouse Life Insurance Company, Charlotte, NC 28277 and in New York, only by Brighthouse Life Insurance Company of NY, New York, NY 10017 and not by MetLife.
If you're buying an annuity to fund a qualified retirement plan or IRA, you should do so for the annuity's features and benefits other than tax deferral. That's because tax deferral is not an additional benefit of the annuity. References throughout this material to tax advantage, such as tax deferral and tax-free transfers, are subject to this consideration. In addition, non-qualified annuity contracts owned by corporations do not receive tax deferral on earnings. 

Prospectuses for variable annuities issued by a Brighthouse Financial insurance company, and for the investment portfolios offered thereunder, are available from Brighthouse Financial. The contract prospectus contains information about the contract's features, risks, charges and expenses. The investment objectives, risks and policies of the investment options, as well as other information about the investment options, are described in their respective prospectuses. Please read the prospectuses and consider this information carefully before investing. There is no guarantee that any of the variable investment options in a variable annuity product will meet their stated goals or objectives. The account value is subject to market fluctuations and investment risk so that, when withdrawn, it may be worth more or less than its original value even when an optional protection benefit rider is elected. Product availability and features may vary by state. Please refer to the contract prospectus for more complete details regarding the living and death benefits.

Annuities are long-term investments designed for retirement purposes. Brighthouse Financial annuities have limitations, exclusions, charges, termination provisions and terms for keeping them in force. All contract guarantees, including optional living and death benefit riders and annuity payout rates, are backed by the claims-paying ability and financial strength of issuing insurance company. They are not backed by the broker/dealer from which an annuity is purchased, by the insurance agency where an annuity is purchased, or any affiliates to those entities, and none makes any representations or guarantees regarding the claims-paying ability and financial strength of the issuing insurance company. Similarity, the issuing insurance company and the underwriter do not back the financial strength of the broker/dealer or its affiliates. Please contact your financial professional for complete details. 

Withdrawals of taxable amounts are subject to ordinary income tax and if made before age 59½, may be subject to a 10% federal income tax penalty. Some broker/dealers and financial professionals may refer to the 10% federal income tax penalty as an "additional tax" or "additional income tax" or use the terms interchangeably when discussing withdrawals taken prior to age 59½. Distributions of taxable amounts from a non-qualified annuity may also be subject to the 3.8% Unearned Income Medicare Contribution Tax on Net Investment Income if your modified adjusted gross income exceeds the applicable threshold amount. Withdrawals will reduce the living and death benefits and account value. Withdrawals may be subject to withdrawal charges. 

Any discussion of taxes is for general informational purposes only, does not purport to be complete or cover every situation, and should not be construed as legal, tax, or accounting advice. You should confer with your qualified legal, tax, and accounting advisors as appropriate.

Brighthouse Financial, an operating segment of MetLife, Inc. (NYSE: MET), announced on March 6, 2017 that it is now offering its suite of life insurance and annuity products under the Brighthouse Financial brand. 
*Data as of March 31, 2017. Total assets includes certain adjustments for transactions associated with the separation from MetLife, Inc.

Ratings as of May 2017. Operating entities collectively rated include Brighthouse Life Insurance Company (BLIC), NELICO, and Brighthouse Life Insurance Company of NY (BLNY); note, Moody’s and Fitch do not rate BLNY.
A.M. Best’s Financial Strength Rating is an independent opinion of an insurer’s financial strength and ability to meet its ongoing insurance policy and contract obligations. A Financial Strength Rating is not assigned to specific insurance policies or contracts and does not address any other risk, including, but not limited to, an insurer’s claims-payment policies or procedures; the ability of the insurer to dispute or deny claims payment on grounds of misrepresentation or fraud; or any specific liability contractually borne by the policy or contract holder. A Financial Strength Rating is not a recommendation to purchase, hold, or terminate any insurance policy, contract or any other financial obligation issued by an insurer, nor does it address the suitability of any particular policy or contract, for a specific purpose or purchaser. Ratings explanations can be found at www.ambest.com.
Fitch’s Insurer Financial Strength Rating provides an assessment of the financial strength of an insurance organization. The Insurer Financial Strength Rating is assigned to the insurance company’s policyholder obligations, including assumed reinsurance obligations and contract holder obligations, such as guaranteed investment contracts. Ratings explanations can be found at www.fitchratings.com.
Moody’s Insurance Financial Strength Rating is an opinion of the ability of an insurance company to pay punctually senior policyholder claims and obligations and also reflect the expected financial loss suffered in the event of default. Specific obligations are considered unrated unless they are individually rated because the standing of a particular insurance obligation would depend on an assessment of its relative standing under those laws governing both the obligation and the insurance company. Ratings explanations can be found at www.moodys.com.
S&P Global Insurer Financial Strength Rating is a forward-looking opinion about the financial security characteristics of an insurance organization with respect to its ability to pay under its insurance policies and contracts in accordance with their terms. This opinion is not specific to any particular policy or contract, nor does it address the suitability of a particular policy or contract for a specific purpose or purchaser. Ratings explanations can be found at www.standardandpoors.com.

More Information about Annuities





What exactly is an Annuity?

                        An annuity is an investment product that provides safe, tax-deferred growth of your
                        retirement nest egg. Annuities are considered low-risk, and can provide guaranteed, monthly
                        income when
                        you retire. There are many types of annuities with varying features & benefits. These include:
                        fixed,
                        variable, immediate, deferred & hybrid. We strongly suggest you consult with a financial
                        professional to
                        help you understand the various types of annuities before you purchase.
                    








Is an Annuity Right for You?

                        Annuities are NOT a good fit for everyone. Annuities are designed for people looking for
                        guaranteed, monthly income when they retire - they are NOT a high-risk / high-return investment.
                        They are considered to be in the mainstream of conservative retirement planning - over $225
                        billion in annuities have been purchased in the past 12 months alone!
                    








What are your Next Steps?

                        The first thing to do is to see if an annuity fits your specific profile and financial
                        situation. This "fit" is based on the amount of retirement savings you currently have, how old
                        you are, and the State you live in. Simply fill in the information above and our system will
                        generate a free, tailor-made Annuity Report that will include annuity rate quotes from A+ rated
                        companies in your area.

 Annuities

	Enjoy your retirement





A good retirement income plan should generate two to three decades of sustainable income. It can help protect your assets from inflation, market volatility and savings withdrawal rates.
What is an annuity?
An annuity is an insurance product designed for retirement to help protect your financial future and guard against outliving your savings. An annuity pays you periodic income payments for as long as you live in exchange for a premium and it’s designed to be part of an overall retirement strategy. Annuity types offer different features and payment options to help meet your needs and priorities. Compare your options.
Annuities offer many additional benefits to help you prepare for the future, such as:  

No annual contribution limit
Ability to diversify and potentially grow your investments
Tax-deferred investment income until it’s withdrawn
Death benefit protection for beneficiaries
Optional riders (for an additional cost). Review our rider options.

To decide if a variable annuity is right for you, consider that its value will fluctuate; it’s subject to investment risk and possible loss of principal; and there are costs associated.
If you have questions or for more information on annuities, contact an advisor. 
Tax considerations
Annuities allow money to grow tax-deferred until clients begin taking payments. While consumers can’t control state and federal tax rates or policies they can take steps to help protect savings and income from tax erosion, and improve spending power in retirement. 

Find out why tax planning for retirement is so important.

What type is right for me?



The two main types of annuities are fixed and variable. While both options provide guaranteed income in retirement, they each offer different features and benefits.
Fixed annuities
With a fixed annuity, premiums go toward predictable returns, growth potential and the possibility of a lifetime income stream. 
We offer three types of fixed annuities:

Fixed annuities offer a predictable return. 
Fixed indexed annuities offer growth potential and a living benefit.
Income annuities provide current and future income.

Variable annuities
A variable annuity is a flexible income solution designed for retirement that provides a guaranteed lifetime income stream. Consumers can also capture growth potential over time through the performance of underlying investment options.
To decide if a variable annuity is right for you, consider that its value will fluctuate; it’s subject to investment risk and possible loss of principal; and there are costs associated. All guarantees, including those for optional features, are subject to the claims-paying ability of the issuer. Limitations and conditions apply.

Investors are advised to consider the investment objectives, risks, and charges and expenses of the variable annuity and its underlying investment options carefully before investing. The applicable variable annuity prospectuses contains this and other important information about the variable annuity and its underlying investment options. Please call 888-868-2583 for a free prospectus. Read it carefully before investing or sending money. Products and features are subject to state availability.
 
A fixed annuity is intended for retirement or other long-term needs. It is intended for a person who has sufficient cash or other liquid assets for living expenses and other unexpected emergencies, such as medical expenses. A fixed indexed annuity is not a registered security or stock market investment and does not directly participate in any stock or equity investments, or index. The index used is a price index and does not reflect dividends paid on the underlying stocks.

	A group variable annuity is a long-term investment product designed particularly for retirement purposes. Group annuities contain both investment and insurance components and have fees and expenses, including administrative and advisory fees. Optional features may be available for an additional charge. The annuity’s value fluctuates with the market value of the underlying investment options, and all assets accumulate tax-deferred. Withdrawals may carry tax consequences, including possible tax penalties.

The Lincoln National Life Insurance Company does not solicit business in the state of New York, nor is it authorized to do so.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
The following is a summary of the application. The complete application is available for a fee from the Public Reference Branch of the Commission, 450 Fifth Street, NW, Washington, DC 20549-0102, (202) 942-8090. 
Applicants' Representations 
1. Lincoln Life was founded in 1905 under Indiana Law, and is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Lincoln National Corp., which is organized under Indiana law. Lincoln National Corp.'s primary businesses are insurance and financial services. Lincoln Life is the Annuity Accounts' depositor within the meaning of the Act.
2. Account E was established on September 26, 1986 and Account H was established on February 7, 1989 as insurance company separate accounts under Indiana law. They are registered with the Commission as unit investment trusts under the provisions of the Act. The Annuity Accounts are segregated investment accounts and as such their assets may not be charged with liabilities resulting from any other business that Lincoln Life may conduct. Income, gains and losses, whether realized or not, from assets allocated to the Annuity Accounts are, in accordance with the applicable annuity contracts, credited to or charged against the Annuity Accounts, and without regard to any other income, gains or losses of Lincoln Life. The Annuity Accounts satisfy the definition of a separate account under the federal securities law. The Annuity Accounts are registered on Form N-4 under the Act as unit investment trusts. 
3. The Annuity Accounts fund the American Legacy Series of Variable Annuity Contracts (“Legacy Contracts”) that Lincoln Life and AFD have offered and sold for a number of years including the American Legacy Contract (“Legacy I”) and the American Legacy II Contract (“Legacy II”). The contracts are flexible premium deferred variable and fixed annuity contracts under which contract owners may pay one or more purchase payments over a period of time. 
4. The subaccounts are invested in funds of the American Funds Insurance Series. To the extent that an owner selects one or more subaccounts, his or her investment in the contract will vary with the investment performance of the selected subaccount. To the extent that an owner selects the general account, Lincoln Life guarantees that the amount allocated to the general account will be credited with a minimum interest rate and Lincoln Life may credit additional interest which it may declare from time to time. Start Printed Page 8952

5. AFD is the distributor and primary underwriter of the contracts issued by Lincoln Life through the Annuity Accounts. AFD is registered as a broker-dealer under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and is a member of the National Association of Securities Dealers. 
6. The Application relates to two Legacy Contracts. The Legacy I contracts issued through Account E have been registered under the Securities Act of 1933 pursuant to a registration statement on Form N-4. The Legacy II contracts issued through Account H have been registered under the Securities Act of 1933 pursuant to a registration statement on Form N-4. 
7. During the accumulation period under the Legacy Contracts, based upon the contract owner's instructions, purchase payments are allocated to the selected subaccounts of the Annuity Accounts and/or Lincoln Life's general account. To the extent that an owner selects one or more subaccounts, his or her investment in the contract will vary with the investment performance of the selected subaccount(s). 
8. A contract owner can elect to receive annuity payments under his or her contract. Under a contract, annuity payments are based upon the life of an annuitant and in some cases the lives of two (or joint) annuitants. Annuity options are available on a variable basis (i.e., funded by the Annuity Accounts) and/or on a fixed basis (i.e., funded through Lincoln Life's general account). 
9. The Legacy I contract has been offered and sold for a number of years. The minimum purchase payment for Legacy I is $1500 for nonqualified contracts and $300 for qualified contracts. Legacy I contracts impose a surrender charge of up to 6% of any amount by which purchase payments withdrawn in any year exceed 10% of purchase payments (however, this 10% withdrawal exception does not apply to a surrender of a contract). The surrender charge associated with each purchase payment after year 2 declines 1% each year until it is 0% at the end of the seventh year after the payment was made. 
10. The Legacy I contracts also impose the following charges: (a) a daily mortality and expense risk charge at an annual rate of 1.25% of the daily net asset value of Account E; (b) for contracts that include the Enhanced Guaranteed Minimum Death Benefit (“EGMDB”), an additional daily charge at an annual rate of 0.15% of the net asset value of Account E; (c) an annual contract maintenance charge of $35; and (d) a charge corresponding to any applicable state premium tax or other tax levied by any governmental entity. 
11. The Legacy II contracts impose a minimum purchase payment of $1500 for nonqualified contracts and $300 for qualified contracts. The Legacy II contracts also impose a surrender charge of up to 6% of any amount by which purchase payments withdrawn in any year exceed 10% of purchase payments (however, this 10% withdrawal exception does not apply to a surrender of a contract). The surrender charge associated with each purchase payment after year 2 declines 1% each year until it is 0% at the end of the seventh year after the payment was made. 
12. The Legacy II contracts also impose the following charges: (a) a daily mortality and expense risk charge at an annual rate of 1.25% of the daily net asset value of Account H; (b) a daily administrative charge at an annual rate of 0.10% of the daily net asset value of Account H; (c) for those contracts that include the EGMDB, a daily charge at an annual rate of 0.15% of the net asset value of Account H; (d) an annual contract maintenance charge of $35; and (e) a charge corresponding to any applicable state premium tax or other tax levied by any governmental entity. 
13. Under both the Legacy I and Legacy II contracts, the death benefit equals the greater of: (a) the Guaranteed Minimum Death Benefit (“GMDB”), or if elected, the EGMDB, or (b) the current value of the contract as of the day Lincoln Life approves the claim for payment. For these contracts, the GMDB is equal to
a. The sum of all purchase payments, plus 
b. any gain attributable to those purchase payments as of the seventh anniversary date of each payment, minus 
c. any withdrawals.
The attributable gain consists of the earnings on each contract years' net purchase payments (purchase payments minus any withdrawals) as of the valuation date just before the seventh anniversary of the purchase payment (i.e. once the surrender charge period for the purchase payment has expired). For the GMDB to apply, the annuitant, as of the seventh anniversary of each eligible contract year, must still be living and must be less than 81 years of age. 
14. For Legacy I and Legacy II, the EGMDB is an alternative to the GMDB for nonqualified contracts or contracts used under an IRA plan. Under the EGMDB, the death benefit payable is the amount equal to the greatest of:
a. Contract value as of the day on which Lincoln Life approves the payment of the claim; or 
b. the sum of all purchase payments less the sum of all withdrawals, partial annuitizations and premium taxes incurred; or 
c. the highest contract value determined as follows: 
(i) When the first of the annuitant, sole contract owner or, in the event the contract is owned by more than one person, the named contract owner or pre-designated joint owner dies, we determine the highest contract value; 
(ii) this highest contract value is as of any contract anniversary from the time the EGMDB takes effect up to and including the decedent's age 80; 
(iii) this highest contract value is then increased by purchase payments and decreased by partial withdrawals, partial annuitizations and premium taxes made, effected or incurred subsequent to the anniversary date on which the highest contract value is attained.
15. If the Legacy I or Legacy II contract has more than one joint owner, the GMDB or EGMDB death benefit will only be paid on the death of the named contract owner or pre-designated joint owner. If the contract owner does not make this pre-designation, the youngest joint owner will be the pre-designated joint owner. Only the cash surrender values will be paid upon the death of a non-pre-designated joint owner. If there are two or more joint owners, the surrender charge is waived only on the death of the named contract owner or pre-designated joint owner.
16. Lincoln Life now proposes to offer an enhancement option (“Enhancement Offer”) to Legacy I and Legacy II contract owners whose contracts have surrender charges equal to 2% or less of their contract value. The Enhancement Offer consists of two options (collectively the “Offers”): (a) an immediate bonus credit equal to 2% of contract value (“Bonus Offer); or (b) an EGMDB at no additional cost (“EGMDB Offer”). An owner can elect only one of the options. 
17. The existing contract will remain in place. However, in exchange for the selected enhancement option the entire contract value (excluding any bonus credit, if that option was selected) will be subject to new surrender charges as of the date the option is accepted. For purposes of calculating surrender charges, the contract value (excluding the bonus credit) will be treated as a new purchase payment. Any remaining surrender charges existing prior to the time of the election of the option will be waived. 
18. The offer is only available for contracts sold in the nonqualified and IRA markets (excluding SEP or SARSEP markets), and this offer is not available for those contracts in which the primary Start Printed Page 8953owner, pre-designated joint owner, or annuitant is over age 76. 
19. For contract owners who elect the Bonus Offer or the EGMDB Offer, there will be no additional charges or any increase in existing charges other than the imposition of the new surrender charge. 
20. Contract owners who elect the EGMDB Offer receive the EGMDB at no additional cost on the date the Offer is accepted. If the contract owner had previously elected the EGMDB when he or she purchased the contract (or when the EGMDB became available in his or her state) and is thus paying for the EGMDB, under the EGMDB Offer, if elected, the 0.15% charge for the EGMDB will be discontinued as of the date the Offer is accepted, and the death benefit at all times after the enhancement will in no event be less than the death benefit that would have been payable if the Enhancement Offer had not been accepted. 
21. Contract owners may cancel the elected option for any reason within ten days (in some states longer) of the date the rider adding the option was received. Upon cancellation, Lincoln Life will waive the new surrender charge and re-establish the prior existing surrender charges, if any, as of the date of the receipt of the cancellation. The contract owner assumes the investment risk on the contract value during this period. If the Bonus Offer is cancelled according to the Right to Examine provision, the bonus credits will be revoked; however, Lincoln Life will assume the risk of investment loss on the bonus credits. Lincoln Life will also re-credit the mortality and expense risk and administrative charges proportionately attributable to the bonus credits. The contract owner will be put back into the same position as if he or she had never elected the Bonus Offer. Lincoln Life will recapture the bonus credit only upon the exercise of the free look privilege. 
22. Regarding the implementation of the Offers, Lincoln proposes to make the offers directly, by providing eligible contract owners with information about the offers through an “Offering Document” sent from the Home Office. Contract owners will be directed to Lincoln Life or their registered representatives for further information. Contract owners who express an interest in the Offers will be given a prospectus. 
23. Registered representatives who are responsible for a contract owner accepting the Bonus Offer or the EGMDB Offer will be paid a commission. The commission is less than what the registered representative would receive on the sale of a new Legacy contract. 
24. The Offering Document will advise such contract owners that the Offers have been designed for those contract owners who intend to continue to hold their contracts as long-term investments. An explanation of the terms of each offer will be provided. The Offering Document will state that the offers are not intended for all contract owners, and that they are especially not appropriate for any contract owner who anticipates surrendering more than a portion of his or her contract in excess of the free withdrawal amount (greater of 10% of the contract value or 10% of purchase payments) within the surrender charge period. In this regard, the Offering Document will encourage contract owners to carefully evaluate their personal financial situation when deciding whether to accept or reject the Offers. In addition, the Offering Document will explain how a contract owner who elects to participate in one of the offers may avoid the applicable surrender charge if no more than the annual free withdrawal amount (10% of purchase payments) is surrendered and any subsequent purchase payments are maintained until the expiration of the applicable surrender charge period. In this regard, the Offering Document will state in clear plain English that if the amended contract is surrendered during the new surrender charge period: (a) The contract owner will pay surrender charges which may be substantial, that he or she would not have paid if the offer had not been accepted; and (b) a contract owner may be worse off than if he or she had rejected the offer. The Offering Document also will state that if the contract is owned by three or more persons and an owner who is not the named contract owner or a pre-designated joint owner dies during the new surrender period, the remaining contract owners could be worse off having accepted the Enhancement Offer because a new surrender charge will apply. 
Applicants' Legal Analysis 
1. The purpose of Section 11 is to prevent the practice of inducing exchanges solely for the purpose of exacting additional selling charges. While the sales representatives will receive a commission and there will be imposed a surrender charge, Applicants argue that based on the foregoing, one should readily conclude that the sole purpose of the Offer is not to exact selling charges but to offer significant benefits to the contact owners as inducement for them to remain contract owners of Lincoln Life. 
2. Section 11(a) of the Act makes it unlawful for any registered open-end company, or any principal underwriter for such company, to make or cause to be made an offer to the holder of a security of such company, or of any other open-end investment company to exchange his security for a security in the same or another such company on any basis other than the relative net asset values of the respective securities to be exchanged, unless the terms of the offer have first been submitted to and approved by the Commission or are in accordance with Commission rules adopted under Section 11. 
3. Section 11(c) of the Act, in pertinent part, requires, in effect, that any offer of exchange of the securities of a registered unit investment trust for the securities of any other investment company be approved by the Commission or satisfy applicable rules adopted under Section 11, regardless of the basis of the exchange. 
4. The Annuity Accounts are registered under the Act as unit investment trusts. Thus, the exchange offer constitutes an offer of exchange of two securities, each of which is offered by a registered unit investment trust. While Applicants would argue that the enhancement offer on its face is not subject to Section 11 because it does not involve the offer of exchange of two securities, nonetheless, it would appear that it is the Commission's current position that offers such as the Enhancement Offer do fall within the ambit of Section 11. 
5. According to the Commission, Congress enacted Section 11 to prevent “switching,” i.e., “the practice of inducing security holders of one investment company to exchange their securities for those of a different investment company solely for the purpose of exacting additional selling charges.” According to the Commission, “[I]nvestors in ‘fixed trusts,’ now known as unit investment trusts (“UIT”), were found to be particularly vulnerable to switching operations. In order to earn another sales commission, a UIT sponsor would often pressure unit holders into exchanging their units for those of another of the sponsor's trusts.”
6. Section 11(c) of the Act requires Commission approval (by order or by rule) of any exchange, regardless of its basis, involving securities issued by a unit investment trust because investors in unit investment trusts were found by Congress to be particularly vulnerable to switching transactions. Applicants believe that the potential for harm to investors perceived in switching by Start Printed Page 8954Congress was its use to extract additional sales charges from those investors.
7. As opposed to providing a means of extracting additional sales charges, as contemplated by the prohibitions of Section 11, Applicants argue that the proposed Offers provide enduring benefits to the contract owners. To the extent that a contract owner ultimately did not benefit from accepting the offer, it would be as a result of his or her own subsequent decision to surrender the enhanced contract in circumstances that would have been the subject of very explicit disclosure. If the contract is owned by three or more persons an an owner who is not the named contract owner or a pre-designated joint owner dies during the new surrender charge period, the remaining contract owners also could be worse off having accepted the Enhancement Offer because the new CDSC will apply. This disclosure provided in the offering materials will give contract owners sufficient information to determine what is best for them.
8. Rule 11a-2, by its express terms, provides for Commission approval of certain types of offers of exchange of one variable annuity contract for another. Other than the relative net asset value requirement for the Bonus Offer, the only part of Rule 11a-2 that would not be satisfied by the proposed Offers is the requirement that payments under the existing Legacy contracts be treated as if they had been made under the enhanced contracts on the dates actually made. This provision of Rule 11a-2 is often referred to as a “tacking” requirement because it has the effecting of “tacking together” the CDSC expiration periods of the exchanged and acquired contracts.
9. Applicants believe that tacking should be viewed as a useful way to avoid the need to scrutinize the terms of an offer of exchange to make sure that there is no abuse. Tacking is not a requirement of Section 11. Rather, it is a creation of a rule designed to approve the terms of offers of exchange “sight unseen.” Tacking focuses on the closest thing to multiple deduction of sales loads that is possible in a CDSC contract—multiple exposure to sales loads upon surrender or redemption. If tacking and other safeguards of Rule 11a-2 are present, there is no need for the Commission or its staff to evaluate the terms of the offer. The absence of tacking in this fully scrutinized Section 11 application will have no import in offers made pursuant to the rule on a “sight unseen” basis.
10. In addition to providing extensive disclosure, the Offers will only be made to contract owners who are at or close to the expiration of their surrender charge period.
11. No tacking is required when Lincoln Life's competitors offer their variable annuity contracts to owners of the Legacy I and Legacy II contracts or indeed when Lincoln makes such an offer to competitors' contract owners. In those exchanges, unlike the Offers proposed here, the exchanging contract owner actually must pay any remaining CDSC on the exchanged contract at the time of the exchange. The broker/dealers that will be making recommendations to their customers regarding these offers are required to satisfy the suitability requirements. Therefore, while tacking is not present, the investor protection afforded by the suitability requirements imposed upon the broker/dealer and the additional disclosure will be. The contract owner who is fully informed of the advantages and disadvantages of the proposed offers is the person who knows best whether the benefits of the offer are appropriate for him or her.
12. By this Application, Applicants are seeking a “level playing field” to permit Lincoln to compete with offers of competitors to its longstanding contract owners. Absent the requested relief, there can be no such offers, as imposition of the Rule 11a-2 tacking requirement would make it unfeasible for the offers to be made. Applicants assert that approval of the terms of the Offers is warranted, among other reasons, because it will promote competition in the variable annuity marketplace. Such approval will foster competition by allowing Lincoln Life to make an offer to its own contract owners which would provide an attractive additional option for contract owners' consideration. Applicants argue that the Offers do not remove choices available; rather competition is increased if Lincoln Life is able to compete on a “level playing field” with its competitors.
Applicants' Conditions
If the requested order is granted, Applicants consent to the following conditions, which are intended to support the understanding that the Offers are being made to contract owners who expect to persist:
1. The Offering Document will contain, as relevant, concise, plain English statements that:
(a) The Enhancement Offer is suitable only for contract owners who expect to hold their contracts as long term investments; and
(b)(i) if a contract owner surrenders contract value over and above the free withdrawal amount before the expiration of the new surrender charge period that applies to the contract value as of the date the Enhancement Offer is accepted, the contract owner will pay surrender charges, which may be substantial, that he or she would not have paid had the offer not been accepted;
(ii) if the contract is owned by three or more persons and an owner who is not the named contract owner or a pre-designated joint owner dies during the new surrender charge period, the remaining contract owners could be worse off having accepted the Enhancement Offer because a new surrender charge will apply; and
(iii) the contract owner may be worse off than if he or she had rejected the Enhancement Offer.
2. Lincoln Life will send the Offering Document directly to eligible contract owners. A contract owner choosing either the Bonus Offer or the EGMDB Offer will then complete and sign an election form which will prominently restate in concise, plain English the statements required in Condition No. 1, and will return it to Lincoln Life. If the election form or the internal exchange form is more than two pages long, Lincoln Life will use a separate document to obtain the contract owner's acknowledgment of the statements referred to in Condition No. 1.
3. Lincoln Life will maintain the following separately identifiable records in an easily accessible place, for the time periods specified below in this Condition 3 for review by the Commission upon request:
(a) Records showing the level of acceptances of the Enhancement Offer and how these acceptances relate to the total number of contract owners eligible to participate in the offer (quarterly as a percentage of the number eligible);
(b) copies of any form of Offering Document, and any other written materials or scripts for presentations by representatives regarding the Enhancement Offer that Lincoln Life either prepares or approves, including the dates that such Offering Document and materials were used;
(c) records containing information about each Enhancement Offer election that occurs, including the name of the contract owner; the old and new contract numbers; the amount of CDSC waived on the transaction; bonus credit paid; if the EGMDB is elected or the EGMDB fee is waived; the name and CRD number of the registered representative soliciting the Enhancement Offer, firm affiliation, branch office address and telephone number of the registered representative Start Printed Page 8955soliciting the Enhancement Offer; the name and CRD number of the registered representative's broker-dealer; commission paid; the election form (and separate document, if any, used to obtain the contract owner's acknowledgment of the statements required in Condition No. 1) showing the name, date of birth, address and telephone number of the contract owner and the date the election form (or separate document) was signed; amount of contract value at the time of election of the Enhancement Offer; and persistency information relating to the enhanced contract, including the date of any subsequent surrender and the amount of CDSC paid on the surrender; and
(d) logs showing a record of any contract owner complaint about the Enhancement Offer; state insurance department inquiries about the Enhancement Offer; or litigation, arbitration or other proceedings regarding any enhanced contract. The logs will include the date of the complaint or commencement of the proceeding, name and address of the person making the complaint or commencing the proceeding, nature of the complaint or proceeding, and the persons named or involved in the complaint or proceeding.
Applicants will retain records specified in (a) and (d) for a period of six years after the date the records are created; records specified in (b) for a period of six years after the date of last use; and records specified in (c) for a period of two years after the date that the CDSC period of the Enhanced Contract ends with respect to contract value as of the date the Enhancement Offer is accepted.
4. The Offering Document will disclose in concise plain English each aspect of the enhanced contracts that will be less favorable than the old contracts.
Conclusion
For all the reasons discussed above, Applicants submit (1) that the Offers provide additional benefits to contract owners, may be advantageous for the owners to whom they will be offered, and do not contravene any policy or purpose of Section 11, and (2) that approval of Applicants' Offers as described, and subject to the conditions set forth in this Application, is appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policies and provisions of the Act. Therefore, Applicants submit that the Commission should grant the approval sought by this Application.

Participation and Protection: With No Annual Fees




When planning for retirement, you can’t risk everything and you can’t protect everything.
But there is a way to have some of both.










A Shield Annuity from Brighthouse Financial can help you use a portion of your assets to take advantage of market
            growth with a level of downside protection that other options may not provide. Shield is designed to provide
            some protection in an unpredictable endeavor — investing.





Protect your retirement assets
A Brighthouse Shield Annuity is designed to provide a level of protection that, when markets inevitably turn volatile,
            ensures your losses are limited.



Participate in growth opportunities
With a Shield Annuity, balance is built-in. This means that even with the protection you enjoy, you can still take
            advantage of growth opportunities in the market up to a certain percentage.



Pay no annual fees
Unlike many financial products, you pay no annual fees with a Shield Annuity.

1 Guarantees are subject to the financial strength and claims-paying ability of the issuing insurance company.
2 Shield annuities do not invest directly in any index.
3 Product guarantees are subject to the financial strength and claims-paying ability of the issuing insurance company and are solely the responsibility of the issuing insurance company. Annuities and life insurance are issued by Brighthouse Life Insurance Company, Charlotte, NC 28277 and in New York, only by Brighthouse Life Insurance Company of NY, New York, NY 10017 and not by MetLife.
If you're buying an annuity to fund a qualified retirement plan or IRA, you should do so for the annuity's features and benefits other than tax deferral. That's because tax deferral is not an additional benefit of the annuity. References throughout this material to tax advantage, such as tax deferral and tax-free transfers, are subject to this consideration. In addition, non-qualified annuity contracts owned by corporations do not receive tax deferral on earnings. 

Prospectuses for variable annuities issued by a Brighthouse Financial insurance company, and for the investment portfolios offered thereunder, are available from Brighthouse Financial. The contract prospectus contains information about the contract's features, risks, charges and expenses. The investment objectives, risks and policies of the investment options, as well as other information about the investment options, are described in their respective prospectuses. Please read the prospectuses and consider this information carefully before investing. There is no guarantee that any of the variable investment options in a variable annuity product will meet their stated goals or objectives. The account value is subject to market fluctuations and investment risk so that, when withdrawn, it may be worth more or less than its original value even when an optional protection benefit rider is elected. Product availability and features may vary by state. Please refer to the contract prospectus for more complete details regarding the living and death benefits.

Annuities are long-term investments designed for retirement purposes. Brighthouse Financial annuities have limitations, exclusions, charges, termination provisions and terms for keeping them in force. All contract guarantees, including optional living and death benefit riders and annuity payout rates, are backed by the claims-paying ability and financial strength of issuing insurance company. They are not backed by the broker/dealer from which an annuity is purchased, by the insurance agency where an annuity is purchased, or any affiliates to those entities, and none makes any representations or guarantees regarding the claims-paying ability and financial strength of the issuing insurance company. Similarity, the issuing insurance company and the underwriter do not back the financial strength of the broker/dealer or its affiliates. Please contact your financial professional for complete details. 

Withdrawals of taxable amounts are subject to ordinary income tax and if made before age 59½, may be subject to a 10% federal income tax penalty. Some broker/dealers and financial professionals may refer to the 10% federal income tax penalty as an "additional tax" or "additional income tax" or use the terms interchangeably when discussing withdrawals taken prior to age 59½. Distributions of taxable amounts from a non-qualified annuity may also be subject to the 3.8% Unearned Income Medicare Contribution Tax on Net Investment Income if your modified adjusted gross income exceeds the applicable threshold amount. Withdrawals will reduce the living and death benefits and account value. Withdrawals may be subject to withdrawal charges. 

Any discussion of taxes is for general informational purposes only, does not purport to be complete or cover every situation, and should not be construed as legal, tax, or accounting advice. You should confer with your qualified legal, tax, and accounting advisors as appropriate.

Brighthouse Financial, an operating segment of MetLife, Inc. (NYSE: MET), announced on March 6, 2017 that it is now offering its suite of life insurance and annuity products under the Brighthouse Financial brand. 
*Data as of March 31, 2017. Total assets includes certain adjustments for transactions associated with the separation from MetLife, Inc.

Ratings as of May 2017. Operating entities collectively rated include Brighthouse Life Insurance Company (BLIC), NELICO, and Brighthouse Life Insurance Company of NY (BLNY); note, Moody’s and Fitch do not rate BLNY.
A.M. Best’s Financial Strength Rating is an independent opinion of an insurer’s financial strength and ability to meet its ongoing insurance policy and contract obligations. A Financial Strength Rating is not assigned to specific insurance policies or contracts and does not address any other risk, including, but not limited to, an insurer’s claims-payment policies or procedures; the ability of the insurer to dispute or deny claims payment on grounds of misrepresentation or fraud; or any specific liability contractually borne by the policy or contract holder. A Financial Strength Rating is not a recommendation to purchase, hold, or terminate any insurance policy, contract or any other financial obligation issued by an insurer, nor does it address the suitability of any particular policy or contract, for a specific purpose or purchaser. Ratings explanations can be found at www.ambest.com.
Fitch’s Insurer Financial Strength Rating provides an assessment of the financial strength of an insurance organization. The Insurer Financial Strength Rating is assigned to the insurance company’s policyholder obligations, including assumed reinsurance obligations and contract holder obligations, such as guaranteed investment contracts. Ratings explanations can be found at www.fitchratings.com.
Moody’s Insurance Financial Strength Rating is an opinion of the ability of an insurance company to pay punctually senior policyholder claims and obligations and also reflect the expected financial loss suffered in the event of default. Specific obligations are considered unrated unless they are individually rated because the standing of a particular insurance obligation would depend on an assessment of its relative standing under those laws governing both the obligation and the insurance company. Ratings explanations can be found at www.moodys.com.
S&P Global Insurer Financial Strength Rating is a forward-looking opinion about the financial security characteristics of an insurance organization with respect to its ability to pay under its insurance policies and contracts in accordance with their terms. This opinion is not specific to any particular policy or contract, nor does it address the suitability of a particular policy or contract for a specific purpose or purchaser. Ratings explanations can be found at www.standardandpoors.com.

More Information about Annuities





What exactly is an Annuity?

                        An annuity is an investment product that provides safe, tax-deferred growth of your
                        retirement nest egg. Annuities are considered low-risk, and can provide guaranteed, monthly
                        income when
                        you retire. There are many types of annuities with varying features & benefits. These include:
                        fixed,
                        variable, immediate, deferred & hybrid. We strongly suggest you consult with a financial
                        professional to
                        help you understand the various types of annuities before you purchase.
                    








Is an Annuity Right for You?

                        Annuities are NOT a good fit for everyone. Annuities are designed for people looking for
                        guaranteed, monthly income when they retire - they are NOT a high-risk / high-return investment.
                        They are considered to be in the mainstream of conservative retirement planning - over $225
                        billion in annuities have been purchased in the past 12 months alone!
                    








What are your Next Steps?

                        The first thing to do is to see if an annuity fits your specific profile and financial
                        situation. This "fit" is based on the amount of retirement savings you currently have, how old
                        you are, and the State you live in. Simply fill in the information above and our system will
                        generate a free, tailor-made Annuity Report that will include annuity rate quotes from A+ rated
                        companies in your area.

Earn Uncorrelated Returns of up to 5% In Shorter Term Maturities
Fixed annuity payment streams offer the opportunity for “yield alpha.” Because the periodic payments from annuities are unrated cashflows, they can be purchased at a discount. However, these same payment streams are backed by insurance companies rated A or better by A.M. Best Company.
Combined, these two features enable our clients to realize above average, risk adjusted returns of up to 5% annually.
Fixed annuities fund a variety of obligations including lotteries, personal injury settlements and investments. These secondary market annuities enable investors to capitalize on cashflows from a variety of diversified sources.
Structured Settlement Benefits

Higher Yields. Opportunities in structured settlements offer significantly higher yields than comparable fixed rate products.
Uncorrelated. Because structured settlement cashflows are long term insurance company obligations, they are generally considered to be uncorrelated to the economy at large.
Proven. Historically, defaults on annuity payments have been a fraction of the defaults typically associated with commercial loans.
Safer. Structured settlement cashflows are backed by insurance companies rated A or better. Even insurance companies that have merged, acquired or ceased operations are backed by runoff insurance which pays outstanding obligations such as payment streams.
Regulated. Insurance companies are subject to extensive regulation which includes federal oversight in addition to state-by-state insurance commissions.
Steady. Buyers of structured settlement payment streams receive regular, monthly payments following their initial investment.




"In addition to introducing me to solutions that fit my wealth-creation needs, the company puts its money where its mouth is. Woodbridge puts its own capital right alongside that of its clients, in exactly the same products. With an experienced firm’s skin in the game, I sleep much better at night." – Leonard Shemtob

11 Annuity Tips You Should Know









































11 Tips You Absolutely Must Know About Annuities  




Tip #11: There are different types of annuities.  Some are designed for accumulation and growth; while others are designed to maximize retirement income. Fixed annuities provide a safe alternative to bank CD’s. It’s very important to select the right type of annuity for your situation. 





Get My Annuity Report Now!


2017's Best Annuities - Find the annuities with the highest rates, lowest fees and highest guaranteed returns in our free report




Tip #10: If you purchase a traditional fixed annuity, find a company that has a history of providing competitive renewal rates. This is important because the interest rate you earn is only guaranteed for a portion of the term. Some companies have a history of paying better renewal rates than others. The rates for CD-type annuities remain the same for the term. 







Tip #8: If you purchase an immediate annuity with a “life with cash refund or life with installment refund”, the listed beneficiaries will receive 100% of the remaining dollars.  Annuities avoid probate, so select the right beneficiary!




Tip #9:
  Rates that look too good to be true, usually are. Make sure to check the companies rating before purchasing and look for stable, highly rated companies. You also want to diversify. Don't invest all of your savings with 1 company. 







Tip #5: Income annuities (SPIA’s) usually provide the highest contractually guaranteed payout of any type of annuity if you need “income now”. SPIA's also have no fees.  




Looking for retirement income? Our free report shops 150+ annuities and highlights the companies with the highest guaranteed returns




Our Free Report compares 1,420 annuities from America's two largest annuity databases








Tip #7: Insurance agents usually get paid more the longer the money is locked up.  Many states have banned annuities with terms over 10 years.  You should do the same. 




Tip #6: You might have seen annuity ads where an annuity earned 12-15% with no risk. These come from "uncapped" index annuities. These returns are possible when market indexes go up considerably. Keep in mind these returns are not normal. 




Bonus Tip :  Let us help you. Request our free annuity report and we will send you what we feel are the best annuities available on the market today. Our free report compares 1,420 annuities from America's two largest annuity databases to find the highest guaranteed returns.

Tip #4:  Be careful of the fees on variable annuities.  Variable annuities have many different layers of fees. Get an itemized breakdown of all of the fees.  If your variable annuity earns 7-9% gross and you pay 3-4% in fees, you may be better off in fixed products.




Tip #3: Shop around. Don't buy any annuity until you compare the rates, benefits and fees of all of the products available.   Rates vary considerably! The top 5 year fixed annuity is now paying 220% more interest than the bottom in our database. 




Tip #2:  Index annuities - 1. Does it have a cap?  2. In plain english, how is the gain calculated?  If you are looking at index annuities with an income rider, we can compare 150+ products and show you which products guarantee the most income in our free report. 











Tip #1:
 Longevity annuities (DIA's) allow you to take a lump sum and turn it into "income later". The US treasury department and IRS have endorsed this type of annuity in recent years and made them more accessible in 401(k) plans.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
