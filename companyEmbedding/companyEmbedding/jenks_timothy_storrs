Investing Insights



Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/29/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.

Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance data quoted.  Yield and return will vary, therefore, you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares.Stock markets are volatile and can decline significantly in response to adverse issuer, political, regulatory, market, or economic developments.

I'd now like to turn the call over to Erica Mannion, at Sapphire Investor Relations, Investor Relations for NeoPhotonics.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Erica L. Mannion, Sapphire Investor Relations, LLC - President [2]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Good morning. Thank you for joining us to discuss NeoPhotonics operating results for the first quarter of 2017 and outlook for the second quarter of 2017. With me today are Tim Jenks, Chairman and CEO; and Ray Wallin, Chief Financial Officer. Tim will begin with brief comments on the first quarter and then discuss market dynamics currently impacting the second quarter. Ray will then provide financial results for the first quarter and the outlook for the second quarter of fiscal 2017 before turning it back to Tim to provide further detail on the outlook of the business before opening the call for questions.Material contained in the webcast is the sole property and copyright of NeoPhotonics with all rights reserved.

Various factors could cause actual results to differ materially. Some of these Risk Factors have been set forth in our press release dated May 5, 2017, and are described at length in our annual and quarterly SEC filings. Now I'll turn the call over to CEO, Tim Jenks.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Timothy Storrs Jenks, NeoPhotonics Corporation - Chairman of the Board, CEO and President [3]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Thank you for joining us today. As we discussed on our prior call, we are pleased that our Q1 marked a milestone in our transition to a purely high-speed company with our focus on 100-gigabit and above as networks are moving to 400-gig and 600-gig. Following the sale of our low-speed transceiver assets and with slowness in China, revenue was in line with our outlook at $72 million. Quarterly shipments in the China region excluding low speed products were down approximately 40% versus the prior quarter in contrast to the growth in our business outside of China approaching 10% sequentially. Demand was very strong in China with overly optimistic forecast entering 2017. A leading customer there accumulated significant inventory as a result.Read MoreBut as we discussed on our call in mid-March, demand dropped precipitously as they moved to rapidly adjust their outsized inventory to align with their production given that expected China tenders had not materialized. I will return to this topic shortly. Coupled with these demand dynamics, our revenue performance in Q1 additionally reflects the seasonal impact from pricing Chinese New Year and other factors as we have discussed on prior calls. Gross margin was 26%, adversely impacted by unfavorable direct material procurement costs from a major contract manufacturing partner, a mixed shift due to the customer, the China customer inventory plus underutilization on lower volumes in on our own hand. The inventory overhang and customer actions to reduce it, in turn reduced our Q1 outlook and will similarly impact our Q2.Notably some products with elevated levels of inventory are also among our higher-margin products such that during the period of burning off this inventory, our margins are being adversely affected. We've queried direct NEM, network equipment manufacturer customers and their telecom carrier customers in China, and things remains slow, though anticipating subsequent near-term tender awards from China Mobile. We expect the national backbone business will go to existing vendors without major announcements, and that provincial business will be new awards from China Mobile as well as from China Telecom and China Unicom as the year progresses.As noted previously, we believe that the total annual port volume will be up from 2016 levels, though given tender delays thus far and with limited visibility, we expect our second quarter will be only modestly up as the significant China inventory overhang is reduced and with continuing growth in the West. Recall also that a meaningful amount of our shipments, notably including those in China are from VMI, Vendor Managed Inventory, so we do not recognize revenue until our customer pulls it for use from their warehouse and provides us notification. This is different than sales and shipment by purchase order, wherein delivery and recognition timing is set at the time the purchase order is placed rather than VMI, where revenue recognition timing remains in the customers control until fulfillment. We believe that in China, the pulls against VMI are a very strong indicator of current customer demand. As such, such VMI planned pulls from leading Chinese customers are slow in the current period and are expected to continue that way until new tenders are awarded and their inventory deflates. That said, the finished goods in VMI is committed for sale to the end customer within a contracted period, at which time, the customer must take it. We saw both the build of inventory and the coming China market softness in early March. And we discussed this on our last call.We now anticipate continuing China softness through Q2 as they consume inventory, followed by a stronger China market in the second half of the year as new provincial tenders are awarded and our Chinese customers increase their pulls on both our production and are higher-than-normal in the quarter finished goods inventory. This will lead to a normalized product mix and gross margin. Again, the overall forecast for port deployments in China are higher for 2017 and 2016, and are similarly expected to be higher in 2018 than this year. The overall demand picture and the strength of the China market remains intact. China continues to build 100-gigabit capacities to extend such capacities to smaller cities and provinces, and they're now looking forward as 5G installations in certain cities are being planned. Shifting to the data center market, we are supplying key components into module supply chains. And due to the continuing demand we're experiencing, we are steadily increasing output. This market contributes roughly 10% to 15% of our revenue. In light of our current visibility, we believe we're taking prudent steps in managing the business. Following the sale of our low-speed transceiver assets and with continued slowness in the first half of this year, we're implementing several cost savings measures including limited restructuring actions, reducing SG&A and thinning R&D in legacy areas. By addressing our operating expenses for the year, we expect to realize increased leverage as demand returns as Ray will detail shortly. That said, we have production capacities in place to serve what we expect to be a stronger second half of 2017 compared to the first half.So I'll now turn it over to Ray to provide further detail on financial performance. Ray?--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Clyde Raymond Wallin, NeoPhotonics Corporation - CFO and SVP [4]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Thank you, Tim, and good morning. Before I provide financial details, since this will be my last conference call at NeoPhotonics, on a personal note, I want to thank my team for the accomplishments we've made in the last 3 years including build-out of our global finance organization. I have enjoyed working with the many talented and committed individuals at NeoPhotonics. And revenue for the first quarter totaled $71.7 million, which, as we discussed on our last call, was lower due to the sale of our low-speed transceiver assets in January, and the slowness we're seeing in China, which Tim discussed. Related to our low-speed transceiver assets, as a reminder, these products had revenue of approximately $63 million in 2016, and contributed roughly $1.5 million to revenue in Q1 for shipments in the first 2 weeks of the quarter prior to the close of the transaction. Sales of our high-speed products were $58.7 million or 82% of revenue and networking products represented $13 million or 18% of revenue.Now revenue excluding the divested low-speed products of $1.5 million for the first quarter was $70.2 million. Our non-GAAP gross margin was 26%, down from 33% in the first quarter of 2016, and down from 30% in the fourth quarter as Tim explained. Total non-GAAP operating expense for the first quarter was $30.2 million, an increase of 14% versus the fourth quarter. Now this reflected some period costs and higher annual audit costs in the first quarter. Now these factors will not be continuing cost. And our non-GAAP operating loss for the first quarter was $11.3 million or 16% of revenue, down from an operating margin of 6% in the fourth quarter.Now non-GAAP net loss in the first quarter was $10.7 million based on a fully diluted share count of 42.6 million shares, and this translates to a loss per share of $0.25. For the first quarter, adjusted EBITDA was a loss of $5.2 million. I will close out my discussion of the first quarter income statement with a review of our GAAP results. Our first quarter gross margin was 26%, down from 28% in the fourth quarter, including a $2 million gain on the sale of the low-speed product assets, operating expense was $30.4 million. Operating loss was $11.9 million for the first quarter, which included approximately $0.4 million of amortization of acquisition-related intangibles, $1.9 million in stock-based compensation expense, $0.3 million in restructuring charges and $0.1 million of cost related to the divestiture of our low-speed transceiver product assets along with the gain on the sale of the low-speed transceiver product assets of $2 million. Now net loss was $11.5 million for the quarter, down from net income of $2 million in the prior period.Geographically, our revenue mix for the first quarter was 17% in the Americas, China was 54%, Japan was 5% and the rest of the world was 24%. Note that these figures are based on shipment destination, not the end use destination. Now further, the sale of our low-speed transceiver products appreciably lowered our percent of revenues from China. And we had 2 10% or greater customers in the first quarter of 2017. Ciena comprised approximately 14% of our total revenue flat with our fourth quarter. And Huawei Technologies and its affiliates, high silicon technologies together comprised 41% of our total revenue compared to 53% in the fourth quarter and 50% of our total revenue excluding the low-speed products for that period. Now a full reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP numbers for the quarter is included in our press release.Going forward, as Tim described, we're implementing a series of cost-saving measures in light of both our sale of low-speed transceiver product assets and due to the current level of outlook from China. Now these changes include rationalizing the number of our product lines, reducing our real estate footprint and making certain staffing reductions in line with the elimination of our low-speed transceiver product line. Now we believe we will save on the order of $6 million to $9 million in annualized operating costs and we are looking further for areas to increase savings as the year progresses. And we expect the full quarterly impact of our cost reduction actions to be realized by Q3 and we expect to record a pretax charge of a range of approximately $0.7 million to $1 million for severance cost in Q2. And we're seeking to continue with limited critical hiring to ensure our key R&D development move a pace and to maintain our production capabilities to respond to any upside.Now turning to the balance sheet, we finished the quarter with $91.5 million in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash, down from $105.6 million at December 31, 2016. Our restricted cash at March 31, 2017, was $3.7 million. Now accounts receivable was $70.9 million with day sales outstanding at 89 days. Now net inventory was $69.2 million with 117 days of inventory on hand. Our capital expenditures were $17.6 million in the first quarter and depreciation and amortization was $6.2 million.As a reminder, we're very well along in our previously announced capacity expansion plan. And to this end, with both progress to date and with China overhang, we anticipate returning to our normalized CapEx of 6% to 8% of revenue in the second half.Now before I discuss our revenue and earnings outlook for the second quarter of fiscal 2017, I want to once again remind everyone of our public filings with the SEC and our safe harbor statement included in our press release that discusses the risks and uncertainties that could affect future performance causing actual results to differ materially from our forward-looking statements.Now as Tim noted, we expect our second quarter revenues will be only modestly up after excluding low-speed product revenues for the reasons we have discussed. We are not seeing an increase in gross margin primarily because of the temporary adverse mix impacts with low volumes on higher-margin products, largely, the result of China's inventory overhang.In addition, during recent quarters, we have added net capacity, resulting in higher depreciation costs on flat revenue in Q2. At the same time, production yields have largely normalized, so that we expect to continue increasing output with increased demand in the second half as we continue production levels in line with our customer forecasts.At this point, we anticipate demand growing late in Q2 as there are some current indicators for this timing. So given these factors, the company's expectations for the June 2017 quarter are: Revenue in the range of $68 million to $74 million; non-GAAP gross margin in the range of 23% to 26%; GAAP diluted net loss per share in the range of $0.26 to $0.34 per share and non-GAAP diluted net loss per share in the range of $0.19 to $0.26 per share. Now these numbers are reflective of approximately 43.3 million fully diluted shares. I'll now turn the call back to Tim.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Timothy Storrs Jenks, NeoPhotonics Corporation - Chairman of the Board, CEO and President [5]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Thank you, Ray. As I noted earlier, we believe that demand for 100-gigabit and beyond products will be stronger in the second half of 2017 than in the first half. The market dynamics driving growth in the optics market and which we have discussed on previous calls remains very robust. The China market is a timing issue related to the transition from national backbone deployments to provincial backbone and metro deployments and related to the accumulated inventory overhang. Worldwide metro and data center interconnect 100-gigabit coherent deployments continue to grow and now exceed long-haul levels by ports. CapEx by web-scale content providers remains robust with multiple mega data centers planned are under construction, resulting in high demand for short-reach and long-reach 100-gigabit client optics modules and components. 100-gig is now standard in all line side and client side applications and networks are moving rapidly to 200-gig and 400-gig with 600-gig on the horizon for data center interconnect fat pipe applications.This is important as we believe we are well positioned to serve these growing 400-gig and beyond markets with both new products and expanded capacity. In line with these drivers, over the last few months, we announced a number of exciting new products, which will accelerate our growth in 2017 and beyond, targeting growth in metro, provincial China backbone and data center interconnect networks is our pluggable coherent CFP-DCO module which supports both 100-gig and 200-gig utilizing 16QAM modulation. For high-capacity data center interconnect and flex coherent metro markets, we demonstrated our [64/64] CFP2-DCO pluggable module capable of single wave length 400-gig and 600-gig connections with a baud rate of 64 gigabaud and supporting up to 64QAM modulation, which means it could handle all data rates from 100-gig up to 600-gig. We also announced a partnership with Ciena to develop, manufacture and sell a new single wave length 400-gig 5x7-inch transponder utilizing Ciena's WaveLogic Ai DSP chipset.Together, these products comprise a suite of 400-gigabit module supporting a full range of modules and applications in key growth market segments. Supporting our modules, we also introduced and demonstrated the new 64-gigabaud micro modulator with integrated drivers, designed for use in such CFP2 and smaller coherent module applications and providing data rates of 400-gigabit and faster. This is important as our new micro modulator completes our full line of coherent components for 400-gig and beyond and it fulfills all new performance requirements for the most demanding high-speed coherent transmission applications including high bandwidth, low-power consumption in very small size. Adding this modulator to our portfolio expands our total addressable market or TAM by an estimated $400 million. Continuing our focus on switching for colorless, directionless and contention-less or CDC, network architectures suitable for SDN networks, we introduced a new 8x16 multicast switch and we continue to innovate on this front as we are working with each of the leading systems companies who support the most advanced DDC network architectures. For applications inside the data center, we introduced our new nonhermetic laser arrays to drive short-reach silicon photonics-based interconnects and modules, notably in PSM4 and CWDM QSFP28 modules. Finally, we announced our new low-power consumption 28 gigabaud EML laser with integrated driver designed for LR and ZR reaches at 100-gig, 200-gig PAM4 and 400-gig PAM4 applications.We also demonstrated our 400-gig CFP8 LR8 pluggable module and we anticipate that our next-generation 56 gigabaud EML lasers, which can transmit at 400-gigabit data rates using only 4 lasers, again utilizing PAM4, should see deployment the following year and will enable even smaller DDQSFP and OSFP modules for 400-gigabit data center use. The mid- and long-term market drivers for our business remain compelling. China remains committed through the China broadband 2020 initiative to continue build-out of the national back bone network and expand build-outs of 100-gig provincial and metro networks. As we've noted, our OEM customers in China expect these actions to increase the number of 100-gigabit ports in China in 2017 over 2016. But with deployments being anticipated to ramp in the second half of the year. In North America, we continue to see strong demand driven by North American carriers with continued metro strength at Verizon and AT&T and growing DCI deployments. Finally, before opening up the call for questions, I would like to thank Ray Wallin for the contributions he made in the NeoPhotonics over the last 3 years. Leveraging his expertise, Ray played an important role in building strength in our finance organization and has added to the strength of the company's financial position. We wish him success with his future endeavors. This concludes our formal comments.And now, I'd like to ask the operator to open up the line for questions. Matt?================================================================================Questions and Answers--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Operator [1]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------(Operator Instructions) And we'll take our first question from Simon Leopold with Raymond James.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Simon Matthew Leopold, Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division - Research Analyst [2]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------I want to just get a couple of housekeeping nuggets out of the way, if I might first, and then get into real question. Just CapEx in the quarter, please?--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Clyde Raymond Wallin, NeoPhotonics Corporation - CFO and SVP [3]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------$17.6 million.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Simon Matthew Leopold, Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division - Research Analyst [4]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------$17.6 million. And you indicated trending back down in the second half of the year, what do you expect for the second quarter?--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Clyde Raymond Wallin, NeoPhotonics Corporation - CFO and SVP [5]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Let's see here. Well, it's going to trend down slightly, Simon, to about $15 million. And then in the fourth quarter, it drops off. Well, second quarter, $15million. Third and fourth quarter, it drops off precipitously.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Simon Matthew Leopold, Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division - Research Analyst [6]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Okay. And then I don't believe you gave us the typical segment breakdown between the networks in 100-gig and above?--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Clyde Raymond Wallin, NeoPhotonics Corporation - CFO and SVP [7]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Well, it's 82% on the high-speed and 18% on the network solutions.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Simon Matthew Leopold, Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division - Research Analyst [8]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Okay. Great. Sorry, if you give that, I missed it. And then in terms of kind of the -- what's going on with the gross margin and the cost reductions. Couple of questions, sort of trying to understand that. So a little bit surprised about the gross margin weakness here, particularly, relative to the forecast for this quarter. So 1 of the things I'm trying to understand is, how much is fixed asset? How much is underutilized staff? Is there any way to give us a little bit of color between those 2 factors, and maybe the metrics of where your headcount is and where it could go?--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Clyde Raymond Wallin, NeoPhotonics Corporation - CFO and SVP [9]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Yes. So if you look at the gross margin, in Q1, 26% versus the Q4, call it 30% on a non-GAAP basis. If we kind of bridge that, it's about 2 points from the material cost that we talked about, higher, it's about a point from utilization and about a point from mix.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Simon Matthew Leopold, Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division - Research Analyst [10]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------And where's your headcount on the quarter?--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Clyde Raymond Wallin, NeoPhotonics Corporation - CFO and SVP [11]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------We have -- in the total company we have 1,951 people. We can give you the breakdown by function, if you like, but it's roughly 2,000 across the whole company.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Simon Matthew Leopold, Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division - Research Analyst [12]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------And where do you expect to be at the end of Q4?--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Timothy Storrs Jenks, NeoPhotonics Corporation - Chairman of the Board, CEO and President [13]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------I think we -- the number of -- the total number of people, Simon, includes deal that varies by production level. So it's hard to say. We don't have a quarterly forecast of headcount.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Simon Matthew Leopold, Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division - Research Analyst [14]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Okay. Well, I guess, what I'm trying to get at is, making sure I get comfortable with where OpEx is going in terms of restructuring. But roughly speaking, if your operating expenses pro forma are about $30 million this quarter, we should be thinking that December should be in the neighborhood of $28 million. Is that correct?--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Clyde Raymond Wallin, NeoPhotonics Corporation - CFO and SVP [15]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------No. Actually Simon, it's going to be substantially less than that. I would say that by the time we get to the fourth quarter of 2017 on a non-GAAP basis, our OpEx will be closer to $25 million, $26 million, probably on the lower side.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Simon Matthew Leopold, Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division - Research Analyst [16]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Okay. That's very helpful. And then I wanted to come back to the inventory topic, I'm sorry for taking so much time here. But so many moving parts in this space. In the past, I think many of us have had the impression that the use of vendor managed inventory would reduce the risk of inventory buildups, and that does not seem to be the case. So I understand things age-out of the VMI hubs and get shipped to the customer anyway, and so there's some risk. But could you help us bridge and get comfortable with why vendor managed inventory didn't address the idea that inventory could get built-up in the channel?--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Timothy Storrs Jenks, NeoPhotonics Corporation - Chairman of the Board, CEO and President [17]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------This is Tim, Simon. I think it's with the things going on right now, it's a particularly important point. So the existence of vendor managed inventory at certain customers means that they have strong control over a certain amount of inventory that's actually in their warehouse. And therefore, they're able to meter that with their production demand rather than continuing to receive product that they may have ordered in prior months or even quarter that is due for delivery and will be delivered whether or not they have the production demand to take it. So with VMI in this particular situation, there is less inventory buildup in fact, in the VMI hub. That is a difference, I think, it -- we noted the demand situation actually on our last call and we began to see it in very early March. And ultimately, that's an ongoing conversation with the customer, not only how much inventory might be in hubs, but also what their intentions are to use it or to pull it. So ultimately going forward that same pattern will play out as production levels increase or fluctuate over time.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Simon Matthew Leopold, Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division - Research Analyst [18]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Great. And 1 last, just trending question. It sounds as if the market and industry are shifting more quickly than some had expected from CFP form factors to QSFP28 form factors. And that may be reflective of what's going on in web-scale and not just the telco side of world, can you help us understand your positioning in this and your view on that market transition?--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Timothy Storrs Jenks, NeoPhotonics Corporation - Chairman of the Board, CEO and President [19]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Okay. The QSFP market, of course, we're referring significantly to both the data com and the client side in the CFP2. We're referring primarily to the CFP and CFP2, we're referring primarily to the client-side. We sell components in both. But, while there's continuing CFP and CFP2, the growth rate in the QSFP28 is considerably higher. So there's a shift in the preponderance of production moving to the QSFP28 and that is consuming a greater portion of the components as well. That -- does that get to your point?--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Simon Matthew Leopold, Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division - Research Analyst [20]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------A little bit, but -- so are you -- do you have any products in the QSFP28 market or are you just selling components into others who make QSFP28?--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Timothy Storrs Jenks, NeoPhotonics Corporation - Chairman of the Board, CEO and President [21]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------We sell components to others who make QSFP28. That's correct.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Simon Matthew Leopold, Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division - Research Analyst [22]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------And how material is that within your business?--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Clyde Raymond Wallin, NeoPhotonics Corporation - CFO and SVP [23]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------In my comments, I noted that overall this is in the range of 10% to 15% of our revenue.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Timothy Storrs Jenks, NeoPhotonics Corporation - Chairman of the Board, CEO and President [24]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Simon, 1 point. Just adjusting for the sale of our low-speed products, you had asked the question about high-speed versus network products and solutions with that adjustment, it's actually closer to 84% and 16%, okay?--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Operator [25]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------And we'll now hear from Richard Shannon with Craig-Hallum.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Richard Cutts Shannon, Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC, Research Division - Senior Research Analyst [26]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Maybe I'll follow up on one of those indices. Partly borne out by a comment, Tim, I heard in your prepared remarks and other one that I might have heard as I was a bit distracted during the early part here. But the comments that I heard, I think, I heard you say as that you're expecting demand to improve late in the second quarter, and I think you're referring to China, and I'm wondering about your earlier comments about the VMI hub, whether there is any relationship there. So I guess maybe I'll just start with that first part of that which is, can you help us understand what you mean by expecting demand improve late in the quarter?--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Timothy Storrs Jenks, NeoPhotonics Corporation - Chairman of the Board, CEO and President [27]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Well, yes, because the indicators that we see are actually production rates. And current production rates are actually now up from the first quarter. So when we're referring to China, and in particular, large customers in China, what we observe is what the inventory is and the pull rates are. So notably, through the first quarter there was an accumulation of inventory and there was a relatively low production rate. That caused the inventory to move up quite a bit. And this is primarily key technology products. And in early March, that situation precipitously changed, where customer forecasts precipitously dropped such that they were not going to pull the remainder of the quarter and that was reflected when we did our call in mid-March. What we see now is higher production rates than at that time. And we're also seeing that inventories are being bled off, they are diminishing. And so ultimately, with the other element in this, somewhat complex puzzle, is the fact that the move from national backbone networks to provincials means that big announcements about tenders diminish. So when there's a national backbone tender award, it's centrally announced and better-known. And what we're seeing is some feathering in of provincial awards, awards that are smaller in size and with less headlines. And so it becomes a bit more important to pay attention to the production rate and the use of inventory.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Richard Cutts Shannon, Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC, Research Division - Senior Research Analyst [28]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Okay. So just to be clear, is this expectation about improving the second -- late in this quarter, is that either direct comments from your customers or more calculations by you using that production rate and where the levels, the inventory and the hub sits right now?--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Timothy Storrs Jenks, NeoPhotonics Corporation - Chairman of the Board, CEO and President [29]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Actually customer comments.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Richard Cutts Shannon, Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC, Research Division - Senior Research Analyst [30]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Okay. That's helpful. Let's see, Tim, I think, you mentioned that in the first quarter, China was down 40% sequentially where the rest of the world was up 10%, did I here that -- those comments currently?--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Timothy Storrs Jenks, NeoPhotonics Corporation - Chairman of the Board, CEO and President [31]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------You did.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Richard Cutts Shannon, Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC, Research Division - Senior Research Analyst [32]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------And so what bakes into our guidance for the second quarter for both of those geographical segments?--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Timothy Storrs Jenks, NeoPhotonics Corporation - Chairman of the Board, CEO and President [33]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------We're expecting that our growth in the West is continuing, China is not, in terms of our outlook.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Richard Cutts Shannon, Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC, Research Division - Senior Research Analyst [34]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Okay. So there is some sort of negative number there, also a positive in the rest of the world then?--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Timothy Storrs Jenks, NeoPhotonics Corporation - Chairman of the Board, CEO and President [35]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Yes. That's correct.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Richard Cutts Shannon, Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC, Research Division - Senior Research Analyst [36]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Okay, Okay. Let's see, I guess, the third question, and I'll jump out of the line here, just to touch on the gross margin topic here. Sounds like the, I guess, from our perspective, lower-than-expected gross margin guidance for the second quarter, I think, you mentioned is in part due to mix with a lot of weakness coming from your highest margin leading edge products. Sounds like from your previous comments, Tim, that you expect those to pick up here with the demand late in the quarter. Any way that you want to help us think about how that inflection goes from the second quarter to the third quarter on gross margins. I know you haven't given us a revenue number, but any way to bridge that forward would be helpful please.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Timothy Storrs Jenks, NeoPhotonics Corporation - Chairman of the Board, CEO and President [37]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------First of all, since you just asked the question about the trending in the West versus the trending in China. So as we see demand increases in China, it doesn't necessarily mean that there's an increase in shipments in the second quarter in China. And so that's reflected in our outlook. There is inventory on hand. And -- while in the VMI case, there may be a limited amount of inventory. There nonetheless, can be lead time subsequently. So we're not -- in our outlook, we're not reflecting that there's an uptick in shipments in China. With respect to gross margin trends, the impact of mix on margins is notable. It's significant. And we had a strong fourth quarter. We were shipping products that had a more normalized mix and that being pretty favorable means that those products were then in ample supply in customer inventory. So what we have to see is we have to see the inventory deplete and then that could return. But as the demand increases, we get 2 benefits. We get the benefits of product mix going back to normal and then we get a benefit from better absorption, better utilization on our production. So the 2 negatives we have right now with increased demand brings into positives going forward. So we should see it go back to a more normalized gross margin.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Operator [38]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------And we will now go to Alex Henderson with Needham & Company.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Alexander B. Henderson, Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division - Senior Analyst of Networking and Security Technology [39]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Lot of noise has disappeared with the conference call as well. I just wanted to go back to the gross margins. So 2 points from depreciation, 1 from utilization, 1 from mix is what I heard you say, is that correct?--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Timothy Storrs Jenks, NeoPhotonics Corporation - Chairman of the Board, CEO and President [40]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------The mix is generally what I was addressing with the prior call. But in the -- let me just ask the question. It's a bit different for what we saw Q1 to Q2, i.e. what we've realized versus what we're expecting. So can you direct your question?--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Alexander B. Henderson, Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division - Senior Analyst of Networking and Security Technology [41]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------The question is what did you say about the gross margin pressure on -- in the fixed comments earlier. There was static on the line and I didn't hear it. Was it 2 points of depreciation, 1 utilization, and 1 mix, is that what you said?--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Clyde Raymond Wallin, NeoPhotonics Corporation - CFO and SVP [42]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Let me go through that, Alex. So we had in the fourth quarter of 2016, we had a non-GAAP gross margin of approximately 31%. And going into 1Q of '17, that's about 27%. So it's about 4 points there. So if I look at the factors that would bridge that difference, the major factor was in terms of material cost being higher in our outside vendor -- outside production vendor that we use. Number two, is the underutilization of the factory as a result of the drop off in revenue. And number three, is aforementioned mix effects that we had. So I'd say it's one half to the material cost and quarter to the utilization and a quarter to the mix.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Alexander B. Henderson, Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division - Senior Analyst of Networking and Security Technology [43]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------I see. So as we look out into the back half of the year, could you give us some sense given what you think mix is likely to do, and therefore, shifting the numbers based on, say, $80 million in numbers or $90 million or $100 million in quarterly revenues. What does it take to get back to 28% or 30% or 32% gross margins? Without being a forecast, but rather giving us some sense of when we forecast what would be the implications for margin recovery structure?--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Clyde Raymond Wallin, NeoPhotonics Corporation - CFO and SVP [44]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Yes, so what we've modeled, Alex, internally, based on understanding our factory utilization dynamics, also understanding the mix effects that we're seeing and the reversal of those mix effects as the inventory has been bled off in the channel. And as we crossover the $100 million mark, and get into the low 100s, I'd see gross margins returning to the very low 30s. So you'd be cracking at 30%-plus gross margin at that point.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Alexander B. Henderson, Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division - Senior Analyst of Networking and Security Technology [45]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------That's very helpful. And so as we're looking out, I understand that you don't want to give more than 1 quarter's forecast. But as we're looking out, do you expect meaningful growth in the back half as things normalize and China recovers and we still see good solid growth in data com as well as in outside of China end markets or would you expect a more tepid kind of environment in the back?--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Timothy Storrs Jenks, NeoPhotonics Corporation - Chairman of the Board, CEO and President [46]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------This is Tim. There are 2 parts I think to saying that. The customer forecast for the total number of port deployment suggests a strong rate of growth. And so suggests, it's more step-wise. With our VMI situation, it would reflect, I think, quite directly to us. But that said, we have limited visibility. And so our outlook for the current quarter reflects our limited visibility and it reflects the reality of what we can and cannot see. In the second half, in order for Chinese customers to actually meet their forecast, we would see a pretty significant growth in the second half. With the move to provincial tenders, the visibility is diminished versus the national tenders. And therefore, it's harder to predict and we can't say whether it's a step increase or a linear increase, we wish we knew that. But what we can say is, as volumes increase, and if they -- if their forecasts are in fact reasonably accurate, then the rate of increase could be high. I don't think anybody really has greater visibility to all of the provincial plans and I think that reflects in the industry view right now.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Alexander B. Henderson, Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division - Senior Analyst of Networking and Security Technology [47]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------All right. Totally understand. So just, as I understand sort of the mechanics around this, if these take longer and say it bleeds into the September -- later in the September quarter before some of these orders come in does that result in the overall demand sliding between '17 and '18, I mean, does that cause some of that to flush out into the first half of '18 analogous to the very late start in 2015 4Q causing undue strength in the first half of '16?--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Timothy Storrs Jenks, NeoPhotonics Corporation - Chairman of the Board, CEO and President [48]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------We would view that as, yes, to your question. A couple of points on it though. Certainly, in the case of China Mobile as an example, we have pretty clear port forecast for them for '17 over '16, but also for '18 over '17. And so things that are not deployed or installed in '17 would roll over to '18, but then be augmented by the new port deployments for '18. So -- and then when you get late in that period, then you're starting to have some views toward what 5G installations might go in subsequently. So there are a series of steps along the way. And the impact, I think, we face is just the transition to a lower-level of visibility because of the deployments now being more diversified across the country.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Alexander B. Henderson, Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division - Senior Analyst of Networking and Security Technology [49]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Going back to the inventory side of the question for a second. One of your competitors made the comment that the CFO at Huawei had made a decision based on their strong growth, but lack of profitability to bring down company-wide inventory, resulting in a more draconian inventory overhang would have happened had that not -- that perception and that need not changed with an intention to increase cash flow. Do you view that as a factor here, and if that's true, does that result in a tighter inventory level as we go into the back half and into '18, which ultimately could cause things to be -- to have a little bit more spring in them?--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Timothy Storrs Jenks, NeoPhotonics Corporation - Chairman of the Board, CEO and President [50]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------We have been given the same message by the same customer group, I'm sure. And so it does -- it is discussed as a policy change. A particular large customer has announced a number of new initiatives in some of their other businesses that are likely to be requiring cash for investments. So I think that does affect their approach to overall inventory control. It would be a onetime thing as they complete an adjustment and they deplete some of their inventory. That certainly is affecting us in the current term. But then rolling forward, we expect it to be more aligned with whatever the current demand is.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Alexander B. Henderson, Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division - Senior Analyst of Networking and Security Technology [51]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------One last question, and I'll cede the floor. Can you give us some guidance on what you're thinking on the income tax line, which obviously is hard for us to manage externally given the circumstances in the forecast, what should we be thinking about for the June quarter and for the full year on that line?--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Timothy Storrs Jenks, NeoPhotonics Corporation - Chairman of the Board, CEO and President [52]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------I think actually it's hard to give it to you in a percentage basis Alex, why don't I follow-up with an e-mail on that just to give you kind of a guidance around the dollar numbers, I would expect.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Alexander B. Henderson, Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division - Senior Analyst of Networking and Security Technology [53]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------We're talking $0.5 million to $750,000 kind of number in the second quarter, is that kind of the...--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Timothy Storrs Jenks, NeoPhotonics Corporation - Chairman of the Board, CEO and President [54]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Yes, that's correct. In the second quarter $800,000 provision probably would be pretty closer for the second quarter.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Operator [55]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------And we'll now go to Paul Silverstein with Cowen & Company.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Paul Jonas Silverstein, Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division - MD and Senior Research Analyst [56]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------If I missed the comments, I apologize, but can you revisit your non-China business, I think I heard you say it's growing at 10%, is there any granular insight you could offer us in terms of applications, customers, regions would you say?--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Timothy Storrs Jenks, NeoPhotonics Corporation - Chairman of the Board, CEO and President [57]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Sure. The business outside of China is on a -- from a product perspective or a customer perspective, they’re both reasonably diverse. These are essentially a couple of different laser products, receiver products and our switch products. And each is actually sequentially up and trending up generally. So these are areas where we have added a certain amount of capacity, and over time, we're increasing output, that is causing the sequential increase.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Paul Jonas Silverstein, Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division - MD and Senior Research Analyst [58]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------And same on your -- on the metro road and build outs outside of China, any update you can offer us?--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Timothy Storrs Jenks, NeoPhotonics Corporation - Chairman of the Board, CEO and President [59]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Well generally there is -- so for metro road and build outs, we're referring in the NeoPhotonics product line to Multicast switches. In my prepared remarks, we talked about the fact that we have -- we have been shipping into the Verizon supply chain over some time. We've qualified a new 8x16 product and then we have -- we think -- we're now working with really each of the major CDC network players for Multicast Switches. So Multicast Switch is being used with other -- with wavelength selector switches from other companies. The Multicast Switch business, we expect this year to essentially double over last year. Last year it was a bit less than $10 million, and this year we expect it to be in the $15 million to $20 million range we would expect. And so that is an area of growth overall. Depending on deployments from carriers, it can be lumpy quarter-to-quarter. But because of the fact that its project-based, but that road of deployment activity as it picks up, it will also pick up our shipments of switch products.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Paul Jonas Silverstein, Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division - MD and Senior Research Analyst [60]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------This quarter is a reminder of how hard it is to forecast for you and everybody else in the business. That said, how much visibility, how confident are you on both the non-China business in terms of the ramp as well as the situation in China. I recognize China is particularly challenging, just given its nature. But any thoughts you can share in terms of visibility right now?--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Timothy Storrs Jenks, NeoPhotonics Corporation - Chairman of the Board, CEO and President [61]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Yes, the first thing is the North American business is a steadier business because it's been -- it's in its third year now, it's continuing to ship and there's a bit more visibility and a bit steadier. The China business is brand new. Products have gone through field trial, testing, qualification, but major deployments actually have not really rolled out yet. So those are poised for growth and we see increases announced with some WSS deployments in China and then Multicast Switches will tend to follow that. So we're optimistic about that for this year. But it's small numbers yet on Multicast Switches. In terms of forecasting overall, I was following the discussion on switches. But now -- are you also asking more generally about all products?--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Paul Jonas Silverstein, Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division - MD and Senior Research Analyst [62]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Absolutely.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Timothy Storrs Jenks, NeoPhotonics Corporation - Chairman of the Board, CEO and President [63]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Okay. The visibility in China just isn't very good because of the transition to provincial networks, where you don't get the kinds of headlines to which we have been come accustomed over the last couple of years. And we do see increasing production rates. That's a good sign. But we don't have enough visibility to say how rapidly things will recover or ramp. So we're going to have to wait and see with the lack of visibility.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Operator [64]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------And our next question comes from Troy Jensen with Piper Jaffray.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Troy Donavon Jensen, Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division - MD and Senior Research Analyst [65]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------It would be my expectation that China comes back slowly SKU by SKU. So I'd just be curious, which ones do you think come back first or where is the least amount of inventory when you look across the product lines?--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Timothy Storrs Jenks, NeoPhotonics Corporation - Chairman of the Board, CEO and President [66]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Okay. Well, let's see. I think that for us, coherent components is -- are big parts of our product lines going to major Chinese network equipment manufacturers. So those things come back the fastest. With the last question, I was referring to Multicast Switches, those will come in sequentially with deployments. And then the components that are not necessarily coherent components have continued to pace. They really haven't diminished at all in the current period. So the thing that would step up most aggressively would be the coherent components.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Troy Donavon Jensen, Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division - MD and Senior Research Analyst [67]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------All right. That makes sense. And then how about, maybe just to end for me at least, just a DCO update, maybe remind us where you are with respect to the number of DSP partners you have, is it 2 or 3 now and then just any update on trials or essentially when that ramps?--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Timothy Storrs Jenks, NeoPhotonics Corporation - Chairman of the Board, CEO and President [68]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Okay. So the DCO product that we initially introduced in December is in a series of customers for qualification currently. And that product -- the ones that are first along the qualification are all primarily with a single DSP partner. But there's availability from a second DSP partner as well though they're not as far along the qualification.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Operator [69]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------And we will now go to Dave Kang with B. Riley.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Dave Ku Kang, B. Riley & Co., LLC, Research Division - Senior Analyst, Optical Components [70]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------First on cash. So you're cash ended at $91.5 million, down from what $105.6 million. Does that $91.5 million -- does it include $26 million from PON sale, and if so, does it imply that you guys used like $40 million during the quarter. Can you just go out over that, can you confirm that first of all?--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Clyde Raymond Wallin, NeoPhotonics Corporation - CFO and SVP [71]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------So actually the cash included a little bit less in PON sale. There's a number of things that are going on there, but let's just call it $22 million cash in Q1. So if you -- you had the cash there from the sale, about $22 million, and so that would have been included in the cash number that we reported.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Dave Ku Kang, B. Riley & Co., LLC, Research Division - Senior Analyst, Optical Components [72]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Okay. So it's more like $35 million, rather than $40 million then?--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Clyde Raymond Wallin, NeoPhotonics Corporation - CFO and SVP [73]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Yes. So that is a $35 million burn, yes. In that quarter, if you kind of dissect the components of what is going on in the cash, so you had the overall cash reduction of about $40 million. And so we had about $22 million of cash that we received from the sale of the low-speed transceiver business. And so then you probably burned about $36 million of cash. $18 million of that was CapEx. And the $19 million was from cash flow from operations. So it's a $5 million cash loss including that $19 million. And then on top of that, working capital changed by about $14 million, principally from buildup in inventory.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Dave Ku Kang, B. Riley & Co., LLC, Research Division - Senior Analyst, Optical Components [74]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Right. So it doesn't sound like that's going to change that much in the second quarter. I mean, is that a fair assumption or…--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Clyde Raymond Wallin, NeoPhotonics Corporation - CFO and SVP [75]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------I think it's a fair assumption. Yes, I think if I look at the same components for the second quarter, we have about a $16 million working capital change versus the $14 million working capital change. We have about $3 million cash loss versus $5 million cash loss. And we have about $16 million in CapEx. We also have a new loan that we took in -- have taken out to fund CapEx in Japan of about $5 million for the quarter. So kind of the net number there's about $30 million.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Dave Ku Kang, B. Riley & Co., LLC, Research Division - Senior Analyst, Optical Components [76]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------The reason I ask is because you still have about $40 million-ish debt to service. I'm sure you guys are aware of the situation changes, can you go over the cash situation going forward? And typically how much minimum cash balance do your major customers require like Ciena and Hauwei, I'm sure they must have some kind of minimum standard, right?--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Clyde Raymond Wallin, NeoPhotonics Corporation - CFO and SVP [77]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Well, to answer that specific question, Dave, they don't for us. They don't ask us to maintain a certain level of cash. But just get getting back to, whether we've sufficient cash in the company, so number of actions and levers that we're pulling. Number one is, we are reducing expenses, which will help our cash situation as well. Secondly, CapEx number for the third quarter will be dropping a lot from the second and first quarters as -- we said we are about 80% of the way through our CapEx programs, so that amount of money we'll spend on CapEx going forward, in the third and fourth quarters it's substantially less. And number three is, we do -- we also have lines of credit in China that a lot of people don't focus on. But there's another $34 million of borrowing capacity in China that we have available as well as a $30 million credit facility with Comerica Bank that we have available. And as we get through the fourth quarter as we talked about, we would be seeing a pickup in the second half, which would ultimately generate cash for the company.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Dave Ku Kang, B. Riley & Co., LLC, Research Division - Senior Analyst, Optical Components [78]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Got it. Just a couple more, if I could. Regarding, in the first quarter, how much of a revenue was impacted by the yield situation and has that been fully resolved, so there's no impact in the second quarter?--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Timothy Storrs Jenks, NeoPhotonics Corporation - Chairman of the Board, CEO and President [79]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------David, this is Tim. There was a little bit of bleed over in the first quarter, but that's all essentially resolved at this point.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Dave Ku Kang, B. Riley & Co., LLC, Research Division - Senior Analyst, Optical Components [80]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Okay. And what is the split between your ITLA's and receivers?--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Timothy Storrs Jenks, NeoPhotonics Corporation - Chairman of the Board, CEO and President [81]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------We just report that 84% is high speed. We don't divide the specific products.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Dave Ku Kang, B. Riley & Co., LLC, Research Division - Senior Analyst, Optical Components [82]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Can I assume receivers are still bigger than ITLA's or they are about same now?--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Timothy Storrs Jenks, NeoPhotonics Corporation - Chairman of the Board, CEO and President [83]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------We don't divide them.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Dave Ku Kang, B. Riley & Co., LLC, Research Division - Senior Analyst, Optical Components [84]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Fair enough. And lastly, I'm just confirming from your 8-K last night. Can you just explain what this financial covenant of 50% EBITDA by end of July? And what happens if you don't meet that covenant? That's it from me.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Clyde Raymond Wallin, NeoPhotonics Corporation - CFO and SVP [85]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Yes. So it's part of our -- this relates to the Comerica line of credit. So 1 of the covenants in the Comerica line of credit is that we achieve 50% of forecasted EBITDA. So we provide them the forecast and we have to meet half of it.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Dave Ku Kang, B. Riley & Co., LLC, Research Division - Senior Analyst, Optical Components [86]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------By July?--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Clyde Raymond Wallin, NeoPhotonics Corporation - CFO and SVP [87]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------There was a covenant spend in there since the beginning of the arrangement. It's been -- it's just a standard covenant in there. So it's nothing really materially new there. So -- that's part of our normal covenant compliance with the Comerica Bank.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Operator [88]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------And our next question comes from Tim Savageaux with Northland Capital Markets.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Timothy Paul Savageaux, Northland Capital Markets, Research Division - MD and Senior Research Analyst [89]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Can I ask a quick product question, but before I do that, I want to follow-up on some of Ray's working capital commentary, and really ask if he can give us more details about anticipated working capital consumption in Q2. At that point I'd imagine that inventory might come down a bit. Are you looking for what would be a fairly dramatic increase in receivables in the quarter, and what would be behind that or any other comments on the comment you just made on working capital consumption in Q2?--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Clyde Raymond Wallin, NeoPhotonics Corporation - CFO and SVP [90]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------So actually in Q2, what we would be seeing is receivables and inventories versus Q1 being effectively flat, I would think. Revenues are flat Q1 to Q2, so we see the receivables being about flat and then the inventories based on our production plans for the quarter, and how we've described how we're maintaining in the company production readiness for the second half revenue plan that we are anticipating, but we would see the inventory stand about the same, I believe, in Q2 as well.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Timothy Paul Savageaux, Northland Capital Markets, Research Division - MD and Senior Research Analyst [91]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------So we expect payables to plummet or how do we get to...--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Clyde Raymond Wallin, NeoPhotonics Corporation - CFO and SVP [92]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------We'd see -- we see about $10 million -- we see some payables plummet because in payables we have payments for CapEx. And so we've paid for a good chunk of that. So we'd see some payables plummet, also some accruing of the current liabilities, we'd see a change there as well. So, yes, we would definitely see some change in the payables and accrued liabilities, probably about $20 million.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Timothy Paul Savageaux, Northland Capital Markets, Research Division - MD and Senior Research Analyst [93]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Okay. On to the product question, I think, most of them have been asked, but Tim, you did mention, I think, putting kind of your cloud data center exposure at 10% to 15% of revenue. I wonder if you might be able to provide a little more detail in terms of what sort of products or components that go into products or kind of included in that bucket, and along with that, maybe give us an update on CFP2-ACO, what's your timing is there in terms of bringing that product to market?--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Timothy Storrs Jenks, NeoPhotonics Corporation - Chairman of the Board, CEO and President [94]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Sure. For the first part of your question, there are a range of lasers, different configurations, different types of lasers that we sell both for modules as well as CIFO based lasers, and ultimately, the -- in many cases, with drivers the semiconductor ICs that go with these. So it's principally lasers and high-speed ICs that are sold into this space as components. And then with respect to the ACO, the 6464-gig ACO, that will not be a revenue producer in '17. So we should be looking out at least a year for that one.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Operator [95]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------And that concludes our question-and-answer session for today. I'd like to turn the call back over for Tim Jenks for any closing remarks.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Timothy Storrs Jenks, NeoPhotonics Corporation - Chairman of the Board, CEO and President [96]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Okay. Matt, thank you. I'd like to thank everyone for your time and interest in NeoPhotonics and we look forward to talking to you again on our next call.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Operator [97]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------And that concludes our conference for today.
