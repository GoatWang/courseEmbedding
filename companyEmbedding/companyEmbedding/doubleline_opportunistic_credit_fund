Investing involves risk. Principal loss is possible. Investments in debt securities typically decline in value when interest rates rise. This risk is usually greater for longer-term debt securities. Investments in asset-backed and mortgage-backed securities include additional risks that investors should be aware of including credit risk, prepayment risk, possible illiquidity and default, as well as increased susceptibility to adverse economic developments. The Fund may invest in foreign securities which involve greater volatility and political, economic and currency risks and differences in accounting methods. These risks are greater for investments in emerging markets. Investments in lower rated and non-rated securities present a greater risk of loss to principal and interest than higher rated securities. Investment strategies may not achieve the desired results due to implementation lag, other timing factors, portfolio management decision-making, economic or market conditions or other unanticipated factors. The Fund is a “non-diversified” investment company and therefore may invest a greater percentage of its assets in the securities of a single issuer or a limited number of issuers than funds that are “diversified.” Accordingly, the Fund is more susceptible to risks associated with a single economic, political or regulatory occurrence than a diversified fund might be. In addition, the Fund may invest in other asset classes and investments such as, among others, REITs, credit default swaps, short sales, derivatives and smaller companies which include additional risks.
The Fund's investment objectives, risks, charges and other expenses must be considered carefully before investing. You can obtain the Fund's most recent periodic reports and certain other regulatory filings by calling 1(877)354-6311 / 1(877)DLINE11, or Clicking here. You should read these reports and other filings carefully before investing.For our Funds that are no-load mutual funds, management fees and other expenses will apply. Please refer to the prospectus for further details.

Opportunistic Credit Fund
Investment Objective
The Fund’s investment objective is to seek high total investment return by providing a high level of current income and the potential for capital appreciation. The Fund cannot assure you that it will achieve its investment objective.
Philosophy
The Fund may invest in debt securities and income-producing investments of any kind, including, without limitation, residential and commercial mortgage-backed securities, asset-backed securitites, U.S Government securities, corporate debt, international sovereign debt, and short-term investments. The Fund’s investment advisor, DoubleLine Capital LP allocated the Fund’s assets among market sectors, and among investments within those sectors, in an attempt to construct a portfolio providing a high level of current income and the potential for capital appreciation consistent with what DoubleLine considers an appropriate level of risk in light of market conditions prevailing at the time.

DBL is a non-diversified fund designed primarily as a long-term investment and not as a trading tool. The Fund should not constitute a complete investment program. Due to the uncertainty in all investments, there can be no assurance that the Fund will achieve its investment objectives. Investing in the Fund involves risks, including the risk that you may receive little or no return on your investment or that you may lose part or all of your investment. The values of securities held by the Fund may move up or down, sometimes rapidly and unpredictably. Your common shares (“Common Shares”) at any point in time may be worth less than your original investment, even after taking into account any reinvestment of dividends and distributions. Closed-end funds (CEF) do not continuously offer shares for sale as open-end mutual funds do. The shares trade on a secondary market after the initial public offering. Investors who wish to buy or sell fund shares of a CEF need to place orders through an intermediary, or broker, who will buy or sell fund shares on the stock exchange in a process identical to the purchase or sale of any other listed stock. A closed-end fund is not required to buy its shares back from investors upon request. The share price of a closed-end fund is based on the market value. Additional risks and uncertainties may also adversely affect and impair the Fund. This Web site is for information purposes only and is not intended as a solicitation to sell or buy any security.

This news release is not for tax reporting purposes. The release has been issued to announce the amount and timing of the distributions declared by the Board of Trustees. There is a possibility that distributions may include ordinary income, long-term capital gains or return of capital. The amount of distributable income and the tax characteristics of the distributions are determined at the end of the taxable year. In early 2018, the Fund will send shareholders a Form 1099-DIV specifying how the distributions paid by the Fund during the prior calendar year should be characterized for purposes of reporting the distributions on a shareholder's tax return.
About DoubleLine Opportunistic Credit Fund
The DoubleLine Opportunistic Credit Fund (DBL) (the "Fund") is a diversified, closed-end management investment company. The Fund's investment objective is to seek high total investment return by providing a high level of current income and the potential for capital appreciation. There is no guarantee that the Fund will achieve its investment objective. Investing in the Fund involves the risk of principal loss. 
About DoubleLine Capital LP
DoubleLine Capital LP, a registered investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, acts as the investment adviser for the Fund. DoubleLine's offices in Los Angeles can be reached by telephone at (213) 633-8200 or by e-mail at info@doubleline.com. Media can reach DoubleLine by e-mail at media@doubleline.com.

Shares of closed-end investment companies frequently trade at a discount to their net asset value, which may increase investors' risk of loss. This risk may be greater for investors expecting to sell their shares in a relatively short period after the completion of the public offering. There are risks associated with an investment in the Fund. 
To read about the DoubleLine Opportunistic Credit Fund (DBL), please access the Annual Report at www.doublelinefunds.com or call 888.308.3838 to receive a copy. Investors should consider the Fund's investment objective, risks, charges and expenses carefully before investing. An investment in the Fund should not constitute a complete investment program.
This document is not an offer to sell securities or the solicitation of an offer to buy securities, nor shall there be any sale or offer of these securities, in any jurisdiction where such sale or offer is not permitted.
Fund investing involves risk. Principal loss is possible.
Shares of closed-end investment companies frequently trade at a discount to their net asset value, which may increase investors' risk of loss.  This risk may be greater for investors expecting to sell their shares in a relatively short period after the completion of the public offering.  There are risks associated with investment in the fund.
Investments in debt securities typically decline in value when interest rates rise. This risk is usually greater for longer-term debt securities. Investments in asset-backed and mortgage-backed securities include additional risks that investors should be aware of including credit risk, prepayment risk, possible illiquidity and default, as well as increased susceptibility to adverse economic developments. 
Past performance is no guarantee of future results. The fund may invest in foreign securities which involve greater volatility and political, economic and currency risks and differences in accounting methods. These risks are greater for investments in emerging markets. Investments in lower rated and non-rated securities present a great risk of loss to principal and interest than higher rated securities. Investment strategies may not achieve the desired results due to implementation lag, other timing factors, portfolio management decisions-making, economic or market conditions or other unanticipated factors. In addition, the Fund may invest in other asset classes and investments such as, among others, REITs, credit default swaps, short sales, derivatives and smaller companies which include additional risks. The DoubleLine Opportunistic Credit Fund (DBL) (the "Fund") is a diversified, closed-end management investment company. 
This material may include statements that constitute "forward-looking statements" under the U.S. securities laws. Forward-looking statements include, among other things, projections, estimates, and information about possible or future results related to the Fund, market or regulatory developments. The views expressed herein are not guarantees of future performance or economic results and involve certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions that could cause actual outcomes and results to differ materially from the views expressed herein. The views expressed herein are subject to change at any time based upon economic, market, or other conditions and DoubleLine undertakes no obligation to update the views expressed herein. While we have gathered this information from sources believed to be reliable, DoubleLine cannot guarantee the accuracy of the information provided. Any discussions of specific securities should not be considered a recommendation to buy or sell those securities. The views expressed herein (including any forward-looking statement) may not be relied upon as investment advice or as an indication of the Fund's trading intent. Information included herein is not an indication of the Fund's future portfolio composition.
Past distribution history is not a projection of potential future distributions. Distributions include all distribution payments regardless of source and may include net income, capital gains, and/or return of capital. Information regarding the source of distributions other than net income may be found by calling 1 (877) 354-6311/1 (877) DLINE11.
Any tax or legal information provided is merely a summary of our understanding and interpretation of some of the current income tax regulations and is not exhaustive.
