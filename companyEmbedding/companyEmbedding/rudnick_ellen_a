Ellen Rudnick of Booth sees cybersecurity as key - Chicago Tribune

Cybersecurity will be key to managing risk and reputation








From Ellen Rudnick
Ellen Rudnick, executive director, Polsky Center for Entrepreneurship
Ellen Rudnick, executive director, Polsky Center for Entrepreneurship (From Ellen Rudnick)

John CarpenterContact ReporterBlue Sky Reporter




Increased connectivity in health care. Smoother deliveries in e-commerce. Wider interest in social-impact initiatives. Chicago-based innovators, entrepreneurs and technology leaders made those predictions and more as the big ideas of 2015. ELLEN RUDNICK, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, POLSKY CENTER FOR ENTREPRENEURSHIP, UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO BOOTH SCHOOL OF BUSINESS

Rudnick acknowledged that her big idea isn’t a new one. But she said cyber security, after building as a threat for many years, will move front and center as companies fight to protect their interests.Rudnick said she serves on a number of boards of directors, including First Midwest Bank.“This is the No. 1 issue they are facing,” she said. “The amount of money being poured into cyber security is amazing. Everybody is dealing with this issue.”It’s not just about protecting money. As the hacking of Sony corporate emails shows, it’s about protecting a company’s standing, she said.“Protecting that reputation is really important,” she said. “Companies are working very hard on this issue.”
