Product Description:

An exploration of violence and revenge told in the fractured style of MEMENTO, ANGELS CREST revolves around the plot of one man to murder his friend and co-worker. Teddy (Christopher Bauer) and Richard (Currie Graham) work in the same corporate office near Los Angeles, and routinely carpool to work. One lovely morning on the way to work, Teddy tells Richard that he wants to show him something in the Angles National Forest. Richard reluctantly agrees and the two drive into the forest, where Teddy plans to carry out his scheme. What happens next is a riveting study in the flawed criminal psyche, terror, and human nature.

Outgoing U.K. Information Commissioner Christopher Graham spoke highly of the agency in the last year as its head in his final annual report, Computer Weekly reports. “We have delivered on our objectives, responded to new challenges and prepared for big changes, particularly in the data protection and privacy field,” said Graham, who also discussed the agency's work handling data breaches and other privacy violations. “The ICO also took part in the debate on surveillance and security and the Investigatory Powers Bill. And, in its responses following the Schrems judgment, with all the implications for trans-Atlantic data flows, the ICO’s influential counsel helped to avert a meltdown,” said Graham. The departing information commissioner also bid farewell on the ICO’s YouTube page, while calling the upcoming months and years ahead an exciting time for his successor, Elizabeth Denham.Full Story
