Disruptive Technology for theCommercial Manufacturing of PureLithium Metal at Room Temperature

Green technology driven by the transition to a low carbon economy.

An Innovative Clean Tech Company





α-En™ Lithium Metal Products

Lowest Cost, Highest Purity, Cleanest Technology

Reducing raw material costs - the key to profitability for battery companies.





TOP NOTCH TEAM

Experience Leadership Success

A  Pairing of Corporate and Scientific Expertise





Clean Technology Cutting Costs and the Carbon Footprint

Our proprietary process enables the production of pure lithium metal at a significant cost savings

Lithium Metal Batteries







Lithium Metal: Power Up
The recent increase in demand for lithium is due to major advances in battery technology. Lithium is the lightest of all metals, and has the highest electrochemical potential, making it the choice raw material for batteries. Virtually all approaches that affect a substantial increase of the energy density of rechargeable batteries beyond that of lithium-ion batteries require the use of a lithium metal anode.
alpha-En’s lithium metal is purer than what is currently available on the market, free of all base metals and common non-conductive impurities found in the existing commercial supply. We produce our lithium using a room temperature process that does not require or release noxious chemicals. Our process allows for the flexible deposition and intercalation of lithium into custom substrates, which streamlines the manufacturing of batteries of all sizes.

The flexibility of our process allows for production of lithium and compounds in a variety of form factors, for use in primary and rechargeable batteries. These batteries have applications across many different markets. Our product is especially relevant in markets that depend on batteries that provide very high energy densities for long useful life in comparatively lightweight packages, such as the consumer electronic and automotive markets.

Clean Technology
Our room temperature, proprietary patent pending process was developed by alpha-En’s research team in 2013. This novel process is mercury and chlorine free, eliminating the use and release of toxic chemicals and expensive containment costs. Our process enables alpha-En to manufacture pure lithium metal at a significant cost savings  in the United States, saving US battery manufactures VAT and associated import costs. Lower processing temperatures substantially reduce production costs and carbon emissions.

Expert Leadership – Always Innovating
alpha-En‘s Chairman and Founder has a proven track record identifying new technologies and bringing them to market, including the soft contact lens, surgical staples and high silica glass to store nuclear waste.

Strategic partners include Argonne National Laboratory and Princeton University. Our top notch Scientific Team includes a Nobel Prize winning Chemist.

Company Profile
alpha-Encorp has invented a patent pending process for the production of pure lithium at room temperature. In addition to its environmental benefits this process is the only known method to produce lithium in “thin film” form, meaning film thinner than 100 micron. Lithium that is the result of alpha-En’s technology has a very unique morphology and is of unprecedented purity. That is why the alpha-En research team believes alpha-En Lithium will lend itself to the development of a proprietary Lithium- Metal anode that will help to enable the next generation batteries.

Corporate Overview
Experience Leadership Success – A Pairing of Corporate and Scientific Expertise
The alpha-En Corporation is an innovative clean technology company focused on enabling next generation battery technologies by developing and bringing to market pure, state of the art materials produced in an environmentally sustainable manner.
Led by Jerome I. Feldman since 2008, alpha-En has been primarily focused on developing sustainable technologies to produce the purest lithium metal for use in batteries and the nuclear power industry. In June of 2013, alpha-En’s R&D team developed a new patent pending process conducted at room temperature to produce pure lithium. Alpha-En has created a carbon neutral technology that is cheaper to produce and has a much greater energy density. This will allow battery manufacturers to create much more powerful batteries at a fraction of the cost without harming the environment.
In July of 2013 alpha-En began a series of tests to determine if lithium metal could be consistently extracted from lithium carbonate utilizing our patent pending process. The results were successful. In April of 2015 the technology was validated by a prestigious university confirming alpha’s results.
Strategic Partners & Development:
Argonne National Laboratory has entered into a collaborative  agreement with alpha-En to assist in the scale and optimization of our process.  Argonne’s vast resources and world class team of experienced  Process Engineers, Chemists and Materials Scientists have a proven track record of advancing technologies.
alpha-En is sponsoring R&D at Princeton University under the supervision of Daniel Steingart, Ph.D. Assistant Professor of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering and the Andlinger Center for Energy and the Environment at Princeton, the team will study the deposition and transport mechanisms enabled by the alpha-En process, allowing us to broaden the application of the company’s core technology.
Since January 2015, the Company has been sponsoring research at the City University of New York’s  (CUNY) newly constructed scientific laboratories, the Advanced Science Research Center, under the direction of Professor Stephen O’Brien. Professor O’Brien leads a team of researchers investigating the most efficient ways to deposit and intercalate lithium onto custom substrates.  The CUNY team and other technologies to produce our pure lithium metal in a variety of form factors to meet market demands. Clean Lithium, a subsidiary of alpha-En was formed in September of 2014 for the purpose of commercializing our novel pure lithium products.
Always innovating, alpha-En is developing a range of products derived from our core technology.
Mr. Feldman believes using clean technology throughout the battery supply chain is the key to an exponential reduction in carbon emissions. As batteries become the economic impetus in the transition to a low carbon economy, clean processing technologies are imperative.

TARRYTOWN, N.Y., May 17, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- alpha-En Corporation (OTC: ALPE), an innovative clean technology company focused on enabling next-generation battery technologies by producing high purity lithium metal and associated products, announced today the completion of a private placement of approximately $1.8 million in convertible preferred shares and warrants to purchase common shares.  








"We are grateful to the far-sighted investors who have joined this round, allowing us to raise more capital in this placement than we had originally targeted," said alpha-En Founder and Executive Chairman Jerome Feldman. "Bringing a revolutionary new technology to market for an industry as big as today's energy storage industry means a fairly constant or even escalating expense level, even before the product is generally available.  In this case, we believe the new power of lithium metal batteries will be very convincing to the international energy storage companies, and we are pleased to be enlarging our list of informed and enthusiastic investors."
Terms of the private placement can be found on a Form 8-K to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on May 17, 2017.
