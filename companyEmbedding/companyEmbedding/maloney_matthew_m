Matthew M. Maloney - Chief Executive Officer
Thank you for joining our Q1 earnings call. I will begin with some highlights from the quarter and then give an update on our progress towards our top 2016 strategic priorities. After that, I will turn the call over to Adam who will give us some more detailed look at the numbers and forward guidance.
We continued our strong growth trajectory across the country in Q1, generating record revenues and profits, while aggressively expanding our delivery footprint. We generated $112 million of net revenue for the seasonally strong first quarter, up 27% from the first quarter of 2015. Adjusted EBITDA was $32 million for the first quarter, including our continued investment in delivery. We ended the quarter with nearly 7 million active diners and generated food sales of $713 million for our local restaurant partners, 24% and 21% increases from the prior year, respectively. This was despite exceptionally warm weather for all three months of the first quarter and a very difficult weather comp from the prior year. In Q1, we averaged over 267,000 orders per day and our diners ordered over 24 million times, that's 3.2 million more orders than the first quarter of last year.

On our last call, we reviewed the milestones we achieved in 2015 and how excited we were about our momentum as we entered this year. We highlighted the progress we'd made across many key growth drivers for our business, including delivery, chain partnerships, a renewed focus on product iteration and the roll out of the updated Grubhub brand.
In short, we've made great strides across all of these initiatives even though 2016 is barely four months old. We also began to see a positive impact to growth from these initiatives as we exited March, and we've seen order growth accelerate in April from Q1 levels. These dynamics give us increased confidence in the reacceleration of order growth we implied in our guidance last quarter and updated today.
Q1 was another strong quarter for Grubhub delivery. Excluding LAbite, we are now delivering more than $250 million annual gross food sales on a run rate basis, a significant step up from Q4. This is impressive growth, but even more so in the context of our improved efficiency and decreased investment level as compared to the prior quarter. We are seeing material economies of scale with our logistics network including decreasing incremental cost per delivery and reduced delivery times. We still see diners who placed their first order through restaurants we deliver for, exhibiting improved retention and increased ordering frequency versus those who don't.
We are hitting our target service levels in major metros, including keeping delivery times near 30 minutes in many cities. Even with our significant increase in scale, investment in delivery was down to just $4 million for the quarter. We are currently operating delivery on a cash neutral basis in some high demand residential neighborhoods. Meaning that from a cash generation perspective, we earn different between orders that we deliver versus orders restaurants deliver for themselves. However, Grubhub delivery provides a significantly better experience for our diners through its more consistent and better service, as well as a much broader selection of restaurants. We're very pleased with this growth and we'll continue to step on the accelerator, including acquisitions of key delivery players like the one announced this morning. These will help augment our scale and service abilities.
Our new partner, LAbite, is one of the largest independent restaurant delivery services in the country with a strong presence in the greater Los Angeles area. They have significant scale with diners, restaurants, gross food sales and drivers. We believe that with the addition of LAbite to our portfolio, we are the leading online food service provider in the Los Angeles area by a very significant margin. We hope to leverage their knowledge and experience to further expand our lead in this huge market and Adam will follow up with more details in the company later.
Our delivery initiative goes hand-in-hand with another strategic priority, expanding our team partnerships. Following up on our success last quarter, we added several new high profile partners in the first quarter, including Johnny Rockets, Boston Market, Uno Pizzeria & Grill and On The Border. This adds to our already strong lineup of national and regional chain partners and we're just getting started.
These partners are excited about the incremental growth we drive with our network of nearly 7 million diners, our key technology focusing only on connecting restaurants and diners and our driver logistics expertise. While delivery and our chain initiative are improving the quality and selection for our restaurant network, we're driving diner engagement with a renewed focus on product innovation and the Grubhub brand update. As discussed, we spent much of the last two years, building and transitioning both brands, Grubhub and Seamless on to a single, nimble, scalable technology platform. With the technical debt largely behind us, we've been able to focus on increasing conversion and driving frequency by improving the diner facing platforms.

Let me highlight one of the more meaningful successes we've already had. With our improved technology, we are better able to address friction points from search, all the way through check-out. Improved add to bag functionalities, streamlined diner on-boarding and payment processes, as well as cutting page load times have all resulted in measurable conversion increases as we've rolled these improvements out to our diner network in late Q1 and early Q2.
This means that our apps and site are easier to use, diners are more likely to complete a purchase once they land on any of our properties. This increases our ability to drive high quality traffic through marketing and converted to new diners, which over the long-term should drive growth and generate more profit.
Our product innovation roadmap is very strong and we will continue to focus on improving the conversion of new and returned diners, personalization and the ease of use to drive more orders. One of our primary goals going forward is to ensure that we surface the local favorite dishes and restaurants that our diners love in more engaging ways. We made some great improvements so far and I'm excited about what we have in the pipeline as this year moves on.
On our last call, we mentioned the new Grubhub brand that started rolling out. Our new creative gives Grubhub a bold new look, designed to highlight the connection between restaurants and diners, focusing on the amazing food that diners enjoy every day from their local favorite restaurants. From eye-catching out-of-home ads to updates through our web, apps and Apple TV platforms, the rebrand is now in full force. The initial results are positive. We've seen a great response from diners on social media and a boost in brand awareness and ad recall. We also feel that the new position allows us to more easily recruit key premium restaurants onto our platform and broaden our appeal to diners in every neighborhood, truly becoming the platform of choice for ordering food across the country.
Thanks to the elevated brand and a fresh emphasis on moving eating forward, we're thinking more broadly about how we can engage with diners. One example from this quarter is our recently created emoji keyboard called mmmoji, another is our decision to stop distributing plastic take-out bags in order to help generate awareness around Earth Day and environmental consequences.
We are also pursuing partnerships in line with our ongoing efforts to be relevant to diners in all the moments that matter, whether at home or on-the-go. We recently launched a pilot program with three Hyatt-centric hotels to deliver food from top local hotspots to the Hyatt-centric brands' new restaurants on-the-go program, satisfying guests who prefer to stay in rather than go out while traveling. Additionally, through a partnership with HBO, Grubhub curated a selection of restaurant choices so that diners could pair tastes and flavors with five HBO viewing favorites. We continue to execute very aggressively in our space, as the opportunity is still tremendous, and no one comes close to us at connecting diners with their local favorite restaurants.
We're very excited about what the rest of 2016 holds, and I look forward to updating you on more of our progress next quarter.
With that, I will hand it over to Adam, who'll walk you through the financials.
Adam J. DeWitt - Chief Financial Officer
Thanks, Matt. I'll start with our first quarter performance, provide some forward-looking color, and then we'll open the call up to questions. First quarter, seasonally one of our strongest, was a record quarter for us. We achieved records across all of our key metrics, revenue and profitability, despite significant headwinds from the extremely mild winter on the East Coast and Chicago. We ended the first quarter with active diners reaching 7 million, a 24% year-over-year increase. We processed 267,800 Daily Average Grubs and $713 million in gross food sales during the first quarter, 14% and 21% year-over-year increases, respectively.

The acquisitions we completed in the first quarter and fourth quarters of last year contributed roughly 0.5 percentage point to year-over-year order growth and 2 percentage points to year-over-year growth in gross food sales. First quarter revenues were $112 million, 27% higher than the year-ago quarter of $88 million. If we exclude the acquisitions, revenue growth would have been approximately 23%. We achieved these records and hit the high end of our guidance for the first quarter, even with the negative impact from weather.
While our guidance for the first quarter reflected the weather through January, it ended up being a significant headwind for the remainder of the quarter. To help quantify the impact, we believe weather was approximately a 200-basis-point headwind to year-over-year order growth for the quarter, and a little more than $2 million in revenue. Net revenue as a percentage of gross food sales was 15.7% during the first quarter. This compares to 15% during the first quarter of last year. The higher revenue capture rate is driven by the growth in our delivery efforts, including the restaurant delivery service acquisitions that we have made to date. Capture rates excluding the delivery portion of our business were consistent with the fourth quarter.
As I noted, year-over-year gross food sales growth outpaced order growth 21% to14%. This variance is driven in small part by an extra day in February, and mostly by a 5% increase in average order size, from $27.93 to $29.25. Approximately two-thirds of the increase in average order size is organic growth that we've seen year after year. The remainder is driven by the acquisitions of DiningIn and Restaurants on the Run that closed mid-quarter last year and Delivered Dish, which closed late in the fourth quarter.
On the expense side, total sales and marketing expenses were $28.8 million this quarter, a 20% increase compared to the same quarter last year, and a sequential increase of 16% as compared to fourth quarter. As a reminder, last quarter we said that for 2016, we would be focusing more on quality diners and increasing our advertising, but at a lower rate than we have in the past. Our first quarter spend level is consistent with this goal.
We've also been communicating that, as a result of our marketing strategy to target more quality diners, we expect overall diner growth to more closely match order growth, and diner frequency to decline less. We saw both of these dynamics in the first quarter, as active diners grew 24% on a year-over-year basis, and 30-day orders per ending active diner declined 8% compared to first quarter of 2015, a slowest decline since we've been public. We expect diner frequency to continue to stabilize throughout this year.
As an aside here, I wanted to note that the best way to look at the growth in active diners is on a year-over-year basis. There is a fair amount of noise in this metric quarter-to-quarter, as we have seen over time. So there can be some volatility when constructing a net diner adds metric on a sequential basis. For example, in the first quarter, to support our rebranded Grubhub, we spent more of our advertising dollars at the end of the quarter, including a fair amount of brand-related non-direct response advertising that takes more time to have an impact.
In addition, during the first quarter, the weather that impacted our order volume also impacted our new diner growth. As a result, this year, we will most likely add more net diners in the second quarter than we did in the first, while last year, as is more typical, it was the opposite. Regardless of the timing, our growth in diners was right in line with our internal expectations, and we are confident it will support the accelerated growth we have implied in our guidance for the remainder of 2016.

Operations and support expenses in Q1 were $35 million, a 54% increase compared to $22.7 million in the first quarter of last year, and sequential increase of 8% as compared to the fourth quarter. This increase is from our aggressive scaling of Grubhub delivery, the inclusion of delivery costs from the three acquisitions we concluded last year, and the organic growth in overall orders.
In the first quarter, our delivery investment or the amount we spent to pay for delivery in excess of the incremental revenue we received for delivery orders declined to approximately $4 million compared to the more than $5 million in the fourth quarter. This decline came despite a significant increase in volume to a run rate of approximately $250 million in gross food sales annually, demonstrating operating leverage we are achieving as we scale. We expect a similar level investment in Q2 as we continue to roll out new markets and grow in existing markets, while continuing to expect the investment for the full year to be between $10 million and $20 million.
Technology expenses excluding amortization of web development were $10.2 million for the quarter, increasing 33% from the first quarter of 2015 and 16% from the fourth quarter. This increase is consistent with the investment we've been making in our technology and product teams, which has helped to drive the improvements Matt talked about earlier. Depreciation and amortization was $7.3 million for the quarter, a sequential increase of 10% from the fourth quarter. This was driven by a number of items including a full quarter of amortization of Delivered Dish intangibles, software development capitalization and the accelerated planned retirement of some acquired software.
G&A costs were $13.6 million, a sequential increase of 19% from the $11.5 million in the fourth quarter. This increase is coming primarily from $1.7 million in accelerated stock comp, associated with some terminations in our acquired businesses and deal costs associated with the LAbite acquisition. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $32.4 million, an increase of 15% from $28.3 million in the same quarter the prior year. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 29% this quarter, an improvement of 200 basis points from the fourth quarter, partially driven by the improved efficiency on the delivery side even with our aggressive delivery growth.
Net income was $9.9 million compared to the prior year of $10.6 million. Net income per fully diluted common share was $0.12 on approximately 86 million weighted average fully diluted shares. Our tax rate for the first quarter was a little less than 43% and we expect approximately this rate for the rest of the year. Non-GAAP net income was $17.2 million or $0.20 per fully diluted common share compared to the prior year of $14.9 million or $0.18 per fully diluted common share. Non-GAAP net income excludes amortization of acquired intangibles, acquisition and restructuring costs and stock based compensation expense, as well as the income tax effects of these non-GAAP adjustments.
As Matt noted, this morning we announced our acquisition of LAbite, a growing and profitable restaurant delivery service focused primarily in Los Angeles, with a smaller presence in Austin and the Bay area that generated $80 million in gross food sales last year. The deal will be approximately $65 million all cash and we expect it to close shortly. We will update guidance more formally when we close, but we expect LAbite to generate roughly $2 million in monthly revenue and a little less than $500,000 of monthly EBITDA for the remainder of the year.
Even with the acquisition of LAbite, our cash flow and strong balance sheet give us a lot of flexibility. To give us even more flexibility in pursuing acquisition opportunities, we are announcing a closing of a new credit facility, which took place last week. This facility gives us a $185 million of immediate capacity and potentially another $30 million if we needed. In addition, we repurchased approximately 0.50 million shares under our recently authorized buyback in the first quarter. We will continue to exercise our buyback opportunistically based on a combination of factors including the value of our stock and other potential opportunities to use our cash.

Finally, I want to share some thoughts on second quarter and full year guidance. We currently expect between $109 million and $111 million of revenue for the second quarter and adjusted EBITDA between $29 million and $31 million. As you may recall, we typically see a sequential decline from the first quarter to the second quarter. Last year, for example, we saw an approximately 6% decline in organic DAG's between those two quarters. However, given the positive impact of the initiatives Matt discussed earlier, the robust new diner trends we've seen in March and April and a strong order growth thus far in Q2, we are expecting only a small sequential decline in organic DAG's for the coming quarter. In addition, as implied by our guidance, we expect to see year-over-year DAG growth higher in the second quarter than the first quarter, even after normalizing for the first quarter weather impact.
We typically don't give inter-quarter updates on performance, but we thought it would be helpful to highlight the strength we saw in April to help explain the growth acceleration in the guidance. For the full year, we are bringing up the low end of the range for revenue by $5 million, and now expect revenue to be between $450 million to $465 million. We continue to expect adjusted EBITDA to be between $122 million and $130 million. Implied in this guidance is our expectation that we'll able to maintain a higher level of DAG growth for the remainder of the year. We do expect to see normal seasonality in both revenue and EBITDA in the back half of the year, with both metrics bottoming in Q3 before increasing in Q4. But overall, we expect DAG growth for 2016 to be higher than it was in the first quarter.
With that, Matt and I will take your questions. Operator, please open the lines for questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Your first question comes from Aaron Kessler with Raymond James. Your line is open.
Aaron M. Kessler - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Yes, great. Thanks guys. First question is, if you can provide us maybe a cohort update, kind of largest cities kind of versus tier-two cities like you usually give? And second Matt, for some of the initiatives you talked about that are driving some of the improved performance within the app and the site. Can you rank those, maybe just what's having the biggest impact on those growth rates? Thank you.
Adam J. DeWitt - Chief Financial Officer
Yeah. So, Aaron, I'll take the cohort question I think. And Matt will talk about the initiatives. So the cohorts look very stable across both the tier-ones and the tier-twos. Obviously, we had the weather impact that we talked about in the first quarter in general that dragged on order frequency. But when we saw – we've been talking about the improvement that we saw at the end of the quarter and specifically in April. And we saw the improvements across all the cohorts from old and new as well as tier-one and tier-two markets. So, it is pretty much the same story that we've had in all the quarters, which is very stable cohorts and order frequency.
Matthew M. Maloney - Chief Executive Officer
And Aaron, there is not a clear-cut answer to what you're asking what's the prioritized impact of multiple product improvements over a quarter. I can talk a little bit more about where the teams are focusing. We're really looking into – like the transaction funnel, we've invested a lot in optimization in AB testing and making sure that we're evaluating multiple changes at the same time across web platforms, mobile web, native app, wherever people are placing orders. And so, we're really looking at what can drive the highest conversion rate once somebody lands on the properties. We're also looking a lot at content and how can we augment and increase the content available, how can we collect it from our restaurants and display it intelligently in a way that drives order.

We spent a lot of time on recommendations, increasing relevancy in investing and reviews, if you're placing orders, you will notice that very frequently we send SMS reviews and we have a high return of those and those are feeding directly into our recommendation system. And so, I think it's something like we get a new – every restaurant on the platform gets a new review about every 24 hours or so. So, we have a very high velocity of engagement with our diners and that's all channeling into being able to better tell you what the best dishes, what the best restaurants are in every neighborhood that we cover all the way across the country.
And then finally like I mentioned in the notes, we spend a lot of time on page load. How can we reduce page load time to make sure that it's a very snappy experience and that we are right there with the menus when you're hungry.
Aaron M. Kessler - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Great. Thank you.
Operator
Your next question comes from Heath Terry with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Heath Terry - Goldman Sachs & Co.
Great. Just curious if you can give us a sense, given customer growth, what you're seeing in the trends and customer acquisition costs, particularly as we at least see the perception of some of the venture backed competitors in the space, maybe getting a little less aggressive, whether or not you're seeing that show up in the efficiency of your marketing or your activity from a customer basis?
Adam J. DeWitt - Chief Financial Officer
Yeah. How are you doing Heath? So, what I say is in the past, we've talked about the customer acquisition costs on the margin being pretty stable. And I think, when you dive really deep into it and you look at the different channels, we're seeing it very similar. So, we're not seeing big fluctuations in anything like the rates that we're buying, SEM words or display ads. For us particularly, if you try to imply a cost per acquisition, you see a little bit of a higher one in the first quarter.
But I think, as I talked about in my prepared remarks, it's more optics. We did spend a lot on branding which doesn't have an immediate payoff and there were a lot of weather headwinds. But we're not seeing any dramatic fluctuations in markets from competition, and in fact we've talked already a little bit about the strength in April, and it was just as much on the new diner side as it was on the order side.
Heath Terry - Goldman Sachs & Co.
Great. Thanks.
Operator
Your next question comes from Mark May with Citi. Your line is open.
Mark A. May - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)
Hey, thanks for taking my questions. I wonder if you could comment on what impact that you've seen both at the time of initial launch and then as they've been in the market for a while from the launch of say Amazon Prime Now restaurant delivery and/or UberEATS in some of the markets that they've launched and that you operate in, where you overlap.
And then secondly, you provided some color on why the diner growth decelerated in Q1 and comment about how April is going. But relative to your marketing spend, marketing spend came down, but relative to the diner growth, obviously, it was still relatively high. Just trying to understand what drove, again, the diner growth deceleration and why there is a little bit of a disconnect there, because you back into a pretty high cost of new diner acquisition in Q1 because of that?
And then lastly just a housekeeping question for LAbites I'm backing into roughly a 30% take rate. Is that roughly correct and maybe if you can help us think about how incorporating LAbites into the model may impact take rate? Thanks.
Matthew M. Maloney - Chief Executive Officer
Sure, Mark. I'll answer the first one and Adam will take the rest of them. So Uber and Amazon are the new boogiemen in the market. I think last year there was more concern around venture-backed startups that ended up not being quite as competitive as people were worried they would be, and now we're looking at these companies. And they're great companies, but I want to take a step back and really understand the marketplace dynamics. We focus on bringing the best selection in every market. And that's not just restaurants we deliver for, but that's also restaurants that do their own delivery, and it's also pickup. We try to address the market needs, the demands of diners, the best way we possibly can, and we're significantly further along than anyone else in that space. We also believe that having the lowest fees is critical, that diners actually care about transactional cost, and that they will always migrate to the lowest cost opportunity if given that choice.

And then finally, we believe in exceptional support. So making sure that we're there at the transaction if anything happens for the diner or for the restaurant, wherever we need to be, we want to be there to be supporting our transactions. And if you execute on those three strategies, you will win. There really is no logistical advantage as people are concerned about. And if you think about it logically, the majority of the wait time for delivery is food preparation, which no third-party can impact. And then this second largest bucket is physically delivering the food from point A to point B, and unless someone invents flying bicycles, I don't think that is going to be dramatically reduced in the near future.
And so really, when you're thinking about logistical advantage, as long as you're using contemporary software, GPS alerts, geofencing, auto dispatch, aggressive algorithms, you're pretty much either – the most you can impact is about five minutes and that's food after being prepared, before it's picked up by your driver, and I can tell you that a lot of this investment that we keep talking about quarter-after-quarter is making sure that Grubhub food does not sit on the counter waiting for a Grubhub driver. We want to make sure the driver is there before the food is ready.
And so, if you add it all up, there is no logical way for anyone to say, I have 2x your drivers on the road, so I'm going to have food there faster. And so, if you think about it, it's all about executing, giving the diners what they want, when they want it, making sure you can send incredible demand for restaurants, and that's what's going to win.
Now to your specific question, we talk to restaurants every day. We have a lot of friends in a lot of markets, and the community is saying that there just aren't that many orders flowing through these competitive systems that everyone is concerned about. We clearly don't see it impacting our value or our growth rate. And so, we're going to continue executing as best we can and not pay attention to the noise, because in spite of all of it, and in spite of all the new competition, we're seeing some of the strongest trends in our order growth that we've seen in the past year.
Adam J. DeWitt - Chief Financial Officer
Mark, this is Adam. I'll talk a little bit about the CPI. I tried to give a little color during the last question, so I think there's a number of things at play. One, you have to remember that our diner number is not a gross diner number. It's an active diner, which we think is the best metric, best reflection of what's driving orders in the business at that time. So it's not a gross add number.
I think, two, there's a lot of volatility in the number quarter-to-quarter, depending on what's happening. This quarter, there was volatility around the rebrand spend, which we biased towards the end of the quarter and also, was a lot of what I call non-direct response, and so more branding, more out of home, more billboards, more train stations, less on SEM and promotions and, as a result, it's got a little bit of a lagged impact. I think the biggest factor, though, in this quarter, is really the weather. In addition to orders, weather has just as significant, if not more significant, impact on new diner growth, and the headwind that we saw on the order side certainly played into the change in the active diner number. I do want to point out that we do expect a bigger sequential increase in the second quarter than we saw in the first quarter, even though it's typically a slower quarter.
And then to your third question on LAbites, I think you are close. I think you should take that gross food sales number, and you have the revenue number. When we close, we will publish, we will update our guidance, but in terms of the take rate, I think you are close. The LAbite model is very similar to the DiningIn and Restaurants on the Run models as well. So it's obviously a significantly higher take rate, but the volume's fairly small relative to Grubhub overall.

Your next question comes from Ron Josey with JMP Securities. Your line is open.
Ron Victor Josey - JMP Securities LLC
Great. Thanks for taking the question. With delivery now in 50 markets, just wondering how has the algorithm evolved in terms of matching driver supply and consumer demand, call it the last 18 months? I think, Matt, you just talked about shaving five minutes off delivery time. Have you achieved that? And then also, I think you said decreasing incremental cost per delivery, reduced delivery time, and also cash-neutral delivery in number of markets. Can you just talk about how well staffed you are from a driver perspective? I think that's where a lot of the investments are heading this year. And then also, how you're generating consumer demand for delivery? Thank you.
Matthew M. Maloney - Chief Executive Officer
Sure, Ron. So the algorithm's evolved, definitely over the past year. We've hired a bunch of outstanding data scientists that do a lot of work, both live and in lab simulations. And, like I said, the majority of the delivery itself is taken up by actual work product and preparing food and moving food, but there is a lot you can do around deadhead legs and making sure that the drivers are as fully utilized as possible when they're driving from one place to another, and that's really where you see the value of algorithmic innovation, is in the cost savings part. And so we've definitely seen a decreasing incremental cost of delivery as we increase network utilization. We see it every month. We pay a lot of attention to it.
With decreasing delivery times, I think what you're seeing is a reduction of volatility around pickup. As you're starting out with not a lot of volume in your network, I think there are times when the food sits around or perhaps the communication with the restaurant isn't as tight as it needs to be. I think over the past 1.5 year, especially now that we're at closer to $250 million in gross food sales on a run rate basis, there's not a lot of room for lose communications, and so we've tightened everything up. We're very much hardened and we have thousands of drivers in the market at any given time, and that's increasing very aggressively. As you point out, a lot of the investment is to build up the infrastructure around recruiting, training, management and making sure that we have the platform that drivers want to drive on.
Ron Victor Josey - JMP Securities LLC
And on the demand side for consumers just normal change of events in terms of your brand marketing and things like that just to make sure consumers know you have delivery?
Matthew M. Maloney - Chief Executive Officer
Yes. Right now what we're focusing on is having ubiquitous selection. So if you want outstanding premium, high-quality, best-of-breed food it's there; if you want pizzas and wings, it's there; if you want chain foods, we got it; if you want the independents, we got it. And so the new brand reposition is really about highlighting the restaurants, highlighting the incredible food that's available to you and really motivating hunger so that we can then fulfill it. And so we don't highlight right now which restaurants are Grubhub delivery versus which aren't, and we're still working through how we're going to highlight either just the best restaurants or just the restaurants we deliver for or some clear expectations around delivery time. But right now, they're just in the mix on the Grubhub platform and they participate in a significant demand that we generate natively.

Your next question comes from Dean Prissman with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
Dean J. Prissman - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC

Thanks for taking my question. You guys have added a meaningful amount of new restaurant supply for your in-house delivery business. Can you discuss the level of productivity you are seeing with the supply versus your delivery (36:16) restaurant supply? Thanks.
Matthew M. Maloney - Chief Executive Officer
Yes. So, hey, Dean, how are you? So as we had talked about before, I think, one of the advantages – or the key advantage for us doing delivery is that we can add restaurants that we couldn't add to the platform before. And so as we're going to markets and adding delivery and selling restaurants, we're able to pick the best, highest-quality restaurants, the most popular restaurants that we are able to identify and prioritize based on what people are searching for on Grubhub and Seamless, what they are searching for on all menus and menu pages, et cetera. And so we are adding what we view is really high-quality restaurants.
And so as a result of just the restaurants being high-quality and also us being able to deliver a consistent service level on the delivery side, we're seeing the, what I'll call, diner retention and diner frequency metrics for the restaurants that we're adding on the delivery side to be pretty much universally better than the average restaurant at Grubhub. And so we continue to see that over the time and we think that that will have an impact overall as that base of restaurants continues to grow.

Your next question comes from James Cakmak with Monness, Crespi, Hardt. Your line is open.
James Cakmak - Monness, Crespi, Hardt & Co., Inc.
Hi, thanks. With the focus on higher value diners, we are seeing the declines in the frequency of ordering improve. As we progress through the year, do you think that it could potentially reach a positive territory at least by year-end? And then looking at your credit facility, $185 million and the acquisitions that you're making, can you talk about how you think about the acquisitions that you make, at least in terms of valuation and what it adds? And can we just assume the balance that you have is going to be continued dry powder for delivery-related acquisitions? Thanks.
Matthew M. Maloney - Chief Executive Officer
So in terms of the frequency decline, I think what I said in the prepared remarks was that we continue to see improvement in that metric throughout the year. Whether or not it gets to zero, I'm probably not prepared to say, but we do expect to see continued improvement in that metric and it's just part of our general strategy of focusing on the high value-add diners. It's obviously still going to be offset by the mix shift away from corporate and New York, which we've had for a couple of years now and that'll continue, but I would think it's going to be offset by the addition of and the focus on the higher quality diners.
In terms of the credit facility and the acquisitions, when we think about acquisitions, we think about a lot of things, but primarily we're looking for things that add to our diner network, our restaurant network, and our driver network. And we think about valuing the acquisition in a lot of different ways. It depends on the company that we're looking at. We also look at on a smaller basis potentially some technology add-ons that could either put us in a position to better service our restaurants or better service our diners. But when you think about, your question specifically was around valuation, I think, we're thinking about what's it going to add or what's it going to bring to Grubhub shareholders over the next several years, right. And so how are we going to turn the asset into something that's generating cash or more cash than it was generating by itself. And then quantifying how much value it's going to bring to the platform.

Your next question comes from Michael Graham with Canaccord. Your line is open.
Michael Graham - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.
Hey, guys. Thank you. Just a couple. First, thanks for quantifying the weather impact on revenue. Is it possible to quantify the impact on diners is the first one? And then, on the acquisition, can you just talk a little bit about two things. One is the pipeline of future deals. Do you have a lot of them planned in terms of delivery? I'm just wondering, you mentioned that the diner for LAbites and the restaurants for LAbites were also important assets in addition to the delivery functionality. Can you talk about how, if at all, you're planning to integrate those parties on to the Grubhub platform? Are you going to run it as a separate local business in LA and just maybe how you're thinking about that? Thank you.
Adam J. DeWitt - Chief Financial Officer
Hey, Mike. I'll take the weather question and Matt will give you a little bit more color on the deals and how we think about them. But in terms of the diner and the weather, it's really a tough number to back into. What I'd say is it was material, it's certainly in the tens of thousands. Was it several hundred thousand? Probably not. But it was a material number of new diners, just based on the weather. What we do see is when we look at our orders on a daily basis and we look at the new diners, we see even more dramatic fluctuations in the new diner comps year-over-year than we do in the orders year-over-year. So, hopefully, that helps give you a little bit of context.
Matthew M. Maloney - Chief Executive Officer
And then, Mike, in terms of LAbite and deals more broadly, we don't have a pipeline of deals that we're looking at. I think we're very open and opportunistic for what's out there. However, through our DiningIn and Restaurants on the Run, Delivered Dish and now LAbite, I think, we've pretty much picked off the largest restaurant delivery networks in the country. And there is a few more out there, but these are really the big ones. And it really goes to our almost cookie cutter strategy of building delivery. These are significant and valuable assets that are being underutilized and with their current logistical infrastructure and the ability to drop them on our platform, we'll be able to pull higher returns out of the same assets and that's the way we look at it.
So DiningIn is nearly fully integrated on the platform, Delivered Dish which until now was our most recent one. All of those restaurants are now available on Grubhub. So all of our advertising that we're pushing in Delivered Dish markets, you're able to order through Grubhub from the ads and then actually it's executed through those contracts. And so LAbite is going to be the same thing. We're going to work as hard as we can to get those restaurants live on our platform and then we're going to migrate the driver second, and then finally, we're going to see if we fully migrate the brands in from a DiningIn perspective or not. It's still kind of TBD.

Your next question comes from Neil Doshi with Mizuho. Your line is open.
Neil A. Doshi - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.
Great. Thanks for the questions. Matt, looks like LAbite, the model is a little bit different. There's like $5 or $6 delivery fee, convenience fee. So any plan to migrate the pricing model for some of these acquisitions to the Grubhub model? Or do you plan on just leaving that as is? And then, also if you could maybe talk a little bit about the Hyatt partnership. I think that was pretty interesting. It seems like in-room dining for hotels is a pretty high margin business. So how has that been trending. I know it's only been a few weeks, but what are you seeing from that relationship and how do you think that can progress over time? Thanks.

Matthew M. Maloney - Chief Executive Officer
Sure, Neil. In terms of the convenience fee, we've done a lot of work around the elasticity of diner demand and what they're looking for. And we believe that we are optimizing for throughput and conversion. And so absolutely any property that we're acquiring, we are going to update that with, I'd say, the most advanced pricing intelligence behind it. The $5 transactional fee, no matter what platform you're on, absolutely hinders conversion, it absolutely slows down growth. And so we're going to do everything we can to maximize growth in orders to restaurants. So that definitely means that we will be rethinking the convenience fee that they have out there right now.
In terms of the Hyatt partnership, in-room dining in general, and I'm not an expert in a hotel space, but from everyone I've talked to, is a big money loser and they don't – it's a real headache and they don't really want to do it. So, Hyatt came to us and said essentially we'd like to replace our room service functionality and the kitchen space in at least some new hotels with your product.
And so we worked hard with them to be able to highlight the best restaurants around these new Hyatt centric concepts, and then we worked with them on a page and they're doing a bunch of in-hotel promotions to tell the guests at their properties that Grubhub knows where the best restaurants are and if you're hungry and you don't want to go out and experience the neighborhoods, then absolutely use Grubhub and order in, and so we're continuing to work on our integrations and potentially even payment capabilities.
But I think that this represents a huge opportunity not just with Hyatt, but with other hotel chains that are looking to roll off of their kitchen commissary services.

Ralph E. Schackart - William Blair & Co. LLC
Hey, good morning. Adam, just curious to give maybe a little more color context just in terms of what caused the April DAG reacceleration, either maybe you could rank it or sort of give some attribution from the marketing initiatives that kicked in at the end of the quarter, is weather a big factor on the compares, higher quality at diners, any more color would be great?
Adam J. DeWitt - Chief Financial Officer
Yeah. I mean so the color I'll give you there is look, certainly weather was a little bit of a headwind in April. We saw – first of all, the comp was easier from last year, and it's been a fairly wet and cool start to the spring in our biggest markets, but what I'd say is, when you look at April order growth and how it's larger or bigger than the first quarter that we've been trending, most of the increase has been organic. So, let's just say that – look, if you say that a couple points of the growth was a tailwind from the weather. There's still a, what I would consider a significant increase in April, even after accounting for that, from kind of January, February and March; to give it some context, April was our biggest order growth month since summer of last year.

Your next question comes from Jason Helfstein with Oppenheimer. Your line is open.
Jason Helfstein - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)
Thanks. Two questions. Just any update on kind of the tech stack and the integration of Seamless, Grubhub and for particularly like in New York, when does all of that – when is it identical between the two apps, and secondly, just remind us, the delivery fee – if the restaurants chooses to add a delivery fee, does that show up in the average order value metric? Thanks.
Matthew M. Maloney - Chief Executive Officer
Sure, Jason. This is Matt. So update on tech integration. I think we've said before that the majority of the technical debt is complete, at least on the consumer side in New York, as well as any other market.

So from a diner perspective, it is identical on the platforms, whether you're on web, mobile web, native app, it doesn't matter, it's all going through the same pipes. Now, the corporate business is a little bit different. It's on a longer delay, because that's just a tremendous amount of work that we're very excited to do, because it's a significant differentiator in the space, being able to channel local restaurants through a coordinated corporate product. But that's taking a little bit longer.
In terms of delivery fee in the average order size, I believe it is in there when the restaurant defines a delivery fee, when they are doing their own delivery.

Your next question comes from John Egbert with Stifel. Your line is open.
John P. Egbert - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.
Thanks for taking the question. Given that New York is such a disproportionately large market for takeout ordering, I was wondering if you could talk about some of the progress you're seeing in delivery in the outer boroughs so far? I know it's still early. And then, given that you said Grubhub delivery is proving to be a better customer experience in a lot of ways than restaurants doing it themselves, does this change your willingness to enter delivery in Manhattan, and it seems like average order uplift could offset maybe some margin concerns. What are the pros and cons that you have to weigh with a decision like that? Thanks.
Matthew M. Maloney - Chief Executive Officer
Sure, John. So, we've definitely seen a ton of growth in the outer boroughs and really, if you look at a market like Queens or Brooklyn, it's very similar to other markets like Chicago or Philly on a standalone basis. New York's just a dramatic market for delivery in general. And so, we know exactly what we're doing. We target the highest premium, high profile restaurants, and we execute very efficiently at a high level of service for a low transactional fee, and that's just the secret sauce that works, whether it's in the Bronx or really anywhere else.
So, when thinking about delivery in Manhattan, you're right, it is a unique proposition, because the ecosystem in Manhattan has evolved over, who knows, 50 years and delivery is extraordinarily efficient in the city of Manhattan. It's why I believe New Yorkers and people in Manhattan order roughly four times more than in most other markets, is because you can order delivery from any restaurant at any time at almost zero transactional fee.
And so, are we able to augment that and I would say, it is trickier. We are experimenting with delivery in Manhattan. I know there are other players doing it, but I frankly don't know the value they bring to the system, because the typical bodega will get a sandwich to your office lightening fast, and I don't know why they'd need a third-party to do it.
Now, for restaurants that don't actually do delivery, obviously there's benefit there. And if you're thinking about augmenting delivery zones, it has its own problems when you're trying to get cross town around rush hour. So, we are working in Manhattan. We clearly haven't done a press release on it yet. We don't feel like we're at a critical scale to be able to pound our chest there, but I think that we're experimenting, we're trying to figure out where the value we can bring is. It's not as obvious as in the outer boroughs. But I think Manhattan is just the greatest delivery market in the world, and I've said that repeatedly, and so we are all in in Manhattan.

Your next question comes from Arvind Bhatia with CRT Capital. Your line is open.
Arvind Bhatia - CRT Capital Group LLC
Thanks for taking my question. I've got two questions. First one, on the corporate side, wondering if you can provide some color on how the trends were for that? And then, the $250 million run rate for the delivery business, Adam, can you remind us what you're thinking the run rate might be by the end of this year?

Adam J. DeWitt - Chief Financial Officer
Yeah. So, on the first, what I would say is, the corporate business, remember that it's something in the low, very low double-digits, close to 10% of our overall business. I think it continues to be a business that we can grow in kind of the single-digits. I think first quarter was in the single-digits, probably a tiny bit lighter than it's been in the past, but still very strong, and it's generating a ton of cash, and we think there's a lot of opportunity there. It's just since we have a lot of the big potential customers out there, it's tough to grow at a significant rate.
In terms of the run rate with delivery for the rest of the year, I don't think we gave a full year target for what we would be doing. Obviously with the LAbite acquisition, they did $80 million last year, there's probably a little bit – there's probably some growth in there, so you can add that on top – or kind of somewhere in the mid-3%s (54:44) right now. And we expect to continue to grow quickly on the delivery side, particularly on the organic side. Just to give some context, I think last quarter, we said we were at $200 million, this quarter we said we're at $250 million, of that $50 million in growth almost all of it's coming from the growth in organic delivery. So, hopefully that gives you a little bit more context, but I don't think we've given an explicit yearend number.

Your next question comes from Nat Schindler of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.
Nat H. Schindler - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Yes. Hi guys. Thanks a lot for taking my questions. I had two quick questions, one you said promotions were a little less than normal and more brand than normal. One, I've been seeing actually quite a few promotions, just did a 20% one last week, thanks a lot for that by the way, but additionally I wanted to just go a little bit into that and see if you could give us some of the normal level of contra revenue impact that you do in promotions in the quarter, and how much you're seeing now or how much you're doing now and how much has that changed?
Secondly, I think in San Francisco we obviously have a lot of these delivery players. And there was a restaurant I took the picture of their – in the mission (56:13) took a picture of their window. And I think they had 10 stickers on it for different delivery players. How are the restaurants reacting to basically all this noise in the market place?
Adam J. DeWitt - Chief Financial Officer
So, I'll take the question on the promos. I mean, look, what I'll say is, overall it's a small enough number that you're not going to see the fluctuations quarter-to-quarter so much unless we're doing something dramatic. And to your point, just to point out, we are back to a more of a normal level in the second quarter, and it's more the first quarter where – particularly at the beginning of the first quarter where we were a little bit light. But we don't rely very heavily on promotion, so it's just a low single-digits percent of revenue on a quarterly basis. And then I'll let Matt give you a little color on the San Francisco restaurants.
Matthew M. Maloney - Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. Hey Matt, I agree with you. The noise is a little asinine and it's kind of crazy. From a restaurant's perspective, this is really a winner-take-most market and the restaurants really only want to deal with one or maybe two. They don't like to be beholden to a single partner. They feel like they want some pricing leverage and so they'll generally open up their front counters for another partner and obviously they're going to keep the one that are actually generating real business for them. And so that's what we've seen historically. I think in San Francisco you're at another level in terms of funded ideas.

But what we see is, as restaurant owners are looking to manage their business and manage the knowledge transfer and execution of their hourly workers, you can't realistically train them on five different tablets. You want to go with the one that produces the most volume and nobody is giving up their Grubhub tablets and preference for anyone else because no one drives even near the volume that we do.

Jeff Houston - Northland Securities, Inc.
Hey, Matt and Adam, thanks for taking my questions. So looking at the momentum you're having with chains, can you talk a bit about how the take rates compare between chain restaurants and independents? And are they generally given higher priority in the listings compared with the independents?
Matthew M. Maloney - Chief Executive Officer
Sure, Jeff. Chains are huge opportunity and when they talk to us and have those conversations, they're excited about two things. They're excited about the amount of volume that we can drive them in terms of business and they're excited about the fact that we can execute delivery at a very high service level and set expectations and partner with them. And so, because we are bringing the business and fulfilling it, they are more than happy to pay these standard rack rates and there's no economic preference given to chains in contracts whatsoever.
And also, in terms of exposure on our platform, we give them the same amount of exposure as any restaurant that produces great food. And so, we like to highlight our best restaurants, the local favorites, the chefs that are really working their tails off to produce the best food possible, and many times that includes chains, and so we highlight all of them based on how much business we believe we can drive them.

Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Grubhub's first quarter of 2017 earnings call.

And now I'll turn the call over to Matt Maloney, Grubhub's CEO.
Matthew M. Maloney - GrubHub, Inc.
Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining the call. 2017 is off to a strong start and I'm excited to share our progress. Capitalizing on our business and product transformations in 2016, we've become more aggressive in showcasing our improved platform to a wider diner audience than ever before. Our product is the most engaging and personalized it's ever been. Our brand is resonating strongly with diners, and our restaurant network is getting better in quality and quantity, most notably in Tier 2 markets.
The numbers speak for themselves. In the first quarter, we added more Active Diners and more restaurants than ever before. We sent $10 million in takeout orders to our more than 50,000 restaurant partners every day. We generated close to 40% year-over-year revenue growth and increased our EBITDA per order by 10%. We're capitalizing on the enormous market opportunity and we're excited about what's ahead of us.

Grubhub generated $156 million of net revenue in Q1 compared to $112 million last year. We saw our typical uptick in business in the first quarter, even with some abnormally mild and dry weather patterns across the Northeast and Midwest. Chicago, for example, had no snow in January or February for the first time since weather has been tracked. Nonetheless, our growth was deep and broad; 28 of our markets generated more than 1,000 DAGs, up meaningfully from 22 in the fourth quarter of last year.
Net income was $17.7 million for the quarter, an increase of 78% from the prior year. Adjusted EBITDA was $43 million for the quarter, growing 32% year-over-year. Adjusted EBITDA per order was $1.46, up from $1.33 per order in the prior year. Over the course of last year, we have improved our delivery efficiency significantly, allowing us to invest in product and marketing, while simultaneously increasing our profitability. These investments will drive growth in diners, orders, and ultimately EBITDA.
We ended Q1 with 8.8 million Active Diners, a growth of 26% versus the prior year. Our traction in Tier 2 and Tier 3 markets is strong, growing twice as fast as our Tier 1 diner base. This accelerating pace of diner growth was driven by our best quarter ever in Active Diner additions and highlights the success of our increased advertising in the first few months of the year, as well as the opportunity ahead of us.
Given our performance year-to-date, we are optimistic about our ability to continue this high level of advertising throughout 2017 while maintaining high ROIs. We generated gross food sales of $898 million for our local restaurant partners in the quarter, an increase of 26% year-over-year. While adding new restaurants helps drive our gross food sales and diner growth, it also creates a rising tide that lifts all boats in our ecosystem, driving more orders to all of our restaurants.
This network effect makes us an increasingly important partner to all our partners as the business grows. Restaurants that have been on Grubhub for more than two years generated greater than 10% gross food sales growth year-over-year in Q1 of 2017. It's clear we provide a tremendous benefit to our restaurants and we're pleased to be able to help them grow year after year. This is the reason that our non-delivery commission rates have gone up every year.
At the beginning of 2017, we spoke about our plan to invest more aggressively in advertising than we did last year. We have improved our product, our restaurant network and the overall diner experience. These improvements give us confidence that when we bring on more new diners outside of our Tier 1 markets, they are going to love what they see.
As planned, we ramped up our advertising in the first quarter. We were able to increase spend effectively within online channels that were leveraged in the past, like search, social and a variety of other digital media. In addition, our improved restaurant network breadth enabled us to deploy broader-based offline media and still yield strong returns across markets.
Many of you have seen our national TV campaign over the past few months. Early results have been extremely positive, driving unaided brand awareness and new diner growth primarily in key Tier 2 markets. As our Tier 2 markets continue to grow, we can more effectively push out-of-home advertising on a market-specific basis as well. Our diners in New York, Chicago, and the rest of our Tier 1 markets have always seen Seamless and Grubhub media around their cities. We're now at sufficient scale to extend that to a number of our Tier 2 markets.
We had great results from these efforts. In Q1, we accelerated Active Diner growth, posted our best quarter of organic diner net adds in the history of the company and cost per net new Active Diner was on par with the fourth quarter. Given this success, we will maintain a more aggressive stance on marketing and look for efficient opportunities to spend into this strength.

We also continued to make great strides on our restaurant network. After an outstanding fourth quarter, our sales force outperformed themselves yet again, and recorded our highest quarter of restaurant additions ever. We are notching successes across the board. Not only did we add several exciting new chain partners over the past few months, including TGI Fridays, Chili's, Maggiano's, and Rubio's Coastal Grill, but our existing partners continued to expand their coverage with us. After strong initial pilots, we're now supporting around 750 locations for Subway, 50 for Red Robin Gourmet Burgers, and over 100 for Buffalo Wild Wings, and over 125 for Denny's.
The chain momentum is great, but we've also continued our focus on adding local cult favorites that our diners love, like The Meatball Shop in New York and Revival Food Hall in Chicago. Our goal is to have exactly what each diner wants the moment they come to Grubhub, whether that's fast food, fast casual, full service, or value-price points, or even a white tablecloth meal delivered to their door. We will have it all at the lowest possible price. We are already delivering on the promise of the most comprehensive takeout marketplace in the U.S. and we see a lot of opportunity to make it better.
On the product side, our team continues to be heads down focused on anything and everything that can improve the diner experience and diner lifetime value. Our recent tests run the gamut from more complex projects like improving our sort algorithm and beta testing the dietary tags, some of you have already noticed, to smaller and less noticeable changes like the positioning of fields and our checkout process, or upselling diners on additional items. Our product team is also increasingly partnering with marketing to place the Grubhub ordering platform front and center for consumers however they want to engage with us, whether it's using Alexa voice ordering on an Amazon device or by sending a gift card to a friend via iMessage for that special occasion.
Finally, on the operational side, we're moving quickly on streamlining our delivery operations and technology. We discussed last quarter that we would be consolidating our RDS platforms onto the Grubhub brand in 2017 and we're ahead of schedule. If any of you happen to have visited DiningIn, Restaurants on the Run, Delivered Dish, or LAbite in the last few weeks, then you have noticed that those sites now link consumers through to Grubhub for our UI restaurant network and lower diner facing fees have the potential to increase ordering habits.
For the corporate clients of our acquired RDS brands, we're now offering what we have branded as Grubhub for Work. Focused on the small business portion of the corporate market that the RDS has generally served, this product offers robust functionality around scheduled recurring orders, catering orders, and customized group ordering. While in the very early stages, we will refine and grow this product over time to serve the broader overall SMB market nationwide. We're excited by the progress we have made so far in 2017 in such a short period of time. All the teams here, from technology to marketing to delivery and product are reinvigorated by our success and the large and growing opportunity in front of us.
I look forward to giving you more updates on our success as the year rolls on. And with that, I will hand it over to Adam who will walk you through the financials and future guidance. Adam?
Adam J. DeWitt - GrubHub, Inc.
Thanks, Matt. Good morning, everyone. As Matt highlighted in his remarks, we are pleased with our start to 2017. Our Active Diner growth accelerated to 26% compared to the first quarter of last year, our highest growth rate since 2015 and easily the most net Active Diners we have added organically in a quarter. We've processed 324,600 Daily Average Grubs and nearly $900 million in Gross Food Sales during the quarter, a 21% increase and a 26% increase year-over-year respectively. The acquisition of LAbite, which we'll fully anniversary in May, contributed approximately 1.5% to Active Diner growth, 1% to DAG growth, and 3% to Gross Food Sales growth.

First quarter net revenues were $156 million, 39% higher than the year-ago quarter of $112 million. If we exclude the impact from LAbite, revenue growth would have been approximately 34%. Net revenue as a percentage of Gross Food Sales was 17.4% during the first quarter. This compares to 15.7% during the first quarter of last year.
We have talked about how our capture rate has increased over the past 24 months due to the increase in the percentage of orders that we deliver because those orders carry a higher capture rate than orders that restaurants deliver for themselves. But it has also increased because, as our marketplace grows, restaurants want to pay a higher commission rate in return for exposure to more diners on our platform. This latter dynamic, while much smaller than the delivery impact, has an exaggerated impact on our bottom line, as nearly all of the increased revenue capture flows through to profit. We hope to continue to see some benefit here over time, due to our strong network growth, as well as newer opportunities for restaurant visibility on our platform, like sponsored listings, carousels, and more targeted CRM.
Matt and I have both noted the strength in new diner acquisition during the first quarter, which certainly contributed to order growth. However, it's worth noting that 95% of our orders come from repeat diners. Our cohorts remain extremely sticky, and generally drive more revenue over time. For example, diners that ordered with us the first time in January of 2013 generated more revenue for us in March of 2017 than they did in March of 2016. This creates a natural, perpetual tailwind for long term revenue growth.
On the expense side, total sales and marketing expenses were $35.4 million in Q1, a 23% increase compared to the same quarter last year, and a sequential increase of 20% compared to the fourth quarter. Last quarter, we highlighted our intention to increase advertising spend this year, and the Active Diner growth I highlighted earlier is a testament to our ability to maintain effectiveness at a higher level of spend. Of note, this strength in new diner acquisition was broad, in our most penetrated markets as well as our smallest, newest markets. When a diner joins our platform and has a good experience in terms of restaurant selection, restaurant quality, diner fees and service levels, they tend to become habitual, repeat diners. Given this predictability, we have good insight into diner lifetime value by market and by channel. This makes us comfortable spending up front to acquire diners that generate long streams of profitable revenue over time.
Of note, the strong recent growth of our restaurant network, both in quantity and quality in many of our less-penetrated markets has improved the first-time diner experience, giving us the ability to spend more dollars in these markets, while maintaining reasonable CPAs and high lifetime values. We'll continue to take advantage of these opportunities as we see them. However, we expect sales and marketing spend to be down in the single digits sequentially because of seasonality. This is less than it would typically be down in the second quarter, which along with the third quarter, make up the softer half of the year for us. We do expect total sales and marketing percentage growth to be in the mid-to high 20%s for the full year 2017, consistent with prior expectations.
Operations and support expenses in the third quarter (sic) [first quarter] (14:28) were $59.5 million, a 70% increase compared to the $35 million in the first quarter of last year, and sequential increase of 15% compared to the fourth quarter. This increase is mostly from the steep growth in our delivery orders, but also the inclusion of LAbite and organic growth in overall orders. We continued to make very good progress on our delivery organization's efficiency. Once again, our revenue growth per order on a nominal basis outpaced the growth in ops and support per order on a nominal basis compared to a year ago. As a result, EBITDA per order grew from $1.33 to $1.46 during the period. We are making excellent progress towards our goal of de minimis investment in delivery by the end of 2017.

Technology expenses, excluding amortization of web development were $13.2 million for the quarter, increasing 29% from Q1 of 2016, due to investments we are making in continuous product improvement. This includes the addition of folks from Zoomer that we talked about last quarter. Depreciation and amortization was $10 million for the quarter, a sequential increase of 1% from the fourth quarter and 37% from a year ago. The year-over-year increase is due to investment in our platform, intangibles from the acquisition of LAbite, and our headquarters build out last year. G&A costs were $13.0 million, a sequential increase of 6% from the $12.3 million in the fourth quarter, consistent with growth to support our business.
Net income was $17.7 million, compared to the prior year of $9.9 million. Net income per fully diluted common share was $0.20 on approximately 87 million weighted average fully diluted shares. Our tax rate for the fourth quarter was around 29%, lower than our normalized tax rate of 40.5%, driven by the new accounting rules for tax benefit or loss related to stock based compensation, and to a lesser extent, a couple of one-time credits.
The new accounting rules, which we and other companies generally adopted in the first quarter, call for a change in the recognition of excess tax benefits or deficiencies from stock-based compensation. Historically, this impact was ignored on the P&L and you would see it on the cash flow statement in the financing section. The new rules dictate that these impacts move to the P&L in the form of a reduction or increased income taxes in the period. This change resulted in approximately eight-point decrease to our effective tax rate in the quarter. Because the benefit or deficiency is generated when employees exercise options or RSUs vest, and depends on both the strike price, or grant price of those shares, as well as the market price at the time of exercise or vest, it is inherently unpredictable and difficult to forecast.
So, while our expectation for our normalized tax rate remains 40.5% going forward, our actual tax rate quarter-to-quarter may vary significantly. It is important to note that these benefits or deficiencies have always been and will continue to be real impacts to cash. A reduction in taxes is a real reduction, and a deficiency is a real increase in taxes. It's just that prior to this quarter this impact in taxes was only identified and quantified on the cash flow statement.
Non-GAAP net income was $25.1 million, or $0.29 per fully diluted common share, compared to the prior year of $17.2 million, or $0.20 per fully diluted common share. Non-GAAP net income excludes amortization of acquired intangibles, acquisition and restructuring costs, and stock-based compensation expense, as well as the income tax effects of these non-GAAP adjustments. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter is $42.7 million, an increase of 32% from $32.4 million in the same quarter of the prior year. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 27%, driven by our continued mix shift towards delivery and recent investments in marketing and technology. We ended the quarter with approximately $360 million in cash, or roughly $4 per share.
Before I move into our guidance, it's important that I spend a moment on seasonality, to help people how to think about modeling our full year. In a typical year, we expect warmer weather and summer vacations to reduce orders in the second quarter, somewhere in the low-to-mid single-digit percentages compared to the first quarter, followed by another small decline in the third quarter. We then see a significant uptick in the fourth quarter, followed by another meaningful uptick in the first quarter. Once you strip away acquisitions and other noise, we have seen this pattern occur consistently throughout our history. 2016 was unique with a sequential uptick in orders in the second quarter, led by dramatic product improvements and weather. We expect a more historical pattern to return this year, and our guidance reflects that.

For revenue, we expect Q2 to be in the range of $153 million to $161 million, and we are raising the full-year guidance to be in the range of $632 million to $662 million. This includes the healthy diner growth we saw in the first quarter, as well as more confidence as to where the percentage of delivery orders is headed. We expect adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $38 million to $44 million for the second quarter and our increasing full year adjusted EBITDA to be between $170 million and $190 million for the full year, based on first quarter performance and updated full year expectations.
The seasonal impact on order growth I just detailed has a similar effect on EBITDA. There is a portion of our cost structure that is variable with order volume. And so it declines sequentially in Q2, along with our marketing spend. Our fixed cost infrastructure, however, typically increases modestly. All things considered, this translates into slight sequential declines in EBITDA in the second and third quarters. Like order growth, this EBITDA trend reverses in the fourth quarter and first quarter, as the activity of our diners picks back up and, given the high profit flow-through of each incremental order, drives a strong uptick in EBITDA from the prior two quarters.
We are firmly on track to meet our goals for the year, showcasing our improved restaurant network and platform to more diners across the country. We are excited by our performance in Q1 and will continue to make investments to drive long-term profitable growth.
With that, Matt and I will take your questions. Operator, please open up the lines.

Your first question comes from the line of Brian Nowak from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
Brian Nowak - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Thanks for taking my questions. I have two. Just the first one on the Tier 2 markets. It seems like you're making good traction in the markets with Active Diners. I'd be curious for anything, early learnings or observations of how these new Active Diners are acting in the new markets compared to the core markets. Any reason to assume that the cohorts and the purchase velocity wouldn't be similar?
And then secondly, Matt, you talked about drivers of higher delivery efficiency. Can you just give us some examples of how you're making the delivery process more efficient? What are still some low-hanging fruit opportunities to make delivery even more efficient? Thanks.
Adam J. DeWitt - GrubHub, Inc.
Hey, Brian. It's Adam. I want to take the first and then I'll let Matt take the second. So in terms of the diners for the Tier 2 markets, really I think it's the same story that we've been seeing throughout the past several years, which is you really have a difference in behavior in the Manhattan and corporate diners, and then the rest of the country is very similar. So the Tier 2 markets, obviously there's some diversity amongst those, but they're generally in the same vicinity. So if you are comparing it to the overall, we obviously have a lot of business in New York and with corporate. So on the average, it's a little bit lower, but they're behaving very similar to other markets outside of Manhattan and corporate.
Matthew M. Maloney - GrubHub, Inc.
Hey, Brian. It's Matt. In terms of delivery efficiency, really, where we're seeing the gains is all around things that are scale-based. So as our order volume in the market increases, our ability to staff, dispatch, route, batch orders, this all improves. This all drives the throughput of our driver network up, and obviously our driver costs down.
One other element when we think about efficiency, the dirty secret in all of this delivery is all the non-driver costs. And people don't really talk about that. Breakeven on a driver pay basis is really only half the battle. And we've actually found ways to noticeably improve our cost efficiency in things like driver recruiting, driver on-boarding, gear distribution and a lot of other of these non-driver pay-related areas of delivery, which overall increases our efficiency.

Your next question comes from the line of Ron Josey from JMP Securities. Your line is open.
Ronald V. Josey - JMP Securities LLC
Great. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask on just marketing campaigns, given it's coming in full swing here. Can you just remind us a little bit more about how you think about the ROI and payback period for marketing spend? And then the tools you all have to basically get these newer diners to repeat and increase and drive engagement higher.
And then, bigger picture, Matt, in terms of delivery. Have you ever thought about potentially, now that delivery is in, what, 70-plus markets with more national coverage, potentially offering a subscription product for unlimited delivery or things along those lines? Thanks.
Adam J. DeWitt - GrubHub, Inc.
Hey, Ron. It's Adam. I'll take the marketing question. So how we think about ROI, what I talked about in my script, I think Matt mentioned it as well, when we have diners come on board, they tend to stay with us for a very long time. I think we've talked about in the past, when we're generating internal lifetime value models, that we actually have to force attrition into the model even though we're not seeing it. We've always talked about the cohorts increasing in value over time after the first few months.
So, the lifetime values are very high. Generally, what we see on the CPA side is that it's coming in generally a lot lower than our LTVs. And so we feel very comfortable. It's just when we talk about the limits of our marketing and being able to spend efficiently, we get to this point in some of these channels where the increased spending actually doesn't generate any new diners. And so we're generally spending to that point of, what I call, dramatic inefficiency.
If you're thinking about payback time, I think it depends on channel, depends where we're getting the diners from. And so it could be anywhere from a few months to even less, to all the way up to a year. But we're getting payback from those diners over a very long period of time.
I think you asked about the re-engagement. I think one of the things that we've been doing differently there or we've improved on over the past 12 months to 18 months, is a lot of personalization. And I think part of what's enabled us to do that is, especially in the Tier 2s, where we've dramatically improved the quality of our restaurant network and so we're able to match specific diners with specific restaurants that we know are really popular. And we have a really good hit rate because of the breadth of restaurants that we have. And so being able to send an email at the right time to encourage an order on a Tuesday night when a diner typically orders on a Friday or Saturday and get them to order more is something that we've been able to have a lot of success on.
Matthew M. Maloney - GrubHub, Inc.
Hey, Ron. In terms of a subscription-like service, we have always been testing things. We've tested subscription services before. We haven't really found that right balance of something that'll really lock in that diner-side demand. And part of the problem is the economics. I mean, they are just tight. You can do the math yourself. And in order to even come close to break-even, it's a pretty hefty annual fee in order to make something like this happen.
But, remember, we're testing delivery fees on a city-by-city basis constantly making sure that we're optimizing for conversion rate and making sure we can float the economics. And when we think about diners that are cost-sensitive, remember, we have over 10,000 restaurants that have free delivery always on the site because they do their own delivery, and they don't have a delivery piece (27:23). So thinking about this from a competitive perspective, we will always have a baked-in advantage in terms of price point for diners.

Your next question comes from the line of Ralph Schackart from William Blair. Your line is open.
Ralph E. Schackart - William Blair & Co. LLC
Good morning. Looking at the strong diner additions in Q1 and clearly the marketing campaign is showing some early positive signs, how should we think about the pace of that sort of diner addition throughout the year, as you add on incremental marketing campaigns? Thanks.
Adam J. DeWitt - GrubHub, Inc.
Yeah, so, Ralph, I think I mentioned in the script that even though sales and marketing, I think, will be down a few points in the second quarter, but that that's actually a little bit higher than it would typically be in the second quarter. So, we're going to continue to spend at a higher level overall. And we expect to see good continued growth in new diners. In terms of the percentage, I think it's a little tough to handicap. Obviously, our guidance has a range of outcomes. We have a lot of confidence that the additional spend is going to yield new diners. And over time, it's going to lead to more order growth. I think, just one thing to remember for your modeling is LAbite, we were lapping in the second quarter, and I think we talked about before that something around 100,000 diners or something we acquired in last year's second quarter, so that will affect your modeling a little bit.
Ralph E. Schackart - William Blair & Co. LLC

Your next question comes from the line of Paul Bieber from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.
Paul Bieber - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)
Good morning, and thanks for taking my question. I was hoping that you could help us reconcile the comments about the stable costs of net new Active Diners, just for the fact that the competitive landscape is pretty intense. It's pretty unusual to see stable customer acquisition costs in a very competitive market. So, I was hoping you could provide some color about that.
Matthew M. Maloney - GrubHub, Inc.
Sure. Paul, I can kind of address the competition question head on and then how an increasing competitive arena impacts CPAs, maybe Adam can follow-up a little bit on that market.
I mean, I think, I have answered this question pretty consistently on the past four or five, maybe six earnings calls, but we just continue to show great growth rates across our business, and again, we just posted our best quarter of diner adds in the history of the company. And don't forget that all material or meaningful competition was in the market more than a year ago, as well. So, when I look at the marketplace, I see that we have significant structural advantages in that we are known for just one thing. Like, we just do take-out ordering, and we back it up with world class service, and we'll succeed because of the singular focus and our ability to engineer our entire product around this purpose.
The Grubhub for Work products that we talked about – or I talked about today in the prepared remarks is a classic example of this. We've really talked to our customers, found out what they wanted, how they wanted to engage with their local restaurants and we built the tool around that specific use case with only that use case in mind. So, industry-wide, I think, we have a huge advantage, because we clearly have the most restaurants, over 50,000 now, and the lowest diner-facing fees, like I just spoke about in terms of – to Ron, actually.
And so you think about – we have the best product experience. We have the most restaurants. We have the largest platform, we have the best customer support. We continue to accelerate on all fronts. And it's a massive marketplace. So, as the industry is growing, and I believe, competition is increasing awareness, broadly, which is accelerating our offline to online transition, I think, it's just a big growth time for this industry.

And as you look at our distinct competitive advantages, just to break it down one level deeper, I mean, scale – we have the largest scale in the industry and that gives us meaningful efficiency and competitive advantages others just can't reproduce. The product focus I talked about, that's all we do. That's all we think about. All of our people do this. That's what we do every day.
We're not going to be held up by delivering iPods or toothpaste or groceries. We have the lowest facing fees and I believe everyone will agree that cost matters to consumers. We pride ourselves on cost transparency, the best service, the lowest fees. And we're not at a significant disadvantage to anyone in terms of delivery time. In fact, oftentimes, we are the fastest and most consistent food-delivery option available, especially during rush hour, or as we call it dinner time. Adam?
Adam J. DeWitt - GrubHub, Inc.
Yeah, I – just to answer, just more – just the more specific question about CPAs, I think, what we see over time is you have to remember this is – as Matt mentioned, kind of, we're capturing an offline to online transition, right? And so there's more eyeballs available for us on the web. And so it's not a matter of having to bid more for keywords, it's getting more clicks and it's expanding the keywords, right? As we expand our restaurant network. So that's an easy way to think about the costs kind of remaining stable while we increase new diners. I think adding high leverage out of home. Our offline advertising, like TV, that can boost the efficiency of our online digital, I think, are other ways that we've kind of managed to keep CPAs relatively flat. And as Matt said, look, if there is competition in certain markets, in some ways it is creating more awareness for the product. And remember, we're all trying to capture some of this offline to online transition. So, in some ways, that perhaps helps us.

Your next question comes from the line of Jason Helfstein from Oppenheimer. Your line is open.
Jason Helfstein - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.
Thanks. Two questions. One, any more commentary you can provide on competition by geography or tier size. And then, secondly, can you talk about product features that would address caller? So, specifically, we've done some work that suggested the biggest opportunity for you is to address basically diners who call the restaurant because they have questions and then end up ordering that way as opposed to through your app. Given the Facebook's presentation at F8 about messaging and partners, just some things they are doing with delivery.com, maybe just talk about how you plan to address in the future, being able to answer questions, so that diners don't have to call restaurants. Thanks.
Matthew M. Maloney - GrubHub, Inc.
Sure, Jason, let me – I don't really have much more commentary on competition. I kind of exhaustively covered that a minute ago. In terms of geo and tier, I think that Grubhub has a very secure base in the Tier 1 major metros and we're not seeing that eroded. In fact, we're seeing that grow. And then, in Tier 2, we've said a bunch of times that this is a key focus, Tier 2, Tier 3, on growth for us, given our success in delivery over the past year, and so we're seeing outsized growth there. Clearly competition isn't impacting our growth rate there either.
Product features on callers – calling is tricky because it requires the bidirectional communication, and kind of what our product is doing is trying to alleviate the friction around the telephone. And so, we are definitely trying to figure out ways to answer diners' questions in real time, but without actually having someone at the restaurant have to pick up the phone. That is a very difficult problem to solve and I'd say we're definitely thinking about it, clearly with the advent of more automated – more automated systems around, like, chatbots and iMessage, I think, there is a lot of opportunity. Opportunities that have never been available before.

Part of it is the actual communication. Another part of it is the metadata inside the menus. We spoke a few earnings calls ago about normalizing menu data and making sure that our menu data is comparable and understandable from a big data perspective. And we've actually continued to invest in that, which is really interesting. And one thing I didn't mention in the prepared remarks is that we – or I think I did, actually – we rolled out with some dietary tags in the menus, which are really interesting. It's a way for us to almost micro-select dishes across restaurants that are vegan, for example, or other various forms of dietary tags, and actually collecting that is non-trivial, and keeping that updated is harder than you would expect. And so we're working through elements like this. But, as we continue to flush out more data on a dish level, then it will be available to query from diners, and I think that's really where you're getting at.

Your next question comes from the line of Heath Terry from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Heath Terry - Goldman Sachs & Co.
Great. Thanks. Adam, I guess just one quick housekeeping question on the – I believe, I heard you say that EBITDA would be down sequentially in Q2, were you referring to the midpoint, because at the higher end, it looks like it would actually – of the guidance, it looks like it would actually be up. I just wanted to clarify that.
And then, Matt, as you talk about the customers that you're – the new customers that you're bringing on and the incredible growth that you saw this quarter in customer additions, do you have a sense of what the older cohorts in these Tier 2 markets that are predominantly – are becoming predominantly delivery-driven, how those perform as they age, relative to what you're seeing. I guess, you've talked about frequency before. How long do you see it taking before that once a month order in Denver gets to the four to six times a month that you see in New York, San Francisco, Chicago, et cetera?
Adam J. DeWitt - GrubHub, Inc.
Yeah, Heath, I'll take the EBITDA question real quick. Yeah, absolutely, I was referring to the midpoint. Our guidance, obviously, has a range of outcomes. Last year, we had – our EBITDA was a little bit higher in the second quarter than the first quarter, but my commentary is around the second quarter we typically expect it to be, all things equal, we would expect a little – it just makes sense that there is a little bit of a tiny step back, in kind of anticipation for the big step forward in the fourth quarter and first quarter. So, yeah, the commentary was around the mid-point as opposed to the high end of the range.
Heath Terry - Goldman Sachs & Co.
Got it.
Matthew M. Maloney - GrubHub, Inc.
And then, Heath, in terms of the older cohorts in the Tier 2, Tier 3 markets and how they're performing with additional delivery restaurants, they are all performing much higher than they were before. They're all getting better. I mean, if you think about cohort performance, it's really a function of restaurant density. And so as you add restaurants to a marketplace, you're going to see those older cohorts actually perform at a higher rate. And I wouldn't – you are exactly right, the spectrum is from the lower restaurant density markets that historically have not had a robust self-delivery ecosystem, all the way up to the high end, which is Manhattan, which is the highest performing marketplace in the country in terms of diner performance. And so, as we continue to add restaurants, you're going to see those cohorts perform more in line with what you'd expect. And I'd expect Denver to progress to more of a Chicago, San Francisco range before it ultimately gets up to Manhattan.

Heath Terry - Goldman Sachs & Co.
Great. Thank you very much.

Your next question comes from the line of Mark May from Citi. Your line is open.
Mark A. May - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.
Thanks for taking my questions. First, I know the focus is more on EBITDA per order and that there are a number of variables that come into play in the capture rate, but can you talk about the top couple of factors driving the capture rate increase in the quarter? For instance, did sponsor listings play a key role? What about the mix of delivery?
And then I know you've talked a lot about the performance of the Tier 2 markets, which is great. I just wondered – and sorry if I missed this, if you could talk about the growth rates that you're seeing in the Tier 1 markets and how those have trended in the last couple of quarters? Thanks.
Adam J. DeWitt - GrubHub, Inc.
Yeah, Mark. How you doing? It's Adam. In terms of the capture rate, happy to talk about that a little bit. In some of my prepared remarks, we talked a little bit about this. Clearly, look, most of the increase is the increase in delivery orders as a percentage of overall orders.
On a delivery order, just to remind everyone, on delivery order, Grubhub gets the delivery fee, and also some additional commission from the restaurant. And most of that goes to paying for drivers. So we do see an increase in take rate. It's much higher on delivery orders. But most of that we see come back out in the expense side.
But we do have, and we've had historically over time, had an increase in the commission rate that restaurants are willing to pay for the demand generation. And so as markets grow and there's more restaurants and more diners, restaurants will pay more for more exposure because there's more value on the network for them. There's more orders, there's a bigger audience, et cetera. And so restaurants are willing to pay for that exposure. You asked a question – so we've certainly seen some improvement in the capture rate there. It's a lot smaller than the delivery mix impact, but it does drop right to the bottom line.
You mentioned, what's driving that? And the sponsor listings, it's basically there's a number of areas on the site, a number of opportunities for restaurants to get more exposure. And we've been continually working on that. One is the sponsor listings. Another is, if you use the platform, you'll notice there's carousels, whether it's on the home page or at the end of menus or other locations on the site. A third is, I mentioned earlier more targeted CRM. We're matching specific restaurants to specific diners, and we're getting better at it. So there's all these opportunities for restaurants to get more exposure and they're willing to pay more as a result. So we have seen an improvement in capture rate. It will be incremental over time and we think that we'll continue to see that.
Mark A. May - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.
What was the delivery mix in the quarter?
Adam J. DeWitt - GrubHub, Inc.
I don't think we've given specifics. In terms of delivery right now, if you look at delivery on our platform, we're at a run rate a little bit higher than 20% overall.
Mark A. May - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.
Thanks. Any comments on Tier 1 growth?
Adam J. DeWitt - GrubHub, Inc.
Yeah. So your second question, Tier 1 growth versus Tier 2 growth. I think it's a similar story as it is before. Tier 1s are just by sheer size make up a large percentage of our volume. So if their growth rate was significantly lower or higher than – it would be hard for Tier 1 growth rate to be much different than the overall company growth rate, I think, is an easy way to say it. It would be very difficult for...
Mark A. May - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.
Thanks. And Tier 2 growing twice as fast?

Adam J. DeWitt - GrubHub, Inc.
Yeah. We said that in the remarks, yeah.

Your next question comes from the line of Nat Schindler from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.
Nat H. Schindler - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Yes. Hi. Matt, not to belabor the point and I know you're sick of answering this, but I'm going to take it from a different angle. Clearly, you have network effects making competition within your Tier 1 markets very, very difficult. And it's undoubtedly over-talked about by Wall Street. But not the Tier 1, not the Tier 2s, not even the tertiary markets, but markets where you barely are, quaternary markets. Are there markets out there that could be substantial on your long-term calculations when you start looking at the market sizing, where you just haven't gotten around to really building up substantial presence that you see other players building in? And does that cut off any of the, to be honest, very long-term growth for the company?
And then a second question for Adam just quickly. You mentioned the take rates are going up on the marketplace side. Just wanted to know if you could give any more color on that? The last time we really had a clean number for that, before you had delivery, I think it around 15.2%. And you said it was roughly stable because new markets come in lower and old markets go up, so they balance each other out. Where is that going and what do you think the dynamics that are really moving it around are?
Matthew M. Maloney - GrubHub, Inc.
Hey, Nat. Yeah, interesting way to position that question. So I think you're right. There's definitely a first-mover advantage in this industry because once you build scale and orders, the restaurants really want to work with you and it's that much harder to prove yourself as a second-comer.
Because of that, for a long time we've been very aggressive expanding our services. So, clearly, before delivery, I think we were incorporating thousands of cities on our self-delivery platform. And that was our initial base. And then we saw how delivery could fundamentally accelerate the market dynamics and the flywheel in these markets. And so we went very aggressively into delivery a year ago. And I think we immediately were at like 70 or so, maybe 100 by now, I'm not really sure, markets.
So when you think about are there potentially substantial markets that we're not in yet, I would say no. In aggregate, there are a lot of markets we're not in yet that together could be substantial for sure, but no one else is there. We're talking broad areas in the Midwest, for example. We hit the key markets. But in between Columbus and Indianapolis, for example, we have very little or no presence.
In aggregate, those geographies are going to be meaningful in the long term. But I don't think any rational competitor is going to go aggressively into those spaces without first taking the intermediary second, third, and even fourth tier markets. So I don't see a strategic way for a competitor to cut off our long term growth by addressing these markets first. And, frankly, we're aggressively expanding in the suburbs of Indianapolis, for example. Those are geographies that you don't see other markets or other competitors expanding and it's because we do truly understand the impact of first-mover advantage in our space.
Adam J. DeWitt - GrubHub, Inc.
Yeah, Nat, in terms of the marketplace, our ad fee rate or however you want to describe it, we're not going to break it out from the overall capture rate. But what I can tell you is, obviously, that impact is a lot smaller on the capture rate than the delivery mix. When we're talking about increases, we're really talking about 10 basis points, 20 basis points, maybe 30 basis points at a time overall. And in the first quarter, we added to the commentary, just because it's larger than it has been. But even if you look at 10 basis points, 20 basis points, you apply that to all of our order volume, and drop it basically to the bottom line, it becomes material.

Hey, thanks. I wanted to go back to the diner ads, just because such a whopper of a number and congrats on that. You had a lot of improvements to the app over the course of the last 12, 18 months, and I'm wondering, given that your diner number is an annual backward-looking for a year, I'm wondering if any of the strength was due to retention, rather than gross adds.
And I'm also wondering, some similar companies have – when they switch to more of a brand marketing emphasis, television and that sort of thing, they've noticed that the customers that are coming in are more sort of focused on aligning with the brand and the experience, and therefore they are stickier, more active, as opposed to a direct response. Customer coming in from search or a social ad. I'm just wondering if you're seeing the same thing.
Adam J. DeWitt - GrubHub, Inc.
Yeah, hey, Mike, how are you? In terms of your question on retention, it certainly helps the number, and we have seen the improvements in the product help our long-term retention numbers. A diner saved is the equivalent of a new diner. In some ways it's better. But to be honest, historically we haven't had a big attrition problem with diners that have been on the platform for a few months. So it helped. But I think, at the end of the day, it's really about the restaurant network, the more efficient advertising, and in this case, at least, it's been a little bit more top of funnel than it has been the throughput on the funnel.
In terms of the diners, I'd say that they're similar, as opposed to much better or much worse. I think they do identify with the brand, but at the end of the day, you got to remember, what we're presenting to the market is a reason to move offline to online. And so a lot of cases these diners are not coming to us after one touch, right? They're seeing us on TV. They're seeing us on display. They're seeing us on SEM, and they're coming to us after a number of touches and they're high quality. I think the one thing I will say is TV diners are, and in all cases I think all diners are generally better if they're coming through some type of advertising medium or some channel that's not through a promotion. So, if you get a diner that's coming to us because of what we do, as opposed to a free meal or a free delivery, those diners tend to be higher quality.
Michael Patrick Graham - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.
Okay. Thanks a lot, Adam.

Your next question comes from the line of Tom Forte from Maxim Group. Your line is open.
Tom Forte - Maxim Group LLC
Great. Thanks for taking my question. So real quickly, wanted to see how you felt about chain restaurant delivery, specifically in the QSR category, given that McDonald's has started to ramp its efforts there.
And then second I wanted an update on the economics of chain restaurant delivery versus independent restaurants. Thank you.
Matthew M. Maloney - GrubHub, Inc.
Hey, Tom. Yeah, chain delivery is a big area of growth for us. I went through a bunch of chains that we signed on with pilots. I think that people should assume that we're talking to every chain realistically that could benefit from delivery at this point. I also walked through a few partners of ours that we had a successful pilot and they're expanding our relationship, which is really an important point when you think about the growth of our business, especially in Tier 2, Tier 3 markets where chains just make up a higher proportion of not only the inventory but of what diners want to order in those geographies.
So, I think that, from a chains perspective, they've always been interested in our demand and the ability to incrementally add revenue. Now with our ability to deliver, and deliver at a very high service level, very consistently, that was always a logistical hurdle that they were not interested in doing themselves for the most part. I mean, obviously, other than the major pizza chains, most chains just did not want to do delivery. So the fact they can partner with us and we will support them and be their partner in this delivery function, as well as bring tremendous new demand in a bunch of markets in ways that they were previously unable to do, this is pretty much a slamdunk from their perspective. In terms of economics, I can let Adam speak to that.

Adam J. DeWitt - GrubHub, Inc.
Yeah Hey, Tom, consistently the story with the chains has been on the economic side, that it's not materially different than our relationships with the independent restaurants. They are coming to us because we can provide something that is more efficient to get through Grubhub than it is through themselves. And, in most cases, that's a combination of the logistics and the demand generation. As our pool of Active Diners continues to grow, it's close to 9 million now, that's a way for them to drive volume where it's hard to access those diners in other places. So, we haven't found the economics to be really different between the chains that we've signed up and the independents.
Tom Forte - Maxim Group LLC
Great. Thank you.

Your next question comes from the line of Aaron Kessler from Raymond James. Your line is open.
Aaron M. Kessler - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Great, thanks, guys. Just a couple of quick questions. First, can you just talk a little about the demographics of new users? Our survey work continues to show kind of younger users much more likely to join these or to sign up.
Secondly, have you guys done much delivery pricing tests and are you still testing that? I have seen a lot of kind of variability on kind of delivery pricing in San Francisco, at least. Thanks.
Matthew M. Maloney - GrubHub, Inc.
Hey, Aaron, in terms of demographics, I mean, we're seeing adds across the board, honestly. I mean, clearly, Millennials and younger users are more apt to turn to their mobile phones for anything in their life at this point. But the success of our advertising across TV and other offline channels, really, has brought in a wide segment of new diners. And we're seeing it, honestly, across the board from older segments. Through kids we see a lot of new parents spike usage through college and even younger and frankly high school kids, when they have to figure out their own meal. So, in terms of demographics, you are not going to see outsized growth in one specific segment because the entire industry is transitioning, and that impacts everyone.
For delivery pricing tests, I'm not sure if you are talking about fees to diners or if you're talking about fees to restaurants, but in both cases...
Aaron M. Kessler - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Yeah. Fees to diners, sorry.
Matthew M. Maloney - GrubHub, Inc.
Okay, yeah, we are absolutely testing this. I think I mentioned it earlier. We're testing on a per market basis. We're trying to figure out what is the expectation. The expectation of delivery fee is set from historical norms based on what their delivery ecosystem looks like. In Manhattan, it has always been free or very small. In markets where there isn't that much delivery available, they charge a higher fee in order to justify the incremental expense. So we're trying to gauge on a per market basis ultimately what impacts conversion the most because all we look at is lifetime value, and then what happens when we decrease that fee? Do we see an increase in frequency? Do we see people turning to their local restaurants more consistently to feed their families? And we're just constantly looking through for both product and advertising to, how do we increase the lifetime value, increase the conversion, increase the frequency of diners and we're constantly testing.
Aaron M. Kessler - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Got it. Great, thank you.
Operator
And our final question comes from the line of John Egbert from Stifel. Your line is open.
John Egbert - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.
Great, thanks for taking the question. Matt, you noted that you are starting to push users of your acquired delivery services towards Grubhub, with them benefiting from lower delivery fees. Have you measured any change in order frequency for those customers?

And, not to dwell too much on competition, but at restaurants where you overlap with other delivery services, have you looked at how your delivery fees compare on average? Are they meaningfully lower? And, if so, is that something that might ever become part of targeting marketing messages in those cities? Thanks.
Matthew M. Maloney - GrubHub, Inc.
Yeah, sure. We definitely see increased frequency as you decrease delivery fees to diners. I mean, it's classical. You reduce transactional costs and you see higher frequency of transaction. There's diminishing returns, I mean, the difference between a $10 transactional fee, and a $3 transactional fee is dramatic, in terms of diner frequency. The difference between a $3 and a $1 is definitely not as dramatic.
There is clearly segments of diners that are very cost conscious, in which case they are always looking at our free-delivery restaurants, which are predominantly – are actually exclusively self delivery restaurants that recognize the value of low transactional fees. And I think, as I said before, we will always have that advantage because those restaurants do it themselves. We don't have to pay for the delivery there. So there's a slope of impact, and then that slope definitely has a different y intercept for various markets.
Now, competitively, this is even more interesting because the way that we execute, we have a lower cost per delivery, especially from the groups that are doing non-contracted delivery. Anyone who is doing non-contracted delivery, your incremental cost is anywhere is from $6 to $10. And so you really can't get away with any type of diner fee less than that if you actually intend to make money at some point in the future. And so, we are clearly cheaper on a transactional basis for diners -- and on all basis this for diners than non-contracted. Versus other contracted shops, I think it really depends on how the restaurant contract is structured. But, generally, we are significantly cheaper than everyone else. And, in fact, we do use that as a key marketing message.
Now, you don't want to cheapen the value of your product because fundamentally, we're here for selection, convenience, consistently high quality service. But, you know what? All things equal, pretty much everyone's going to choose the lower cost provider on that. And so, I think we sent out a broad-based email a week or two ago highlighting the fact that we have over 10,000 restaurants with no delivery fee and that's not a special that we have for this week or the rest of this month. This is a permanent fixture of the way our marketplace works, and we will always be cheaper than everyone else.
So I think that there's a lot of legs on that marketing communication and we're going to continue to push that. And if you look at the rack rates for diners in terms of delivery fee across the competitive arena, I think you will agree that we are materially cheaper than everyone else.
John Egbert - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.

In 1999, Seamless was founded by two lawyers, Jason Finger and an associate, fed up with out-of-date paper menus.[4] In 2004, Grubhub was founded by Matthew Maloney and Michael Evans, two web developers looking for an alternative to paper menus.[5]
In 2013, Grubhub and Seamless merged.[6] The combined organization, Grubhub, went public in April 2014 and trades on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) under the ticker symbol "GRUB".[7]

Brands[edit]
Grubhub's portfolio of brands includes Seamless, AllMenus, MenuPages, Restaurants on the Run, DiningIn, Delivered Dish, and LAbite. Grubhub is an online and mobile food-ordering company that connects diners with local restaurants. Diners who order through Grubhub's website or mobile apps—for iOS and Android devices—can pay with cash, credit or PayPal. Seamless is an online and mobile food ordering platform that connects diners with local restaurants. It serves consumer diners as well as corporate businesses in the U.S. and London.[citation needed]
MenuPages was acquired by Seamless in September 2011.[10] Allmenus was acquired by Grubhub in September 2011.[11] DiningIn, an online ordering and food delivery company based in Brighton, Massachusetts, was acquired by Grubhub in February 2015. DiningIn operates in Boston, Chicago, Dallas, Philadelphia, and the Twin Cities.[12] Restaurants on the Run, a corporate food delivery company based in Aliso Viejo, California, was acquired by Grubhub in February 2015, operating in Orange County, San Diego, Inland Empire, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Las Vegas, Seattle, Houston, Tulsa & Chicago.[13]

Most of LAbite's volume comes from the Greater Los Angeles area.[citation needed]
History[edit]
Grubhub history[edit]
Chicago-based Grubhub was founded in 2004 by Mike Evans and Matt Maloney, looking for an alternative to paper menus.[15] Two years later, in 2006, Maloney and Evans won first place in the University of Chicago Booth School of Business's Edward L. Kaplan New Venture Challenge with the business plan for Grubhub.[16]
In November 2007, Grubhub secured $1.1 million in Series A funding (led by Amicus Capital and Origin Ventures), which enabled market expansion into San Francisco and New York.[17]
In March 2009, Grubhub earned $2 million in Series B funding, led by Origin Ventures and Leo Capital,[18] which was followed by $11 million in Series C funding, led by Benchmark Capital in November 2010.[19] $20 million in Series D funding was raised (led by DAG Ventures) in March 2011.[20]
In September 2011, Grubhub secured $50 million in Series E funding and acquired New York-based competitor Dotmenu, the parent company of Allmenus and Campusfood.[21] In December 2015, Grubhub acquired Delivered Dish, a restaurant delivery service in seven markets across the Pacific Northwest and Southwest, including Denver, Las Vegas, San Diego, Portland, El Paso and Albuquerque.[22] LAbite, a Los Angeles-based restaurant delivery service, was acquired by Grubhub in May 2016.[23]
Seamless history[edit]
In 1999, New York lawyer Jason Finger founded SeamlessWeb to provide companies with a web-based system for ordering food from restaurants and caterers. Six years later, in 2005, SeamlessWeb introduced a free ordering service to consumer diners to complement the existing corporate-ordering service.[24] In April 2006, SeamlessWeb was acquired by Aramark and integrated into its Food, Hospitalities, and Facilities segment.[25]
Jonathan Zabusky was named President of Seamless in 2009, and by June 2011, Seamless was re-privatized, as Boston-based Spectrum Equity Associates invested $50 million for a minority stake in the company from Aramark. The company then changed its name from SeamlessWeb to Seamless.[26]
In September 2011, Seamless acquired MenuPages,[27] and in February 2012, Seamless introduced the industry's first iPad app.[28]
Grubhub and Seamless merger[edit]
In May 2013, Grubhub and Seamless announced that they were merging, with Seamless representing 58% of the equity and GrubHub representing 42% of the equity of the combined business; the merger was finalized in early August 2013.[29]
IPO[edit]
Grubhub went public in April 2014 and trades on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) under the ticker symbol "GRUB".[30]
Delivery[edit]
In June 2014, Grubhub began offering delivery to restaurants that don't operate their own delivery service. The company is now delivering in more than 50 markets across the U.S.[31] (publicly announced markets include Atlanta, Phoenix, Philadelphia, Los Angeles, San Francisco/Bay Area, D.C., Southeast Florida, Portland, Denver, Pittsburgh, Detroit, San Diego, Brooklyn/Queens (NYC), Chicago and Las Vegas). More than 5,000 restaurants are now using Grubhub delivery.[citation needed]
Grubhub's UK competitors are Deliveroo, Just Eat, and Hungryhouse. In the US, its competitors include Yelp, Eat24, Instacart, and Uber[32]
Controversy[edit]
On November 10, 2016, after the victory of President-elect Donald Trump in the general election, Grubhub President and CEO Matt Maloney, sent a company-wide memo to employees saying that he rejected "nationalist, anti-immigrant and hateful politics of Donald Trump". The Washington Times reported that Maloney "unleashed a political screed after the Nov. 8 election and said that those who disagree with its [the majority of the company personnel's] anti-Trump views should resign."[33][34]
After a Twitter boycott campaign was initiated, Maloney later claimed his words were "misconstrued", adding "I want to clarify that I did not ask for anyone to resign if they voted for Trump. I would never make such a demand. To the contrary, the message of the email is that we do not tolerate discriminatory activity or hateful commentary in the workplace, and that we will stand up for our employees."[33] In a tweet that was later deleted, Maloney added: "To be clear, Grubhub does not tolerate hate and we are proud of all our employees - even those who voted for Trump."[34] By Thursday night, the hashtag #BoycottGrubHub was trending on Twitter.[35]
On November 11, 2016, after the controversy, the company's shares dropped 5.93%.[36][35]
Scheduled Stock Selloffs by Executives[edit]
CEO Matt Maloney, in addition to other Grubhub Inc. executives, sells shares on a schedule throughout the year.
On October 24, 2016, Matt Maloney (the company's President/CEO) sold 14,491 shares of the stock at an average price of $43.55, for a total value of $631,083.05.[37][38]
On November 7, Maloney sold 14,491 shares of the company's stock at a price of $37.80, for a total transaction of $547,759.80 in personal profit.[39] Following the sales, Maloney now directly owns 1,649 shares of the company stock, valued at approximately $62,332.20. The transaction was disclosed in a filing with the Securities & Exchange Commission.[39]
On December 21, 2016, Maloney sold 14,491 shares at $37.46 per share price, according to the Form-4 filing with the securities and exchange commission.[40]

Overview[edit]
In 1999, Seamless was founded by two lawyers, Jason Finger and an associate, fed up with out-of-date paper menus.[4] In 2004, Grubhub was founded by Matthew Maloney and Michael Evans, two web developers looking for an alternative to paper menus.[5]
In 2013, Grubhub and Seamless merged.[6] The combined organization, Grubhub, went public in April 2014 and trades on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) under the ticker symbol "GRUB".[7]

As of Q1 2017, the company processes more than 324,600 orders/day and has 8.75 million active diners.[9]
Brands[edit]
Grubhub's portfolio of brands includes Seamless, AllMenus, MenuPages, Restaurants on the Run, DiningIn, Delivered Dish, and LAbite. Grubhub is an online and mobile food-ordering company that connects diners with local restaurants. Diners who order through Grubhub's website or mobile apps—for iOS and Android devices—can pay with cash, credit or PayPal. Seamless is an online and mobile food ordering platform that connects diners with local restaurants. It serves consumer diners as well as corporate businesses in the U.S. and London.[citation needed]
MenuPages was acquired by Seamless in September 2011.[10] Allmenus was acquired by Grubhub in September 2011.[11] DiningIn, an online ordering and food delivery company based in Brighton, Massachusetts, was acquired by Grubhub in February 2015. DiningIn operates in Boston, Chicago, Dallas, Philadelphia, and the Twin Cities.[12] Restaurants on the Run, a corporate food delivery company based in Aliso Viejo, California, was acquired by Grubhub in February 2015, operating in Orange County, San Diego, Inland Empire, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Las Vegas, Seattle, Houston, Tulsa & Chicago.[13]
In December 2015, Grubhub acquired Delivered Dish, a restaurant delivery service in seven markets across the Pacific Northwest and Southwest, including Denver, Las Vegas, San Diego, Portland, El Paso and Albuquerque.[14] LAbite, one of the largest restaurant delivery services in the U.S., was acquired by Grubhub in May 2016. Most of LAbite's volume comes from the Greater Los Angeles area.[citation needed]
History[edit]
Grubhub history[edit]
Chicago-based Grubhub was founded in 2004 by Mike Evans and Matt Maloney, looking for an alternative to paper menus.[15] Two years later, in 2006, Maloney and Evans won first place in the University of Chicago Booth School of Business's Edward L. Kaplan New Venture Challenge with the business plan for Grubhub.[16]
In November 2007, Grubhub secured $1.1 million in Series A funding (led by Amicus Capital and Origin Ventures), which enabled market expansion into San Francisco and New York.[17]
In March 2009, Grubhub earned $2 million in Series B funding, led by Origin Ventures and Leo Capital,[18] which was followed by $11 million in Series C funding, led by Benchmark Capital in November 2010.[19] $20 million in Series D funding was raised (led by DAG Ventures) in March 2011.[20]
In September 2011, Grubhub secured $50 million in Series E funding and acquired New York-based competitor Dotmenu, the parent company of Allmenus and Campusfood.[21] In December 2015, Grubhub acquired Delivered Dish, a restaurant delivery service in seven markets across the Pacific Northwest and Southwest, including Denver, Las Vegas, San Diego, Portland, El Paso and Albuquerque.[22] LAbite, a Los Angeles-based restaurant delivery service, was acquired by Grubhub in May 2016.[23]
Seamless history[edit]
In 1999, New York lawyer Jason Finger founded SeamlessWeb to provide companies with a web-based system for ordering food from restaurants and caterers. Six years later, in 2005, SeamlessWeb introduced a free ordering service to consumer diners to complement the existing corporate-ordering service.[24] In April 2006, SeamlessWeb was acquired by Aramark and integrated into its Food, Hospitalities, and Facilities segment.[25]
Jonathan Zabusky was named President of Seamless in 2009, and by June 2011, Seamless was re-privatized, as Boston-based Spectrum Equity Associates invested $50 million for a minority stake in the company from Aramark. The company then changed its name from SeamlessWeb to Seamless.[26]
In September 2011, Seamless acquired MenuPages,[27] and in February 2012, Seamless introduced the industry's first iPad app.[28]
Grubhub and Seamless merger[edit]
In May 2013, Grubhub and Seamless announced that they were merging, with Seamless representing 58% of the equity and GrubHub representing 42% of the equity of the combined business; the merger was finalized in early August 2013.[29]
IPO[edit]
Grubhub went public in April 2014 and trades on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) under the ticker symbol "GRUB".[30]
Delivery[edit]
In June 2014, Grubhub began offering delivery to restaurants that don't operate their own delivery service. The company is now delivering in more than 50 markets across the U.S.[31] (publicly announced markets include Atlanta, Phoenix, Philadelphia, Los Angeles, San Francisco/Bay Area, D.C., Southeast Florida, Portland, Denver, Pittsburgh, Detroit, San Diego, Brooklyn/Queens (NYC), Chicago and Las Vegas). More than 5,000 restaurants are now using Grubhub delivery.[citation needed]
Grubhub's UK competitors are Deliveroo, Just Eat, and Hungryhouse. In the US, its competitors include Yelp, Eat24, Instacart, and Uber[32]
Controversy[edit]
On November 10, 2016, after the victory of President-elect Donald Trump in the general election, Grubhub President and CEO Matt Maloney, sent a company-wide memo to employees saying that he rejected "nationalist, anti-immigrant and hateful politics of Donald Trump". The Washington Times reported that Maloney "unleashed a political screed after the Nov. 8 election and said that those who disagree with its [the majority of the company personnel's] anti-Trump views should resign."[33][34]
After a Twitter boycott campaign was initiated, Maloney later claimed his words were "misconstrued", adding "I want to clarify that I did not ask for anyone to resign if they voted for Trump. I would never make such a demand. To the contrary, the message of the email is that we do not tolerate discriminatory activity or hateful commentary in the workplace, and that we will stand up for our employees."[33] In a tweet that was later deleted, Maloney added: "To be clear, Grubhub does not tolerate hate and we are proud of all our employees - even those who voted for Trump."[34] By Thursday night, the hashtag #BoycottGrubHub was trending on Twitter.[35]
On November 11, 2016, after the controversy, the company's shares dropped 5.93%.[36][35]
Scheduled Stock Selloffs by Executives[edit]
CEO Matt Maloney, in addition to other Grubhub Inc. executives, sells shares on a schedule throughout the year.
On October 24, 2016, Matt Maloney (the company's President/CEO) sold 14,491 shares of the stock at an average price of $43.55, for a total value of $631,083.05.[37][38]
On November 7, Maloney sold 14,491 shares of the company's stock at a price of $37.80, for a total transaction of $547,759.80 in personal profit.[39] Following the sales, Maloney now directly owns 1,649 shares of the company stock, valued at approximately $62,332.20. The transaction was disclosed in a filing with the Securities & Exchange Commission.[39]
On December 21, 2016, Maloney sold 14,491 shares at $37.46 per share price, according to the Form-4 filing with the securities and exchange commission.[40]

In September 2011, Seamless acquired MenuPages,[27] and in February 2012, Seamless introduced the industry's first iPad app.[28]
Grubhub and Seamless merger[edit]
In May 2013, Grubhub and Seamless announced that they were merging, with Seamless representing 58% of the equity and GrubHub representing 42% of the equity of the combined business; the merger was finalized in early August 2013.[29]
IPO[edit]
Grubhub went public in April 2014 and trades on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) under the ticker symbol "GRUB".[30]
Delivery[edit]
In June 2014, Grubhub began offering delivery to restaurants that don't operate their own delivery service. The company is now delivering in more than 50 markets across the U.S.[31] (publicly announced markets include Atlanta, Phoenix, Philadelphia, Los Angeles, San Francisco/Bay Area, D.C., Southeast Florida, Portland, Denver, Pittsburgh, Detroit, San Diego, Brooklyn/Queens (NYC), Chicago and Las Vegas). More than 5,000 restaurants are now using Grubhub delivery.[citation needed]
Grubhub's UK competitors are Deliveroo, Just Eat, and Hungryhouse. In the US, its competitors include Yelp, Eat24, Instacart, and Uber[32]
Controversy[edit]
On November 10, 2016, after the victory of President-elect Donald Trump in the general election, Grubhub President and CEO Matt Maloney, sent a company-wide memo to employees saying that he rejected "nationalist, anti-immigrant and hateful politics of Donald Trump". The Washington Times reported that Maloney "unleashed a political screed after the Nov. 8 election and said that those who disagree with its [the majority of the company personnel's] anti-Trump views should resign."[33][34]
After a Twitter boycott campaign was initiated, Maloney later claimed his words were "misconstrued", adding "I want to clarify that I did not ask for anyone to resign if they voted for Trump. I would never make such a demand. To the contrary, the message of the email is that we do not tolerate discriminatory activity or hateful commentary in the workplace, and that we will stand up for our employees."[33] In a tweet that was later deleted, Maloney added: "To be clear, Grubhub does not tolerate hate and we are proud of all our employees - even those who voted for Trump."[34] By Thursday night, the hashtag #BoycottGrubHub was trending on Twitter.[35]
On November 11, 2016, after the controversy, the company's shares dropped 5.93%.[36][35]
Scheduled Stock Selloffs by Executives[edit]
CEO Matt Maloney, in addition to other Grubhub Inc. executives, sells shares on a schedule throughout the year.
On October 24, 2016, Matt Maloney (the company's President/CEO) sold 14,491 shares of the stock at an average price of $43.55, for a total value of $631,083.05.[37][38]
On November 7, Maloney sold 14,491 shares of the company's stock at a price of $37.80, for a total transaction of $547,759.80 in personal profit.[39] Following the sales, Maloney now directly owns 1,649 shares of the company stock, valued at approximately $62,332.20. The transaction was disclosed in a filing with the Securities & Exchange Commission.[39]
On December 21, 2016, Maloney sold 14,491 shares at $37.46 per share price, according to the Form-4 filing with the securities and exchange commission.[40]

Chicago-based Grubhub was founded in 2004 by Mike Evans and Matt Maloney, looking for an alternative to paper menus.[15] Two years later, in 2006, Maloney and Evans won first place in the University of Chicago Booth School of Business's Edward L.

I would never make such a demand. To the contrary, the message of the email is that we do not tolerate discriminatory activity or hateful commentary in the workplace, and that we will stand up for our employees."[33] In a tweet that was later deleted, Maloney added: "To be clear, Grubhub does not tolerate hate and we are proud of all our employees - even those who voted for Trump."[34] By Thursday night, the hashtag #BoycottGrubHub was trending on Twitter.[35]

In 1999, Seamless was founded by two lawyers, Jason Finger and an associate, fed up with out-of-date paper menus.[4] In 2004, Grubhub was founded by Matthew Maloney and Michael Evans, two web developers looking for an alternative to paper menus.[5]
In 2013, Grubhub and Seamless merged.[6] The combined organization, Grubhub, went public in April 2014 and trades on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) under the ticker symbol "GRUB".[7]

As of Q1 2017, the company processes more than 324,600 orders/day and has 8.75 million active diners.[9]

Grubhub is an online and mobile food-ordering company that connects diners with local restaurants. Diners who order through Grubhub's website or mobile apps—for iOS and Android devices—can pay with cash, credit or PayPal. Seamless is an online and mobile food ordering platform that connects diners with local restaurants. It serves consumer diners as well as corporate businesses in the U.S. and London.[citation needed]
MenuPages was acquired by Seamless in September 2011.[10] Allmenus was acquired by Grubhub in September 2011.[11] DiningIn, an online ordering and food delivery company based in Brighton, Massachusetts, was acquired by Grubhub in February 2015.

In December 2015, Grubhub acquired Delivered Dish, a restaurant delivery service in seven markets across the Pacific Northwest and Southwest, including Denver, Las Vegas, San Diego, Portland, El Paso and Albuquerque.[14] LAbite, one of the largest restaurant delivery services in the U.S., was acquired by Grubhub in May 2016. Most of LAbite's volume comes from the Greater Los Angeles area.[citation needed]
History[edit]
Grubhub history[edit]
Chicago-based Grubhub was founded in 2004 by Mike Evans and Matt Maloney, looking for an alternative to paper menus.[15] Two years later, in 2006, Maloney and Evans won first place in the University of Chicago Booth School of Business's Edward L. Kaplan New Venture Challenge with the business plan for Grubhub.[16]
In November 2007, Grubhub secured $1.1 million in Series A funding (led by Amicus Capital and Origin Ventures), which enabled market expansion into San Francisco and New York.[17]
In March 2009, Grubhub earned $2 million in Series B funding, led by Origin Ventures and Leo Capital,[18] which was followed by $11 million in Series C funding, led by Benchmark Capital in November 2010.[19] $20 million in Series D funding was raised (led by DAG Ventures) in March 2011.[20]
In September 2011, Grubhub secured $50 million in Series E funding and acquired New York-based competitor Dotmenu, the parent company of Allmenus and Campusfood.[21] In December 2015, Grubhub acquired Delivered Dish, a restaurant delivery service in seven markets across the Pacific Northwest and Southwest, including Denver, Las Vegas, San Diego, Portland, El Paso and Albuquerque.[22] LAbite, a Los Angeles-based restaurant delivery service, was acquired by Grubhub in May 2016.[23]
Seamless history[edit]
In 1999, New York lawyer Jason Finger founded SeamlessWeb to provide companies with a web-based system for ordering food from restaurants and caterers. Six years later, in 2005, SeamlessWeb introduced a free ordering service to consumer diners to complement the existing corporate-ordering service.[24] In April 2006, SeamlessWeb was acquired by Aramark and integrated into its Food, Hospitalities, and Facilities segment.[25]
Jonathan Zabusky was named President of Seamless in 2009, and by June 2011, Seamless was re-privatized, as Boston-based Spectrum Equity Associates invested $50 million for a minority stake in the company from Aramark. The company then changed its name from SeamlessWeb to Seamless.[26]
In September 2011, Seamless acquired MenuPages,[27] and in February 2012, Seamless introduced the industry's first iPad app.[28]
Grubhub and Seamless merger[edit]
In May 2013, Grubhub and Seamless announced that they were merging, with Seamless representing 58% of the equity and GrubHub representing 42% of the equity of the combined business; the merger was finalized in early August 2013.[29]
IPO[edit]
Grubhub went public in April 2014 and trades on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) under the ticker symbol "GRUB".[30]
Delivery[edit]
In June 2014, Grubhub began offering delivery to restaurants that don't operate their own delivery service. The company is now delivering in more than 50 markets across the U.S.[31] (publicly announced markets include Atlanta, Phoenix, Philadelphia, Los Angeles, San Francisco/Bay Area, D.C., Southeast Florida, Portland, Denver, Pittsburgh, Detroit, San Diego, Brooklyn/Queens (NYC), Chicago and Las Vegas). More than 5,000 restaurants are now using Grubhub delivery.[citation needed]
Grubhub's UK competitors are Deliveroo, Just Eat, and Hungryhouse. In the US, its competitors include Yelp, Eat24, Instacart, and Uber[32]
Controversy[edit]
On November 10, 2016, after the victory of President-elect Donald Trump in the general election, Grubhub President and CEO Matt Maloney, sent a company-wide memo to employees saying that he rejected "nationalist, anti-immigrant and hateful politics of Donald Trump". The Washington Times reported that Maloney "unleashed a political screed after the Nov. 8 election and said that those who disagree with its [the majority of the company personnel's] anti-Trump views should resign."[33][34]
After a Twitter boycott campaign was initiated, Maloney later claimed his words were "misconstrued", adding "I want to clarify that I did not ask for anyone to resign if they voted for Trump. I would never make such a demand. To the contrary, the message of the email is that we do not tolerate discriminatory activity or hateful commentary in the workplace, and that we will stand up for our employees."[33] In a tweet that was later deleted, Maloney added: "To be clear, Grubhub does not tolerate hate and we are proud of all our employees - even those who voted for Trump."[34] By Thursday night, the hashtag #BoycottGrubHub was trending on Twitter.[35]
On November 11, 2016, after the controversy, the company's shares dropped 5.93%.[36][35]
Scheduled Stock Selloffs by Executives[edit]
CEO Matt Maloney, in addition to other Grubhub Inc. executives, sells shares on a schedule throughout the year.

On November 7, Maloney sold 14,491 shares of the company's stock at a price of $37.80, for a total transaction of $547,759.80 in personal profit.[39] Following the sales, Maloney now directly owns 1,649 shares of the company stock, valued at approximately $62,332.20. The transaction was disclosed in a filing with the Securities & Exchange Commission.[39]
On December 21, 2016, Maloney sold 14,491 shares at $37.46 per share price, according to the Form-4 filing with the securities and exchange commission.[40]

    A family practitioner is a doctor who specializes in caring for people of all ages, at all stages of life. Rather than focusing on the treatment of one disease or patient population, family practitioners are often the doctors that people see for their everyday ailments, like cold and flu or respiratory infections, and health screenings. When necessary, family practitioners will provide referrals for conditions that require the expertise of another specialist.


    The doctors may also provide physicals, inoculations, prenatal care, treat chronic diseases, like diabetes and asthma, and provide advice on disease prevention.
