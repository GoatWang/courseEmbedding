      (c) The class D-1 and class D-2 certificates may be exchanged for class 
      D certificates, and class D certificates may be exchanged for the class 
      D-1 and class D-2 certificates.
    

      Fitch does not rate the $44,708,765 class NR certificates.
    

      The certificates represent the beneficial ownership interest in the 
      trust, primary assets of which are 50 loans secured by 110 commercial 
      properties having an aggregate principal balance of approximately $1.02 
      billion as of the cut-off date. The loans were contributed to the trust 
      by JPMorgan Chase Bank, National Association, Barclays Bank PLC, 
      Starwood Mortgage Funding II LLC, and Redwood Commercial Mortgage 
      Corporation.
    

      Fitch reviewed a comprehensive sample of the transaction's collateral 
      including site inspections on 68.6% of the properties by balance, cash 
      flow analysis of 84.8%, and asset summary reviews on 84.8% of the pool.
    

      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    

      Fitch Leverage: The transaction has higher leverage than other recent 
      Fitch-rated fixed-rate multi-borrower transactions. The pool's Fitch 
      DSCR of 1.14x is lower than both the 2015 average of 1.18x and the 2014 
      average of 1.19x, while the pool's Fitch LTV of 109.5% is in line with 
      the 2015 average of 109.3% and higher than the 2014 average of 106.2%.
    

      Highly Concentrated Pool: The top 10 loans account for 58.9% of the 
      pool, which is well above the 2015 and 2014 averages of 49.3% and 50.5%, 
      respectively. Additionally, the loan concentration index (LCI) is 442, 
      which is above the 2015 and 2014 averages of 367 and 387, respectively.
    

      Property Concentration: The largest property type is office (36.4%), 
      followed by hotel (19.1%), and multifamily (14.7%). The pool's office 
      concentration is above the 2014 averages of 22.8% and the year to date 
      2015 averages of 23.2%, respectively. The pool's hotel concentration is 
      higher than the 2014 concentration of 14.2%, and the year to date 2015 
      average of 16.6%. Loans secured by hotels have a higher probability of 
      default in Fitch's multi-borrower CMBS model.
    

      Lower Percentage of Loans Below 1.0x Fitch DSCR: 19.0% of the pool falls 
      below a 1.0x Fitch DSCR. This is lower than recent transactions and 
      below the 2015 average of 23.3%. Additionally, the top 10 loans have a 
      WAVG stressed loss of 3.9%, well below the average loss for the pool.
    

      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    

      For this transaction, Fitch's net cash flow (NCF) was 6.2% below the 
      most recent year's net operating income (NOI; for properties for which a 
      full-year NOI was provided, excluding properties that were stabilizing 
      during this period). Unanticipated further declines in property-level 
      NCF could result in higher defaults and loss severities on defaulted 
      loans and in potential rating actions on the certificates.
    

      Fitch evaluated the sensitivity of the ratings assigned to JPMBB 2016-C1 
      certificates and found that the transaction displays average sensitivity 
      to further declines in NCF. In a scenario in which NCF declined a 
      further 20% from Fitch's NCF, a downgrade of the junior 'AAAsf' 
      certificates to 'A-sf' could result. In a more severe scenario, in which 
      NCF declined a further 30% from Fitch's NCF, a downgrade of the junior 
      'AAAsf' certificates to 'BBB-sf' could result. The presale report 
      includes a detailed explanation of additional stresses and sensitivities 
      on pages 12-13.
    

      DUE DILIGENCE USAGE
    

      Fitch was provided with third party due diligence information from Ernst 
      and Young LLP. The third-party due diligence information was provided on 
      Form ABS Due Diligence-15E and focused on a comparison and 
      re-computation of certain characteristics with respect to each of the 
      mortgage loans. Fitch considered this information in its analysis and 
      the findings did not have an impact on the analysis.

      D-1 and class D-2 certificates.
    

      The expected ratings are based on information provided by the issuer as 
      of Feb. 15, 2016. Fitch does not expect to rate the $44,708,765 class 
      NR. The certificates represent the beneficial ownership interest in the 
      trust, primary assets of which are 50 loans secured by 110 commercial 
      properties having an aggregate principal balance of approximately $1.02 
      billion as of the cutoff date. The loans were contributed to the trust 
      by JPMorgan Chase Bank, National Association, Barclays Bank PLC,

      Lower Percentage of Loans Below 1.0x Fitch DSCR: 19% of the pool falls 
      below a 1.0x Fitch DSCR. This is lower than recent transactions and 
      below the 2015 average of 23.3%. Additionally, the top 10 loans have a 
      WAVG stressed loss of 3.9%, well below the average loss for the pool.

      NCF could result in higher defaults and loss severities on defaulted

RATINGS RATIONALE




The Certificates are collateralized by 50 fixed-rate loans secured 
by 110 properties. The ratings are based on the collateral and 
the structure of the transaction.




Moody's CMBS ratings methodology combines both commercial real estate 
and structured finance analysis. Based on commercial real estate 
analysis, Moody's determines the credit quality of each mortgage 
loan and calculates an expected loss on a loan specific basis. 
Under structured finance, the credit enhancement for each certificate 
typically depends on the expected frequency, severity, and 
timing of future losses. Moody's also considers a range of qualitative 
issues as well as the transaction's structural and legal aspects.




The credit risk of loans is determined primarily by two factors: 
1) Moody's assessment of the probability of default, which is largely 
driven by each loan's DSCR, and 2) Moody's assessment of the severity 
of loss upon a default, which is largely driven by each loan's LTV 
ratio.




The Moody's Actual DSCR of 1.51X is higher than the 2007 
transactions averages of 1.31x, but lower than the CMBS 2.0 
Conduit transaction average of 1.62X. The Moody's 
Stressed DSCR of 0.91X is in-line with the 2007 Conduit 
transaction average of 0.92X but below the CMBS 2.0 Conduit 
transaction average of 1.03X.




The pooled Trust loan balance of $1,021,912,765 
represents a Moody's LTV ratio of 117.7%, which 
is both higher than the 2007 and CMBS 2.0 Conduit transaction averages 
of 110.6% and 105.2%, respectively. 
The Moody's Trust LTV of 117.7% is also higher than 
the average pools securitized during 2015 of 115.7%. 
The pool contains one pari passu loan, 5 Penn Plaza (7.6% 
of pool), structured with $40 million of mezzanine debt ($12 
million is allocated to this transaction). Including the additional 
debt, the Moody's LTV ratio rises to 118.1%.




Moody's also grades properties on a scale of 0 to 5 (best to worst) and 
considers those grades when assessing the likelihood of debt payment. 
The factors considered include property age, quality of construction, 
location, market, and tenancy. The weighted average 
Moody's Quality Grade for the pool is 2.35 which is in-line 
with the average grade of transactions rated in 2015. However, 
the pool's top 5 loans (37.7% of the pool balance) 
have a very strong weighted average property quality grade of 1.53. 
The five loans are of superior real estate quality, evidenced by 
assigned grades between 1.25 and 2.00. The total 
pool's weighted average property grade excluding the top 5 loans 
is 2.89, worse than the average grade for transactions rated 
in 2015.




In the case of five loans totaling $327.5 million (32.0% 
of the pool balance), one or more related companion loans is pari 
passu with the related mortgage loan. The five loans are 5 Penn 
Plaza ($78 million, 7.6% of the pool balance), 
32 Avenue of the Americas ($72.5 million, 7.1%), 
7700 Palmer ($70 million, 6.8%), Naples 
Grand Beach Resort ($70 million, 6.8%), 
and The 9 ($37 million, 3.6%).




Moody's also considers both loan level diversity and property level diversity 
when selecting a ratings approach. With respect to loan level diversity, 
the pool's loan level Herfindahl score of 22.6 is lower than 
the average of CMBS 2.0 Conduit deals at 27.




With respect to property level diversity, the pool's property 
level Herfindahl score is 25.6.




This deal a has super-senior Aaa (sf) class with 30% credit 
enhancement. Although the additional enhancement offered to the 
senior most certificate holders provides additional protection against 
pool loss, the super-senior structure is credit negative 
for the certificate that supports the super-senior class. 
If the support certificate were to take a loss, the loss would have 
the potential to be quite large on a percentage basis. Thin tranches 
need more subordination to reduce the probability of default in recognition 
that their loss-given default is higher. This adjustment 
helps keep expected loss in balance and consistent across deals. 
The transaction was structured with additional subordination at class 
A-S to mitigate the potential increased severity to class A-S.




The principal methodology used in these ratings was "Approach to Rating 
US and Canadian Conduit/ Fusion CMBS" published in December 2014. 
Please see the Ratings Methodologies page on www.moodys.com 
for a copy of this methodology.




Moody's review used the excel-based CMBS Conduit Model, which 
it uses for both conduit and fusion transactions. Credit enhancement 
levels for conduit loans are driven by property type, Moody's actual 
and stressed DSCR, and Moody's property quality grade (which reflects 
the capitalization rate Moody's uses to estimate Moody's value). 
Moody's fuses the conduit results with the results of its analysis of 
investment grade structured credit assessed loans and any conduit loan 
that represents 10% or greater of the current pool balance. 
Moody's analysis also used the excel-based CMBS IO calculator which 
references the following inputs to calculate the proposed IO rating based 
on the published methodology: original and current bond ratings 
and credit estimates; original and current bond balances grossed 
up for losses for all bonds the IO(s) reference(s) within the transaction; 
and IO type corresponding to an IO type as defined in the published methodology. 
Please see the Ratings Methodologies page on www.moodys.com 
for a copy of this methodology.




Moody's Parameter Sensitivities: If Moody's value of the collateral 
used in determining the initial rating were decreased by 5%, 
14.4%, and 22.9%, the model-indicated 
rating for the currently rated senior Aaa (sf) class would be Aaa (sf), 
Aa1 (sf), A1 (sf), respectively. Parameter Sensitivities 
are not intended to measure how the rating of the security might migrate 
over time; rather they are designed to provide a quantitative calculation 
of how the initial rating might change if key input parameters used in 
the initial rating process differed. The analysis assumes that 
the deal has not aged. Parameter Sensitivities only reflect the 
ratings impact of each scenario from a quantitative/model-indicated 
standpoint. Qualitative factors are also taken into consideration 
in the ratings process, so the actual ratings that would be assigned 
in each case could vary from the information presented in the Parameter 
Sensitivity analysis.




These ratings: (a) are based solely on information in the public 
domain and/or information communicated to Moody's by the issuer at the 
date it was prepared and such information has not been independently verified 
by Moody's; (b) must be construed solely as a statement of opinion 
and not a statement of fact or an offer, invitation, inducement 
or recommendation to purchase, sell or hold any securities or otherwise 
act in relation to the issuer or any other entity or in connection with 
any other matter. Moody's does not guarantee or make any representation 
or warranty as to the correctness of any information, rating or 
communication relating to the issuer. Moody's shall not be liable 
in contract, tort, statutory duty or otherwise to the issuer 
or any other third party for any loss, injury or cost caused to 
the issuer or any other third party, in whole or in part, 
including by any negligence (but excluding fraud, dishonesty and/or 
willful misconduct or any other type of liability that by law cannot be 
excluded) on the part of, or any contingency beyond the control 
of Moody's, or any of its employees or agents, including any 
losses arising from or in connection with the procurement, compilation, 
analysis, interpretation, communication, dissemination, 
or delivery of any information or rating relating to the issuer.




Factors that would lead to an upgrade or downgrade of the rating:




The performance expectations for a given variable indicate Moody's forward-looking 
view of the likely range of performance over the medium term. Performance 
that falls outside the given range may indicate that the collateral's 
credit quality is stronger or weaker than Moody's had previously anticipated. 
Factors that may cause an upgrade of the ratings include significant loan 
paydowns or amortization, an increase in the pool's share of defeasance 
or overall improved pool performance. Factors that may cause a 
downgrade of the ratings include a decline in the overall performance 
of the pool, loan concentration, increased expected losses 
from specially serviced and troubled loans or interest shortfalls.




REGULATORY DISCLOSURES




For further specification of Moody's key rating assumptions and sensitivity 
analysis, see the sections Methodology Assumptions and Sensitivity 
to Assumptions of the disclosure form.




Further information on the representations and warranties and enforcement 
mechanisms available to investors are available on http://www.moodys.com/viewresearchdoc.aspx?docid=PBS_SF428215.




The analysis includes an assessment of collateral characteristics and 
performance to determine the expected collateral loss or a range of expected 
collateral losses or cash flows to the rated instruments. As a 
second step, Moody's estimates expected collateral losses or cash 
flows using a quantitative tool that takes into account credit enhancement, 
loss allocation and other structural features, to derive the expected 
loss for each rated instrument.




Moody's quantitative analysis entails an evaluation of scenarios 
that stress factors contributing to sensitivity of ratings and take into 
account the likelihood of severe collateral losses or impaired cash flows. 
Moody's weights the impact on the rated instruments based on its 
assumptions of the likelihood of the events in such scenarios occurring.




For ratings issued on a program, series or category/class of debt, 
this announcement provides certain regulatory disclosures in relation 
to each rating of a subsequently issued bond or note of the same series 
or category/class of debt or pursuant to a program for which the ratings 
are derived exclusively from existing ratings in accordance with Moody's 
rating practices. For ratings issued on a support provider, 
this announcement provides certain regulatory disclosures in relation 
to the credit rating action on the support provider and in relation to 
each particular credit rating action for securities that derive their 
credit ratings from the support provider's credit rating. 
For provisional ratings, this announcement provides certain regulatory 
disclosures in relation to the provisional rating assigned, and 
in relation to a definitive rating that may be assigned subsequent to 
the final issuance of the debt, in each case where the transaction 
structure and terms have not changed prior to the assignment of the definitive 
rating in a manner that would have affected the rating. For further 
information please see the ratings tab on the issuer/entity page for the 
respective issuer on www.moodys.com.




For any affected securities or rated entities receiving direct credit 
support from the primary entity(ies) of this credit rating action, 
and whose ratings may change as a result of this credit rating action, 
the associated regulatory disclosures will be those of the guarantor entity. 
Exceptions to this approach exist for the following disclosures, 
if applicable to jurisdiction: Ancillary Services, Disclosure 
to rated entity, Disclosure from rated entity.




Regulatory disclosures contained in this press release apply to the credit 
rating and, if applicable, the related rating outlook or rating 
review.


Please see www.moodys.com for any updates on changes to 
the lead rating analyst and to the Moody's legal entity that has issued 
the rating.


Please see the ratings tab on the issuer/entity page on www.moodys.com 
for additional regulatory disclosures for each credit rating.

Moody’s Investors Service, Inc., a wholly-owned credit rating agency subsidiary of Moody’s Corporation (“MCO”), hereby discloses that most issuers of debt securities (including corporate and municipal bonds, debentures, notes and commercial paper) and preferred stock rated by Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. have, prior to assignment of any rating, agreed to pay to Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. for appraisal and rating services rendered by it fees ranging from $1,500 to approximately $2,500,000. MCO and MIS also maintain policies and procedures to address the independence of MIS’s ratings and rating processes. Information regarding certain affiliations that may exist between directors of MCO and rated entities, and between entities who hold ratings from MIS and have also publicly reported to the SEC an ownership interest in MCO of more than 5%, is posted annually at www.moodys.com under the heading “Investor Relations — Corporate Governance — Director and Shareholder Affiliation Policy.” Additional terms for Australia only: Any publication into Australia of this document is pursuant to the Australian Financial Services License of MOODY’S affiliate, Moody’s Investors Service Pty Limited ABN 61 003 399 657AFSL 336969 and/or Moody’s Analytics Australia Pty Ltd ABN 94 105 136 972 AFSL 383569 (as applicable).

By continuing to access this document from within Australia, you represent to MOODY’S that you are, or are accessing the document as a representative of, a “wholesale client” and that neither you nor the entity you represent will directly or indirectly disseminate this document or its contents to “retail clients” within the meaning of section 761G of the Corporations Act 2001. MOODY’S credit rating is an opinion as to the creditworthiness of a debt obligation of the issuer, not on the equity securities of the issuer or any form of security that is available to retail investors. It would be reckless and inappropriate for retail investors to use MOODY’S credit ratings or publications when making an investment decision.

(“MJKK”) is a wholly-owned credit rating agency subsidiary of Moody's Group Japan G.K., which is wholly-owned by Moody’s Overseas Holdings Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of MCO. Moody’s SF Japan K.K. (“MSFJ”) is a wholly-owned credit rating agency subsidiary of MJKK. MSFJ is not a Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organization (“NRSRO”). Therefore, credit ratings assigned by MSFJ are Non-NRSRO Credit Ratings. Non-NRSRO Credit Ratings are assigned by an entity that is not a NRSRO and, consequently, the rated obligation will not qualify for certain types of treatment under U.S. laws. MJKK and MSFJ are credit rating agencies registered with the Japan Financial Services Agency and their registration numbers are FSA Commissioner (Ratings) No. 2 and 3 respectively. MJKK or MSFJ (as applicable) hereby disclose that most issuers of debt securities (including corporate and municipal bonds, debentures, notes and commercial paper) and preferred stock rated by MJKK or MSFJ (as applicable) have, prior to assignment of any rating, agreed to pay to MJKK or MSFJ (as applicable) for appraisal and rating services rendered by it fees ranging from JPY200,000 to approximately JPY350,000,000. MJKK and MSFJ also maintain policies and procedures to address Japanese regulatory requirements.

Approximately $829 Million of Structured Securities Affected


New York, June 16, 2017 -- Moody's Investors Service (Moody's) has affirmed the ratings of nine classes 
in JPMBB Commercial Mortgage Securities Trust 2016-C1, Commercial 
Mortgage Pass-Through Certificates, Series 2016-C1 
as follows: 




Cl. A-1, Affirmed Aaa (sf); previously on Mar

Cl. X-A, Affirmed Aa1 (sf); previously on Mar

RATINGS RATIONALE




The ratings on the P&I classes were affirmed because the transaction's 
key metrics, including Moody's loan-to-value (LTV) 
ratio, Moody's stressed debt service coverage ratio (DSCR) and the 
transaction's Herfindahl Index (Herf), are within acceptable 
ranges.




The ratings on the IO class (X-A) was affirmed based on the credit 
quality of its referenced classes.




Moody's rating action reflects a base expected loss of 5.4%. 
Moody's provides a current list of base expected losses for conduit 
and fusion CMBS transactions on moodys.com at http://www.moodys.com/viewresearchdoc.aspx?docid=PBS_SF215255. 





FACTORS THAT WOULD LEAD TO AN UPGRADE OR DOWNGRADE OF THE RATINGS:




The performance expectations for a given variable indicate Moody's forward-looking 
view of the likely range of performance over the medium term. Performance 
that falls outside the given range can indicate that the collateral's 
credit quality is stronger or weaker than Moody's had previously expected.




Factors that could lead to an upgrade of the ratings include a significant 
amount of loan paydowns or amortization, an increase in the pool's 
share of defeasance or an improvement in pool performance.




Factors that could lead to a downgrade of the ratings include a decline 
in the performance of the pool, loan concentration, an increase 
in realized and expected losses from specially serviced and troubled loans 
or interest shortfalls.




METHODOLOGY UNDERLYING THE RATING ACTION




The principal methodology used in these ratings was "Approach to Rating 
US and Canadian Conduit/Fusion CMBS" published in December 2014. 
Please see the Rating Methodologies page on www.moodys.com 
for a copy of this methodology.




Additionally, the methodology used in rating Cl. X-A 
was "Moody's Approach to Rating Structured Finance Interest-Only 
(IO) Securities" published in June 2017. Please see the Rating 
Methodologies page on www.moodys.com for a copy of this 
methodology.




DEAL PERFORMANCE




As of the May 17, 2017 distribution date, the transaction's 
aggregate certificate balance has decreased by less than 1% since 
securitization, to $1.02 billion. The certificates 
are collateralized by 50 mortgage loans ranging in size from less than 
1% to 9% of the pool, with the top ten loans constituting 
59% of the pool. The pool contains no loans with investment-grade 
structured credit assessments and no defeased loans.




Moody's uses a variation of Herf to measure the diversity of loan 
sizes, where a higher number represents greater diversity. 
Loan concentration has an important bearing on potential rating volatility, 
including the risk of multiple notch downgrades under adverse circumstances. 
The credit neutral Herf score is 40. The pool has a Herf of 23, 
unchanged from at securitization.




One loan, constituting less than 1% of the pool, is 
on the master servicer's watchlist. The watchlist includes 
loans that meet certain portfolio review guidelines established as part 
of the CRE Finance Council (CREFC) monthly reporting package. As 
part of Moody's ongoing monitoring of a transaction, the agency 
reviews the watchlist to assess which loans have material issues that 
could affect performance.




Moody's received full year 2016 operating results for 88% of the 
pool. Moody's weighted average conduit LTV is 117%, 
compared to 118% at Moody's last review. Moody's 
conduit component excludes loans with structured credit assessments, 
defeased and CTL loans, and specially serviced and troubled loans. 
Moody's net cash flow (NCF) reflects a weighted average haircut 
of 12.6% to the most recently available net operating income 
(NOI). Moody's value reflects a weighted average capitalization 
rate of 9.9%.




Moody's actual and stressed conduit DSCRs are 1.52X and 0.92X, 
respectively, compared to 1.51X and 0.91X at securitization. 
Moody's actual DSCR is based on Moody's NCF and the loan's 
actual debt service. Moody's stressed DSCR is based on Moody's 
NCF and a 9.25% stress rate the agency applied to the loan 
balance.




The top three performing conduit loans represent 24% of the pool 
balance. The largest loan is the 215 Park Avenue South Loan ($95 
million -- 9% of the pool), which is secured by a 324,000 
square foot, Class B office property located in Manhattan's 
Union Square neighborhood. The property benefits from a diverse 
rent roll, with the largest tenant occupying approximately 10% 
of the property's net rentable area (NRA). The property was 
82% leased as of December 2016. The loan is interest only 
for the full term. Moody's LTV and stressed DSCR are 89% 
and 1.06X, respectively, unchanged from at securitization.




The second largest loan is the 5 Penn Plaza Loan ($78 million -- 
8% of the pool). The loan represents a pari passu loan component 
of a $260 million senior mortgage loan secured by a 26-story, 
Class A office property in Midtown Manhattan. The property was 
90% occupied as of December 2016. The property is also encumbered 
by mezzanine debt held outside the trust. The loan is interest 
only for the full term. Moody's LTV and stressed DSCR are 115% 
and 0.82X, respectively, unchanged from at securitization.




The third largest loan is the 32 Avenue of the Americas Loan ($73 
million -- 7% of the pool). The loan represents a pari 
passu loan component of a $425 million mortgage loan. The 
loan is secured by a nearly 1.2 million square foot property located 
in Lower Manhattan. The property consists of a mix of telecom, 
switching, data center, and traditional office spaces with 
traditional office space accounting for approximately 51% of the 
property's NRA. The property was 98% leased as of 
March 2017. The loan is interest only for the full term. 
Moody's LTV and stressed DSCR are 105% and 0.92X, 
respectively, unchanged from at securitization.




REGULATORY DISCLOSURES




For further specification of Moody's key rating assumptions and sensitivity 
analysis, see the sections Methodology Assumptions and Sensitivity 
to Assumptions of the disclosure form.




The analysis includes an assessment of collateral characteristics and 
performance to determine the expected collateral loss or a range of expected 
collateral losses or cash flows to the rated instruments. As a 
second step, Moody's estimates expected collateral losses or cash 
flows using a quantitative tool that takes into account credit enhancement, 
loss allocation and other structural features, to derive the expected 
loss for each rated instrument.




Moody's did not use any stress scenario simulations in its analysis.




For ratings issued on a program, series or category/class of debt, 
this announcement provides certain regulatory disclosures in relation 
to each rating of a subsequently issued bond or note of the same series 
or category/class of debt or pursuant to a program for which the ratings 
are derived exclusively from existing ratings in accordance with Moody's 
rating practices. For ratings issued on a support provider, 
this announcement provides certain regulatory disclosures in relation 
to the credit rating action on the support provider and in relation to 
each particular credit rating action for securities that derive their 
credit ratings from the support provider's credit rating. 
For provisional ratings, this announcement provides certain regulatory 
disclosures in relation to the provisional rating assigned, and 
in relation to a definitive rating that may be assigned subsequent to 
the final issuance of the debt, in each case where the transaction 
structure and terms have not changed prior to the assignment of the definitive 
rating in a manner that would have affected the rating. For further 
information please see the ratings tab on the issuer/entity page for the 
respective issuer on www.moodys.com.




For any affected securities or rated entities receiving direct credit 
support from the primary entity(ies) of this credit rating action, 
and whose ratings may change as a result of this credit rating action, 
the associated regulatory disclosures will be those of the guarantor entity. 
Exceptions to this approach exist for the following disclosures, 
if applicable to jurisdiction: Ancillary Services, Disclosure 
to rated entity, Disclosure from rated entity.




Regulatory disclosures contained in this press release apply to the credit 
rating and, if applicable, the related rating outlook or rating 
review.


Please see www.moodys.com for any updates on changes to 
the lead rating analyst and to the Moody's legal entity that has issued 
the rating.


Please see the ratings tab on the issuer/entity page on www.moodys.com 
for additional regulatory disclosures for each credit rating.

To the extent permitted by law, MOODY’S and its directors, officers, employees, agents, representatives, licensors and suppliers disclaim liability for any direct or compensatory losses or damages caused to any person or entity, including but not limited to by any negligence (but excluding fraud, willful misconduct or any other type of liability that, for the avoidance of doubt, by law cannot be excluded) on the part of, or any contingency within or beyond the control of, MOODY’S or any of its directors, officers, employees, agents, representatives, licensors or suppliers, arising from or in connection with the information contained herein or the use of or inability to use any such information. NO WARRANTY, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, AS TO THE ACCURACY, TIMELINESS, COMPLETENESS, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PARTICULAR PURPOSE OF ANY SUCH RATING OR OTHER OPINION OR INFORMATION IS GIVEN OR MADE BY MOODY’S IN ANY FORM OR MANNER WHATSOEVER. Moody’s Investors Service, Inc., a wholly-owned credit rating agency subsidiary of Moody’s Corporation (“MCO”), hereby discloses that most issuers of debt securities (including corporate and municipal bonds, debentures, notes and commercial paper) and preferred stock rated by Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. have, prior to assignment of any rating, agreed to pay to Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. for appraisal and rating services rendered by it fees ranging from $1,500 to approximately $2,500,000. MCO and MIS also maintain policies and procedures to address the independence of MIS’s ratings and rating processes. Information regarding certain affiliations that may exist between directors of MCO and rated entities, and between entities who hold ratings from MIS and have also publicly reported to the SEC an ownership interest in MCO of more than 5%, is posted annually at www.moodys.com under the heading “Investor Relations — Corporate Governance — Director and Shareholder Affiliation Policy.” Additional terms for Australia only: Any publication into Australia of this document is pursuant to the Australian Financial Services License of MOODY’S affiliate, Moody’s Investors Service Pty Limited ABN 61 003 399 657AFSL 336969 and/or Moody’s Analytics Australia Pty Ltd ABN 94 105 136 972 AFSL 383569 (as applicable). This document is intended to be provided only to “wholesale clients” within the meaning of section 761G of the Corporations Act 2001. By continuing to access this document from within Australia, you represent to MOODY’S that you are, or are accessing the document as a representative of, a “wholesale client” and that neither you nor the entity you represent will directly or indirectly disseminate this document or its contents to “retail clients” within the meaning of section 761G of the Corporations Act 2001. MOODY’S credit rating is an opinion as to the creditworthiness of a debt obligation of the issuer, not on the equity securities of the issuer or any form of security that is available to retail investors. It would be reckless and inappropriate for retail investors to use MOODY’S credit ratings or publications when making an investment decision. If in doubt you should contact your financial or other professional adviser. Additional terms for Japan only: Moody's Japan K.K. (“MJKK”) is a wholly-owned credit rating agency subsidiary of Moody's Group Japan G.K., which is wholly-owned by Moody’s Overseas Holdings Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of MCO. Moody’s SF Japan K.K. (“MSFJ”) is a wholly-owned credit rating agency subsidiary of MJKK. MSFJ is not a Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organization (“NRSRO”). Therefore, credit ratings assigned by MSFJ are Non-NRSRO Credit Ratings. Non-NRSRO Credit Ratings are assigned by an entity that is not a NRSRO and, consequently, the rated obligation will not qualify for certain types of treatment under U.S. laws. MJKK and MSFJ are credit rating agencies registered with the Japan Financial Services Agency and their registration numbers are FSA Commissioner (Ratings) No. 2 and 3 respectively. MJKK or MSFJ (as applicable) hereby disclose that most issuers of debt securities (including corporate and municipal bonds, debentures, notes and commercial paper) and preferred stock rated by MJKK or MSFJ (as applicable) have, prior to assignment of any rating, agreed to pay to MJKK or MSFJ (as applicable) for appraisal and rating services rendered by it fees ranging from JPY200,000 to approximately JPY350,000,000. MJKK and MSFJ also maintain policies and procedures to address Japanese regulatory requirements.

                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

                    Global Credit Research - 09 Jun 2017
                









New York, June 09, 2017 -- Moody's Investors Service ("Moody's") has upgraded the 
ratings on eight interest-only (IO) classes from seven US and Canadian 
commercial mortgage-backed securitizations (CMBS) deals, 
downgraded the ratings on 243 IO classes from 236 CMBS deals and withdrawn 
51 interest-only classes from 51 CMBS deals issued by multiple 
issuers. As further described below, the rating actions result 
from the adoption of an updated approach to the rating of structured finance 
interest-only (IO) securities.

RATINGS RATIONALE




Please click on this link http://www.moodys.com/viewresearchdoc.aspx?docid=PBS_SF453781 
for the List of Affected Credit Ratings. This list is an integral 
part of this Press Release and provides, for each of the credit 
ratings covered, Moody's disclosures on the following items:




-Principal Methodologies 




The upgrades of eight CMBS IO classes and the downgrades of 243 CMBS IO 
classes follow the publication of "Moody's Approach to Rating 
Structured Finance Interest-Only (IO) Securities" published 
on 8 June 2017 (the "updated IO Methodology") and reflect 
the rating impact of our updated approach incorporating performance information 
as of the May 2017 remittance dates.




The updated methodology modifies Moody's approach to rating IO securities 
referencing multiple bonds and single or multiple collateral pools with 
realized losses. References made to the exclusion of certain IO 
securities in the previous methodology were removed. In addition, 
a description was added to explain when an IO bond is viewed as having 
effectively matured and results in the withdrawal of the rating.




The updated methodology explains that Moody's will limit the rating 
of an IO security to no more than five notches above the rating of the 
lowest credit quality reference bond or the rating that would be assigned 
based on an assessment of the default probability of the reference pool(s), 
as applicable, and clarifies that the collateral pool's default 
probability typically will be treated as equivalent to Ca(sf) if a loss 
is expected on the pool. The methodology also explains how Moody's 
10-year Idealised Cumulative Loss Rates table will be used to determine 
the rating of IOs referencing multiple bonds and IOs backed by single 
or multiple pools, as well as how the table is used when the loss 
falls between two rating categories.




This press release is not intended to provide a summary of the methodology. 
For a full explanation of the methodology, please consult the updated 
report, now available on www.moodys.com and accessible 
at: https://www.moodys.com/research/Moodys-updates-its-approach-for-rating-structured-finance-interest-only--PR_367970




Ratings on 51 of the interest-only classes from 51 deals were withdrawn 
due to the excess spread due on the IO bond being reduced to zero and 
are treated as having effectively matured.




The upgrades of eight CMBS IO classes were due to the modification of 
Moody's approach to rating IO securities referencing multiple bonds (including 
WAC IOs) to the weighted average of the current credit quality of all 
referenced bonds based on current balances (grossed up for realized losses), 
subject to the constraint of no more than five notches above the lowest 
credit quality referenced bond.




The downgrades on 243 CMBS IO classes were due to (i) the rating limit 
of an IO security to no more than five notches above the lowest credit 
quality referenced bond, (ii) the use of Moody's 10-year 
Idealised Cumulative Loss Rates table to determine the rating of IOs referencing 
multiple bonds and the mapping to the next lower category when the loss 
falls between two rating categories and (iii) principal paydowns of higher 
quality reference classes as of the May 2017 remittance statements.




FACTORS THAT WOULD LEAD TO AN UPGRADE OR DOWNGRADE OF THE RATINGS:




An IO class may be subject to ratings upgrades if there is an improvement 
in the credit quality of its referenced classes, subject to the 
limits and provisions of the updated IO methodology.




An IO class may be subject to ratings downgrades if there is (i) a decline 
in the credit quality of the reference classes and/or (ii) paydowns of 
higher quality reference classes, subject to the limits and provisions 
of the updated IO methodology.




REGULATORY DISCLOSURES




For further specification of Moody's key rating assumptions and sensitivity 
analysis, see the sections Methodology Assumptions and Sensitivity 
to Assumptions of the disclosure form.




The analysis includes an assessment of collateral characteristics and 
performance to determine the expected collateral loss or a range of expected 
collateral losses or cash flows to the rated instruments. As a 
second step, Moody's estimates expected collateral losses or cash 
flows using a quantitative tool that takes into account credit enhancement, 
loss allocation and other structural features, to derive the expected 
loss for each rated instrument.




Moody's did not use any stress scenario simulations in its analysis.




For ratings issued on a program, series or category/class of debt, 
this announcement provides certain regulatory disclosures in relation 
to each rating of a subsequently issued bond or note of the same series 
or category/class of debt or pursuant to a program for which the ratings 
are derived exclusively from existing ratings in accordance with Moody's 
rating practices. For ratings issued on a support provider, 
this announcement provides certain regulatory disclosures in relation 
to the credit rating action on the support provider and in relation to 
each particular credit rating action for securities that derive their 
credit ratings from the support provider's credit rating. 
For provisional ratings, this announcement provides certain regulatory 
disclosures in relation to the provisional rating assigned, and 
in relation to a definitive rating that may be assigned subsequent to 
the final issuance of the debt, in each case where the transaction 
structure and terms have not changed prior to the assignment of the definitive 
rating in a manner that would have affected the rating. For further 
information please see the ratings tab on the issuer/entity page for the 
respective issuer on www.moodys.com.




For any affected securities or rated entities receiving direct credit 
support from the primary entity(ies) of this credit rating action, 
and whose ratings may change as a result of this credit rating action, 
the associated regulatory disclosures will be those of the guarantor entity. 
Exceptions to this approach exist for the following disclosures, 
if applicable to jurisdiction: Ancillary Services, Disclosure 
to rated entity, Disclosure from rated entity.




Regulatory disclosures contained in this press release apply to the credit 
rating and, if applicable, the related rating outlook or rating 
review.

the rating.

ALL INFORMATION CONTAINED HEREIN IS PROTECTED BY LAW, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO, COPYRIGHT LAW, AND NONE OF SUCH INFORMATION MAY BE COPIED OR OTHERWISE REPRODUCED, REPACKAGED, FURTHER TRANSMITTED, TRANSFERRED, DISSEMINATED, REDISTRIBUTED OR RESOLD, OR STORED FOR SUBSEQUENT USE FOR ANY SUCH PURPOSE, IN WHOLE OR IN PART, IN ANY FORM OR MANNER OR BY ANY MEANS WHATSOEVER, BY ANY PERSON WITHOUT MOODY’S PRIOR WRITTEN CONSENT. All information contained herein is obtained by MOODY’S from sources believed by it to be accurate and reliable. Because of the possibility of human or mechanical error as well as other factors, however, all information contained herein is provided “AS IS” without warranty of any kind. MOODY'S adopts all necessary measures so that the information it uses in assigning a credit rating is of sufficient quality and from sources MOODY'S considers to be reliable including, when appropriate, independent third-party sources. However, MOODY’S is not an auditor and cannot in every instance independently verify or validate information received in the rating process or in preparing the Moody’s publications. To the extent permitted by law, MOODY’S and its directors, officers, employees, agents, representatives, licensors and suppliers disclaim liability to any person or entity for any indirect, special, consequential, or incidental losses or damages whatsoever arising from or in connection with the information contained herein or the use of or inability to use any such information, even if MOODY’S or any of its directors, officers, employees, agents, representatives, licensors or suppliers is advised in advance of the possibility of such losses or damages, including but not limited to: (a) any loss of present or prospective profits or (b) any loss or damage arising where the relevant financial instrument is not the subject of a particular credit rating assigned by MOODY’S. To the extent permitted by law, MOODY’S and its directors, officers, employees, agents, representatives, licensors and suppliers disclaim liability for any direct or compensatory losses or damages caused to any person or entity, including but not limited to by any negligence (but excluding fraud, willful misconduct or any other type of liability that, for the avoidance of doubt, by law cannot be excluded) on the part of, or any contingency within or beyond the control of, MOODY’S or any of its directors, officers, employees, agents, representatives, licensors or suppliers, arising from or in connection with the information contained herein or the use of or inability to use any such information. NO WARRANTY, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, AS TO THE ACCURACY, TIMELINESS, COMPLETENESS, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PARTICULAR PURPOSE OF ANY SUCH RATING OR OTHER OPINION OR INFORMATION IS GIVEN OR MADE BY MOODY’S IN ANY FORM OR MANNER WHATSOEVER. Moody’s Investors Service, Inc., a wholly-owned credit rating agency subsidiary of Moody’s Corporation (“MCO”), hereby discloses that most issuers of debt securities (including corporate and municipal bonds, debentures, notes and commercial paper) and preferred stock rated by Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. have, prior to assignment of any rating, agreed to pay to Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. for appraisal and rating services rendered by it fees ranging from $1,500 to approximately $2,500,000. MCO and MIS also maintain policies and procedures to address the independence of MIS’s ratings and rating processes. Information regarding certain affiliations that may exist between directors of MCO and rated entities, and between entities who hold ratings from MIS and have also publicly reported to the SEC an ownership interest in MCO of more than 5%, is posted annually at www.moodys.com under the heading “Investor Relations — Corporate Governance — Director and Shareholder Affiliation Policy.” Additional terms for Australia only: Any publication into Australia of this document is pursuant to the Australian Financial Services License of MOODY’S affiliate, Moody’s Investors Service Pty Limited ABN 61 003 399 657AFSL 336969 and/or Moody’s Analytics Australia Pty Ltd ABN 94 105 136 972 AFSL 383569 (as applicable). This document is intended to be provided only to “wholesale clients” within the meaning of section 761G of the Corporations Act 2001. By continuing to access this document from within Australia, you represent to MOODY’S that you are, or are accessing the document as a representative of, a “wholesale client” and that neither you nor the entity you represent will directly or indirectly disseminate this document or its contents to “retail clients” within the meaning of section 761G of the Corporations Act 2001. MOODY’S credit rating is an opinion as to the creditworthiness of a debt obligation of the issuer, not on the equity securities of the issuer or any form of security that is available to retail investors. It would be reckless and inappropriate for retail investors to use MOODY’S credit ratings or publications when making an investment decision. If in doubt you should contact your financial or other professional adviser. Additional terms for Japan only: Moody's Japan K.K. (“MJKK”) is a wholly-owned credit rating agency subsidiary of Moody's Group Japan G.K., which is wholly-owned by Moody’s Overseas Holdings Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of MCO. Moody’s SF Japan K.K. (“MSFJ”) is a wholly-owned credit rating agency subsidiary of MJKK. MSFJ is not a Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organization (“NRSRO”). Therefore, credit ratings assigned by MSFJ are Non-NRSRO Credit Ratings. Non-NRSRO Credit Ratings are assigned by an entity that is not a NRSRO and, consequently, the rated obligation will not qualify for certain types of treatment under U.S. laws. MJKK and MSFJ are credit rating agencies registered with the Japan Financial Services Agency and their registration numbers are FSA Commissioner (Ratings) No. 2 and 3 respectively. MJKK or MSFJ (as applicable) hereby disclose that most issuers of debt securities (including corporate and municipal bonds, debentures, notes and commercial paper) and preferred stock rated by MJKK or MSFJ (as applicable) have, prior to assignment of any rating, agreed to pay to MJKK or MSFJ (as applicable) for appraisal and rating services rendered by it fees ranging from JPY200,000 to approximately JPY350,000,000. MJKK and MSFJ also maintain policies and procedures to address Japanese regulatory requirements.

With respect
  to all mortgage loans, with the exceptions of the mortgage loans listed below, the Current LTV % and the Maturity LTV % are
  based on the “as-is” Appraised Value ($) even though, for certain mortgage loans, the appraiser provided “as-stabilized”
  values based on certain criteria being met.

  With respect to Loan No. 4, 7700 Parmer, the Appraised Value ($) represents the “hypothetical as-is value” of
  $272,250,000, which assumes that all outstanding tenant improvements, leasing commissions and rent abatements/free rent have
  been paid. At origination, the borrower was required to reserve $19,803,193 for outstanding tenant improvements and $3,780,811
  for outstanding rent abatements/free rent. The “as-is” value as of October 27, 2015 was $249,000,000, which results
  in a Current LTV % and Maturity LTV % of 71.1% and 71.1%, respectively.

  With respect to Loan No. 5, Naples Grande Beach Resort, the Appraised Value ($) represents the aggregate “as-is”
  value of the resort property  and the golf course and excludes the $1.75

  on a property-by-property basis. The portfolio value was appraised at $102,000,000, which is reflective of the value of the
  portfolio as a whole, if sold in its entirety to a single buyer. The aggregate value of the individual mortgaged properties
  totaled $92,545,000. The Current LTV % and the Maturity LTV % are based on the aggregate value of the individual mortgaged
  properties.  The Current LTV % and the Maturity LTV % based on the portfolio value are approximately 53.8% and 39.2%,
  respectively.

  With respect to Loan No. 9, The 9, there are no release provisions associated with the three components of the mortgaged property.
  Accordingly, there are no allocated loan amounts associated with the hotel/multifamily/parking components of the mortgaged
  property. If hypothetical allocated loan amounts were assigned based on each of the three components’ pro rata share
  of the total appraised value, the hypothetical allocated loan amounts for The Metropolitan at The 9 Hotel, Concierge Living
  at The 9 Apartments and Tower Parking Garage would be approximately $39.1 million, $26.4 million and $11.5 million, respectively.
  Based on these hypothetical allocated loan amounts, the Cut-off Date Loan / Unit for The Metropolitan at The 9 Hotel, Concierge
  Living at The 9 Apartments and Tower Parking Garage components would be $250,536 per hotel room, $253,956 per multifamily
  unit and $44 per square foot for the parking space, respectively, and the Maturity Date Loan / Unit would be approximately
  $216,205, $219,157 and $38, respectively, based on 156 hotel rooms, 104 multifamily rooms and 850 parking spaces.

  With respect to Loan No. 11, Aventura View, Current LTV % is calculated based on the principal balance of the mortgage loan
  as of the Cut-off Date less a $2,000,000 performance reserve which was escrowed with the lender at origination of the mortgage
  loan. See footnote 17 below, as well as Annex A-3 and “Description of the Mortgage Pool—Certain Terms of the
  Mortgage Loans—Prepayment Protections and Certain Involuntary Prepayments” in the Preliminary Prospectus for
  further details.

  With respect to Loan No. 13, Hilton Garden Inn Lake Oswego, the Appraised Value ($) represents the “hypothetical as-is
  value assuming completion of renovation” of $39,400,000, which assumes that the property improvement plan (“PIP”)
  outstanding at origination is complete. At origination, the borrower was required to reserve $3,703,456 for the PIP, which
  represents the full estimated remaining cost of the PIP. The “as-is” value as of October 13, 2015 was $34,200,000,
  which results in a Current LTV % and Maturity LTV % of 73.5% and 70.2%, respectively.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
