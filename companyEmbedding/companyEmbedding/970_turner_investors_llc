	Turner has contractually agreed to waive fees and reimburse Fund expenses to keep the Fund's "Total Annual Fund Operating Expense after Fee Waivers and Expense Reimbursements" of Investor Class Shares (excluding acquired fund fees and expenses and interest expenses relating to short sales) from exceeding 1.25%, respectively, through January 31, 2018. Only the Board of Trustees of the Turner Funds may terminate the waiver prior to January 31, 2018. Turner may discontinue this arrangement at any time after January 31, 2018. To the extent acquired fund fes and expense and interest expenses relating to short sales are excluded from the waiver and reimbursement calculation, "Total Annual Fund Operating Expense after Fee Waivers and Expense Reimbursements" will be higher.







*Formerly known as the Turner Spectrum Fund
The performance data quoted represents past performance and the principal value and investment return will fluctuate so that an investor's shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance shown here. Returns shown, unless otherwise indicated, are total returns, with dividends and income reinvested. Returns spanning more than one year are annualized. Fee waivers are in effect; if they had not been in effect performance would have been lower.
Past performance can vary over short periods. Past performance is no guarantee of future results.
Effective October 1, 2010, The Turner Funds are distributed by Foreside Fund Services, LLC, Portland, ME. The investor should consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses carefully before investing. This information can be found in the prospectus.
