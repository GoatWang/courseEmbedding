ORIX acquires Robeco

19 February 2013


ORIX Corporation (ORIX), Coöperatieve Centrale Raiffeisen-Boerenleenbank B.A., (Rabobank) and Robeco Groep N.V., (Robeco) announce that ORIX is acquiring approximately 90.01% of the equity in Robeco from Rabobank, for EUR 1,935 million (JPY 240.2 billion). Closing of the transaction is subject to legal and regulatory approvals, which are expected to be completed within six months.

Part of the agreement is a strategic alliance between Rabobank and ORIX. This includes Rabobank retaining a 9.99% share in Robeco, and continuing to cooperate in maintaining and expanding Robeco’s business platform. ORIX will allocate treasury stock to Rabobank as part of the acquisition price, and as a result Rabobank becomes a shareholder of ORIX. Also, ORIX and Rabobank have agreed that Robeco’s banking activities, which are only based in the Netherlands, will be transferred to Rabobank with Robeco retaining its client service relations.


The financial market has drastically changed since the financial crisis and ORIX believes that it is necessary to pursue a new business model by combining finance with related services in a strategy called "Finance + Services." As one of the measures to drive this strategy, ORIX has been seeking to build its presence in the global asset management industry in recent years, as evidenced by the 2010 purchase of Mariner Investment Group in the U.S.


Rabobank decided to sell Robeco to ORIX, on the basis that becoming part of ORIX Group will enhance Robeco’s future growth prospects. Robeco is ORIX’s most significant strategic acquisition to date and it will become ORIX’s primary platform for future growth ambitions in global markets. Robeco will continue to service customers under its existing brand names.


The rationale for ORIX’s acquisition of Robeco includes the strength of Robeco’s global brand, its diversified range of businesses across asset classes and regions, the breadth of its global distribution network and experienced investments teams. As a well-managed and relatively autonomous group of businesses with a good performance record, Robeco is the ideal vehicle for ORIX to pursue its ambitions in global asset management. Growth opportunities also exist in the pension and asset management markets in Asia and Middle East where ORIX has an established network.


ORIX is committed to support Robeco’s 2010-2014 strategy, its services to clients, its investment processes and teams, based on Robeco’s long term commitment to deliver value to clients. Robeco’s management board will remain in their current roles with Roderick Munsters continuing as CEO and reporting to ORIX headquarters in Tokyo. Robeco Group NV’s legal structure will remain unchanged, as will the current governance and reporting lines from Robeco’s subsidiaries. ORIX will also retain Robeco’s Supervisory Board structure including both independent members as well as representatives from ORIX.


Last year Robeco achieved record results, demonstrating the strength and resilience of the business, both in the Netherlands and internationally. Robeco’s assets under management increased by 26% to EUR 189 billion at the end of December (2011: EUR 150 billion). Net new cash was also at a record of EUR 18.4 billion. Net profit increased from EUR 134 million to EUR 197 million. Investment performance was also strong with 65% of Robeco’s assets outperforming their benchmarks.


Yoshihiko Miyauchi, CEO ORIX Group: "Robeco is a global company with an outstanding brand and excellent management, well-diversified in all aspects including asset management products, investor clientele, managed portfolio, and regional presence. The management team has displayed tremendous performance over the years and we are confident that they will continue to accomplish this going forward. ORIX will pursue further expansion in Europe and the U.S, as well as growth in Asia and Middle East regions where it has a strong platform."


For Piet Moerland, Chairman of the Executive Board of Rabobank Group, the sale of Robeco is the start of a new beginning. "Rabobank and Robeco have strengthened each other over the past decades by working closely together in serving their clients. This cooperation will remain. Robeco is a solid asset manager, with a track record of being innovative, for instance by introducing pension solutions. Robeco has now the opportunity to develop further under ORIX’s ownership."


Roderick Munsters, CEO Robeco Group: "Just like Robeco, ORIX Corporation is a client focused organization with an entrepreneurial culture. As part of ORIX Group, we will continue to serve our clients' best interests and achieve attractive investment returns.

History[edit]
1929 A group of prominent businessmen from Rotterdam founded the Rotterdamsch Beleggings Consortium (Rotterdam Investment Consortium) and the Robeco fund. The portfolio is diversified globally over the Netherlands, other European countries, North and South America, and the Dutch East Indies.[2] The company had a startup capital of almost 2 million guilders, but by mid-1932 less than half was left.[3] But the company managed to survive the 1930s and managed to grow during World War II by heavily investing in United States.
1940-1945 On the eve of WWII, almost half of the portfolio is invested in the US.[4] As a result, Robeco’s assets increase by almost 90% between 1939 and 1946.[5]
1953 Robeco introduces a share-saving system, allowing people of more modest means to save up for Robeco shares.[6]
1959 New listings in Paris (1959), Brussels (1960), London (1962) and numerous other European financial centers. Listings are also obtained in Hong Kong (1971) and Tokyo (1976).[7]
1963 Robeco is one of the first foreign investors to enter the Japanese stock market.[8]

2007 For the Belgian market, Robeco decides to focus on third-party distribution; Robeco Bank Belgium is sold to Kaupthing Bank Luxembourg.[22]
2012 Rabobank Group is looking into the "strategic options" for its subsidiary Robeco as part of a strategic reorientation.[23]
2013 In February Rabobank announced the sale of Robeco to ORIX Corporation of Japan. Orix will acquire about 90.01% of the equity in Robeco from Rabobank for €1,935 million (JPY 240.2 billion). Closing of the transaction is subject to legal and regulatory approvals, which are expected to be completed within six months.[24]

History[edit]
1929 A group of prominent businessmen from Rotterdam founded the Rotterdamsch Beleggings Consortium (Rotterdam Investment Consortium) and the Robeco fund. The portfolio is diversified globally over the Netherlands, other European countries, North and South America, and the Dutch East Indies.[2] The company had a startup capital of almost 2 million guilders, but by mid-1932 less than half was left.[3] But the company managed to survive the 1930s and managed to grow during World War II by heavily investing in United States.
1940-1945 On the eve of WWII, almost half of the portfolio is invested in the US.[4] As a result, Robeco’s assets increase by almost 90% between 1939 and 1946.[5]
1953 Robeco introduces a share-saving system, allowing people of more modest means to save up for Robeco shares.[6]
1959 New listings in Paris (1959), Brussels (1960), London (1962) and numerous other European financial centers. Listings are also obtained in Hong Kong (1971) and Tokyo (1976).[7]
1963 Robeco is one of the first foreign investors to enter the Japanese stock market.[8]
1965 Foundation of Rolinco, a second mutual fund, for investors more interested in capital growth than taxable dividend.[9]
1969 Robeco has become the largest mutual fund in Europe.[10]
1974 Foundation of Rorento, Robeco’s first bond fund, as an answer to the oil crisis in 1973.[11]
1980s Robeco opens offices in various European countries, including France, Luxembourg and Switzerland.[12]
1981 The company opens its own savings bank Roparco.[13]
1990s The company continued its international strategy in the 1990s by acquiring a number of US based firms.
1990 The company starts a close cooperation with the Rabobank, which would eventually lead to the takeover of Robeco by the Rabobank in 2001.[14]
1999 Introduction of Robeco DuurzaamAandelen [Sustainable Equities], the first sustainable equity fund launched by a Dutch mainstream asset manager.[15]
2000 Robeco North America acquires Urban Shopping Centers
2002 Robeco North America sells all of its Urban Shopping Center investments
2002 Robeco acquires a 60% interest in Boston Partners Asset Management, a value-equity manager based in Boston.[16] The remaining shares are acquired in 2003.[12]
2002 Robeco acquires a 49% interest in Transtrend, a Rotterdam-based managed-futures trader with a track record going back to 1990.[17] The remaining shares are acquired in 2007.[18]
2004 Introduction of Robeco Sustainable Private Equity, the first sustainable private-equity fund of funds in the world, developed in cooperation with Rabobank.[15]
2006 Introduction of Robeco Clean Tech Private Equity II, an investment program aimed at clean-tech private-equity funds and co-investments, developed in cooperation with Rabobank.[15]
2006 Robeco signs the United Nations’ Principles for Responsible Investment.[19]
2006 Robeco joins the Enhanced Analytics Initiative, a group of international asset owners and asset managers who work together to encourage investment research that considers the impact of extra-financial issues on long-term company performance.[20]
2006 Acquisition of a 64% stake in Swiss based Sustainable Asset Management. SAM Group and Robeco join forces to launch the global number-1 platform for sustainability investments.[21]
2007 For the Belgian market, Robeco decides to focus on third-party distribution; Robeco Bank Belgium is sold to Kaupthing Bank Luxembourg.[22]
2012 Rabobank Group is looking into the "strategic options" for its subsidiary Robeco as part of a strategic reorientation.[23]
2013 In February Rabobank announced the sale of Robeco to ORIX Corporation of Japan. Orix will acquire about 90.01% of the equity in Robeco from Rabobank for €1,935 million (JPY 240.2 billion). Closing of the transaction is subject to legal and regulatory approvals, which are expected to be completed within six months.[24]

History[edit]
1929 A group of prominent businessmen from Rotterdam founded the Rotterdamsch Beleggings Consortium (Rotterdam Investment Consortium) and the Robeco fund. The portfolio is diversified globally over the Netherlands, other European countries, North and South America, and the Dutch East Indies.[2] The company had a startup capital of almost 2 million guilders, but by mid-1932 less than half was left.[3] But the company managed to survive the 1930s and managed to grow during World War II by heavily investing in United States.
1940-1945 On the eve of WWII, almost half of the portfolio is invested in the US.[4] As a result, Robeco’s assets increase by almost 90% between 1939 and 1946.[5]
1953 Robeco introduces a share-saving system, allowing people of more modest means to save up for Robeco shares.[6]
1959 New listings in Paris (1959), Brussels (1960), London (1962) and numerous other European financial centers. Listings are also obtained in Hong Kong (1971) and Tokyo (1976).[7]
1963 Robeco is one of the first foreign investors to enter the Japanese stock market.[8]
1965 Foundation of Rolinco, a second mutual fund, for investors more interested in capital growth than taxable dividend.[9]
1969 Robeco has become the largest mutual fund in Europe.[10]
1974 Foundation of Rorento, Robeco’s first bond fund, as an answer to the oil crisis in 1973.[11]
1980s Robeco opens offices in various European countries, including France, Luxembourg and Switzerland.[12]
1981 The company opens its own savings bank Roparco.[13]
1990s The company continued its international strategy in the 1990s by acquiring a number of US based firms.
1990 The company starts a close cooperation with the Rabobank, which would eventually lead to the takeover of Robeco by the Rabobank in 2001.[14]
1999 Introduction of Robeco DuurzaamAandelen [Sustainable Equities], the first sustainable equity fund launched by a Dutch mainstream asset manager.[15]
2000 Robeco North America acquires Urban Shopping Centers
2002 Robeco North America sells all of its Urban Shopping Center investments
2002 Robeco acquires a 60% interest in Boston Partners Asset Management, a value-equity manager based in Boston.[16] The remaining shares are acquired in 2003.[12]
2002 Robeco acquires a 49% interest in Transtrend, a Rotterdam-based managed-futures trader with a track record going back to 1990.[17] The remaining shares are acquired in 2007.[18]
2004 Introduction of Robeco Sustainable Private Equity, the first sustainable private-equity fund of funds in the world, developed in cooperation with Rabobank.[15]
2006 Introduction of Robeco Clean Tech Private Equity II, an investment program aimed at clean-tech private-equity funds and co-investments, developed in cooperation with Rabobank.[15]
2006 Robeco signs the United Nations’ Principles for Responsible Investment.[19]
2006 Robeco joins the Enhanced Analytics Initiative, a group of international asset owners and asset managers who work together to encourage investment research that considers the impact of extra-financial issues on long-term company performance.[20]
2006 Acquisition of a 64% stake in Swiss based Sustainable Asset Management. SAM Group and Robeco join forces to launch the global number-1 platform for sustainability investments.[21]
2007 For the Belgian market, Robeco decides to focus on third-party distribution; Robeco Bank Belgium is sold to Kaupthing Bank Luxembourg.[22]
2012 Rabobank Group is looking into the "strategic options" for its subsidiary Robeco as part of a strategic reorientation.[23]
2013 In February Rabobank announced the sale of Robeco to ORIX Corporation of Japan. Orix will acquire about 90.01% of the equity in Robeco from Rabobank for €1,935 million (JPY 240.2 billion). Closing of the transaction is subject to legal and regulatory approvals, which are expected to be completed within six months.[24]

History[edit]
1929 A group of prominent businessmen from Rotterdam founded the Rotterdamsch Beleggings Consortium (Rotterdam Investment Consortium) and the Robeco fund. The portfolio is diversified globally over the Netherlands, other European countries, North and South America, and the Dutch East Indies.[2] The company had a startup capital of almost 2 million guilders, but by mid-1932 less than half was left.[3] But the company managed to survive the 1930s and managed to grow during World War II by heavily investing in United States.
1940-1945 On the eve of WWII, almost half of the portfolio is invested in the US.[4] As a result, Robeco’s assets increase by almost 90% between 1939 and 1946.[5]
1953 Robeco introduces a share-saving system, allowing people of more modest means to save up for Robeco shares.[6]
1959 New listings in Paris (1959), Brussels (1960), London (1962) and numerous other European financial centers. Listings are also obtained in Hong Kong (1971) and Tokyo (1976).[7]
1963 Robeco is one of the first foreign investors to enter the Japanese stock market.[8]

2002 Robeco acquires a 49% interest in Transtrend, a Rotterdam-based managed-futures trader with a track record going back to 1990.[17] The remaining shares are acquired in 2007.[18]
2004 Introduction of Robeco Sustainable Private Equity, the first sustainable private-equity fund of funds in the world, developed in cooperation with Rabobank.[15]

2006 Acquisition of a 64% stake in Swiss based Sustainable Asset Management. SAM Group and Robeco join forces to launch the global number-1 platform for sustainability investments.[21]
2007 For the Belgian market, Robeco decides to focus on third-party distribution; Robeco Bank Belgium is sold to Kaupthing Bank Luxembourg.[22]
2012 Rabobank Group is looking into the "strategic options" for its subsidiary Robeco as part of a strategic reorientation.[23]
2013 In February Rabobank announced the sale of Robeco to ORIX Corporation of Japan. Orix will acquire about 90.01% of the equity in Robeco from Rabobank for €1,935 million (JPY 240.2 billion).

History[edit]
1929 A group of prominent businessmen from Rotterdam founded the Rotterdamsch Beleggings Consortium (Rotterdam Investment Consortium) and the Robeco fund. The portfolio is diversified globally over the Netherlands, other European countries, North and South America, and the Dutch East Indies.[2] The company had a startup capital of almost 2 million guilders, but by mid-1932 less than half was left.[3] But the company managed to survive the 1930s and managed to grow during World War II by heavily investing in United States.
1940-1945 On the eve of WWII, almost half of the portfolio is invested in the US.[4] As a result, Robeco’s assets increase by almost 90% between 1939 and 1946.[5]
1953 Robeco introduces a share-saving system, allowing people of more modest means to save up for Robeco shares.[6]
1959 New listings in Paris (1959), Brussels (1960), London (1962) and numerous other European financial centers. Listings are also obtained in Hong Kong (1971) and Tokyo (1976).[7]
1963 Robeco is one of the first foreign investors to enter the Japanese stock market.[8]
1965 Foundation of Rolinco, a second mutual fund, for investors more interested in capital growth than taxable dividend.[9]

1990s The company continued its international strategy in the 1990s by acquiring a number of US based firms.
1990 The company starts a close cooperation with the Rabobank, which would eventually lead to the takeover of Robeco by the Rabobank in 2001.[14]

2002 Robeco acquires a 49% interest in Transtrend, a Rotterdam-based managed-futures trader with a track record going back to 1990.[17] The remaining shares are acquired in 2007.[18]
2004 Introduction of Robeco Sustainable Private Equity, the first sustainable private-equity fund of funds in the world, developed in cooperation with Rabobank.[15]
2006 Introduction of Robeco Clean Tech Private Equity II, an investment program aimed at clean-tech private-equity funds and co-investments, developed in cooperation with Rabobank.[15]
2006 Robeco signs the United Nations’ Principles for Responsible Investment.[19]
2006 Robeco joins the Enhanced Analytics Initiative, a group of international asset owners and asset managers who work together to encourage investment research that considers the impact of extra-financial issues on long-term company performance.[20]
2006 Acquisition of a 64% stake in Swiss based Sustainable Asset Management. SAM Group and Robeco join forces to launch the global number-1 platform for sustainability investments.[21]
2007 For the Belgian market, Robeco decides to focus on third-party distribution; Robeco Bank Belgium is sold to Kaupthing Bank Luxembourg.[22]
2012 Rabobank Group is looking into the "strategic options" for its subsidiary Robeco as part of a strategic reorientation.[23]
2013 In February Rabobank announced the sale of Robeco to ORIX Corporation of Japan. Orix will acquire about 90.01% of the equity in Robeco from Rabobank for €1,935 million (JPY 240.2 billion). Closing of the transaction is subject to legal and regulatory approvals, which are expected to be completed within six months.[24]

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
