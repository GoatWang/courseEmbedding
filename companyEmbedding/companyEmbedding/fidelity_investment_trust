			Whether selecting Fidelity Personal Trust Company, FSB, (FPTC)1 as your trustee or investment manager for assets held in a trust, you put to work a team of professionals who are committed to adding value to your trust.
		








 Help preserve wealth for future generations 
Consider using FPTC if you would like help transferring $200,000 or more to your family or other beneficiary through a trust; or, if you would like to potentially avoid probate—the legal process of distributing wealth after death—to maintain privacy and minimize estate-related costs.
If you decide to name FPTC as your trustee or co-trustee, we offer objectivity, continuity, and experience in trust administration. As part of our fiduciary services, we will:

Administer the trust according to its terms.
Communicate regularly with beneficiaries.
Prepare required records, statements, and tax returns.

Whether you name us as trustee or prefer to name another in this capacity, you’ll also receive the same tax-sensitive investment management2 as with Fidelity® Personalized Portfolios.
A dedicated trust officer will be assigned to all accounts for which FPTC serves as trustee or co-trustee. A dedicated portfolio specialist will be assigned to all other Fidelity® Personalized Portfolio accounts.










Next steps

To open an account, start by telling us your financial needs and goals. We’ll send you a complimentary investment proposal.

FAQs: Fidelity® Personalized Portfolios


How can this strategy help me meet my goals?  

This professionally managed strategy is tailored to your personal financial situation, enabling you to request exclusion of particular stocks or industries, while seeking to reduce the impact of taxes on your investment returns.



Who manages my money?  

Strategic Advisers, Inc., a Fidelity company, will actively manage your personalized portfolio using their disciplined, research-driven approach, and will apply tax-sensitive investment strategies1, where appropriate, that seek to enhance after-tax investment returns.



What kind of investments can I expect in my account?  

This strategy includes a broad range of investment options including stocks, bonds, mutual funds, exchange-traded funds (ETFs), and separately managed accounts (SMAs) when appropriate.



How are the investments chosen for my account?  

Because we are creating a portfolio that is personalized to your needs and specific goals, our investment team will research and select the mix of investments that is appropriate for your goals.



Can I choose my own investments?  

Our investment professionals will select your investments and build a portfolio tailored to you. We will use in-depth investment research, manage your risk through diversification, and suggest a mix of investments personalized for your goals. We do offer transparency into your holdings and the activity conducted on your behalf.



Can I change my investment strategy?  

You can contact us at any time to discuss changing your investment strategy should your financial situation or goals change. You can feel confident knowing we'll work with you to help ensure you're on track to meet your needs.



Can I add funds to my account?  

Yes, you can add funds at any time.



Can I withdraw funds from my account?  

Yes, there are several ways to access your funds, including scheduled withdrawals.



How much do I need to open an account?  

The minimum funding amount is $200,000. Accounts can be funded with a check, bank wire, an exchange purchase from an existing Fidelity account, or a transfer of eligible assets from an account at another institution.



How much does it cost?  

Gross advisory fees range from 0.55% to 1.50% based on the amount of assets you invest.3



What type of tax strategies do you use?  

While many investment management firms only offer tax-loss harvesting at year's end, Strategic Advisers uses this and a number of other strategies throughout the year designed to help reduce your tax liability and help reach your goals as quickly as possible.1



Will there be tax consequences when I open my account?  

Partnering with you to help manage your money in a tax-efficient way starts with getting your account set up with the right mix of investments. This process may require selling some investments that generate taxable gains. However, the result is an account that we believe will be better positioned to provide opportunities for growth while managing potential investment risks.



Can I choose a different strategy than what is suggested?  

You can opt to select a different strategy than what is suggested during our planning discussions. We will manage your account according to your selected investment strategy.

          1. Fidelity® Personalized Portfolios apply tax-sensitive investment management techniques (including tax-loss harvesting) on a limited basis, at their discretion, primarily with respect to determining when assets in a client’s account should be bought or sold. With this discretionary investment management service, any assets contributed to an investor’s account that Fidelity® Personalized Portfolios do not elect to retain may be sold at any time after contribution. An investor may have a gain or loss when assets are sold.
	
    

          2.
	
	
	       
					Please note that you will be charged an additional fee for any SMAs held in your account. These fees are in addition to the basic advisory fees for Fidelity® Personalized Portfolios. Please refer to your Client Agreement for detailed fee information.


          3. The advisory fee does not cover charges resulting from trades effected with or through broker-dealers other than affiliates of Strategic Advisers, mark-ups or mark-downs by broker-dealers, transfer taxes, exchange fees, regulatory fees, odd-lot differentials, handling charges, electronic fund and wire transfer fees, or any other charges imposed by law or otherwise applicable to your account. You will also incur underlying expenses associated with the investment vehicles selected.
	
    

          4. Fidelity Personal Trust refers to trust services that are offered through Fidelity Personal Trust Company, FSB (FPTC), a federal savings bank.
	
    

Keep in mind that investing involves risk. The value of your investment will fluctuate over time, and you may gain or lose money.

            Hey there! Are you maybe looking for Firebase instead?

            







    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).

History[edit]
The company was founded as Fidelity Management & Research (FMR) by Edward C. Johnson II in 1946.[1] In 1969, the company formed Fidelity International Limited (FIL) to serve non-U.S. markets.[3] It was spun off in 1980.[3] In 2010, it was rebranded as 'Fidelity Worldwide Investment'.[4] In 1982, the company started offering 401(k) products.[1] In 1984, the company offered computerized stock trading.[1]
In 1997, Robert Pozen was named CEO.[5] In 2010, Fidelity Ventures, its venture capital arm, was shut down, and many of the employees created Volition Capital.[6] In 2011, Fidelity changed the name of its international division from Fidelity International to Fidelity Worldwide Investment and a new logo was introduced.[7] In 2012, the company moved its Boston headquarters to 245 Summer Street.[8]
Current operations[edit]
Mutual funds[edit]
FMR has three fund divisions: Equity (headquartered in Boston, Massachusetts), High-Income (headquartered in Boston) and Fixed-Income (headquartered in Merrimack, New Hampshire). The company's largest equity mutual fund is Fidelity Contrafund, which has $107.4 billion in assets,[9] making it the largest non-indexed fund in the US. The current manager of Contrafund is William Danoff.
Fidelity Magellan is another large equity fund, with $15.5 billion in assets.[10] Its current manager is Jeffrey Feingold, who also manages the Fidelity Trend Fund. It was previously managed by Ned Johnson from May 2, 1963 to Dec. 31, 1971, Peter Lynch from May 31, 1977 to May 31, 1990 and Harry W. Lange from 2005 to 2012.
Brokerage[edit]
Fidelity Investments operates a major brokerage firm and has investor centers in over 140 locations throughout the US. Through its subsidiary, National Financial Services LLC, Fidelity Investments provides services to its correspondent broker-dealers, institutional investment firms and registered investment advisors including brokerage clearing and back office support and a suite of software products for financial services firms. National Financial was the custodian for over $443 billion in assets, in 4.3 million accounts as of September 30, 2010.[11]
Benefits outsourcing[edit]
Fidelity Personal, Workplace and Institutional Services (PWIS) is the largest provider of 401(k) retirement plan services with $1.4 trillion under administration[12] and $32 billion in total defined contribution assets, as of 2015.[13] Other services provided include pension administration, health & welfare administration, stock plan administration as well as payroll and other record-keeping services.
Devonshire Investors[edit]
The company's Devonshire Investors arm is a division that gives the owners of the company the ability to make other investments outside its funds.[14]
Assets include Veritude, an employment agency for jobs at Fidelity.[15] The company has been a major investor of real estate, owning the Seaport Center and 2.5 million square feet of office space in Boston.[16] It formerly owned Community Newspaper Company, the largest chain of newspapers in suburban Boston, Massachusetts, sold to the Boston Herald in 2000[17] and now owned by GateHouse Media. Fidelity has also strategically invested in the telecom/managed services/data center industries, including COLT Telecom Group in Europe,[18] MetroRED in South America, and KVH Co. Ltd. in Japan. Since 2008, all MetroRED ownership has been completely divested.
It was formerly heavily invested in commercial lumber and building materials.[19] In 2013, they sold Boston Coach, a limousine and black-car service, founded in 1985 by Ned Johnson after waiting too long for a taxi, to Harrison Global.[20] It formed ProBuild Holdings in 2006 and sold it to Builders FirstSource in 2015.[21]
Donor-advised fund[edit]
Fidelity manages a donor-advised fund, Fidelity Charitable, in 1991, becoming the first commercial DAF provider. As of 2017, Fidelity Charitable is currently the largest charity by donations from the public, surpassing the United Way. Tax donations to a DAF can be registered in the year of the donation, when the beneficiary may be being chosen. In a 2015 survey by Fidelity Charitable, 90% of donors who responded stated this benefit as the main reason for starting donations using a DAF. Donors also cite that this allows them to give more to charity. Investments in a DAF register interest until the distribution is given to a beneficiary.[22] Fidelity Charitable produces a report "Women and Giving" that examines differences in giving attitudes, strategies and priorities across generations and gender.[23]
In 2016, Fidelity Charitable raised nearly $7 million in bitcoin. As of June 2017, the organization's annual report said that nearly $2 billion had been committed by all funding methods, with almost $9 million in bitcoin.[24]
Legal issues[edit]
Document retention fines[edit]
In February 2007, the NASD, a division of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, fined 4 FMR-affiliated broker-dealers $3.75 million for alleged registration, supervision and e-mail retention violations. The broker-dealers settled without admitting or denying the charges.[25]
In 2004, Fidelity Brokerage paid $2 million to settle charges by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that employees altered and destroyed documents in 21 of its 88 branch offices between January 2001 and July 2002. Fidelity has internal inspections every year to make sure it is complying with federal regulations. Management was accused of pressuring branch employees to have perfect inspections and gave notice of the inspections and that at least 62 employees destroyed or altered potentially improper documents maintained at branch offices including new account applications, letters of authorization and variable annuity forms.[26]
Misrepresentations[edit]
In May 2007, NASD fined two Fidelity broker-dealers $400,000 for preparing and distributing misleading sales literature promoting Fidelity's Destiny I and II Systematic Investment Plans, which were sold primarily to U.S. military personnel. As part of the settlement, the FMR affiliates were required to notify Destiny Plan holders who want to increase their investments in existing Destiny Plans that additional shares of the underlying fund can be purchased outside the Destiny Plans without paying the additional sales charges.[27]
Ownership and management[edit]




Fidelity Investments Investor Center on Boylston Street in Boston


Johnson Family[edit]
The founding Johnson family, individually and through various trusts, owns stock representing a 49% voting interest in FMR, and have signed agreements pledging to vote all their shares as a bloc. Edward Johnson III was chairman of the group, but was replaced by his daughter, Abigail Johnson. Abigail was once the largest single shareholder with about 25% ownership, but in October 2005, it was reported that she had sold a "significant" portion of her shares to family trusts, and that there were doubts as to whether she was still in line to succeed her father.[28]
Employees and ex-employees[edit]
Most of the remaining 51% of the company is held by various Fidelity employees and ex-employees, including fund managers and ex-managers, such as Peter Lynch.[29]
Offices[edit]
FMR's corporate headquarters are in Boston, Massachusetts, with the largest U.S. operations located in Merrimack, New Hampshire; Smithfield, Rhode Island; Westlake, Texas; Covington, Kentucky; Durham, North Carolina; Albuquerque, New Mexico; Cincinnati, Ohio; Salt Lake City, Utah; Jacksonville, Florida; Greenwood Village, Colorado; and American Fork, Utah. It also has offices in Canada in Toronto, Montreal, Calgary and Vancouver. Fidelity Management and Research in 2009 opened offices in both Hong Kong and Tokyo, Japan to add capabilities to its small cap research.
In 2004, Fidelity established its first presence in India by opening an office in Mumbai. However, their offices in India mostly serve back-office function and do not make any investments related decisions.[1] The company has over 4,000 employees in India. Its second largest software development facility (after the United States) is in Bangalore and Chennai.
Fidelity Investments Ireland was established in 1996 as the European offshore development centre for Fidelity Investments and now employs over 1,000 people with offices in Dublin and Galway. Fidelity also has offices in France, Germany, Belgium, Italy, Spain and Switzerland and London for its HR Solution business HR Access.
Marketing[edit]
Paul McCartney marketing campaign[edit]
Fidelity has experimented with marketing techniques directed to the baby boomer demographic, releasing Never Stop Doing What You Love, a compilation of songs by Paul McCartney. McCartney became the firm's spokesman in 2005 in a campaign entitled "This Is Paul." On the day of the disc's release, company employees were treated to a special recorded message by Paul himself informing them that "Fidelity and [he] have a lot in common" and urging them to "never stop doing what you love".[30]

The company was founded as Fidelity Management & Research (FMR) by Edward C. Johnson II in 1946.[1] In 1969, the company formed Fidelity International Limited (FIL) to serve non-U.S. markets.[3] It was spun off in 1980.[3] In 2010, it was rebranded as 'Fidelity Worldwide Investment'.[4] In 1982, the company started offering 401(k) products.[1] In 1984, the company offered computerized stock trading.[1]
In 1997, Robert Pozen was named CEO.[5] In 2010, Fidelity Ventures, its venture capital arm, was shut down, and many of the employees created Volition Capital.[6] In 2011, Fidelity changed the name of its international division from Fidelity International to Fidelity Worldwide Investment and a new logo was introduced.[7] In 2012, the company moved its Boston headquarters to 245 Summer Street.[8]
Current operations[edit]
Mutual funds[edit]
FMR has three fund divisions: Equity (headquartered in Boston, Massachusetts), High-Income (headquartered in Boston) and Fixed-Income (headquartered in Merrimack, New Hampshire). The company's largest equity mutual fund is Fidelity Contrafund, which has $107.4 billion in assets,[9] making it the largest non-indexed fund in the US. The current manager of Contrafund is William Danoff.
Fidelity Magellan is another large equity fund, with $15.5 billion in assets.[10] Its current manager is Jeffrey Feingold, who also manages the Fidelity Trend Fund. It was previously managed by Ned Johnson from May 2, 1963 to Dec. 31, 1971, Peter Lynch from May 31, 1977 to May 31, 1990 and Harry W. Lange from 2005 to 2012.
Brokerage[edit]
Fidelity Investments operates a major brokerage firm and has investor centers in over 140 locations throughout the US. Through its subsidiary, National Financial Services LLC, Fidelity Investments provides services to its correspondent broker-dealers, institutional investment firms and registered investment advisors including brokerage clearing and back office support and a suite of software products for financial services firms. National Financial was the custodian for over $443 billion in assets, in 4.3 million accounts as of September 30, 2010.[11]
Benefits outsourcing[edit]
Fidelity Personal, Workplace and Institutional Services (PWIS) is the largest provider of 401(k) retirement plan services with $1.4 trillion under administration[12] and $32 billion in total defined contribution assets, as of 2015.[13] Other services provided include pension administration, health & welfare administration, stock plan administration as well as payroll and other record-keeping services.
Devonshire Investors[edit]
The company's Devonshire Investors arm is a division that gives the owners of the company the ability to make other investments outside its funds.[14]
Assets include Veritude, an employment agency for jobs at Fidelity.[15] The company has been a major investor of real estate, owning the Seaport Center and 2.5 million square feet of office space in Boston.[16] It formerly owned Community Newspaper Company, the largest chain of newspapers in suburban Boston, Massachusetts, sold to the Boston Herald in 2000[17] and now owned by GateHouse Media. Fidelity has also strategically invested in the telecom/managed services/data center industries, including COLT Telecom Group in Europe,[18] MetroRED in South America, and KVH Co. Ltd. in Japan. Since 2008, all MetroRED ownership has been completely divested.
It was formerly heavily invested in commercial lumber and building materials.[19] In 2013, they sold Boston Coach, a limousine and black-car service, founded in 1985 by Ned Johnson after waiting too long for a taxi, to Harrison Global.[20] It formed ProBuild Holdings in 2006 and sold it to Builders FirstSource in 2015.[21]
Donor-advised fund[edit]
Fidelity manages a donor-advised fund, Fidelity Charitable, in 1991, becoming the first commercial DAF provider. As of 2017, Fidelity Charitable is currently the largest charity by donations from the public, surpassing the United Way. Tax donations to a DAF can be registered in the year of the donation, when the beneficiary may be being chosen. In a 2015 survey by Fidelity Charitable, 90% of donors who responded stated this benefit as the main reason for starting donations using a DAF. Donors also cite that this allows them to give more to charity. Investments in a DAF register interest until the distribution is given to a beneficiary.[22] Fidelity Charitable produces a report "Women and Giving" that examines differences in giving attitudes, strategies and priorities across generations and gender.[23]
In 2016, Fidelity Charitable raised nearly $7 million in bitcoin. As of June 2017, the organization's annual report said that nearly $2 billion had been committed by all funding methods, with almost $9 million in bitcoin.[24]
Legal issues[edit]
Document retention fines[edit]
In February 2007, the NASD, a division of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, fined 4 FMR-affiliated broker-dealers $3.75 million for alleged registration, supervision and e-mail retention violations. The broker-dealers settled without admitting or denying the charges.[25]
In 2004, Fidelity Brokerage paid $2 million to settle charges by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that employees altered and destroyed documents in 21 of its 88 branch offices between January 2001 and July 2002. Fidelity has internal inspections every year to make sure it is complying with federal regulations. Management was accused of pressuring branch employees to have perfect inspections and gave notice of the inspections and that at least 62 employees destroyed or altered potentially improper documents maintained at branch offices including new account applications, letters of authorization and variable annuity forms.[26]
Misrepresentations[edit]
In May 2007, NASD fined two Fidelity broker-dealers $400,000 for preparing and distributing misleading sales literature promoting Fidelity's Destiny I and II Systematic Investment Plans, which were sold primarily to U.S. military personnel. As part of the settlement, the FMR affiliates were required to notify Destiny Plan holders who want to increase their investments in existing Destiny Plans that additional shares of the underlying fund can be purchased outside the Destiny Plans without paying the additional sales charges.[27]
Ownership and management[edit]

Johnson Family[edit]
The founding Johnson family, individually and through various trusts, owns stock representing a 49% voting interest in FMR, and have signed agreements pledging to vote all their shares as a bloc. Edward Johnson III was chairman of the group, but was replaced by his daughter, Abigail Johnson. Abigail was once the largest single shareholder with about 25% ownership, but in October 2005, it was reported that she had sold a "significant" portion of her shares to family trusts, and that there were doubts as to whether she was still in line to succeed her father.[28]
Employees and ex-employees[edit]
Most of the remaining 51% of the company is held by various Fidelity employees and ex-employees, including fund managers and ex-managers, such as Peter Lynch.[29]
Offices[edit]
FMR's corporate headquarters are in Boston, Massachusetts, with the largest U.S. operations located in Merrimack, New Hampshire; Smithfield, Rhode Island; Westlake, Texas; Covington, Kentucky; Durham, North Carolina; Albuquerque, New Mexico; Cincinnati, Ohio; Salt Lake City, Utah; Jacksonville, Florida; Greenwood Village, Colorado; and American Fork, Utah. It also has offices in Canada in Toronto, Montreal, Calgary and Vancouver. Fidelity Management and Research in 2009 opened offices in both Hong Kong and Tokyo, Japan to add capabilities to its small cap research.
In 2004, Fidelity established its first presence in India by opening an office in Mumbai. However, their offices in India mostly serve back-office function and do not make any investments related decisions.[1] The company has over 4,000 employees in India. Its second largest software development facility (after the United States) is in Bangalore and Chennai.
Fidelity Investments Ireland was established in 1996 as the European offshore development centre for Fidelity Investments and now employs over 1,000 people with offices in Dublin and Galway. Fidelity also has offices in France, Germany, Belgium, Italy, Spain and Switzerland and London for its HR Solution business HR Access.
Marketing[edit]
Paul McCartney marketing campaign[edit]
Fidelity has experimented with marketing techniques directed to the baby boomer demographic, releasing Never Stop Doing What You Love, a compilation of songs by Paul McCartney. McCartney became the firm's spokesman in 2005 in a campaign entitled "This Is Paul." On the day of the disc's release, company employees were treated to a special recorded message by Paul himself informing them that "Fidelity and [he] have a lot in common" and urging them to "never stop doing what you love".[30]

Investments in small and emerging markets can be more volatile than other overseas markets. Some funds invest more heavily than others in smaller companies, which can carry a higher risk because their share prices may be more volatile than those of larger companies.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
