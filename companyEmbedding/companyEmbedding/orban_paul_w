Paul W. Orban, Senior Vice President and Chief Accounting Officer, is responsible for all aspects of DISH’s accounting department including external financial reporting, technical accounting policy, income tax accounting and internal controls. He has had key roles in significant debt offerings, acquisitions and divestitures over the years including  the “spinoff” of Echostar Corporation (“Echostar”) in 2008, which created two independent, publicly traded companies: DISH Network Corporation, which provides consumers with the highest quality programming and technology in pay-TV, and Echostar, a premier global provider of satellite operations and video delivery solutions. Following the “spinoff,” Paul was the Senior Vice President and Corporate Controller for both DISH Network Corporation and Echostar Corporation until 2012. Today, he remains Corporate Controller for DISH. 
Paul joined DISH in 1996 as a Senior Manager of Accounting and was responsible for all aspects of SEC external financial reporting. Prior to his current position, he held various leadership positions with increasing responsibility including Director of Accounting, Vice President of Accounting and Senior Vice President and Corporate Controller. Before joining DISH, Paul was an auditor at Arthur Anderson LLP, where he was responsible for the audits of numerous companies including many SEC registrants in the Denver area.
As a CPA, Paul is a member of the Colorado Society of Certified Public Accountants and the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants. He holds his Bachelor of Science in Accounting from the University of Colorado.
In his spare time, Paul enjoys boating, skiing, coaching and attending sporting events with his significant other Barbara and their young triplets.
