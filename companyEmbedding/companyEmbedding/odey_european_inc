Odey


















To be a successful long term investor you must think like an owner - know when to take risk and when to preserve capital.

I launched Odey Asset Management in 1991 with this 'owners' approach and have worked hard to build an investment team and a client base who share these beliefs. Today we manage c. $6.0bn* for many of the world's leading investors and have an exceptional performance record across our conventional and hedge fund portfolios (* as at 30 June 2017).

If you would like to learn more about us, please do get in touch.

The Information is not directed at any person or entity.
The Information is intended only for use by users domiciled in the

local regulations before considering investment. Odey disclaims all

in the United States, and this site is not intended for
distribution or to be used by any person or entity in the United
States unless those persons or entities are existing investors in
funds managed by Odey and they have applicable US
exemptions.
Accordingly, all persons who access this site are required to
inform themselves of and to comply with all applicable sales
restrictions in their home country. 
Sales Restrictions
United Kingdom: certain of the funds referred to in the
restricted part of this site (the "Restricted Area") more commonly
known as hedge funds are not recognised collective investment
schemes for the purposes of the Financial Services and Markets Act
2000 of the United Kingdom (the "Act"). The promotion of such funds
and the distribution of offering materials in relation to such
funds in the United Kingdom is accordingly restricted by law.

available to and directed only at persons to whom such funds may
lawfully be promoted by a person authorised under the Act (an
"authorised person") by virtue of Section 238(5) of the Act and
Chapter 4 (Part 12) of the FCA Conduct of Business Sourcebook.

The hedge funds in the Restricted Area are not regulated under
the UK's financial services regulations and investors in those
funds will not benefit from the rules and regulations made under
the Act for the protection of investors or from the Financial
Services Compensation Scheme.
Shares in the hedge funds in the Restricted Area are not dealt
in or on a recognised or designated investment exchange for the
purposes of the Act, nor is there a market maker in such shares,
and it may therefore be difficult for an investor to dispose of his
shares.

it.

this site should only be made having read fully the relevant

on this site, you should contact your financial adviser.
Risk Factors
Past performance is not an indication of future
performance. The value of investments and the income from them may
go down as well as up and investors may not get back the amount
invested. Consequently, you are not certain to make a profit on
your investments and you may lose money.
The hedge funds in the Restricted Area may be subject to higher
risk and volatility than other funds and may not be suitable for
all investors. These funds are not regulated.
Exchange rates may cause the value of overseas investments and
the income arising from them to rise or fall.
The levels and bases of and reliefs from taxation may change.
Any tax reliefs referred to are those currently available and their
value depends on the circumstances of the individual investor.
Investors should consult their own tax adviser in order to
understand any applicable tax consequences.

risk. The Information does not constitute an offer to buy or sell

            What is the Fund’s objective?


        The investment objective of CF Odey Continental European Fund is to achieve long term capital appreciation through investing primarily in quoted securities issued by companies with principal offices in Continental Europe and the normal policy of the Sub-Fund is to invest in a broad spread of equities but the Sub-Fund may also invest in government bonds, other fixed interest securities and preferred stocks if in the opinion of the ACD and the Investment Manager this is appropriate to the goal of maximising capital growth.
