(  OTCQB :  MFST ) would like to take this opportunity to further update shareholders about ongoing company developments. Commented CEO, Bruce J. Schoengood, "Our most recent press announcement gave shareholders a framework of our plans for growth and expansion. I am pleased and excited to announce that we have completed an agreement to add an innovative product that will immediately add both revenue to our balance sheet and a new line of products to our health and wellness division. The company also continues to make substantial and fast progress in creating business opportunities and inroads into the legal marijuana industry."MARIJUANA PUBLICATIONS--  Medifirst has filed for two publication trademarks with the USPTO, the United States Patent and Trademark Office. The first publication is called "Marijuana News & Report" and is positioned to be the premiere industry national B2B trade magazine. The company also plans to create regional publications starting with "Colorado Buds" which will be geared to Colorado marijuana consumers and state tourism. Stated Schoengood, "Having over 25 years experience in the national and regional publishing industry made the decision easy to enter this arena. Our goal is to grab top tier positions in both the trade and consumer markets and to position these magazine as leaders of their category. The company also plans to produce digital version Ezines for online consumers."MEDICAL MARIJUANA-- Medifirst is in the final stages of negotiations to partner with a California medical facility that offers Medical Cannabis Evaluations. Proposition 215, or the Compassionate Use Act of 1996, allows patients in California to use marijuana for medicinal purposes to treat over 100 different conditions. The practice would like to add our laser and light therapies to expand their patient services. These laser and light therapies has been very effective in providing relief for people who have many types of pain. The center which offers Holistic Evaluation is a new evaluation clinic offering medical cannabis recommendations to qualified patients who wish to seek alternative options to using pharmaceutical drugs to treat or manage their medical condition or illness. Said Schoengood, "This would allow us to begin to do business in California and align ourselves with medical professionals that can and are willing to work with us to expand to other states, such as Florida, if those states make marijuana legal for medical purposes. We anticipate the agreement to be completed shortly and Medifirst will then announce further details."NEW PRODUCT: WATER FROM AIR-- As previously announced, Medifirst will also be unveiling several exciting new products at the IECSC Conference at the NYC Javits Center March 9th to 11th. The company is pleased to announce that is has completed an agreement with Atmospheric Water Solution, a Florida based company that generates water by using an advanced patented technology.

Medifirst is the exclusive distributor for tradeshows within the US for the entire Spa and Wellness industry and will seek to expand to international sales as well. Said CEO Schoengood, "We get to offer the health and wellness industry the best and purist water available today and at the same time offer these businesses a great branding solution by bottling their own water with their company name." The units operate on standard 110V power and on average one gallon of water generated will cost out at about 10 cents.

We will not receive any proceeds from the sale of shares offered by the 
Selling Stockholders. In the event we issue any of the additional 2,000,000 
shares of common stock in connection with possible acquisitions or business 
combination transactions, we will not receive any proceeds from such 
transactions. As of the date of this prospectus, there are no pending 
acquisitions or business combinations under consideration by us.


The internet marketplace for electronic cigarettes is very competitive with 
many brands being offered . Green Smoke, NJOY. Eco and Blu are examples of 
the major  competitive brands which use the internet and search engines such 
as Google placement and Google Keywords to web search page  placement. 
  
All electronic cigarettes work in the same way. Consequently, competition is 
based on brand development and recognition and price.   We have filed a 
trademark  application for “Miracle-cig”  with the United States Patent and 
Trademark Office as part of our effort to develop strong brand recognition. 
The suggested retail price for the Miracle-cig will be $9.95 which is the 
average price for a disposable electronic cigarette. Below are links to four 
competitors and their disposable lines.

----------

There are many online websites and have a medical directory integrated in 
their site. They are all competing for people to point and click on their 
site. Many like webmd.com or zocdoc.com asks you pick a state to begin the 
search. Others which are national, are part of either government programs 
such as Medicare or private insurance companies such Blue Cross Blue Shield 
(provider.bcbs.com). There are online phonebooks such as superpages.com  and 
state websites such as Florida doctors.com that will compete directly with 
Florida Health Community. What sets FHC apart is our integration of social 
media to give the users a much more comprehensive online experience. 

Our major competitor is Pinellas Health Care News that offers a 12 page 
oversized newsletter which is distributed via mail. Considering  Florida’s 
size and demographics, we believe there is room for the FHC Newsletter 
content to find its own niche and to sustain sales and revenue.


Company Description
Medifirst Solutions, Inc. (the "Company") was incorporated in Nevada in 
November 2010.   We are in the development stage and have a diverse product
line including both consumer products and digital media. We  intend to 
launch "Florida Health Community" as an on-line healthcare directory and


 
social media site geared towards both professionals and consumers.  We also 
intend to produce a tabloid size newsletter with healthcare industry related 
news and events.  We  hold the trademark to,  and will sell,  the Miracle-cig 
TM , an electronic cigarette that is tobacco free and that emits a fine water 
mist in place of smoke.  Lastly, we  will offer print and digital marketing 
and advertising services to its client base of medical professionals as well 
as solicit new business in other business sectors. 

Our principal executive offices are located at 4400 North Federal Highway, 
Suite 54, Boca Raton, Florida 33431 and our telephone number is: 
(561) 558-6872.
