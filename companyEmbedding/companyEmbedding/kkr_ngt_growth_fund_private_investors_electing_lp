KKR Closes $711 Million Global Next Generation Technology Growth Fund




Aims to Back Growth Companies to Build Leading Global Enterprises






December 07, 2016 04:05 PM Eastern Standard Time



MENLO PARK, Calif. & LONDON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--KKR, a leading global investment firm, today announced the final closing 
      of KKR Next Generation Technology Growth Fund (“NGT” or the “Fund”), a 
      $711 million fund dedicated to growth equity investment opportunities in 
      the technology, media and telecommunications (TMT) space in North 
      America, Europe and Israel.
    


      The Fund is focused on generating strong returns for investors by 
      investing in market-leading, high-growth companies. Beyond access to 
      financial capital, KKR offers partner companies access to KKR’s 
      operational expertise, deep network, industry expertise, global reach 
      and insights from its more than 100 current portfolio companies 
      worldwide, which translates into over $7 billion in Information 
      Technology spend and over $10 billion in marketing spend annually.
    

      NGT is part of KKR’s 
      TMT private equity platform which is led by Herald 
      Chen and Richard 
      Sarnoff in the Americas and Philipp 
      Freise in Europe. Leading the TMT Growth strategy is KKR new-hire David 
      Welsh, a veteran in the TMT growth equity space who joined the Firm 
      in October from Adam Street Partners, where he was a Partner on the 
      growth equity and venture capital teams focusing on enterprise 
      technology.
    

      “We believe we can offer a unique set of assets and resources to our 
      partner companies,” said Mr. Welsh, Managing Director and Head of TMT 
      Growth at KKR. “In today’s evolving technology landscape, the 
      combination of KKR’s global network, sourcing engine, value creation and 
      capital markets capabilities can help accelerate new market leaders. We 
      look forward to leveraging our global footprint to build leading 
      enterprises in technology, while also aiming to deliver strong returns 
      for our investors.”
    

      The Fund seeks to invest in secular growth areas with structured 
      downside protection, limited leverage and will seek to take on execution 
      risk as opposed to fundamental technology risk. In particular, NGT is 
      expected to make equity investments amounting to less than $100 million 
      and focused on the following themes: Business to Business Software 
      /Software-as-a-Service, Information Technology Automation/ 
      Infrastructure, Security, Scalable Internet /Digital Media, and the 
      Internet of Things.
    

      “Our overall approach to TMT is to identify platforms – management 
      teams, businesses, and sectors –where we can invest to build leading 
      global TMT enterprises, whether in Private Equity or now through our new 
      growth fund,” said Herald Chen, Co-Head of TMT in North America, and 
      Philipp Freise, Head of TMT in Europe. “This strategy has served us well 
      and we look forward to building upon it further by helping more 
      entrepreneurs take their companies to the next level.”
    

      The Fund received strong backing from a diverse group of new and 
      existing global investors, including public and corporate pensions, 
      family offices and high net worth individual investors. “We are really 
      pleased with the response from investors and excited to see they share 
      our enthusiasm for the attractive opportunities NGT presents,” said Alisa 
      Amarosa Wood, KKR Member and Head of Private Market Products Group.
    

      KKR has a long record of supporting technology companies, having 
      invested over $18 billion of equity in TMT-related private equity 
      investments since 1983 and over $640 million in NGT-related growth 
      equity investments since 2014. Over the last year, the Firm has executed 
      a number of transactions as part of the firm’s growth equity strategy, 
      including Optimal+, 
      GetYourGuide, 
      Jitterbit, 
      and Darktrace.

	"We believe we can offer a unique set of assets and resources to our partner companies," said Mr. Welsh, Managing Director and Head of TMT Growth at KKR. "In today's evolving technology landscape, the combination of KKR's global network, sourcing engine, value creation and capital markets capabilities can help accelerate new market leaders. We look forward to leveraging our global footprint to build leading enterprises in technology, while also aiming to deliver strong returns for our investors."

	The Fund seeks to invest in secular growth areas with structured downside protection, limited leverage and will seek to take on execution risk as opposed to fundamental technology risk. In particular, NGT is expected to make equity investments amounting to less than $100 million and focused on the following themes: Business to Business Software /Software-as-a-Service, Information Technology Automation/ Infrastructure, Security, Scalable Internet /Digital Media, and the Internet of Things.

	"Our overall approach to TMT is to identify platforms - management teams, businesses, and sectors -where we can invest to build leading global TMT enterprises, whether in Private Equity or now through our new growth fund," said Herald Chen, Co-Head of TMT in North America, and Philipp Freise, Head of TMT in Europe. "This strategy has served us well and we look forward to building upon it further by helping more entrepreneurs take their companies to the next level."

	The Fund received strong backing from a diverse group of new and existing global investors, including public and corporate pensions, family offices and high net worth individual investors. "We are really pleased with the response from investors and excited to see they share our enthusiasm for the attractive opportunities NGT presents," said Alisa Amarosa Wood, KKR Member and Head of Private Market Products Group.

	KKR has a long record of supporting technology companies, having invested over $18 billion of equity in TMT-related private equity investments since 1983 and over $640 million in NGT-related growth equity investments since 2014. Over the last year, the Firm has executed a number of transactions as part of the firm's growth equity strategy, including Optimal+, GetYourGuide, Jitterbit, and Darktrace.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
