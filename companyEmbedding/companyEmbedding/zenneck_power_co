The E-field of a Zenneck surface wave at an air-silver interface.


The Zenneck wave, Zenneck surface wave or Sommerfeld-Zenneck surface wave is an inhomogeneous or non-uniform electromagnetic plane wave incident at the complex Brewster angle onto a planar or spherical boundary interface between two homogeneous media having different dielectric constants.[1][2][3][4][5][6][7]:p. 198
The Zenneck wave propagates parallel to the interface and decays exponentially vertical to it, a property known as evanescence. It exists under the condition that the permittivity of one of the materials forming the interface is negative, while the other one is positive, as for example the interface between air and a lossy conducting medium such as the terrestrial transmission line, below the plasma frequency. Arising from original analysis by Arnold Sommerfeld and Jonathan Zenneck of the problem of wave propagation over a lossy earth, it exists as an exact solution to Maxwell's equations.[8]

    REDISCOVERING THE ZENNECK SURFACE WAVE
      by Gary Peterson 
In 1916 while speaking of his system for global
    transmission, Tesla cited the analysis of mathematician Arnold N. Sommerfeld as
    verification of his explanations of observed radio phenomena.  Tesla was referring to his
    wireless system in which, he claimed, 90% to 95% of the electrical energy was manifested at the transmitters
    output as "current waves" with the remainder existing as dissipating
    electromagnetic
    radiation (see Antenna
    Theory).  In 1909 another investigator by the name of Johann
    Zenneck, while working to explain Marconi's trans-oceanic results, showed that a unique
    type of surface wave could travel along the interface between the ground and the air. 
    In
    the words of James Corum,
    


"The distinguishing feature of the Zenneck wave was
    that the propagating energy didn't spread like radiation, but was concentrated near the
    guiding surface.  Sommerfeld had shown that an electromagnetic wave could be guided along a
    wire of finite conductivity, and Zenneck conceived that the earth's surface would
    perform in a manner similar to a single conducting wire." [see
        "Operating Principles of the Wardenclyffe Apparatus"]

In commenting on Sommerfeld's analysis of the surface wave,
    James R. Wait states that "The field amplitude varies inversely as the square
    root of the horizontal distance from the source. . . ."  It's interesting to note
    that Sommerfeld made a point of distinguishing between the "electrodynamic"
    surface wave and its Hertzian counterpart the space wave, believing that both components
    could be present in varying proportion in the wave complex.  It was Tesla's assertion that
    the exact composition of the emissions was dependent upon the design of the transmitter 
	launching structure.


    Geometry for Zenneck wave propagation.
        
        According to James Corum's mathematical analysis of the Zenneck wave,
    

        "The resulting wave is a surface guided (single
    conductor) transmission line mode which attenuates exponentially along the
        guide. . . .  There is no inverse square spreading or diffraction, as with Hertzian
        waves. . . .  With
    appropriate constitutive parameters, a pure Zenneck wave would seem to hold out the
    promise of guided propagation with no radiation field to waste energy."
    

As the study of radio propagation progressed and certain
    mathematical analyses excluded it, some question as to the existence of Zenneck surface
    waves began to develop.  In 1937 limited support was given to these doubts after tests
    showed simple antennas driven at 150 mHz produced 100 times lower field strength
    than predicted.  More recent investigations show evidence that Zenneck waves can, indeed,
    be generated.  The lower the frequency, the lower are the propagation losses. 
    It is also
    apparent that they are not a major contributor to the field produced by an electric dipole
    or a quarter wave radiator, however they might be excited by an
    energetic quarter wave resonator.  To quote Hill and Wait,

"As it turns out, the
      Zenneck wave is generally difficult to excite with a realistic source
      because it has a rather slow decay with height above the earth's
      surface.  But there is still an open question whether other types of
      sources may not be more favorable. . . . An infinite vertical aperture
      with height variation corresponding to that of the Zenneck wave will
      excite only the Zenneck surface wave with no radiation field. . . ."
      [Hill, D. and J.R. Wait, "Excitation of the Zenneck Surface Wave by a
      vertical Aperture," Radio Science, Vol. 13, No. 6, November-December,
      1978, pp. 969-977.]

And to once again quote Dr. Corum,
    

"The 1978 analysis
      provided by Hill and Wait examined the fields produced by a vertical sheet
      of horizontally directed magnetic current with an exponential
      variation in an 'infinite Zenneck" aperture. . . . The analysis .
      . . showed that this field has no intrinsic merit at 1 to 10 MHz, and we
      certainly agree.  One wonders, however (and this is pure conjecture
      at this point), if the disposition of Tesla's Colorado Springs high
      voltage (10-20 Mv) VLF resonator did, in fact, possess an effective
      vertical distribution of magnetic current which could launch a similar
      Zenneck Surface Wave. . . ."

Plots of field strength vs. frequency indicate that a
    Zenneck wave propagates best at ELF and VLF frequencies up to about 35 kHz and
    begins to lose
    its
    advantage as frequency rises above this point.



    Predicted Zenneck wave field strength decrease for around-the-world propagation as a function of frequency in kHz.

    surface for the Zenneck surface wave.
The Zenneck Surface Wave vs.
  the Norton Surface Wave
A 1/2-wave dipole antenna in free
  space--the Hertz antenna--approaches an ideal source of electromagnetic radiation
  emitted
        in the form of space waves.  These space waves can reach the
        receiver either by sky-wave propagation or by ground-wave propagation,
  the latter being the portion
      of the radiated space wave that propagates close to the earth's surface. 
  The ground wave has both direct-wave and
      ground-reflected components, and under certain conditions a tropospheric
      ducting component.  The direct-wave is limited
      only by the distance to the horizon from the transmitter plus a small
      distance added by atmospheric diffraction around the curvature of the
      earth.  The ground-reflected portion of the radiated
      wave reaches the receiving antenna after being reflected from the earth's surface.
There is also an induced ground-hugging surface-wave
  component known as the Norton surface
      wave.  This wave is the result of
      electrical currents induced in the ground by refraction of a portion of
      the reflected-wave component at the earth-atmosphere interface.  Upon reflection
      from the Earth's surface the reflected wave undergoes a 180deg phase
      reversal.  When both transmitting and receiving antennas are on, or
      close to, the ground, and the distance between them becomes great, the
      direct and reflected components tend to cancel out, and the resulting
      field intensity is principally that of this surface wave.  Because
      part of its energy is absorbed by the ground, the electrical intensity of
      the surface wave is attenuated at a much greater rate than inversely as
      the distance.  It is the conductivity of the underlying terrain that
      determines the attenuation of the surface-wave field intensity as a
      function of distance.  The ground currents of a vertically polarized
      surface wave do not short-circuit a given electric field but rather serve
      to restore part of the used energy to the following field.  The
      better the conducting surface layer, the more energy returned and the less
      energy absorbed. [Antennas and Radio Propagation, TM 11-666, Dept. of the
        Army, Feb. 1953, pp. 17-23.]
It is useful here to consider two
  additional forms of wireless
        telecommunications antennas or launching structures, the
        Marconi antenna, a vertical 1/4-wave monopole antenna element and the Tesla antenna, a vertical high aspect-ratio
  1/4-wave helical resonator with large capacitive top loading
        and small overall height, compared to the electrical 1/4 wavelength. 
  In both cases the structure is base fed, and a ground connection is used.
The
        Marconi antenna is a modified 1/2-wave Hertz antenna
        adapted to the real-world conditions encountered in the construction of
  medium and low frequency transmitters.  These adaptations are imposed by the
        wavelength involved and the resulting physical dimensions required of
        the antenna.  The dipole antenna is modified in that its lower
        half, 1/4 wavelength long, exists only as a mirror image of its upper
        counterpart.  The resulting 1/4-wave vertical monopole antenna
        takes advantage of the fact that at lower frequencies the ground acts as a
        mirror for the radiated energy.  The ground reflects a large amount
        of the energy that is radiated downward from the antenna mounted over
        it.  In the physical construction of the ground
        connection is important to have as high a conductivity as possible.
          The object is to provide the
        best possible reflecting surface for the energy radiated downward from
        the antenna.  The ground consists of a number of bare conductors arranged
        radially and connected, 1/2 wavelength long, buried a short distance
        beneath the earth's surface.  In practice these conductors may act as
        part of the reflecting surface as well as making the connection to
        ground itself.
          An alternative type of ground is the counterpoise.
          It is a wire structure erected a short distance above the ground, 
        and insulated from the ground.  The counterpoise operates by virtue of its capacitance to the
        ground.   Not
        unlike the Hertz antenna, the Marconi antenna is a source electromagnetic radiation in the form of
        space waves.The Tesla antenna is a
        form of wireless antenna or wave launching structure developed by 
        Tesla in which the transmitted energy propagates or is carried to the
        receiver by a combination of electrical current flowing through the
        earth, electrostatic induction and electrical conduction through plasma
        with an embedded magnetic field.  Of course it is also part of an
        electric dipole, consisting of the elevated capacitance, the helical
        resonator and master oscillator plus connections, and the Earth itself.  The above-ground
        structure is not
        intended as a source of electromagnetic radiation, rather, it is
        designed to minimize the production of electromagnetic radiation.  The principle that
        the ground acts as a mirror, which reflects electromagnetic energy radiated downward
        by the antenna mounted over it, is not applicable. In operation,
        the Tesla
        launching structure induces an electrical current in the earth between the transmitting and receiving stations,
        along with an associated surface wave, that propagate the transmitted energy. 
        A conducting path is also establish through the rarified upper level
        atmosphere between the transmitting and receiving stations
        elevated high voltage terminals, leading Tesla to coin the term "disturbed charge of ground and air method." 
He stated that this method involves electrical conduction and that energy escapes from the
        system in the form of electromagnetic radiation.  The conducting media
        are the earth and the atmosphere above 5 miles elevation.   While
        the region from 5 miles up to the ionosphere is not an ohmic conductor, the density or pressure is sufficiently reduced to so that, according to Tesla's theory, the atmosphere's insulating properties can be easily impaired allowing an electric current to flow.   His theory further suggests that the conducting region is developed through the process of atmospheric ionization, shifting the effected portions thereof to a plasma state. 
        A magnetic field is developed by each plant's helical resonator,
        meaning that an embedded magnetic field is also involved.  The atmosphere below 5 miles is also viewed as a propagating medium for a portion of the above ground circuit, and being an insulating medium, electrostatic
        induction or 'displacement current' would be involved rather than true electrical conduction.   Tesla felt that with a sufficiently high electrical potential on the elevated terminal the practical limitation imposed upon its height could be overcome.   He anticipated that a highly energetic
        transmitter would charge the elevated terminal to the point where the atmosphere around and above it would break down and become ionized, leading to a flow of true conduction currents between the two terminals through the
        troposphere path connection.Now, Sommerfeld described an
  electrodynamic wave that is guided along a wire of finite conductivity and
  Zenneck expanded upon this description, asserting that the earth's surface
  performs in a manner similar to a conducting wire.  And,
  while the Norton Surface
  Wave is the result of electrical
  currents induced in the ground by refraction of a portion of the
  reflected-wave component of the ground-wave at the earth-atmosphere interface,
  the surface wave associated with Tesla's apparatus is the result of
  electrical ground currents flowing between two discrete points on the
  earth's surface.  Unlike
  the lossy Norton
  surface-wave that is
  excited by a conventional AM radio transmitter it would seem that Tesla's
  surface wave would not diminish quite as significantly as the distance from
  the source facility increases.  [See
  "A Comparison of the Tesla and Marconi LF Wireless Systems"][This piece is derived from
    "The Zenneck Surface Wave," Appendix II of the paper
    entitled "Nikola Tesla, Lightning Observations and Stationary Waves"
    by K. L. Corum and J. F. Corum, Ph.D. 1994., presented
    at the 1994 Colorado Springs Tesla Symposium.  This and other papers are available
