Accel-KKR Closes Its Fifth Buyout Fund with over $1.3 Billion in Committed Capital

Sep 28, 2015, 06:00 ET
		  		  						
						 from   Accel-KKR 











 
















































 

 




















 


MENLO PARK, Calif., Sept. 28, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Accel-KKR, a technology-focused private equity investment firm, today announced the official close of its fifth buyout fund with $1.3 billion in committed capital.  The fund, Accel-KKR Capital Partners V LP ("Fund V"), will continue Accel-KKR's long-term focused strategy of investing in lower-middle market and middle-market software and IT-enabled services companies.
Accel-KKR said the fund received strong support from its investors in prior funds, as well as attracted a number of new investors.  Commenting on the fund closing, Tom Barnds, Managing Director of Accel-KKR, said, "We are heartened by the support we received from our existing investors, and are quite pleased to welcome a number of new investors to the fund.  The missions of our investors, who include leading academic institutions, medical research foundations, health care institutions, and corporate and government pensions, resonate deeply with the Accel-KKR team."
The firm formally went to market with Fund V in Spring 2015 and closed on its hard cap earlier this month.  This brings Accel-KKR's total committed capital to $4.0 billion across its current and previous funds.
The new fund includes a $100 million commitment from the firm's general partners.  "We believe in strong alignment of interest with our limited partners," commented Rob Palumbo, Managing Director of Accel-KKR. "One of the many ways we seek to achieve this alignment is by making very significant financial commitments to invest alongside of our limited partners."  The $100 million commitment represents the largest such general partner commitment in the firm's history and also makes the general partner the largest investor in the fund.
Accel-KKR invests through two different types of funds – its Buyout funds for majority ownership positions and its Growth Capital funds for minority ownership positions.  Accel-KKR raised its second Growth Capital Fund in 2014 with $350 million of committed capital.  Fund V also follows the firm's fourth buyout fund, which it started investing out of in 2013 with $800 million of commitments.
The firm has continued to expand its investment efforts outside of North America.  In 2013, it opened a London office, and since 2013 the firm and its portfolio companies have acquired or invested in over eight technology companies in Europe.  Accel-KKR has also expanded its investor base outside the United States, such that in Fund V over one third of the committed capital is from international investors.  International investments continue to be an integral part of the firm's strategy going forward.
The close of Fund V also comes amidst a period of significant activity for Accel-KKR, in terms of new investments, add-on acquisitions by portfolio companies and realizations of investments.

Recent new platform investments include:
 											 			   		  	 		  			   																																																		
Motor Vehicle Software Corporation (MVSC) – Based in Agoura Hills, CA, MVSC provides innovative process management software for state government agencies and businesses including an electronic vehicle registration solution. 
Banker's Toolbox – Based in Austin, TX, Banker's Toolbox is a leading provider of Bank Secrecy Act anti-money laundering compliance and fraud prevention solutions for the financial industry.
Five Accel-KKR portfolio companies made add-on acquisitions over the last several months, including:
 											 			   		  	 		  			   																																																		
Oildex, a leader provided of revenue and expense management software to the oil and gas market, acquired the Procure-to-Pay (P2P) business of Automatic Data Processing. 
HighJump, a global provider of supply chain management solutions, acquired Wesupply, a United Kingdom-based provider of supplier enablement and B2B integration solutions. 
MEA|NEA, the leader in secure health information exchange for medical and dental providers, acquired The White Stone Group, Inc., a provider of healthcare communication management solutions. 
Kerridge Commercial Systems, a global provider of enterprise resource planning software to the distributive trades, acquired Dancik International, a provider of software to the flooring and tiling industries. 
Datapipe, a global leader in managed hybrid IT solutions for the enterprise, acquired DualSpark, an Amazon Web Services assessment, automation, and migration company.
Accel-KKR has achieved a series of successful exits recently including:
 											 			   		  	 		  			   																																																		
RiseSmart, the leading provider of contemporary career transition services, which was acquired by Randstad Holding nv. 
On Center Software, a leading construction automation technology company, which was acquired by Roper Technologies. 
Applied Predictive Technologies, a leading cloud-based analytics provider, which was acquired by MasterCard for $600 million.
About Accel-KKR Accel-KKR is a technology-focused investment firm with $4.0 billion in capital commitments to its current funds.  The firm invests primarily in software and IT-enabled businesses well-positioned for topline and bottom-line growth. At the core of Accel-KKR's investment strategy is a commitment to developing strong partnerships with the management teams of its portfolio companies and a focus on building value through significant resources available through the Accel-KKR network. Accel-KKR focuses on middle-market companies and provides a broad range of capital solutions from minority-growth investments to buyouts, recapitalizations, divisional carve-outs and going-private transactions. The firm has offices in Menlo Park, Atlanta and London. For more information, please visit accel-kkr.com.

PLEASANTON, Calif. & OXFORD, England, Sep 29, 2015 (BUSINESS WIRE) — Veeva Systems Inc. VEEV, -3.85% today announced it has acquired Zinc Ahead, a leading provider of commercial content management solutions.

Veeva Systems’ solution—Vault PromoMats released in 2011—is now utilized by more than 70 customers.
“The Zinc Ahead team brings decades of experience in commercial content management and will add considerable domain expertise to this rapidly growing area for Veeva,” said Peter Gassner, CEO of Veeva.
“The merging of Veeva and Zinc Ahead will create a best-in-class solution that supports every step in the digital content lifecycle—from creation to expiration—developed and supported by top software and life sciences talent.”
With this acquisition, the market will now have a powerful, end-to-end solution that combines the strengths of both Veeva and Zinc Ahead. The joint company will fully support Zinc Ahead customers with the outstanding levels of personalized service for which Zinc Ahead is known. Customers will have access to an enhanced Vault PromoMats solution, bolstered by the unique strengths of Zinc Ahead’s offerings. The result will be the most complete software and services solution for digital content creation, review, and multichannel approval and withdrawal on the market—backed by a company-wide commitment to customer success.
“Veeva shares our top value—a clear and steadfast commitment to the customer,” said Zinc Ahead CEO James Brown. “This acquisition is a great fit and a tremendous win for Zinc Ahead’s employees, customers, and the industry. We are bringing together the strongest products and the best people. With Vault PromoMats, our customers will benefit from having a fully integrated solution that works seamlessly within their commercial landscape.”
Mr. Brown will now lead Veeva’s commercial content management business. The joint team will support both offerings to ensure a seamless transition from Zinc MAPS to Vault PromoMats over time. Customers who elect to continue to use Zinc MAPS will be supported through at least 2020.

Accel-KKR Closes its Fifth Buyout Fund with Over $1.3B in Committed Capital Accel-KKR | Sep 28, 2015


Menlo Park, CA, September 28, 2015 – Accel-KKR, a technology-focused private equity investment firm, today announced the official close of its fifth buyout fund with $1.3 billion in committed capital. The fund, Accel-KKR Capital Partners V LP (“Fund V”), will continue Accel-KKR’s long-term focused strategy of
investing in lower-middle market and middle-market software and IT-enabled services companies.
Accel-KKR said the fund received strong support from its investors in prior funds, as well as attracted a number of new investors. Commenting on the fund closing, Tom Barnds, Managing Director of AccelKKR,
said, “We are heartened by the support we received from our existing investors, and are quite pleased to welcome a number of new investors to the fund. The missions of our investors, who include leading academic institutions, medical research foundations, health care institutions, and corporate and government pensions, resonate deeply with the Accel-KKR team.”
The firm formally went to market with Fund V in Spring 2015 and closed on its hard cap earlier this month. This brings Accel-KKR’s total committed capital to $4.0 billion across its current and previous funds. The new fund includes a $100 million commitment from the firm’s general partners. “We believe in strong alignment of interest with our limited partners,” commented Rob Palumbo, Managing Director of AccelKKR.
“One of the many ways we seek to achieve this alignment is by making very significant financial commitments to invest alongside of our limited partners.” The $100 million commitment represents the largest such general partner commitment in the firm’s history and also makes the general partner the
largest investor in the fund.
Accel-KKR invests through two different types of funds – its Buyout funds for majority ownership positions and its Growth Capital funds for minority ownership positions. Accel-KKR raised its second Growth
Capital Fund in 2014 with $350 million of committed capital. Fund V also follows the firm’s fourth buyout fund, which it started investing out of in 2013 with $800 million of commitments.
The firm has continued to expand its investment efforts outside of North America. In 2013, it opened a London office, and since 2013 the firm and its portfolio companies have acquired or invested in over eight
technology companies in Europe. Accel-KKR has also expanded its investor base outside the United States, such that in Fund V over one third of the committed capital is from international investors. International investments continue to be an integral part of the firm’s strategy going forward.
The close of Fund V also comes amidst a period of significant activity for Accel-KKR, in terms of new investments, add-on acquisitions by portfolio companies and realizations of investments.
Recent new platform investments include:


Motor Vehicle Software Corporation (MVSC) – Based in Agoura Hills, CA, MVSC provides innovative process management software for state government agencies and businesses including an electronic vehicle registration solution.
Banker’s Toolbox – Based in Austin, TX, Banker’s Toolbox is a leading provider of Bank Secrecy Act anti-money laundering compliance and fraud prevention solutions for the financial industry.


Five Accel-KKR portfolio companies made add-on acquisitions over the last several months, including:


Oildex, a leader provided of revenue and expense management software to the oil and gas market, acquired the Procure-to-Pay (P2P) business of Automatic Data Processing.
HighJump, a global provider of supply chain management solutions, acquired Wesupply, a United Kingdom-based provider of supplier enablement and B2B integration solutions.
MEA|NEA, the leader in secure health information exchange for medical and dental providers, acquired The White Stone Group, Inc., a provider of healthcare communication management solutions.
Kerridge Commercial Systems, a global provider of enterprise resource planning software to the distributive trades, acquired Dancik International, a provider of software to the flooring and tiling industries.
Datapipe, a global leader in managed hybrid IT solutions for the enterprise, acquired DualSpark, an Amazon Web Services assessment, automation, and migration company.


Accel-KKR has achieved a series of successful exits recently including:


RiseSmart, the leading provider of contemporary career transition services, which was acquired by Randstad Holding nv.
On Center Software, a leading construction automation technology company, which was acquired by Roper Technologies.
Applied Predictive Technologies, a leading cloud-based analytics provider, which was acquired by MasterCard for $600 million.

Randstad Acquires Outplacement Innovator RiseSmart Accel-KKR | Sep 25, 2015


Silicon Valley-based outplacement provider secures backing of staffing giant to further capitalize on the rapidly changing workforce and propel its virtual and scalable model to the next level of growth.
SAN JOSE, Calif. – Sept. 25, 2015 – RiseSmart, the leading provider of contemporary career transition services, today announced that it has entered into a definitive agreement to be acquired by Randstad Holding nv (AMS: RAND), one of the largest HR services companies in the world.  RiseSmart will continue to serve its customers under the RiseSmart brand as an independent operating unit of Randstad focused on technology-led solutions.
By acquiring a leader in the fast-growing virtual outplacement space, Randstad is now better positioned to offer a more disruptive, progressive alternative to traditional services. The move underscores Randstad’s commitment to investing in emerging technologies while offering a more comprehensive suite of services to its clients.  RiseSmart, boasting a growing roster of clients with global footprints, is now even better positioned to serve them with the support of Randstad, whose operations represent more than 90 percent of the global HR services market.
“RiseSmart is an outplacement innovator and a perfect fit for Randstad,” said Linda Galipeau, CEO of Randstad North America. “We have evaluated numerous outplacement solutions in the United States and around the world, and we have come to the conclusion that RiseSmart is the best in class in terms of technology, service and results.  Adding RiseSmart’s offering to our portfolio aligns well with our mission of addressing the full workforce continuum through a single integrated approach, and matches the strategy of our Randstad Innovation Fund where we seek to anticipate and shape disruption of how employers engage the workforce.I am inspired about what we, together, will be able to offer our customers to strengthen employer brands, improve retention and re-engage talent.”
Since its founding in 2007, RiseSmart has emerged to challenge long-established players in the multi-billion-dollar outplacement market. The key to the company’s rapid rise has been its distinctive blend of innovative technology and personalized service, which helps put transitioning employees back to work more than 60 percent faster than the national average – and typically with equal or higher pay. Earlier this month, RiseSmart launched RiseSmart Spotlight, a wholly updated version of its flagship solution, which industry analysts have called “astonishing” for its innovation and utility.
“Becoming part of Randstad empowers RiseSmart to fundamentally accelerate our growth trajectory,” said Sanjay Sathé, RiseSmart founder and CEO. “We see growing opportunities for outplacement in North America and around the world.  Randstad is the leading player in the HR space and opens us to a vast set of clients and relationships, which bring greater opportunities.  Similarly, our proprietary technology platform provides a powerful alternative to what Randstad competitors have today.  It allows for technological agility, addresses the changing nature of the outplacement business and complements Randstad’s total suite of offerings.”
RiseSmart will remain in San Jose and Sanjay Sathé will continue to serve as RiseSmart’s president and CEO. Randstad is paying USD 100 million for the transaction, which is effective September 24, 2015.
RiseSmart’s growth since its founding has been fueled by funding from investors including Norwest Venture Partners, Storm Ventures, Accel-KKR and angel investors, who successfully exit with the transaction.

Datapipe Acquires DualSpark Accel-KKR | Sep 09, 2015


DualSpark’s expertise in migrating, automating, and running apps on AWS enhances Datapipe’s industry leading cloud enabled managed services
Jersey City, NJ – September 9, 2015 – Datapipe, a global leader in managed hybrid IT solutions for the enterprise, today announced it has acquired AWS assessment, automation, and migration company DualSpark. DualSpark’s AWS consulting services simplify the experience of moving apps and critical infrastructure to the AWS cloud.
“DualSpark has extensive cloud-native experience helping enterprises modernize and refactor applications around site and system reliability, distributed configuration management and automation at all levels,” said Robb Allen, CEO, Datapipe. “Datapipe has been consistently enhancing our AWS managed services offering for more than six years. Today’s acquisition is our latest step forward to help enterprises take full advantage of the AWS public cloud, all backed by Datapipe’s highly experienced, certified professionals.”
DualSpark was founded by former AWS managers who recognized that enterprises need expert advice and DevOps training to realize all the benefits of AWS’s rich cloud platform. Proven assessment methodologies, informed by the experience gained from hundreds of successful AWS deployments, combined with a focus on “Automation EverywhereTM” puts DualSpark at the forefront of enabling the transformation of traditional computing platforms to the AWS cloud.
“I truly believe that this combination of market-leading and client-obsessed AWS partners results in a very unique value proposition for enterprises seeking to take full advantage of the AWS cloud platform,” said Matthew Scott, Vice President, Public Cloud and Professional Services. “Combined we deliver the most complete set of cloud enablement services in the world.”
“Bringing the cutting edge DevOps and automation expertise from DualSpark together with the AWS management capabilities of Datapipe will bring an unparalleled level of support to our cloud clients,” said Patrick McClory, Director, Automation and DevOps.
This acquisition is the latest advancement for Datapipe as the company continues to gain momentum in the security, integration and management of multiple cloud platforms, including AWS, Microsoft Azure, and its own leading hosted private cloud, Stratosphere. Earlier this year, the company acquired GoGrid to enhance its one-button deployment for big data solutions, in addition to being named an AWS Managed Service Provider Partner and a leader in the Gartner Magic Quadrant for Cloud Enabled Hosting, North America.
Financial details of the acquisition were not disclosed.
