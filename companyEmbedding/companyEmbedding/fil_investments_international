History[edit]
It was established in 1969 [1] as an international investment subsidiary of Fidelity Management & Research, before becoming an independent business in 1980. Today, Fidelity International handles investments for clients in Europe, EMEA and Asia, while the US-based Fidelity Management and Research handles investments for clients in North America.
In the same year that it was established, an office was opened in Tokyo,[2] followed by London in 1973,[3] Hong Kong in 1981[4] and Taipei in 1986. In 1990 the first Continental European office was opened in Amsterdam,[5] when a number of Luxembourg funds for Continental Europe and Asia were launched. Expansion has continued, with Fidelity opening an office in India in 2001 and in China in 2004.
In 2012, chief investment officer Dominic Rossi expressed support for a UK government plan to allow shareholders to veto bonus deals for boardroom members in companies, using what The Guardian called "unusually confrontational language for a major investor more accustomed to operating behind the scenes".[6] Rossi has since campaigned to get UK long-term incentive plans extended from three years to five.[7]
As of 2013[update], Fidelity employs over 7,000 people in 24 countries around the world;[1] Australia, Austria, Belgium, Bermuda, Brazil, China (including Hong Kong), Dubai, France, Germany, India, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Korea, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Poland, Singapore, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Taiwan, Tunisia and the UK.
The company is privately owned; the majority of the company is owned by its employees, though the Johnson family still owns a substantial minority of 39.89% according to regulatory filings.[8]
Services[edit]
Fidelity offers its own funds and, through its platforms in a number of countries, other managers’ funds. It currently manages or administers over US$300bn on behalf of private individuals and institutions around the world, offering investors the opportunity to further their medium and long-term investment goals.[9]
Depending on location, Fidelity offer a range of active asset management solutions as well as large fund platforms offering access to Fidelity and other managers’ funds and services for personal investors. Fidelity provides solutions to the ISA, SIPP and Defined Contribution Pensions markets, both for domestic schemes, multinational employers and their staff.
Fidelity International Investment has around 300 portfolio managers and research professionals globally[1]. These investment professionals carry out in-depth analysis to uncover investment opportunities, following a bottom-up stock picking approach.[10]
Awards[edit]
Fidelity has been named Fund House of the Year, DC Provider of the Year at the UK Pensions Awards, and won the Premier Group Award at the Money Investment Trust Awards.[11] [12] [13]

About Fidelity International  About FidelityCareersRemunerationMediaHomeAbout usWho we are & what we do
Fidelity International offers world class investment solutions and retirement expertise. We are a privately owned, independent company, with the commitment and resources to provide the investment expertise, technology and service innovation needed to help our clients achieve their financial goals.
We invest USD $279 billion globally on behalf of clients in Asia Pacific, Europe, the Middle East, and South America. Our clients range from pension funds, central banks, sovereign wealth funds, large corporates, financial institutions, insurers and wealth managers, to private individuals. For institutional clients, we offer tailored investment solutions design and full-service asset management outsourcing.
In addition to asset management, we provide investment administration and guidance services for workplace benefit schemes, advisers and individuals in several countries, with USD $83 billion in assets under administration.
Our history
Established in 1969 as the international arm of Fidelity Investments, founded in Boston in 1946, Fidelity International became independent of the US organisation in 1980, and is today owned mainly by management and members of the original founding family.
Our investment philosophy & approach
Building on active, bottom-up research, we create the competitive advantage that is able to deliver superior returns for our clients. Because markets are only semi-efficient, we act on intelligent insight:

We have one of the largest global research capabilities with over 400 investment professionals and research staff around the world.
We are committed to proprietary insights: Our portfolio managers have access to in-house research, unavailable to others, on 90% of our fund holdings.
Our analysts carry out their research on the ground – visiting the shop floor, speaking to customers, competitors, suppliers, and independent experts to form conviction.
Over the course of a year, our portfolio managers and analysts attend more than 17,000 company meetings – or one every 10 minutes on average.
Our analysts work together across asset classes, e.g. combining insights from equity and credit research, to form a 360° view on the health and prospects of companies.
In addition, our analysts commission ~250 bespoke surveys or reports a year to understand the market potential of companies’ product and service innovations.
Our industry-leading technology platform gives our investment professionals mobile access to all research and reporting in one place. This includes risk monitoring, unique modelling, and forecasting tools. Portfolio Managers are also able to initiate trades anytime from anywhere for execution by our 24-7 global trading team.

This is how we find growth opportunities or income streams that have not been priced in by the market – allowing us to consistently add value for our clients.
How we run our business
We train many of our fund managers through our rigorous Portfolio Manager Academy programme. New portfolio managers initially manage pilot funds to test their ideas with our own money first. To our clients we offer tried and tested funds as a matter of principle.
Our portfolio managers are compensated on their long-term performance so that client and manager time horizons and interests are aligned. The same is true for our management, whose shareholdings are for the duration of their careers with the company.
It’s an approach that works: More than 200 awards across Europe and Asia in 2016 alone recognise the consistent strong achievements of our investment and client service teams. For example, we have won the Thomson Reuters Lipper ‘Best Overall Group’ award 36 times since 2002 in 13 countries.
