Book Review: I am MIXED

Posted by susan on November 26, 2013 · 3 Comments 

Book Review
I am MIXED by Garcelle Beauvais and Sebastian A. Jones. Illustrated by James C. Webster. Published by Stranger Kids (strangerkids.com)
Available at: http://www.strangercomics.com/I-Am-Mixed/

 
 
I am MIXED
 
This could be the perfect book for kids of any age. It could also be the perfect book for adults of any age. I am MIXED tells the story of twins Jay and Nia, but it’s so much more than the story of two multiracial kids.
I have to first say that the illustrations by James C. Webster are amazing. It’s so refreshing to see a picture book with great pictures! But, it’s not just a picture book; it’s much more. Preschoolers will love listening to the adults in their lives read the story and they can look for the fanciful “hidden” animals on each page.
I have noticed that most books about or for multiracial children become trite and preachy about how biracial kids are the best of both worlds. Not this one. It shows things light and dark and the beauty in both. It also deals with some common things our kids get asked like hair texture, and does it in such a way that presents it casually and naturally.
Four of my favorite pages read like this:
I am a Cuban painter with brush in hand.
I am a Haitian farmer healing the land.
I am a Chinese Dragon in search of Mars.
I am a Mexican sailor who travels afar.
The authors delve into different cultures with ease and grace. There is even a bonus family tree in the back of the book and an “about me” page that can both be filled in and individualized; fabulous additions!
Yes, this absolutely delightful book has everything. Although I would have preferred the terminology of “multiracial” rather than “mixed,” it does not take a thing away from the need for this book to be in every home and library.
