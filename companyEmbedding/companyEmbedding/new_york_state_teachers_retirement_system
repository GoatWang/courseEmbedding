Model-based institutional strategies typically invest across a broad spectrum of global fixed-income securities, as well as currencies, futures and swaps.

Alpha sources may include security selection, duration and yield curve positioning, industry rotation, asset allocation, and currency positioning. For institutional index strategies, BFM typically invests in accordance with the risk and return profile of the benchmark either by replicating the index, or utilizing security level or stratified sampling where the index is disaggregated into smaller cells in an effort to match the risk characteristics of each cell.The firm's equity platform includes a broad range of products that vary according to investment style (active, scientific and passive management), market-cap (small-, mid-, small/mid-, large- and all-cap), and geography (global, international and regional). The product range may also include sector funds, long-only and long-short portfolios, as well as products that combine different strategies to create balanced and asset allocation portfolios. For certain private investors and other SMA program, BlackRock creates and maintains 'target' portfolios of securities, to which securities are added and from which securities are removed from time to time.
