Process

Model 
						



Realize
						







We immerse ourselves in the problem to identify insights and opportunities.
We start with in-depth research—understanding the nature of the problem and studying human behavior. We then synthesize our findings to identify insights and areas of opportunity. The resulting vision serves as a springboard for concept generation.

UNCOVERING HUMAN INSIGHT Behaviors and needs influence how we think and what we design.









Through a rapid, iterative process, we create, test and evolve competing product concepts.
Multi-disciplinary teams of strategists, designers and technologists brainstorm concepts and prioritize features. We build prototypes based on the strongest ones, testing them with consumers and learning from the results. Because the process is iterative, we continually improve upon the ideas.

MULTI-DISCIPLINARY TEAMWORK We bring individual perspectives together in a collaborative setting.









We finalize and build the launch-ready product, then implement a plan for the future.
As we prepare to bring the product or service to market, we execute a combination of design, development and content creation to make it real. We then test it with customers, refine it, and create an optimization plan to analyze performance and user behavior post-launch.

Multi-Disciplinary Teams









		            <img src="_assets/img/rosace.png" alt="Strategy, Design, Technology">
		        




			Strategists, designers and technologists work together throughout the duration of a project.
			



						Each discipline is always involved, though at varying levels. We place greater emphasis on strategy up front, relying more heavily on design while concepting, and development during the build.						
					



					The office layout supports this collaborative approach. Strategists and designers sit next to developers and producers — there are no silos or barriers to overcome. Disciplines are in constant communication.

Men's ClothingGuys, it’s time to update your wardrobe. Luckily for you, we’ve got all the staples and on-trend pieces your closet needs. Explore men’s clothing (including big & tall sizes), plus shoes and accessories to create outfits tailored for every occasion. And if you’re interested in a few helpful styling tips, then check out our Men’s Guide to Style. Don’t worry, you can thank us later.
First, let’s keep it casual. The keys to a great laid-back wardrobe are to pick pieces that fit well, are comfortable and are versatile. T-shirts and tees are a great place to start. Plain tees are simple and can be worn with anything. Bonus? They can double as undershirts in a pinch. Graphic tees are an easy way to show off your personality. Go with versions that showcase your interests, rep your favorite sports team or just look cool. Finish your chill shirt collection with a few polos—they’re a more polished option and can easily be dressed down or up.
Now that you’ve got your list of classic casual shirts, it’s time to focus on refreshing your collection of shorts and pants. From cargos and chinos to denim, we’ve got you covered. When it comes to jeans, especially, grab a few pairs in various washes—think light, medium and dark. Feeling adventurous? Colored denim provides a fresh update to your look. From skinny and slim fit to bootcut and relaxed, fit matters and you should always pick pairs that suit your frame and that you feel good in.
Let’s move on to pieces you’ll need to dress to impress. Look pulled together with suits, dress shirts, undershirts and men’s dress shoes. Take the opportunity to mix and match with sport coats and blazers. Pair them with dress pants or jeans for a modern feel (but only if if the dress code is more lenient). Whether you’re headed to the office, a wedding or special event, your stylish clothes will speak for themselves. Don’t forget accessories. Grab a wallet, cuff links, ties, belts and more to round out your look.
Whether you’re dressed up or down, you’ll need to layer up when it’s cold outside. Our collection of jacket, coats and vest will keep you warm. Throw on cozy sweaters and sweatshirts into your look, and for even more warmth, stock up on hats, scarves and gloves. Stick with Timberland boots and thicker fabrics that help trap heat—think wool, leather, cotton and more.
Oh, and we can’t forget workout clothes. Whether you live at the gym or are just getting back into an exercise routine, you’re going to need a solid collection of activewear. And on rest days (and every evening), pajamas and loungewear will come in handy. We’re here to help you look great every hour of the day. Find helpful styling tops and tricks with Macy’s Men’s Guide to Style.
Who’s ready for a wardrobe refresh? Shop men’s clothing, shoes, accessories and more at Macy’s.Looking for huge savings? Shop our Black Friday, Cyber Monday and Holiday Gift Guide!
