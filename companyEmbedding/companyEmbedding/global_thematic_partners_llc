Global Thematic Partners Launches with $9 Billion under Management




Focus on Thematic Investing to Capitalize on Change around the World






August 09, 2010 08:30 AM Eastern Daylight Time



NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Global Thematic Partners, LLC (GTP), an independent investment 
      management firm that focuses on worldwide thematic investments, launched 
      with approximately $9 billion in assets under management. Based in New 
      York, the firm will be headed by Dr. Oliver Kratz, portfolio manager and 
      chief executive officer.
    


      The firm’s flagship strategy, the Global Thematic Equity product, is 
      focused on identifying enduring themes that influence the valuation and 
      cash flows of companies worldwide. GTP forms partnerships with both 
      traditional and non-traditional information sources, including industry 
      experts, academics, and companies around the world to identify and 
      capitalize on investable themes and opportunities.
    

      "Our singular approach is thematic investing, a powerful strategy that 
      we have refined over a period of many years to anticipate and capitalize 
      on discontinuity and global change," said Kratz. "We believe that big 
      shifts in economics, social science and – above all – natural science 
      are highly non-linear developments. Seeking inflection points on the 
      s-curve and uncovering hidden optionality are integral to our investment 
      process."
    

      Kratz brings more than 16 years of investment experience at companies 
      including Deutsche Bank and Bankers Trust. He will be supported by ten 
      experienced research analysts dedicated to the global thematic strategy.
    

      "The methodical and disciplined portfolio construction process that we 
      have developed involves rigorous reasoning and analysis to ensure that 
      capital is allocated to high-conviction situations that offer the most 
      risk-adjusted upside opportunity," Kratz added.
    

      GTP focuses on global thematic and agribusiness strategies, blending a 
      thematic framework with security-level analysis and customized valuation 
      techniques. The firm conducts primary research to identify investable 
      themes, with a current repertoire of 13 themes that provide clients with 
      diversification benefits and help create opportunities for 
      outperformance over a market cycle.
    

      The firm serves both institutional and retail clients globally, working 
      with institutional clients through separately managed accounts and 
      retail investors through sub-advised pooled funds.

	Company Overview

	Global Thematic Partners, LLC ("GTP") is an independent investment management firm with offices in New York and London. Our singular focus is thematic investment, a powerful approach that we have refined over a period of many years to anticipate and capitalize on discontinuity and change around the world. We believe that big shifts in economics, social science and – above all – natural science are highly non-linear developments; seeking inflection points and uncovering hidden optionality are hallmarks of our investment process. We couple thorough and independent research with risk management to seek long-term value creation for our clients. GTP serves select institutional clients in separately managed accounts, as well as retail investors through sub-advised pooled funds.

	 

	Investment Strategies

	Global / International Thematic Equity Product

	Our flagship thematic investment strategy is truly global in scope, and focused on identifying enduring themes that will influence the valuation and cash flows of select companies worldwide. Partnerships with both traditional and non-traditional sources, including industry experts, academics, trade journalists and over 1,200 company meetings per year enable us to identify themes, opportunities and risks early enough to capitalize on them. We conduct our own research and we have the benefit of patience: each of our 13 themes functions as a separate sub-strategy with low correlation, providing diversification benefits and creating opportunities for outperformance over a market cycle.

	Our theme filters — based on in-depth fundamental research and defined by quantitative and qualitative criteria — focus our research mission and guide us to investment opportunities. We then compile “short lists” for each theme based on comprehensive financial modeling and the application of geography-transcending cash flow metrics to assess valuation attractiveness. Our methodical and disciplined portfolio construction process involves spirited debate and rigorous analysis to ensure that capital is allocated to the high-conviction ideas that offer the most risk-adjusted upside opportunity. Risk management is a core discipline and a key element of our culture, and our approach is continuously evolving to the latest standard of knowledge. This approach has historically resulted in outperformance relative to our benchmark.

	Global Agribusiness Equity Product

	The investment case for global agribusiness rests on food security, discontinuity, scarcity, and the solutions to overcome them. The Global Agribusiness strategy is a unique investment vehicle that provides access to a diverse spectrum of agribusiness companies — from farm production to the end consumer — which spans several distinct asset classifications. We do not seek a high correlation with global soft commodity prices, as we invest along parts of the value chain. In fact, several of our agribusiness sub-themes benefit from lower crop prices. Our main objective is to invest in and equalize global inefficiencies, with a time horizon of at least 3 to 5 years.

	As the largest global equity investor across the agribusiness value chain, we have a unique vantage point which also gives us a credible voice with company managements and allows us to objectively evaluate their business decisions. By reviewing global markets and competitors, relevant assets, and internal structures and processes we are able to convey an objective business assessment to the respective managers of our investments. In addition, we are able to promote our ideas, including various types of operational and organizational corporate strategies.

	 

The information contained on this web site should not be considered a recommendation to purchase or sell a particular security. Past performance is not indicative of future results.

Investing in foreign securities, particularly those of emerging markets, presents certain risks, such as currency fluctuations, political and economic changes, and market risks. Deteriorating market conditions might cause a general weakness in the market that reduces the overall level of securities prices in that market. Portfolio management could be wrong in its analysis of industries, companies, economic trends and favor a security that underperforms the market.
