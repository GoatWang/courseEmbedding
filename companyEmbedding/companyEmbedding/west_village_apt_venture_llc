About Us



We're not brokers, we're owners. We live in the West Village ourselves, and we've been acquiring, renovating and leasing historic West Village townhouses since 2001. We treat each property as if it were our home and rent only to discriminating individuals and families who are looking for the romance and charm of 19th Century townhouse living with the amenities, finishes and service that urban residents expect today. 

Our apartments are represented by Matt Lesser of Leslie J. Garfield & Co.  Matt can be reached by email at mlesser@lesliegarfield.com or by phone at 917-754-7783.

Have a West Village townhouse you're looking to sell? Contact Rosalind Resnick, CEO of Double R Ventures LLC, at rosalind@double-r-ventures.com

 UC Davis West Village Rising It is largest planned zero net energy community in the U.S.  

 






      
          By UC Davis Staff on May 19, 2011 in University News 

 



Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom toured the UC Davis West Village site on May 19. "This is a demonstration of California's excellence in sustainability, and should set an example for the rest of the nation," he said. 









 



The largest planned zero net energy development in the U.S. is readying for its debut this fall.
Under construction on the campus of the University of California, Davis, UC Davis West Village is combining advanced energy-efficient design features with a high-efficiency solar power system to become the largest planned zero net energy development in the nation. (“Zero net energy” means that the community will put back into the electrical grid, annually, as much electricity as it consumes.)
UC Davis West Village is the product of an innovative public-private partnership between UC Davis and West Village Community Partnership LLC, a joint venture led by San Francisco-based Carmel Partners with their joint venture partner Urban Villages of Denver.
The collaborators gathered today in the poolside community room with public and industry officials, including California Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom, and toured the energy-efficient apartments. The first 315 apartments will be occupied by students, faculty and staff in September.
“I applaud UC Davis, SunPower Corporation, Carmel Partners and the California Energy Commission for their collaboration, dedication and leadership in developing the largest zero net energy project in the United States,” said Newsom. “This is a demonstration of California’s excellence in sustainability, and should set an example for the rest of the nation.”
Chancellor Linda P.B. Katehi said UC Davis West Village demonstrated the university’s unwavering commitment to sustainability and clean energy solutions.
“The West Village project is a prime example of how our campus researchers are working with industry and government on real-time, real-world solutions to improve and enhance our living communities and address California’s environmental problems,” Katehi said.
When complete, the 200-acre project is expected to house about 4,500 people, including students, staff and faculty.
Phase I of the project is currently being built. It includes apartments for 2,000 people in The Ramble and Viridian; an education center for Los Rios Community College; recreation and study facilities; a village square surrounded by neighborhood-serving retail; and 343 single-family homes for sale to faculty and staff.
“West Village is breaking ground by creating both a great place to live and a model zero net energy community,” said Nolan Zail, senior vice president for Carmel Partners. “Our guiding principles include affordability, environmental sustainability and quality of place. West Village will include housing, recreation and retail options, providing a convenient and eco-friendly lifestyle.
“Using aggressive energy-efficiency measures and on-site renewable energy generation to meet community energy demand, this holistic approach eliminates key barriers that once made it difficult to design and build large-scale sustainable communities,“ Zail added.
UC Davis West Village integrates sustainable design to enable those living in the community to reduce their reliance on automobiles, limit energy consumption and leverage the local climate. Low-energy-consumption design features maximize on-site water retention. Building designs optimize solar orientation, utilize energy-efficient appliances and incorporate materials from renewable sources.
A major element of the zero net energy plan is a 4-megawatt solar power system manufactured, designed and installed by SunPower Corp. of San Jose, Calif.
The solar system will generate the equivalent of 100 percent of the electricity needed for the rental apartments housing the first 2,000 tenants and the retail space. The system includes rooftop solar power installations and solar canopies over parking areas.
“We expect SunPower’s high-efficiency technology to reliably deliver enough clean, emission-free power to help West Village achieve its zero net energy goals,” said Jim Pape, president of SunPower’s residential and commercial business group. “We applaud the aspirations of this unique community, and are confident it will serve as a model for similar developments around the world.”
According to estimates provided by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the SunPower system will produce enough power to avoid more than 2,000 tons of carbon dioxide emissions per year, equivalent to removing 9,000 cars from California roads over the 25-year life of the system.
In addition to the SunPower system, UC Davis West Village integrates sustainable-design elements to exceed California Title 24 building code energy use standards by 50 percent.
• Every apartment building is built with energy-conserving components including solar-reflective roof materials, radiant barrier roof sheathing, high-efficiency light fixtures, thick 2x6-inch exterior walls for added insulation, and high-efficiency air-conditioning systems and appliances.
• On-site water retention is maximized and materials from renewable sources are incorporated.
• Architectural elements such as roof overhangs and extensive use of sunshades over windows are designed to mitigate the specific solar exposure of each building.
• Residents will have technology tools to enhance control of their own energy use, including programmable energy-management systems and SunPower monitoring, which provides information on solar-system power generation and electricity usage.
Energy experts from PG&E, Chevron Energy Solutions and Davis Energy Group have played key roles in the zero net energy planning and feasibility studies on this project.
Grant funding was provided by the California Energy Commission, the California Public Utilities Commission and the U.S. Department of Energy.
The project also draws on the nationally recognized expertise of UC Davis, particularly from its research centers, including the UC Davis Energy Efficiency Center, Energy Institute, Center for Water-Energy Efficiency, Western Cooling Efficiency Center, California Lighting Technology Center and Biogas Energy Project.
UC Davis West Village’s Phase I components include:
• The Ramble Apartments. Two-, three- and four-bedroom apartments for students are configured on 10 courtyards positioned along a central winding pathway. The adjacent 15,000-square-foot recreation and amenities facility provides pools; a sauna; fitness center; conference and study areas; and game and theater rooms.
• Viridian. One- and two-bedroom apartments overlook the village square.
• Retail space. West Village has 42,500 square feet of commercial space for neighborhood-serving retail and university offices surrounding the village square. Viridian units are all located above the retail space.
• Community college. The 60,000-square-foot facility opening in January 2012 will house the Sacramento City College Davis Center of the Los Rios Community College District -- the first community college center ever built on a University of California campus. There are also sites allocated for the Davis Joint Unified School District and a small day-care or preschool facility.
• Single-family homes. Available for purchase in 2012, 343 homes will help the university recruit and retain top faculty and staff. Ownership is intended for full-time employees of the university. A lottery system will be used to allocate houses to prospective buyers.
About UC Davis West Village
UC Davis West Village is the largest planned zero net energy  development in the U.S. By combining aggressive energy-efficiency measures with on-site renewable power generation that meets the energy demand of the community, West Village creates a new model for environmentally responsible living in a large-scale community. Located on the campus of the University of California, Davis, the development broke ground in August 2009, and is a public-private partnership between UC Davis and the West Village Community Partnership LLC, a joint venture led by Carmel Partners with their partner Urban Villages.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
