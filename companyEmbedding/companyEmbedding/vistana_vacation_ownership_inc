Well-Equipped Kitchenettes
Stylishly Furnished Living Area
Separate Dining Area
Resort Amenities









With these unique amenities, you'll feel right at home even when you're thousands of miles away. 










WHAT IS A VILLA RESORT?







A villa stay combines the conveniences of home with pampering amenities at Sheraton and Westin resorts. Villa resorts typically feature studio, one-bedroom/one-bath, and two-bedroom/two-bath villas ranging from more than 400 square feet to nearly 1,200 square feet in most destinations.

While staying in a villa resort, you can expect world-class resort amenities and in-villa features, such as fully equipped kitchens or kitchenette, separate living and dining areas with entertainment center, washer and dryer, and private balconies or patios in most villas. You’ll feel right at home even if you’re thousands of miles away.
Architectural details and designer décor combine to reflect the environment of the resort destination. At The Westin Kierland Villas, the quality and style of Westin blend to create an engaging setting of color and décor that defines the very spirit of the Southwest. On the East Coast at Sheraton Vistana Resort, the colorful and tropically influenced appointments reflect casual, yet fashionable Florida style.
Below are three sample villa layouts and a concise list of just some of the many amenities one would enjoy as a guest.

The Courts are newly renovated!!!!!!!  (Edited 2015)Our group of 14 stayed in two units in the 
courts.    The layout is so spacious and this 
section was quiet yet close to everything you 
could want.  It is an easy walking distance to 
the grocery store, Zimmie's Restaurant, the 
Karaoke pool, Putt Putt, Rec. Center.   We were looking for a particular item at the 
grocery store and they didn't have 
exactly what we needed but we told them 
that if we just had a cheese grater we could 
work it out with what they had.  The guest 
service person was standing at our door with 
a cheese grater when we got back to our 
unit.  GREAT SERVICE !!!  The staff was wonderful everywhere we went 
in the resort.  You could have a great vacation 
without leaving the resort.  This is one of the 
older units (the Courts) which means it is 
much more spacious than the newer ones.  
Units are in great shape.

This place is fantastic! All other resorts we visited are compared to the Vistana in accommodations, facilities, Activities and cleanliness!   We walk to downtown Disney every morning for our coffee and exercise.  So much to do, we go every year, and sometimes don't even visit the parks!   The Vistana is a destination in itself!   Highly recommend making it a family tradition.  Our extended family has been going every year for over thirty years!

This resort is the best I've been to by far. I've visited a lot of timeshares, but they all pale beside this.

We loved this resort. We stayed in the Cascades section overlooking the pool in a 2 bd/ 2 bath villa. It was very new looking and quite high end. We were so pleasantly surprised! With all the different pools, we had a different choice almost every day. The giant water slide was a great favorite of my kids. All the staff EXCEPT the timeshare selling staff were courteuous and quick to respond as needed. The timeshare staff was pushy, snobbish and would not take No for an answer.

Beautiful place. We had an amazing suite for 6-8. Great pools, very near Disney and H. Studios, and many other attractions. Make sure you have a GPS to get around. This place had such friendly workers. Make sure to tip the cleaning staff, they work their buts off, and deserve a very good tip. Enjoy, its such a beautiful and well kept resort. My then 3 yr old loved swimming past 10pm. It was his dream come true.  The smile on children's faces from around the world was heartwarming.  I would love to visit again, however only on the renovated side, so make sure that's where you'll be at.

This is a fabulous resort!  We had a 2 bedroom unit, it was beautifully furnished and maintained.  The kitchen was well stocked and the beds were comfortable.  The grounds are beautiful and the pool was great.  The market store on the resort was well stocked and the prices were reasonable.   The resort restaurant was good.  However, I suggest skipping the sales pitch, they are very aggressive and do not take no for an answer.  I simply wanted printed information about prices etc to take home and they would not give it.  Just received a very unprofessional, high pressure sale.

Great location.  Very close to 2 entrances to Disney World, yet also has a nice proximity to Sea World and the airport!The staff is very kind and do not hound you to buy a new timeshare if you simply tell them that you are not interested in taking the tour, or the "owner's update."The rooms have all been remodeled and are in great condition and very clean.

They had originally put us in palms which was not renovated and still looked like a late 70's unit. Broken thermostat, many bugs, dirty & smelled like mold.  We complained and the Manager we spoke to was extremely pleasant and changed our room.  However, we lost about a day and a half waiting to move to another room, so we felt displaced for a bit.  The new reno room was in the Falls and made up big time for the palms. Overall, loved it otherwise.

My wife and I went over to spend some time at one of our unit weeks in the Courts.  Unit K-88 is one of the units with a 2nd bedroom and loft upstairs.  It was still in beautiful shape for its age.  No spell and nothing broken.  This unit will be undergoing rennovation in the last phase early next year.  3 of my other four units have now been refrubished and they are as the ratings describe.  I can't wait for the work on my courts units to be complete.  I often rent out my units now that I live in Florida.  However, I still love to go over to enjoy the amenities and to play volleyball with the grandkids.  We enjoyed some exceptional games in the sand and the water.  The food we had at Zimmis was excellent but I still miss the discount coupons.  Loved the sauna and the not tubs.  Just walking the grounds every day relaxed me in a way no other resort does.  I love to travel but haven't found another resort that compares to Vistan for FAMILY FUN.  Try the Saturday night sing along at Zimmies and you will be surprised at the talent!

We had a refurbished unit in the Fountains section and it was wonderful.  The only drawbacks were: 1) they charged us for a rollaway bed, which we didn't have (hopefully we'll get a credit back to our card), 2) I would have liked a better cutting board and some place mats and potholders, and 3) the pool was too cold for me.  In all other respects it was fantastic.  We didn't attend a sales presentation.

We stayed in the Cascades section from March 22 - 28, 2009.  We had a great time. We stayed in a  2 bedroom - 2 bath unit on the 2nd floor, used the stairs mostly. I believe all the renovations in this building are now complete as of Nov. 2009. The view from our balcony was very relaxing. You could watch the fountain spraying water 30 feet in the air in the middle of the lake or watch the ducks and ducklings move about on the water. Having breakfast on the balcony and watching the sun rise was very peaceful. We did a tour of recently renovated units in various sections and they look terrific! Pools were great, workout areas were fine, usually not crowded in the evening. The main restaurant was OK. Happy hour prices at the main large pool were the BEST! The take out restaurants were excellent when we wanted something quick. It could be delivered or picked up which we did as it was no effort at all. The people we dealt with at the resort were very friendly (we bought discount Disney tickets) and we thoroughly enjoyed our time here. Once all the renovations are done to all the sections of this resort it will be even more outstanding.

We've owned in the Lake Section for many years now but mostly exchange it for other locations we'd like to visit.  This year we let our daughters and their friends use our unit.  I saw the pictures they brought home and it was beautiful.  They felt the pools were well maintained, the place was clean, and the staff was nice and helpful.  A month later my husband and I went, using banked time, and it was a pleasant experience, not having seen the resort in many years.  My advice would be to try to avoid the lure of free stuff to listen to their sales pitch.  We went to the Villages for our presentation.  The woman we got was extremely rude and pushy.  Where do they find these people?  We used the place not as a vacation, but to look for a vacation home to buy.  We put an offer on a home while we were there, making buying another unit out of the question.  But we still had to attend the presentation.  When I made it clear I wasn't buying anything due to our changed finances, she made us stay the longest she could just for spite.  I actually cried out of frustration.

Our recent vacation at the Sheraton Vistana was September 27-October 4.  We had purchased an even and odd year week at the Cascades section earlier this year, and were very anxious to see what we had bought.  Unlike the previous poster, we were aware that the every unit at the Sheraton Vistana was being completely refurbished.  Knowing this, we asked for a unit that had already been refurbished.  Although we could not use our unit at the Cascades section due to the remodeling, we were given a completely updated one in the Falls section.  The refurbishment of these units was not just a minor upgrade....the units were completely gutted (everything inside down to the studs).  You would have to see the results for yourself to truly appreciate the finished product.  Every unit has a  full kitchen with new appliances.  Granite counter tops can be found in the kitchen and both bathrooms.  All furniture is brand new and the beds are very comfortable.  The refurbishment for all units is to be completed in mid 2010.  The finished units are beautiful, and truly worthy of a 5 star rating.  The landscaping is a work of art.  Many large ponds are on the property and add to beauty of this resort.  Seven huge pools are available for use throughout the property.   Planned activities are also available.  My wife took part in an astronomy session and loved viewing the moon and nearest planets on two high powered telescopes.  The grand daughter was also thrilled with a dance class she attended.  The staff at the Sheraton Vistana should be commended for their friendly manner and willingness to help.  We had two minor problems at our unit while we were there, and cheerful service people responded within 5 minutes on both occasions.My wife and I thought so much of this property, that upon our return home, we purchased an annual unit in the Springs section.  This was not purchased through Sheraton Vistana's Starwood network, but through another internet site.  Although we do not get to enjoy the Starwood's inter network property trades, the price was much, much cheaper.  A word of caution here...make sure the unit you are buying has no refurbishment fees, which could run as high as $5000!  And if you are trading for a week at the Sheraton Vistana, INSIST on a refurbished unit.  I would also pass up the $50 for the sales pitch breakfast.  Not particularly high pressure, but not worth the time.  If you take this advice, I am sure you will fall in love with this property just as fast as the wife and I did.

My family and I stayed here from July 3, 2009 to July 10, 2009!  We will not stay here again. The rooms were very outdated and several things were stained badly or broken.  The faucet was broken, the fold out sofas were worn out.  The bed stood about a foot off of the ground which needless to say, the mattresses were worn out and thin.  The television buttons were broken.  Housekeeping came by once and she gave us fresh towells and made our bed.. once in seven days.  The dishwasher was missing some buttons. The whole resort was just dirty.  The sales rep that we met with about purchasing a timeshare on the second day of our visit was forceful and pushy as well as rude.  He told us we had only two hours to make up our minds about purchasing a timeshare with them or the rates would double.  I told him as a christian family we needed to pray about it and sleep over night and he short of mocked us and held out his hands and said pray now! And when we told him that we wouldn't consider making that kind of purchase without deep prayer and a night's rest he threw his hands up in the air and began to shove his paper work in his desk saying oh well then there is nothing I can do for you.  What a Jerk! Needless to say we spent as little time as possible there... We went to their (7) very chlorinated and hazy pools just twice hoping for a different outcome the second time.  I will say however the people who checked us in could speak English, and also the man who sold us our Disney Tickets however you might have a difficult time understanding some of the others.

Just stayed at this property week before Easter '09.  Traded in through RCI.  They always put you in the outdated rooms near the main 
road which tend to be very noisy!  Tried to get into a newer unit but was impossible. In addition to my recent RCI stay a few months 
earlier I 
bought a resale here.  
I looked at the units which have been updated which will be the case for the whole property by the end of 2010.  The new units are 
absolutely stunning.  Staying in an old outdated unit though was very depressing.  This is a question to ask when renting or buying here.  
You also have to pay $650 for reno charges for two years if you buy in now  which is for the updates/reno of the units.  I am happy to 
buy at this 
property with the updates in mind down the road for my future visits.  I have stayed at a few resorts now in the Orlando area and 
find 
the facilities on this property very nice.  You hardly have time to use many of the different facilities when combining all the theme park 
visits.  It has an outstanding kids pool with water spraying up all over the pool which keeps toddlers quite amused. This part of the pool 
in only about a foot deep but you do have to watch the little ones since one side leads to about two to three feet of depth.  Still the 
littles ones spend hours here since it is such a large pool area for toddlers.  One of the best I have seen.  I would compare this to the 
best I have seen.  Great price for drinks at the bar at happy hour.  You do pay for everything on this property eg $9 per person to shuttle 
to disney and the other parks.  Also quite a walk to get from most units to the pools in most cases since there are two thousand units 
here.  Property is beautiful and well maintained.  Can take ten minutes to get a person on the phone when you need to ask a question 
or if you leave a message no calls are returned.  BEWARE when they say two hours for the timeshare presentation these are real pros 
when it comes to selling.  NOTHING IS FREE!  you will spend more time there and it is hard saying no to them since they are real 
selllers/sharks to get you to buy or upgrade or beware of the EXPLORER PROGRAM. TOTAL RIPOFF.  $1600 or so for 30000 spg points plus 
four nights at another resort in North Carolina. 30000 spg points only gets you three 
nights at a category 4 eg Westin. They also give you a 50% off rack rate at any spg hotel ....that works out to similar prices of the spg 
promotional prices on their website or other sites like expedia. So beware of the "Explorer" angle.  I went in to the presentation having 
just bought a resale and they said it is 
only an hour to update on what the resort has.  $50 for this "update"...right, it actually turned into three hours of vacation time. The 
Explorer adds an hour since they tell you they are not selling you the timeshare at that point.  What a dis-
service to the SPG brand.  I feel like switching everything over to another hotel chain when I travel on business now after this ordeal.  
They are 
good so be warned that $50 or another bonus for free is really not worth your time.  I have to admit staying in the palms unit by the 
road really upset me so make sure you understand where your unit is.  This will be updated in 2010 sometime from what they told me.  
The outdated units were fine considering it was an exchange that didnt cost me much at all but it was still not the level you would 
expect from Sheraton! Quite depressing colors and decor but huge rooms and clean enough.  Read the reviews thats all I can recommend 
and you will get a better idea of what many people think.  I am sure once this resort is all updated it will be a great place to stay!

Wow, I thoroughly enjoyed our trip to Disney this time.  We went during 
food and wine festival in November and decided to stay at this resort 
instead of onsite despite the fact that I'm a DVC member.   I was able to pick 
up a week on an RCI last call.  Well when we first checked in like most people 
who got stuck with the older units we weren't particularly impressed but not 
that unhappy either.  The only problem was that after the first night it 
seemed that the unit had bed bugs so the staff was gracious enough to 
move us to a brand new unit.  So here is the wow factor.  Granite counter 
tops, tumbled marble in the baths, a nice jacuzzi in the master, 3 plasma 
giant screen TV's and even a BOSE stereo system.  Everything was bolted 
down understandably but it was so nice to stay in this modern "New York" 
loft style condo that we were sad when the week was over.  The kitchen is 
amazing, real wooden cabinets and granite counter tops all new appliances, 
we actually made omlettes and pancakes it was so inviting.  Our unit had a 
nice balcony overlooking a tranquil lake with a fountain.  I have no 
complaints about our improved unit and the staff was very friendly.  The 
timeshare pitch was a bit of a scam because we were told we could get $25 
off all our tickets to the parks but it was only off certain tickets like the 7 
day passes not the one day passes so we ended up buying 3 day passes for 
Florida residents cheaper.  Stay here you will like it.  It's real close to Lake 
Buena Vista.

We just returned from 2 weeks at the Sheraton Vistana - and WOW.  We went with 
RCI and requested a 'stayover' in the same room for our 2 week stay and were put in 
a renovated unit in the Fountains and it was amazing. We had a ground floor unit that 
opened up to a playground and the beautiful pool area - perfect for our kids. The only 
concern was that the washer/dryer are small and therefore had to do a load of 
laundry each night and they were noisy and located between the 2 bedrooms.I was concerned about staying here after reading many reviews, but once all units are 
renovated, this will be an amazing vacation spot for anyone to enjoy!We do recommend a car rental, even though the resort is within 5 minutes of Disney, 
you have to see other attractions in the area such as Universal, Gatorland, Fun Spot 
and of course Kennedy Space Centre.Many great restaurants in the area, but especially recommend Bahama Breeze and 
Landry's Seafood - excellent.

We just returned from our week long stay 
at Sheraton Vistana.  We have owned 
since 1998.  We usually try to go back to 
Vistana every year.   We love the 
atmosphere at Vistana.  We have found 
our favorite unit that overlooks a beautiful 
pool scene.  We ask for that unit each 
time and have been successful at getting 
the unit requested.  The only thing about 
requesting a certain unit is that you may 
have to wait to check-in.  We prefer an 
early check-in.   We own 3 timeshares and 
this one is our favorite.  I would 
recommend it to anyone.  All the units are 
getting updated either this year or next 
year.  By the end of 2009, they all should 
be in top condition.

I have just returned home from this resort and I do have to say our room in the Lakes section was 
gorgeous. They have just been completely redone and they make the Cascades sections of this 
resort look totally run down. I am also a Cascades owner and have just been informed that they are 
going to be refurbishing them once the other areas of the resort have been done (Fountains I &II, 
Springs and Falls. The Courts section is also going to be done in 2010 by then this resort will be a 
gold star resort and every part of it except (Palms) will be brand new and no one will have a reason 
to complain about the villas. In previous readings it has been said that some amenities you have to 
pay for well many resorts that offer what this one does you will have a $$ expensive to pay for your 
fun. If you don't like the golfing-minu putt then don't golf! If you have ever been to Orange Lake 
you have to pay for everything there its all in the "holiday fun package of family travel". This resort 
is so central to everything, restaurants, Prime outlet mall, Disney , grocery store, pharmace and 
liquor store right next door. It has several restaurants some with pool side service and some 
without if you want drinks or food at one of the pools then go to the one that offers it. Personally 
we love the Fountains pool its quiet and not hardly any kids especially when our children are 
teenagers and they don't want to be around alot of noise. The Cascades pool is FULL of children so 
if you want kids then thats the pool to go to. I am an owner of 5 Timeshares and have stayed at 
many in Orlando and for what you get and location you WILL not find a better resort, The pools are 
open until 1:00 am all Hiltons close at 11:00 so that doesn't work for our family also it does not offer 
more than a few simple activities and its really no fun for teenagers as nothing to do there. We 
love the Sheraton Resort and go there 4 times per year and now our oldest goes on her own . So 
do your homework before you travel and check out the websites as its unfair to complain about 
anything when you have the option of knowing about it before you go. Its funny people will spend 
hundreds of dollars on Disney parks and food there but when it comes to a $5 golf mini putt game 
it's like its a million dollars to golf.. so enjoy this resort to the fullest and forget about the small 
extras that go with it. Its all in the memory of a great vacation.So if you want to pick the nicest 
areas now it goes like this- Lakes-gorgeous-Fountains I- beautiful (no M/B Whirlpool)-Fountains II- 
Gorgeous (whirlpool in M/B)- Springs and Falls are next by the end of 2009 then Cascades and 
Courts 2010. So instead of asking for Cascades try the others you will be happy with 3 Digital tv's 
while eating breakfast at the marble top counter sitting on bar stools listening to the Bose Stereo 
sytem! You will truly love it . I guarantee you won't stay in Cascades again once you have been in 
these new units.

We own two units in the Lakes and Falls 
section of this 
resort.  One July 4th 
week and one Columbus Day week.  We love 
it here.  Less than a mile from Disney 
entrance.  We can sit on our balcony and 
watch the fireworks nightly at Disney.  Our 
units are two bedroom, two full bathroom, 
spacious, beautifully decorated 1100+ sq ft 
units that sleep 8 comfortably.  Trading power 
for these units are incredible.  We have 
traded to ski at Beavercreek in Colorado and 
Tahoe, and scuba dive in Maui, Cancun and 
Cozumel. The renovations are spectacular and 
we can't wait to go back there this July 4th.  
The staff is awesome and always ready to 
help with any need you may have.  The pools 
are beautiful and with teenage children, they 
stay busy all day at the resort.  We love it 
here.

Just stayed at the Vistana.  I rented a week from an owner.  Asked for 
the Cascades a month in advance (as the paperwrk suggested).  It was an 
OK stay.  The unit was outdated but clean.  Was first assigned to a really 
old unit in the Courts but the cleaning solution smell was so strong, we 
had to leave.  The staff at the desk was very accomodating, and asked us 
to look at another unit.  That unit was ok, but was a total mess (hadn't 
been cleaned yet).  Finally settled into the third unit that was in the 
Fountains II section.  The outside stairs up to the unit could use a simple 
powerwashing. The unit itself was clean, just outdated.  Freshly painted 
and wallpapered. Large in size. Shaded location, relatively quiet. 
Convenient parking. Got maid service mid-week, plus a supervisor follow 
up to make sure we were happy.The service was friendly, just a call every day to invite us to a "free" 
breakfast (where they try to sell you a unit).    The heater in the 
Fountains pool was broken. Got a nice voice mail saying it would be fixed 
(after we left).  Used other pools which where nice but only certain 
pools have towels available.  No poolside drink service.The small mini golf course was not worth the $5 charge per person---it 
should be free since it was completely boring.Overall, I would have preferred the Cascades newer models and pools. I 
recommend being assertive and not taking a really old unit.

VISTANA is the GREATEST. I have owned a vista in Vistana for over 10 years. You cannot go wrong 
with ANY of the facilities. The older units (Courts and Falls)are actually more private than the 
newer units. These are only two story resorts and much better parking facilities. The entire resort 
is open to everyone. We swim at every pool, visit all parts of the complex and enjoy it immensely.   I have visited many other timeshares from coast to coast. The service levels at Vistana are the 
best. The atmosphere is very family oriented. No pressure sales pitch if you choose. Excellent 
accommodations for young and old alike. I't always been rated as a gold crown unit and always will.   It sure doesn't hurt that it sits besides "the happiest place on Earth". Disney, Epcot, Universal, 
City walk, Seaworld, Daytona, NASA are all within easy reach.   Enjoy your stay....I'll say hi to you and welcome you when I see you at Vistana.....

I have owned in the Courts for more than 20 years.  They have been updated 
recently, and the units are larger than the newer ones.  The staff is very 
friendly and versatile.  There are so many activities that we don't see the 
older children until late in the evening.  There are many, many attractions 
nearby that all ages thoroughly enjoy!  I highly recommend this resort.

WE HAVE OWNED HERE at VISTANA SINCE "1982", AND USE IT EVERY YEAR.  
WE HAVE TAKEN ALL OF OUR CHILDREN DOWN ALONG WITH THEIR FRIENDS, 
NOW WE ENJOY IT W/OUR GRANDCHILDREN AND THEIR FRIENDS, ALONG 
W/FAMILY. 
IF THERE IS EVER A PROBLEM THEY FIX IT ALMOST IMMEDIATELY.
I HIGHLY RECOMEND THIS RESORT.
THEY KEEP UP W/THE UNITS AND THE GROUNDS.  THEY ARE IMMACULATE.
IT IS VERY CLOSE TO DISNEY, SHOPPING ETC. 
IT IS ALSO A GATED COMMUNITY, AND YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT 
THE CHILDREN. 
THEY HAVE SOMETHING GOING FOR EVERYONE, EVERY DAY IF YOU WANT.  
YOU DO NOT HAVE TO GO INTO TO THE PARKS TO ENJOY YOURSELF.
TRY IT--YOU WILL LIKE IT!

We have just returned from a week at the SHERATON
VISTANA RESORT . The hotel is magnificent and we
have never experienced such incredible service
before. It was so lovely that it was hard to drag
ourselves away from the hotel to go to the theme
parks at all. In fact we didn't bother with Disney
, having been before and just did a few trips to
Universal. It was so hot and busy there, we
couldn't wait to get back to the peace and
tranquility of the hotel.WE STAYED IN A 2 BED ROOM
THEY MUST HAVE REDONE THEM AS OF LATE THEY WERE
LIKE NEW FLAT SCREEN TV AND DVDS WOW WHAT A NICE
PLACE TO STAY .The pools are lovely, AND BIG Our
kids are 11 and 13 and they enjoyed it. The pool
attendants were wonderful .Overall I would say
this is probably the best hotel we have ever
stayed in on holiday and I am extremely fussy!
Perhaps not the most convenient if all you want to
do is theme parks, but if you want to mix a little
luxury with the odd trip to the parks then this is
an absolute must. PS-Restaurants are great.

My husband, myself and another couple along 
with their daughter stayed the week of July 
27th - August 3rd.  We stayed in the 
Cascades area which I was thankful for after 
walking around and seeing how old looking 
that the other areas were.  But you could 
start seeing the wear and tear even in the 
Cascades.  But overall it was ok.That was the good side.  My husband and I 
have stayed at other resorts and have never 
had to pay for the amenities.  Here, you have 
to pay for everything that you want to do 
except swim.  If you are an owner you have to 
pay $4.00 each to play miniature golf in a 
really tired looking course.  Your money is 
much better spent somewhere else.That is not even the worst of it.  All week we 
had someone above us that was up all night 
yelling, running, and just being rude.  We 
called Security every night for the week that 
we were there.  Nothing stopped.  We even 
would call during the day and were told that 
management would get back with us and no 
one ever did.  The last night we were there I 
called it did not stop, I called an hour later 
and this person put me through to Security 
and they said that the first person never 
contacted them.  So it makes me wonder if 
they had ever been contacted the other times 
that week.  My husband and the other 
gentleman that we were with had 2 hours of 
sleep before making a 14 1/2 hour drive 
home.  All we got was a sorry and our 
exchange fee back.I would never stay here again.  While the 
grounds are nice, there are much nicer places 
to stay that will take care of their guests.

Stayed here the last week of June.  Great 
Resort.  Kids loved the pools.  Staff was very 
helpful.  Very quiet and peaceful.  Room was 
very clean.  Everything was very close and 
easy to get to.  If you are coming to Orlando, 
this is a great place to stay.

This is a hidden Gem! The location is central, 
convenient to everything, I 4, International 
Drive, Outlet malls, Disney, etc. The resort is 
clean family oriented, everything you could 
want is in the resort, great variety of pools, 
rec centres, restaurants, tennis, mini golf, etc.We have stayed here the last two years 
(March 06 & Feb. 07) and have been totally 
pleased with the service and aminities!

We had a mini family reunion in Orlando and 
rented 3 units in the Cascades section at 
Sheraton Vistana Resort.  We had a total of 6 
children ages 2 - 14 in tow.  I was a little 
concerned because of some of the previous 
reviews I read but decided to go anyway.  We 
were very pleasantly surprised!  Check in was 
a breeze.  A very nice young man walked us 
to our units(all in same building across from 
the pool) and made sure we were satisfied.  
The units were spacious, clean and nicely 
furnished.  The pool was spectacular and we 
had a hard time getting the little ones out of 
the kiddie pool section which was huge.  The 
location of this property in relation to Disney 
was a big plus--we were only a 5 minute drive 
to Disney and there was plenty of shopping 
and restaurants in the vicinity.  The staff was 
extremely polite and eager to please.  As a 
result, we are now looking to buy a resale in 
the Cascades section of the Vistana resort!

I had 3 units week before x-mas 2006. resort 
is great. Very well maintained. Units very clean 
and not run down.Anyone who reads this must know this, all 3 
partys we traveled with called before we went 
down there to verify a shuddel service to get 
to the parks and was told yes. But when we 
got there is was only for hotel guest. Forgot to 
tell us that part. I thought if you offer it and 
was going there anyway who cares where you 
are on the property. Also when we called up 
front for a taxi to goto downtown disney, they 
told us in 15 min., we waited a hour and no 
show. So we complainted to the front desk 
and they kept hanging up on us as soon as 
they knew it was us calling again to find out 
where out taxi was.Staff a little pushy on check in for there free 
breakfast(sell you a unit breakfast). Kept 
calling room and leaving messages. Other than those small issues, everything was 
great. if returning to florida again withfamily 
would go back to this resort. One great thing is a few of the pools are open 
to 1 a.m. Pools and pool area very clean. they 
use alot of clorine. so if this bothers you, don't 
get in.travel times. disney is very close. you can get 
to almost all disney parks within 5 min. 
universal is about 10 min. away. also close to 
kissimmee under 5 min away.

Dec 06--2 weeks before and after Christmas in 2 different 2 
bedroom,2 bath condos. The resort is very beautiful--many gorgeous heated pools, hot 
tubs, exercise rooms, and many activities, especially for children.First week was in the Fountains, first floor just in front of a huge 
pool. We asked for first floor because there are no elevators in the 
older sections--just in the Cascades and the Lakes (Starwood 
owned). Some of the buildings have three floors and we don't do 
stairs well. The condo was clean and well decorated. Jacuzzi in master 
bath with separate walk in shower. The bed was hard and the sofa 
and overstuffed chair in the living room were broken down so that 
you sank to the bottom when you sat. The kitchen had adequate 
dishes to eat out of, but was very sparse on cooking utensils and 
no mid size microwavable bowls.Second week was first floor in the falls. Redecorated, clean, and 
pretty, with a good mattress, and comfortable sofa and chair in 
living room. The kitchen utensils were even sparser--had to cook 
veggies for two in a spaghetti for 10 size pot. Master bath had a 
nice dressing area with lav, but shower was inside the jacuzzi with 
sliding doors which made it difficult to access (we are in our 
seventies) and the shower in second bath was also inside the 
regular size tub--no problem getting in and out of this.The two newer sections of the resort--Cascades and Lakes are the 
only two owned by Starwood, and they are realy nice. We were 
supposed to get the Cascades the first week, but were told not 
enough owners turned in their weeks for us to get there.The Fountains, Falls, and other sectiions of the resort are owed 
and operated by owner's associations. This explains the disparities 
mentioned here in various ratings.We took the tour, and were not pressured at all. We already own 
enough resort points so we declined. I would rate the resort a four star, and I am sure the Starwood 
parts are five star.

We stayed in the Cascades section of Vistana and couldn't have 
been happier.  It was very spacious, clean and a perfect location 
for both Disney and MGM.  We visited all the areas of the resort 
and liked the Lakes section as well. I see that many who stayed in 
the older sections of the resort weren't as happy.  If you have a 
choice ask for Cascades or Lakes.I have teenagers so I was a little worried they would be bored 
when they weren't in the parks.  There was so much to do they 
were happy to have 4 days in the resort.I would definately go again.

Visited 8/20-8/27 and was given a 2bd 
(sleeps 8) in the Falls section. I was informed 
by the front desk that the room was recently 
refurbished. Well here goes, - THE BAD: the sheets had stains, the blankets 
had holes (no kidding) and I told my kids not 
to use the comforters (only god knows). The 
doors on the showers were broken and the 
shower heads were coming off the walls IN 
BOTH BATHROOMS. I washed the linens prior 
to using and the stains did not come off. In 
the kitchen there were 8 DISHES, a few 
bowls, 1 frying pan, 1 pot 1 baking dish, 6 ash 
trays - you get the picture here. the room was 
clean but quite dated with pink walls, and 
heavy, heavy, floral drapes not curtains. on 
Wednesday, we were given a complementary 
cleaning. ok, the kitchen floors appeared 
clean, but were STICKY, and the stained 
sheets were still on the bed. NUFF SAID. I 
attended their timeshare and they tried to sell 
me a 2 bed. in the new Vistana Villages for 
$23K, however, since I was staying in the 
Sheraton Vistana, I was NOT ALLOWED TO 
USE THE NEW CLEAN POOLS AT THE VISTANA 
VILLAGES. I also, found out that RCI is 
considered 3rd class on the Sheraton Vistana 
list of guests. I was told 2x in one week by 
the staff. We did not use the facilities on the 
property .. thank god the weather was 
working on our side. I WOULD NOT RETURN. 
WENT TO ORANGE LAKE COUNTRY CLUB TO 
ENJOY THEIR FACILITIES.

I exchanged from a Gold Crown 2 week in 
Cyprus (which is highest demand by RCI 
standards), to a 25 year old 2 bedroom 
apartment in the Courts area of the resort.The resort itself was all I could ask for, but the 
standard of accommodation I was given was a 
big disappointment. I also feel the way the 
manager promised me an upgrade (at my 
expense) then never got back in touch was 
lousy customer service. On top of that the 
pressure as soon as you check in to go to a 
presentation on Starwood Vacations was 
terrible. I told the gentleman that I was not 
interested in another timeshare but I had to 
walk away from the representative as he 
could not take no for an answer.If you are exchanging like I did, ensure 
through your exchange company you get 
accommodation in the Cascades or the Falls. 
Not in the Courts or you will be hugely 
disappointed!!!

We love this resort.  We visit Orlando evey 
year for the month of April and have visited 
lots of RCI resorts.  This by far is one of the 
nicest ones we have been to. The activites staff ( lacking clear english) are 
wonderful with the kids.  They are very 
friendly and my kids loved them.  We stayed in one of the older units the 
Springs.  Other than the mauve tile in the 
master bathroom it was all updated.  THE 
master bed was sooooooo comfortable.  The 
unit itself is a little smaller than most two 
bedrooms we have stayed at but still large 
enough.  I liked how the second bedroom and 
the living room are far enough away from the 
master bedroom. If you can stay here jump at the chance.  They 
have so much to do for kids of all ages. Our 
clan ranged from 19-5.  ENJOY hope you have 
as much fun as we did.Can't wait to return next year.

Hey, this is by far the choice place to stay for 
anyone who wants it all. I own there for over 
20 yrs. and have had great exchange powers 
because of it's location and of it's Gold Crown 
Rating. I have been given 3bd/rms in kaui, on 
a golf course, with a wraparound deck for my 
week. I have even been offered 2 and 3 
weeks at other places for my week. They 
simply don't come any better.

My husband 2 yr old Son and I just returned from 
our 4 day stay in the fountains section of the 
resort.  This is an older section of the 
resort.  The furnishings are not quite as plush 
as the cascades section which is the new section 
that Starwood actually built.  The other 
sections are the ones that Starwood acquired and 
it is quite obvious.  Some of the other older 
sections looked quite dumpy.We were in a 2 BR unit.  Very spacious.  Had 
everything you could possibly want.  Downside of 
the fountains section is that it is right next 
to the highway.  So there is a lot of highway 
noise.  I think they have the fountains to mask 
the noise.  We were there on a free stay for a timeshare 
sale of the Vistana Villages.  They were not 
pushy at all. After touring the Vistana Villages 
it made this place look like a dump.We thought that going to Disney in January would 
be less busy.  Boy were we wrong.  It was 
freezing and tons of people and traffic.  I 
don't think there is a good time to visit Disney 
anymore.

Upon checking in we waited in line while two 
employees at the desk checked guests in and out. 
We waited about twenty minutes which was not bad 
considering how well they do explaining 
everything about the resort.What upset me was 
across from the check in desk was the Starwood 
timeshare sales desk with 9 employees trying to 
sell you a timeshare(so now I know where the 
focus is) The room was in the Fountain section 
which is older. Was just ok, the bathrooms were 
dirty and the Master bed had no sheets,what was 
completely disgusting was our blanket 
with black hair all over it and a stain of feces 
on it. We called the front desk and told them 
our problem, they said they would send someone 
up as soon as possible although they were very 
busy. Again back to the 9 behind the sales desk 
and two helping the guests. We had to call again 
two hours later and finally they showed up. We 
never heard from a manager or received any kind 
of apology until we went on the timeshare tour 
and told them.
Overall the property is gorgeous. The pools are 
great and the activities staff were excellent.We 
never complain nor do I ever take the time to 
write reviews. Needless to say we will not 
return.

I recently spent a week at the Vistana at the 
end of August. My family and I had a great time. 
We stayed in the Palms section this time around. 
It's an older unit but still had all the 
amentities of the newer sections and talk about 
spacious. It's the most relaxed I've ever been 
on vacation. I loved it so much that I just 
purchased a 2BR in the Fountains Section. I look 
forward to spending vacations at this resort.

We own week 12 and 36, and LOVE this resort. Our unit in the Fountains has just been renovated
(they are working their way through the whole
resort) and is beautiful. Any problems we may have
had in the unit had been promptly fixed.  The pool
was a little crowded but it was Easter week and
when we go other times it isn't bad. The
Kids/teens LOVE it because there is lots to do and
lots of other kids their age there. Great family
vacation.  They even turned down Disney a couple
of days so they could stay back and enjoy the
activities and pool, which was fine with me, I had
margaritas at poolside!!!

Just returned from the 4th of July week at the 
Sheraton Vistana-Cascades.  We rented a time 
share unit and were very satisfied with the 
resort.  The 2BR villa was more than adequate, 
had everything we needed, washer/dryer,ironing 
board and iron, hair dryers....full kitchen w/ 
all utensils, spacious and seemed 
very new.  Everything worked fine, no problems. 
Resort is very nice, safe and the staff is 
friendly.  Many pools to enjoy, however, very 
tired after disney parks. Very close to disney 
parks,restaurants, malls etc.  Can't wait to 
return!

Our 18th year at Vistana. Just spent two weeks in
the Lakes section. 1st floor unit near both the
Lakes pool and the Fountains pool. What a great
time we had. Our three children had tons to do on
property. And of course the resort is close to all
the major attractions. Absolutely gorgous grounds. Mature trees and
lanscaping everywhere. Although Vistana is a
fairly large property it still feels very
intimate. We have stayed at other top notch
resorts and Vistana is our favorite by far.

As an owner since 1982,my family has never had

(135 acres of ponds,foliage,etc.)alone make this 
resort an oasis! Their 7 swimming pools,and 6 
recreation rooms guarantee that family & friends 
will NEVER be bored! From sun up to after 
dark,this resort is a paradise for vacationers 
of ALL ages!

The best thing about this resort is its 
location.  Without having to get on a major 
roadway, you can be in Disney.  That said, we just finished a week in a Cascades 
unit.  During that week, it took 6 hours to 
resolve an electronic door lock malfunction, our 
diswasher leaked, our washing machine stopped 
running, and the toilet backed up.  Luckily, we 
spent most of our time out of the unit.  This 
was especially true since the few times we 
wanted to go to the pool, the deck was 
completely full.If you are looking for a convenient place to 
park while visiting Disney, this will work, but 
if you hope to enjoy the facilities, I'd suggest 
looking somewhere else.

We stayed in the Springs section last summer.  
While not as new as the Cascades section, they 
are directly next to them and in great 
condition.  The Springs has a great location 
since they are very close to the large Cascades 
pool, but also have their own recreation center 
and pool.Our top-floor, 2 BR unit in the Springs was 
large and very nice.  Vaulted ceilings, a huge 
back screened-in porch, and full kitchen with 
everything you could possibly want.  Each unit 
in the Springs also has a back entrance from the 
porch which adds to the spacious feel.Given the amenities of the resort and the 
location of the Vistana, I don't think you will 
find a better off-property resort when planning 
a WaltDisneyWorld vacation.

Our extended family just stayed in two units, 
each sleeping eight, the week between Christmas 
and New Years.  The units were extremely 
comfortable, and we had plenty of room to spread 
out, which was important since we had five young 
children with us.  It was only a short drive to 
the WDW parks, and there were grocery stores and 
restaurants very close by.  One thing I want to 
caution about - don't even think about trying to 
stay at the resort without a car.  They do offer 
minimal transportation to and from the parks, but 
only a few times a day, and it would be very 
difficult to try to adhere to their 
transportation schedule.  You REALLY NEED YOUR 
OWN CAR if you are planning to go to the parks.  
I cannot emphasize enough, however, how 
comfortable the units were.  Without going into 
detail, lets just say you'll be very happy.

My family and I stayed at the Vistana Resort in 
May of 2004. We are owners at the Vistana 
Village and decided to give the resort a try. 
We were very pleased with the resort 
accomodations and found the service to be 
fine with the exception of housekeeping. The 
resort has many more amenities than the 
Vistana Village has to offer and with the many 
separate sections, we tried a different pool 
almost daily. The location was certainly very 
convenient to Disney which we enjoyed 
immensely. As to whether I would return 
there, we just booked another vacation in 
March to the resort in hopes of finding warm 
weather and an opportunity to catch a Yankee 
pre-season game.

everything.  Pools are great especially the 
super pool.  Our unit in the Fountains Section 
was very clean and kept up...no 
disappointments here.  Great family resort 
with friendly, courteous employees.  We really 
loved going on the "Casino Cruise!".

Wow! The Vistana is a wonderful place to stay!
As a single parent I felt very safe at the 
Vistana, with plenty of security and wonderful 
amenitites for the children.  We stayed on the 
Fountains area of the resort, with the pool at 
the end of the road.  Our wonderful 2 bed villa 
was spacious, clean and very well appointed, 
it felt very much like home! The dive-in movies 
at the pool were a great hit with the kids.  The 
staff at the Sheraton were wonderful, and 
although we had only a small problem with our 
VCR, they were there in 10 mins to collect it 
and replace it.  What service!  As a Brit, I am thoroughly impressed with the 
Vistana, and cannot wait to return there next 
year, for me there is no where else in Orlando 
that I would stay!

We stayed here twice, in summer 1998 for two 
weeks and again in fall 2002. I loved 
everything about this resort.For our first stay, we were in an older 2 BR 
unit along the lagoons and loved the location 
so much that I requested it again when we 
returned in 2002.  I much prefer a ground floor 
location with  easy access to the street or 
paths along the lagoons, than to be in a high 
rise. We had ducks at our back door which the 
kids enjoyed a lot and were able to walk along 
the lagoons and see herons and other water 
birds very close up.The resort does have everything you could 
want, including a store for food, sundries, 
souvenirs, and  also has  a couple of 
restaurants and a Pizza Hut on premises.
One would not have to leave the complex if 
you didn't want to as everything could be 
found there.The location is a great one for the parks, as 
well as Downtown disney. It's also a  quick 
hop to Crossroads shopping center which has 
some good restaurants, a supermarket, and 
ice cream store (as well as other shops).The unit itself was well maintained, decorated 
very nicely, is huge and very comfortable.
It was well stocked with everything we could 
need and is a place I would love to return to 
the next time we go to WDW.  There are many pools to choose from, each 
with its own 'specialty' (ie, some type of slide, 
or just a big super pool, etc) and the kids 
enjoyed a down day at the resort just trying 
all the pools.We did not take advantage of most of the  
resort's many amenities because we were 
there primarily for the parks.  The unit and the 
resort looked as great in 1002 as it did in 
1998. It's a big resort, quite sprawling, but it 
is easy enough to walk among various pools if 
you are in the right area.I loved the Vistana!

We just returned from renting at the Vistana 
(Springs) for a week. It was fabulous! Close 
to the parks (we rented a car), but there is so 
much to do at the resort, you can simply stay 
there all week long if desired.Going to the different pools for a change of 
scenery was great. The unit we rented was 
on the older side, and could have used an 
update, but it was clean and was plentiful 
with amenities. I would rent here again in a 
minute.We did agree to attend the timesharing 
presentation for a great discount on park 
tickets, and I had read they could be a bit 
pushy. We made it clear that we weren't 
interested after an hour and walked away, 
still getting the discount. I am wondering if 
our room would have be inundated with calls 
asking us to attend the sales pitch had we 
not agreed to it.

We stayed here with our 4 kids in March of 
2004.  The Complex itself is very nice, but our 
unit was very old.  It really needed to be 
updated.  The beds were old, and all the 
decorations were too.  
We were on the main level in a Fountains 
unit.  The pool is great, food at the resturant 
was okay.  We stayed at the Marriott last year 
and it was much nicer than this.

Wasn't terribly impressed.  It's a nice facility, 
but it shows it's age.  The shower door woud 
not close, there were basic cooking items 
missing from the room, no room amenities 
other than small soaps (no shampoo, ect).  The 
Cascades has a nice pool, but for those with 
toddlers - be warned that (at least when I was 
there) there are no bouy's separating the 
toddler part of the pool from the drop-off to 
5-7" feet of water, we found out the hard way.It's a great location close to the parks, and is 
chock-full of activites for the kids (all day, every 
day) but they are scattered all over this 
enormous resort so be prepared to either drop 
off your kids with radios or let them walk with 
radios.  The other issue I was was with security.  I had 
oodles of stuff in my dash (parkig passes from 
the parks, ect) all week long - covering my 
Vistana parking pass, yet only once was I 
stopped and verified by security.  Normally this 
is no big deal, but with having my kids needing 
to travel to the other side of the resort 
(sometimes in the dark), I'd like to know that 
only verified guests are there.Other than that, I gave it 4 stars because 
overall the resort shows it's age.

Stayed at the Fountains, Lovely, spacious 
clean units. Wonderful staff, lots to do.  Great 
Location. Maggie

Our biggest complaint is the size of the guest 
bedroom - twin beds with barely enough room 
to maneuver around them.  The master bedroom was large & beautiful, 
however both bathrooms were plain - the first 
resort that did not furnish basic shampoo,  
conditioner, or shower cap.The screened-in porch with an exit door to the 
walkway around the lake, with  several 
connecting bridges to cross the lake, was the 
most impressive item on our visit.We were also displeased with the number of 
calls to "take a tour" even though we precisely 
informed Marketing at check-in that our week 
was too compressed with  medical treatments 
and family visits in Orlando.

Absolutely the best!  Great staff, Great resort.  
Lots to do and you don't even have to leave 
the resort if you don't want to!
Totally relaxing!

We just completed a week stay (mid August 
2003) in a two bedroom Lakes unit in the back 
of the resort complex.  We overlooked a small 
lake (very pretty) and in the distance, the 
Marriott.  We are very impressed with the unit 
itself.  It was clean, spaceous, comfortable for 
8 with an in-room safe.  The master bedroom 
was huge, even with the very comfortable 
kingsized bed and in-room jucuzzi.  The other 
bedroom had two double beds.  The kitchen 
was well supplied.  The dining area had a very 
large table, totally suitable for 8 people.  For 
the upscale appearance of everything else, 
however, the bath was surprisingly plain.  We 
are also surprised at how unfresh the fresh 
linen smelled, like our pillowcases, which we 
had replaced with the same smell.  For eating 
out, our favorite was going to the Golden 
Corral, which offered the best buffet for the 
money I've seen there, all for $9.99.  It is just 
down the street right next to the interstate.Amenities included 7 swimming pools.  We 
enjoyed the Fountain's pool complex the best.  
It was also the largest.  They were 12 well 
maintained tennis courts.  The location is 
perfect for everything in the area.  We 
enjoyed the Universal Studios and Islands of 
Adventure package better than last year's 
Disney World experience.  The rides and 
things to do were really fun.  I would also 
suggest for those not familiar with this area of 
the state of Florida to consider three free 
outings, a rarity in Florida.  One is to go 
swimming and canoeing at Wekiva State Park 
and swimming and tubing at Rock Springs 
(Kelly County Park).  Both are very close to 
Apopka, which is about a 45 minute drive.  We 
loved the tubing experience and would choose 
Rock Springs (Kelly County Park) over Wekiva 
if I had to choose only one.  Both are crystal 
clear springs that bubble out of the ground 
starting rivers.  They are classic old Florida.  
Tubing Rock Springs is like tubing through 
what looks like Jurassic Park without the scary 
dinasaurs.  It is totally safe even for small 
kids.  If you go a bit further, canoeing Juniper 
Springs is the best canoe run in Florida.  The 
current is strong enough that you hardly have 
to do anything but steer the canoe.  You rent 
a canoe from a concessionaire who then picks 
you up at the end of the run.  Don't miss Rocks 
Springs and Juniper Springs if you have time.  
They are nice breaks from the hustle and 
bustle of the theme parks.Overall, I don't think you will find a better 
timeshare complex in the Orlando area, 
especially if you are in the Lakes or Cascades 
areas.  They were replacing all the living room 
area sofas the day we left in our complex.  I 
have heard far less positive comments from 
some staying in older areas of the this very 
large timeshare complex.

This is a great place for the whole family and 
centrally located. We had my parents 50th 
anniversary their and guest stayed at there 
sister resort the vistana villages where we 
own.

I really liked this resort.  It was very classy 
and had a great view of a lake.  Beware of the 
Love Bug.  They are these little bugs that are 
all over Orland during certain months.  We 
were there in September and they were 
everywhere.

We stayed in the resort in 2001 with friends 
of ours who own a unit & it was probably the
nicest resort catered to children. They are 
many pools to choose from so the kids have a 
variety.The kids had a wonderful time and so did the 
adults. George

Nice clean resort with plenty to do - close to 
everything. Service at the pool bar, restaurant & general 
store were understaffed causing longer than 
normal wait times.  We only visited 3 of the 7 pools, but they were 
very nice - but get there early for chairs.Would stay here again.

We have stayed here a couple of times in the 
past few years....it is a wonderful resort....lots 
of conveniences, like the onsite pizza hut, 
restaurant, beautiful pool areas....the newer 
units are beautifully decorated....the close 
access to all the Disney parks is great....you 
will really enjoy this resort!

This is a beautiful and very friendly resort to

always look forward to coming back to visit.

very nice resort, my children love staying here.
We do not own a timeshare, we always rent 
from someone else.   The resort is everything 
you would want in a vacation.  You don't have 
to worry about your children walking around 
because it's all secured.  Maybe someday we 
will own a timeshare to this resort.  Karen

Everything was just great, one remark though:
Don't use your phone to make a phonecalls, 
esp. abroad. You would be in for a very 
unpleasant 
surprise

Stayed in Cascades in July 2002 and loved it. I 
own in Springs week 47 but havent stayed 
there. Cascades are newer units so must have 
been lucky. Beautiful 2 bedroom sleeps 8 with 
jacuzzi and loads of activities for all ages if you 
get tired of Disney attractions. Had another 
family with us and the 7 of us had plenty of 
room and our own space when necessary.

Must be one of the best apartments I've stayed in, its was
one of the older units on the site, but was large, clean and
had all mod/cons washer, dryer, dishwasher, 2 T.V's and
airconditioning. The disney shuttle bus stopped outside, but
you would need tranpsort to go further a field. Excellant.

Stayed in nearly new unit in 
Cascades area, Feb. 2001 fabulously 
large 2 bdrm. Most convenient 
location to all attractions.. So much 
to do on site, with all the great 
pools, some with great waterfalls, 
islands, and poolside cafes, one 
would be hard pressed to find a 
place that can top this! Would go 
back in a flash..and we dont even 
have kids.  Old Town in Kissimmee 
nearby too, and shopping on I. Drive.

Everything is exceptional.  There are 
large, beautiful pools.  The rooms are 
very nice, too.  I'm looking into going 
back there again.

I've stayed here 3 times in the last year and half. Everything is always outstanding. Close to all Disney, Univeral and Seaworld parks or just enjoy a day of relaxation at the Vistana with plenty of activities for the kids.
