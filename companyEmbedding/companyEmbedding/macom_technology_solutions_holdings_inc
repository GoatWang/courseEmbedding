Strive for Innovation


As a company, MACOM is committed to continual improvement, and as such it is constantly
                            seeking new ways to drive innovation. For that reason, MACOM invests 20% of the
                            company’s sales revenue on research, development and engineering annually—in 2016 alone our
                            investment was nearly $108 million. These efforts are supported by over 220 engineers and 4
                            global design centers, working closely with customers to develop applications—specific,
                            highly engineered products and systems to satisfy customers’ needs. MACOM’s innovation,
                            early design involvement and materials expertise give customers a competitive advantage by
                            delivering new functionality, and by helping them to bring better performance to existing
                            products, deliver new products to market faster, and realize greater efficiencies in their
                            manufacturing processes.

Developmental Programs


MACOM offers professional development courses in a variety of different disciplines including
                            management, sales, and engineering. The goal is to ensure that our employees are empowered
                            with the knowledge and competencies they need to perform on the job. 
Within our technical community, the developmental program includes two career paths. The
                            first is the management career path. This may include titles such as Engineering Manager,
                            Engineering Director or VP Engineering. The second career path option is the individual
                            contributor path. These titles may include Senior Engineer, Principal Engineer, or
                            Distinguished Fellow.

Shares closed at $63.67 after opening at $63.24 for a move of 1.03%. The company now has a market cap of $4.06 billion.

Investors and traders can learn a lot about a stock’s momentum when it sets a new 52-week high. As an example, bullish investors view a company hitting its highest price in a year as a sign of 
momentum and may interpret it as a signal to buy. On the other hand, bearish investors could view a new 52-week high as a signal of the end of a strong run, with the stock possibly peaking out 
before an impending period of decline.


For MACOM Technology Solutions Holdings Inc., the new 52-week high came on volume of 426,460. The stock has a float of 63.83 million shares and average daily volume of $747,683. It has a 
50-day SMA of $57.73 and a 200-day SMA of $48.94.

Board of Directors
Show all 



John Ocampo
Chairman





John Ocampo has served as a director and as the Chairman of the board of directors since our inception in March 2009. Mr. Ocampo has also served as President of GaAs Labs since co-founding it in February 2008. Previously, Mr. Ocampo co-founded Sirenza in 1984, served as a director of Sirenza from its inception in 1984 through its sale to RFMD in November 2007, and served in a number of senior executive roles throughout that period, most recently as its Chairman from December 1998 through November 2007. Mr. Ocampo also served as a director of RFMD from November 2007 to November 2008. From October 2010 to October 2013, Mr. Ocampo served as a director of Ubiquiti Networks, Inc. (“Ubiquiti”), a developer of networking technology for service providers and enterprises. Mr. Ocampo also serves as a director of various privately-held companies. Mr. Ocampo holds a B.S.E.E. from Santa Clara University. Mr. Ocampo’s strategic vision, developed over more than 30 years successfully leading public and private companies in the RF semiconductor and component industry, is a unique asset to our board of directors. His engineering background and extensive knowledge of our operations, markets and technology provides our board of directors with important insights. We also believe that having our largest stockholder (together with Mrs. Ocampo and their affiliates) on the board of directors assists the board in making decisions aimed at increasing stockholder value over the long term.





John Croteau
President & Chief Executive Officer and Director 





John Croteau has served as our Chief Executive Officer and as a director since December 2012, and as our President since October 2012. Mr. Croteau joined us from NXP Semiconductors N.V. (“NXP”), a provider of mixed signal solutions and standard products, where he served as the Senior Vice President and General Manager of its High-Performance RF business from May 2008 to October 2012. For three of those years, Mr. Croteau also managed NXP’s Power & Lighting Solutions business. Prior to joining NXP, Mr. Croteau held numerous product management positions at Analog Devices, Inc. (“ADI”), a high-performance semiconductor company, including General Manager for ADI’s Convergent Platforms and Services Group as well as product line director for the Integrated Audio Group. Mr. Croteau holds a B.S. in Engineering Science and Mechanics from Penn State University. Mr. Croteau’s qualifications to serve as a director include his unique perspective and insights into our operations as our current President and Chief Executive Officer, including his knowledge of our products, technologies, business relationships, competitive and financial positioning, senior leadership and strategic opportunities and challenges. Our board of directors also benefits from Mr. Croteau’s industry perspective, stemming from his broad experience in a variety of executive roles at public semiconductor companies.
