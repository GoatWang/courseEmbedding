Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Oxford Immunotec First Quarter 2017 Conference Call. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.
It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Mark Klausner of Westwicke Partners.
Mark Klausner
Good morning and thank you for joining us for Oxford Immunotec's first quarter 2017 conference call. Joining us on today’s call are Oxford Immunotec’s Chief Executive Officer, Dr. Peter Wrighton-Smith, and its Chief Financial Officer, Rick Altieri.
Before we begin, I would like to caution listeners that certain information discussed by management during this conference call will include forward-looking statements covered under the Safe Harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results could differ materially from those stated or implied by these forward-looking statements due to risks and uncertainties associated with the company's business.
For discussion of risks and uncertainties associated with Oxford Immunotec’s business, I encourage you to review the company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The company disclaims any obligation to update any forward-looking statements made during the course of this call.
During the call, we will also present certain financial information on a non-GAAP basis. Management believes that non-GAAP financial measures taken in conjunction with U.S. GAAP financial measures provide useful information for both management and investors by excluding certain non-cash and other expenses that are not indicative of our core operating results. Management uses non-GAAP measures to compare our performance relative to forecasts and strategic plans to benchmark our performance externally against competitors and for certain compensation decisions.
Reconciliations between U.S. GAAP and non-GAAP results are presented in tables accompanying our earnings release, which can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website.
With that, it’s my pleasure to turn the call over to Oxford Immunotec’s Chief Executive Officer, Peter Wrighton-Smith.
Peter Wrighton-Smith
Good morning. Thank you for joining us today. On today's call, I'll provide some general comments on our financial results and operating progress in the first quarter of 2017, I’ll then hand it over to Rick who’ll walk you through our financial results in detail. Once Rick's completed that and will hand back to wrap up the call and provide our financial guidance. We'll then open up the lines to take your questions.
Turning to 2017 first quarter results, we posted revenues of $21.5 million, which was just above the top end of our guidance of $20.8 million to $21.3 million, representing year-over-year growth of 26%. On a constant currency basis, revenues grew 27%.
In the quarter TB revenue was $18.5 million in line with our expectations. We saw continued growth in the US, as well as strong growth in Europe and rest of world. As expected, Asia declined year-over-year due to order timing in China. Tick-borne disease and other revenue during the quarter was $3 million, which is a little stronger than expected.
Looking at revenue by geography, US revenues grew 55% in the first quarter compared to the prior year quarter. The growth was driven by continued positive impacts of a larger and maturing sales force and the addition of our new tick-borne disease revenue lines.
Europe and rest of world revenues grew by 12% on a reported basis relative to the prior year quarter or 22% on a constant currency basis. The growth was driven by strong TB performance in the UK and continental European markets and the small additional contribution from the sale of Lyme kits in Europe.

As anticipated, Asia revenues declined to 9% on a reported basis over the prior year quarter or 8% on a constant currency basis. As we discussed in our prior call, there were some temporary factors driving the flatness in Asia for the full-year, including FX headwinds, the discount we gave to our Chinese distributor and the decision to stop selling certain accessories in Japan.
However, the decline seen specifically in this quarter was due to order timings in China. Nevertheless, the underlying volume growth in test utilization remains strong in both China and Japan.
We continue to focus on growth in our core TB business, which is trending in line with the expectations stated in our fourth quarter call. As a reminder, our sales force size will remain relatively constant for the year as we look to drive adoption in the large underpenetrated TB market with a maturing sales force. In addition, we will look to leverage the sales force to accelerate growth of our new tick-borne disease portfolio.
During the first quarter we saw good early sales activity with our tick-borne products. However, as we previously stated, we expect to take another quarter or so for our sales force to become fully trained and then productive. Consequently we’re expecting to see a positive impact in account acquisition only towards the end of the year and that do not expect to see the fruits of that labor in terms of revenue growth until 2018.
Overall, the integration of both Imugen and Immunetics is going very well. We have fully integrated both companies into our organizational structure and completed the integration of our HR systems. We’ve also successfully transferred substantially all of Imugen’s emergence private payor contracts to us and as a result we are now routinely collecting payment from third-party payors.
The progress continues on schedule towards setting up T-SPOT.TB in our Norwood laboratory and as I’ll detail later, we’ve made good progress with the BLA submissions for our blood screening assays for Babesia.
Shifting to discuss our pipeline. On new addition to our tick-borne disease pipeline is an assay for Rickettsia, which includes Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever. We expect to add this to our Imugen test menu in time for the peak tick season this year. The Rickettsia test helps us to further expand our menu of tests in the tick-borne space. This R&D assay is part of our stated aim to continue to innovate our offering, consistent with our longer term goal of building a market leadership position in tick-borne diseases.
Shifting 12 of blood screening pipeline. We made good progress on our three BLAs, having expanded a significant amount of effort on continued remediation of the applications. We believe we remain on track for BLA approval in late 2017 for the portfolio for Babesia related products. As a reminder both Imugen and Immunetics have products seeking to address the babesiosis within the blood transfusion screening market, Imugen with both a serology and a PCR testing service and Immunetics with an ELISA based serology test.
We’re also delighted to report another scientific paper [ph] on the Imugen test system has just been published. The paper in the general [ph] transfusion report from the findings from the use of the Imugen tests in over 220,000 blood donations and it confirms the importance of combining PCR testing, serology in endemic areas.
Moving onto our transplant pipeline. We released encouraging interim data from the REACTs trial for the T-SPOT CMV test during the first quarter. The data was released in multiple posters and presentations at the American Society for blood and marrow transplantation conference in February, the European Society For Blood And Marrow Transplantation Conference in March and additionally last week at the European Congress of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Disease. We’ve been pleased with the positive physician feedback on this early data.

As mentioned previously, [indiscernible] more data to emerge, we are planning a measured commercialization of the product to gain some market experience. Our initial commercial efforts is to be focused in Europe and we’ll progress from there.
We continue to expect to receive interim data for T-SPOT.PRT from the PROTECTs trial in quarter three. Similar to CMV, once the interim data is available, we’ll determine the most appropriate commercialization strategy as we wait for clinical data to grow. We continue the process of reprioritizing our R&D pipeline in an effort to maximize the ROI and reduce costs.
Overall, we're pleased with the progress WE made so far in 2017 and remain positive about the growth opportunities in our business.
On that note, I'll now hand you over to Rick to walk you through our financial results in greater detail.
Richard Altieri
Thank you, Peter. Total revenues in the quarter were $21.5 million, a 26% increase over revenues of $17.1 million in the first quarter of 2016. Breaking down our reported revenue on a regional basis, US revenue was $13.5 million, representing 63% of our revenue. Europe and rest of world revenue was $1.8 million, representing 8% of our revenue and Asia revenue was $6.2 million, representing 29% of our revenue.
Turning to some comments on pricing and volume in our TB business. We sold 180,000 tests in the US via both our kit sales and tests processed in our ODL service business. ASPs in our US business for the quarter increased slightly due to the increasing contribution from reimbursed tests.
We sold just under 390,000 tests in our OUS region both via kit sales and tests processed in our UK ODL service business. In country pricing remained stable, while ASP's - reported ASP's were impacted by mix and foreign currency movements.
Gross profit of $11 million increased by $2.1 million year-over-year, an increase of 23% from the prior year's quarter. Overall, gross margin for the quarter was 51.2%, a decrease of 110 point basis points from the prior-year period.
We continue to make great progress in expanding margins in our TB business, which grew strongly year-over-year, but these were offset by the addition of the tick-borne disease business, which currently carries lower gross margins.
Breaking down our margins on a product and service split. Product gross margin was 61.3% and service gross margin was 44.7%. Product gross margin increased to 180 basis points from the prior year. The increase was primarily due to improved TB kit costs, product mix and the impact of FX, partially offset by the lower margin on tick-borne disease kits sales.
To give a bit more detail on product mix, we are now seeing the positive impacts on margins of having stop selling low-margin accessories in Japan. Service margin decreased to 180 basis points from the prior-year period. We continue to make positive progress on TB service gross margin at our Memphis facility. This was obeyed - outweighed by the addition of tick-borne disease service revenues which currently carry lower margins.
On a sequential basis, overall gross margin decreased from 52.8% in the fourth quarter of 2016 to 51.2% in the first quarter of 2017, a decrease of 160 basis points. Product gross margin decreased 60 basis points, driven primarily by the impact of seasonally lower revenues or sequentially lower revenues and service gross margin fell 220 basis points, primarily due to the usual impact of seasonally lower tick-borne disease volumes in Q1.
Turning to operating expenses. Sales and marketing expenses were $9.6 million in the first quarter of 2017, up $1.2 million from the first quarter of 2016. The increase in sales and marketing cost was primarily due to the hiring we did last year to increase headcount.

Research and development expenses were $3.8 million in the first quarter, an increase of $800,000, compared to the first quarter 2016. The increase in R&D expense was primarily due to increased headcount, consumable costs and amortization related to the acquisitions.
General and administrative expenses was $6.9 million in the first quarter of 2017, up $2.3 million from the prior year period. The increase in G&A expense was primarily driven by legal costs related to the patent litigation, as well as increased headcount.
Operating expenses for the first quarter included $1.3 million of share-based compensation. We expect this number to increase as we make additional equity awards in 2017 and future years.
During the quarter, we recorded a credit to the P&L to reflect the change in value of the contingent consideration payments in connection with the acquisition of Immunetics. This is because we now believe that FDA approval for the Immunetics BLA will fall beyond the time cut-off where a milestone payment would have been due.
Net loss for the first quarter of 2017 was $8.1 million compared to a net loss of $7 million in the first quarter of 2016. EBITDA for the first quarter was a loss of $6.1 million, compared to a loss of $6.4 million in the first quarter of 2016.
Adjusted EBITDA, which excludes share-based compensation, unrealized foreign currency gains and losses and change in value of contingent consideration, was a loss of $7.1 million compared to a loss of $5.8 million in the prior year period. Adjusted EBITDA loss was somewhat higher than anticipated, primarily due to the higher spending to remediate the BLAs and higher than anticipated spending on litigation. Both EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA are non-GAAP measures.
Turning to the balance sheet, we finished the first quarter with $43.1 million in cash and cash equivalents and we've yet withdraw anything on our outstanding $10 million revolving line of credit. We used approximately $16 million of cash in the quarter. As a reminder, cash utilization is highest during the first quarter due to payment of year-end bonuses and royalties, along with accounting and legal fees related to our year end filings. Nonetheless, cash utilization in the first quarter was somewhat above our expectations, primarily due to the BLA and litigation spending that I previously mentioned.
I'll now hand it back to Peter, who will discuss our business outlook.
Peter Wrighton-Smith
Thank you, Rick. Turning to guidance for the full-year 2017, we continue to expect revenues of between $102 million to $105 million, representing 19% to 22% year-over-year growth or 21% to 24% on a constant currency basis.
Turning to the outlook for the second quarter of 2017. We expect revenues of between $24.9 and $25.7 million, representing 30% to 34% year-over-year growth. We’re expecting TB revenues to grow sequentially due to continued strong US performance and a pickup in China following the relatively light Q1.
We are expecting tick-borne disease and other revenues to also grow sequentially based on the usual seasonal pattern of testing. As well as growing revenues, our second major focus this year is on transitioning the company towards profitability. One component to that strategy is driving operating leverage with a reduction of operating expenses as a percent of sales.
On the bottom line, we are focused on making progress initially on adjusted EBITDA which we use internally as our best measure as the core profitability of the business. Given our earlier comments over the cost of BLA remediation and litigation expenses, we now expect EBITDA loss to be in the range of $10 million to $12 million. For the same reasons, we now anticipate using approximately $20 million to $22 million of cash in 2017. We expect this number will decline in subsequent years and believe that we currently have cash on hand to fund our current operating plans for future profitability.

That concludes our formal prepared remarks. We’ll now open the line for questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Bill Quirk with Piper Jaffray. Your line is open.
William Quirk
Great. Thank you and good morning, everyone. First question is just on the gross margin performance. certainly understand that there's some nuances to mix and whatnot, but your tick-borne diseases was off a little bit sequentially, and yeah, we saw a sequential decline in gross margin, so maybe you can just dive into that a little deeper and maybe talk about some - or maybe give some additional color on the initiative to try to drive that higher here in future quarters? Thank you.
Richard Altieri
Sure. So thanks, Bill for the question. So we actually saw our TB margins come in ahead of expectations. We made good progress in underlying TB margins, both in the product side, as well as on the service side, and these were offset by the impact of the tick-borne disease gross margins both on the on the kit – TB tick-borne disease kits sales, as well as tick-borne disease service margins.
As a reminder, tick-borne disease margins are lower than our corporate average currently, and that was exacerbated by the seasonally low tick-borne disease revenues in the first quarter. So therefore the margins are lower in the first quarter, and we expect them to be sequentially higher as we come into the seasonally higher tick-borne disease you know, quarters in the second and third quarter.
William Quirk
So it’s essentially that those have negative absorption is that basically would happen Rick because you had lowest...
Richard Altieri
Yeah, there is a high fixed costs in the tick-borne disease margin, so you know, they are significantly impacted by the volumes that go through the lab.
William Quirk
Okay, got it. And then question, Peter. Peter, you made the comment about keeping the sales force stable or constant, I think was word you used in 2017, is that to imply that you consider investing in some additional sales people and in 2018 or is that or am I reading too much into that?
Peter Wrighton-Smith
I think you’re reading too much into that. I mean, certainly it’s something that we will consider, whether to further expand the sales force and ultimately comes down to a trade-off between profitability and growth and we have made the decision over that for 2018. But either [indiscernible] that will certainly be something we’ll look at, but we haven’t made a final decision on it.
William Quirk
Okay, got it. And then just last one for me, just R&D spend, it did sequentially come down kind of as expected given commentary around some of the BLA filings and such. How should we think about that trending over the balance of the year? Should that continue to come down as you reprioritizing part of the R&D pipeline, just I guess, kind of help us directionally to think about where that should go and maybe to the extent you can talk about a stable run rate? Thank you.
Peter Wrighton-Smith
Yes. We do expect R&D to come down both because obviously PROTECTs and REACTs trials will gradually wind down. But also the BLA remediation costs, which as we said are running higher than we had thought obviously on to permanent either, because once that work is done and the resubmissions in, you know, once the FDA is considering that submission obviously we don’t have the cost of doing that. So we do directionally feel the R&D costs will come down.
William Quirk
Got it. Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan. Your line is open.
Tycho Peterson
Hey, good morning. Maybe just starting with China, Peter, you cited some order timing issues there, can you maybe just elaborate on what that was and then I guess should we think about the impact of the discount to the distributors being more of a 2Q dynamics since you didn’t necessarily call that out?

Peter Wrighton-Smith
Thanks, Tycho for the question. So really the way to think about Asia for this year is it - is basically flat for the year as a whole. But as usual there is going to be some bouncing around that 0% growth rate, which is because of order timings, that’s traditionally been the feature of our Chinese business.
And so Q1, the reason it was below flat was purely due to order timings and then we’re expecting it to be above flat in quarter two as those order timings rebound. But net-net of it, as we take the whole year as a whole, we do expect Asia to be consistent what we said previously, which is roughly flat for the year.
Tycho Peterson
Okay. And if we think about you know, the performance in the US market, good number there, can you just may be help us segment that a little bit, how much is being driven by physician office versus the segments right now?
Peter Wrighton-Smith
Yes, it’s a great question. We are seeing good growth in both segments. But clearly physician office is going well, it's becoming a more - it’s still a minority, but a more material minority of our revenues and one of the positive impacts of that on our business is clearly that about the ASP overall is going up in the US, as we get more reimbursed revenues as a share of our revenue mix. So that's being good to see.
Tycho Peterson
Okay. And then last one I guess, just thinking little bit about competitive dynamics, you know, Qiagen did a announce a big tender with the Korean Armed Forces,are there other tenders of that size and scale out there that you’re potentially looking at and any thoughts on how things could change when they launch their fourth gen test later this year?
Peter Wrighton-Smith
So the central message is that we don’t see any fundamental changes in the competitive landscape. The 4G products being out in Europe for some time now and again we don’t see it fundamentally change in the landscape. So as far as we are concerned that’s a relatively stable dynamic in our business.
Tycho Peterson
And terms of your government tenders big figure, you know, projects that maybe out there?
Peter Wrighton-Smith
Yes. So I mean, clearly, in South Korea what actually happened there was a lab that was running QuantiFERON who won a tender with the military and there were clearly – there is clearly other aspects of that South Korean increase in screening that are also up for grabs and we will certainly intend to compete for that and we’re also looking in many other countries around the world as well where we think there is growth opportunities, I am not sure how big an impact tender specifically will play in that, but to the extent that they feature in particular market we’ll clearly be looking at those.
Tycho Peterson
Okay. Thank you.
Peter Wrighton-Smith
Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Doug Schenkel with Cowen & Company. Your line is open.
Unidentified Analyst
Hi. Good morning. This is Christine on for Doug today. Thanks for taking my questions.
Peter Wrighton-Smith
Morning, Chris.
Unidentified Analyst
Good morning. So I guess, how are you thinking about the OUS opportunity for tick, and I guess the question is really coming from, Immunetics previously had sales in Europe or was that really a function of cross-selling after closing the acquisition?
Peter Wrighton-Smith
So why some of you will think of Lyme disease and tick-borne diseases is primarily US phenomena. Lyme is actually a global phenomenon, it’s been reported in over 8 counties around the world and one of the principle OUS markets actually is Europe for Lyme disease testing, of which there is a meaningful market and one that’s growing.
Immunetics had a small amount of revenue in Europe when we made the acquisition, and clearly we are looking to grow that in Europe through having it this product in our sales force in Europe in the same way that we’re looking to grow it in the US through leveraging our sales forces there as well.

Unidentified Analyst
Got it. And then in terms of the Europe, total Europe growth, can you just tease out what was Europe growth related to TB and what the contribution from tick was?
Peter Wrighton-Smith
I don’t have those numbers to hand Rick, do you happen to have them to hand? It’s not Chris, we’ll follow up with you afterwards, I would estimate that the majority of it is TB, tick testing [indiscernible] new.
Unidentified Analyst
Got it. Then just given the strength in Europe, can you talk about the potential of vesting incrementally in that market for both TB and tick-borne and then just how sustainable is the recent growth trends in Europe, just because I know I think there were some tenders in the UK?
Peter Wrighton-Smith
Yes, we actually see the outlook in Europe most of all being stronger, that it has been in recent times because of those factors, because of the UK tender, because of some strength we’re seeing in some other countries and because of the addition of tick-borne disease testing. So we are all viewing Europe and rest of world as being stronger this year in terms of growth.
The one thing I should say, its caution for that is FX - like to see a material headwind and so reported growth may look more muted, but on a constant currency base certainly we are seeing Europe and rest of world growth pick up.
Unidentified Analyst
Got it. Thanks so much for taking my questions.
Peter Wrighton-Smith
Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Catherine Schulte with Robert W. Baird. Your line is open.
Catherine Schulte
Hey, guys. Thanks for the questions. I was wondering if you could talk about other products that you acquired with Imugen and Immunetics and any planned rollouts for the rest of the year, I know the FDA has announced plans to publish a final guidance on bacterial detection in platelets this year. So is that something that would encourage commercialization of the BacTx test?
Peter Wrighton-Smith
Morning, Catherine. That’s a great question. So yes, Imugen came with some – they were doing some R&D work on additional emerging species within tick-borne diseases and we certainly feel that that's worth continuing, because it’s consistent with our strategy of wanting to become a market leader in tick-borne diseases.
Immunetics came with a very large pipeline of other infectious disease tests and you’re quite right, I think the BacTx product is the most near term opportunity within that and certainly that’s the one that we are spending significant and effort examining. Clearly the market is going to change with this FDA guidance, it’s going to come out. The question we need to identify is the BacTx product likely to be successful in that market, given the competitor that exist and what is the cost of return on investment to get to that point and that's one of things that we’re deep in evaluation over the moment.
Catherine Schulte
Okay. Great. And then for the CMV launch, how should we think about the investments for a measured European rollout, and what are your assumptions and guidance for second quarter and the year for CMV contribution?
Peter Wrighton-Smith
So I’ll answer the second question first. So as we said on the fourth quarter call, we have minimal expectations for revenue of CMV this year. In terms of what it means in terms of incremental investment, it’s relatively modest, you know, the whole intent behind tick-borne diseases and behind transplant is the ability to leverage the global commercial channel we’ve already built for TB. And so there is only modest incremental spend to start those early commercialization activities because we are largely using the same sales people and technical support people that we already have.
Catherine Schulte
Great. Thank you.
Peter Wrighton-Smith

Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Oxford Immunotec Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2016 Conference Call. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.
It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Mark Klausner of Westwicke Partners. 
Mark Klausner
Good morning and thank you for joining us for Oxford Immunotec's fourth quarter and full year 2016 conference call. Joining us on today’s call are Oxford Immunotec’s Chief Executive Officer, Dr. Peter Wrighton-Smith, and its Chief Financial Officer, Rick Altieri.
Before we begin, I would like to caution listeners that certain information discussed by management during this conference call will include forward-looking statements covered under the Safe Harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results could differ materially from those stated or implied by these forward-looking statements due to risks and uncertainties associated with the company's business.
For discussion of risks and uncertainties associated with Oxford Immunotec’s business, I encourage you to review the company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The company disclaims any obligation to update any forward-looking statements made during the course of this call.
During the call, we will also present certain financial information on a non-GAAP basis. Management believes that non-GAAP financial measures taken in conjunction with U.S. GAAP financial measures provide useful information for both management and investors by excluding certain non-cash and other expenses that are not indicative of our core operating results. Management uses non-GAAP measures to compare our performance relative to forecasts and strategic plans to benchmark our performance externally against competitors and for certain compensation decisions.
Reconciliations between U.S. GAAP and non-GAAP results are presented in tables accompanying our earnings release, which can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website.
With that, it’s my pleasure to turn the call over to Oxford Immunotec’s Chief Executive Officer, Peter Wrighton-Smith.
Peter Wrighton-Smith
Good afternoon. Thank you for joining us today. On today’s call, I’ll provide an overview of significant progress we made in 2016 before reviewing our fourth quarter performance. I will then hand it over to Rick to walk you through our financial results in detail. Once Rick has completed that, he’ll hand back to me to discuss our outlook for 2017 and provide our financial guidance. We will then open up the lines to take your questions.
2016 was a transformational year for Oxford Immunotec. We made significant progress to moving from a single product late in TB Diagnostics Company to a multi-product Immune-regulated disease diagnostics company. The on-driving continued adoption and strong growth in our core TB business, we acquired Imugen and Immunetics which established a new franchise in tick-borne disease testing.
We now have a portfolio of tick-borne disease tests but in kit and service form and are enthusiastic about the opportunity in this clinical market. In addition, to our clinical product offerings in fact, physicians also allow us to enter into the blood screening market. Between Imugen and Immunetics, we believe that we’re the only products currently seeking FDA clearance for screening Babesia in donated blood. It's potentially significant opportunity to add another dimension to our product pipeline.

We also made headway in progressing our transplant pipeline having completed enrollment for both our T-SPOT.CMV and our T-SPOT.PRT clinical trials during the year. And upon readout of the dates from these trials we will shift off focus towards commercialization of these products.
Our financial results for 2016 demonstrated our progress as we achieved revenues of $86.1 million which was above our initial annual guidance of $74 million to $77 million. As a result of strong performance in our core TB business and the contribution from the Imugen and Immunetics acquisitions. Our core TB franchise performed well in 2016 as revenues grew from $62.8 million to $78.6 million. This represented 25% growth on a reported basis and 23% on a constant currency basis. This was above our initial expectations for the year.
In 2016 U.S. TB sales grew 34% which represents record year-over-year dollar growth. The growth in our U.S. TB business was driven primarily by volume increases in the institutional and physician office points as we continue to see the positive impact from our growing and maturing sales force.
We ended the year with approximately 50 sales reps calling on both institutions and physician office up approximately 10 reps in the beginning of the year. Europe and rest of world revenue declined by 1% on a reported basis relative to the prior year on a constant currency basis however, Europe and rest of the world revenues increased by 5%.
Positive volatility and FX rate and commodities prices affected some of our more fast loan markets. We were pleased to see performance strengthen in our core European markets. In particular, in the U.K. volumes in the NHS tender are growing nicely but remain small in relation to the total opportunity.
Asia revenues grew 22% on a reported basis over the prior year. The increase was primarily due to significant growth in both Japan and China. Asia grew 15% on a constant currency basis with the variance in reported growth due to strengthening of the Yen. Our sales force in Japan continues to be successful in driving demand that is for TB and in China our strategy to expand it to other segments of the market appears to be bearing fruit. Underlying volume growth remains strong in both of these markets.
Turning to [indiscernible] these products we are excited about the acquisitions of both Imugen and Immunetics. We view these acquisitions not only as highly complementary to each other but also to our TB business due to the high degree of core point overlap. We therefore believe we will able to leverage our current commercial resources to sell these products. We’ve launched the tick-borne to these franchises to our sales force and continue to anticipate that our U.S. sales force will be fully trained by the middle of 2017. Neither Imugen nor Immunetics had a well developed commercial infrastructure. Until once our sales team reaches full productivity with these products, we expect to be able to drive accelerated growth in these businesses.
As previously mentioned, both these acquisitions included some additional pipeline products. The most immediate near term opportunity is the leverage technologies developed by both Imugen and Immunetics to enter into the blood screening market of Babesia. By way of background Babesia is caused primarily by parasite transmitted by the bite of an infected tick. However, this parasite infects red blood cells in addition to infection by tick bite, patients can also contract the disease to blood transfusions from Babesia infected donors. Babesia is a growing cause of transfusion transmitted infections and in fact it is now the highest ranking pathogen that's transmitted by blood transfusion for which no donor screening is available. And despite this risk there are currently no Babesia tests which FDA clears the blood screening.

Both Imugen and Immunetics have products seek to address this problem. Imugen has both serology and a PCR testing service and Immunetics has laser based serology cascade. Clinical trials from these products have been completed and BLA applications have been submitted to the FDA.
In early December the New England Journal of Medicine published clinical trial result from Imugen tests from their large clinical trials conducted in partnership with the American Red Cross. This clinical trial which forms core of the FDA submission determined that Imugen testing regime is effective in detecting Babesia in blood samples. We are working with the FDA to provide additional information on both companies, BLA applications and currently anticipate the approval of these three tests occurring in late 2017.
To our knowledge no other company have started an IND for the VGA screening so with these assets we expect to be the first mover in this market for a number of years. We believe that the addressable market for VGA blood screening could be significant. In May of 2015 the FDA's blood product advisory committee or BPAC met and proposed the following recommendations for the VGA testing in donor blood in the U.S. Approximately 13 million serological test for [indiscernible] and approximately 2 million PCR test for [indiscernible]. If these recommendations were to become a formal mandate these 15 million test could present upwards of a $50 million revenue opportunity.
Moving onto our transplant pipeline, as we noted in our quarter three call, enrollment on PROTECT and REACT chart is complete and we are now following up these patients for post transplant event. We remain on track for interim data to be available from the REACT trial for CMV this quarter and from the PROTECT chart PRT in quarter three. Assuming that interim data is positive, we expect to move to start filling these tests. We will continue to take a measured approach of commercialization once we wait for the clinical data to grow.
Turning now to review our 2016 fourth quarter results, we posted revenues of $23.7 million which was above our guidance of $22.6 to $23.4 million and represents year-on-year growth of 39% on a constant currency basis. Given the recent acquisition we provided revenue breakout by indication, in the fourth quarter TB revenue grew 22% as compared to the prior year period. Increase was primarily driven by strong growth in the U.S.
Tick-borne disease and other revenue which during the quarter included both Imugen and Immunetics was $3.3 million to ahead of our expectations. Looking at fourth quarter revenue by geography, U.S. revenues grew 76% in the fourth quarter compared to the prior year period. U.S. TB sales grew 37%. The growth in TB was driven primarily by volume increases in both institutions and physician offices, but we continue to see the positive impacts from our growing and maturing sales force.
Europe and rest of world revenue fell by 5% on a reported basis relative to the prior year quarter. On a constant currency basis however Europe and rest of world revenue increased by 4% as we continue to see a strengthening in core markets. Asia revenues grew 9% on a reported basis over the prior year quarter. The increase was primarily due to growth in both Japan and China. Asia grew 3% on a constant currency basis with the variance in reported growth due to the Yen.
Subsequent to our last earnings call we’ve given a couple of regulatory guidelines announcements that I would like to briefly discuss. In December, updated guidelines of the diagnosis of tuberculosis in adults and children were published jointly by the American Thoracic Society, Infectious Diseases Society of America and the CDC. These guidelines go much further in recommending [indiscernible] over the skin test in prior guidelines. We believe these new guidelines along with the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommendation which came out early in 2016 continue to generate further momentum for the adoption of tests.

Also in December, Congress passed 21st Century Cures Act, as part of the act a formal working group is to be established to focus specifically on laying another tick-borne disease. The purpose of the working group is to develop and implement a plan for improving outcomes of Lyme disease and other tick-borne diseases as well as the implementation of a plan for improving diagnosis, treatment and prevention of tick-borne diseases.
Specific actions have been taken and it may not well be taken for a number of years we view the creation of a group focused solely on tick-borne diseases in the U.S. as validation of our assessment of the unmet need and shows the governmental support for solutions to the problem.
Overall, we are very pleased with our strong performance during the fourth quarter and throughout the year in both our core TB business and on newly core tick-borne business as well as with our pipeline products.
On that note, I will now hand over to Rick who will walk you through our financial results in greater details.
Richard Altieri
Thank you, Peter. Total revenues in the quarter were $23.7 million, a 41% increase over revenues of $16.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2015. Breaking down our reported revenues on a regional basis, U.S. revenue was $14.8 million, representing 62% of our revenue. Europe and rest of world revenue was $1.7 million, representing 7% of revenue and Asia revenue was $7.3 million, representing 31% of our revenue.
Turning to some comments on pricing and volume in our TB business, we sold over 210,000 tests in the U.S. via both our kit sales and test processed in our ODL service business. ASPs in the U.S. business for the quarter increased slightly versus the prior-year period as a result of increased contribution from the physician office market.
We sold over 500,000 tests in our OUS region both via kit sales and tests processed in our U.K.’s ODL service business. In country pricing remain generally stable for the fourth quarter, although ASPs for the OUS region as a whole vary from quarter-to-quarter due to geographic revenue mix and foreign currency movements.
Gross profit of $12.5 million increased by $4 million or 48% from the prior year’s quarter. Overall, gross margin for the quarter was 52.8%, an increase of 230 basis points from the prior year period.
Product gross margin was 61.9% and service gross margin was 46.9%. Product gross margin increased 580 basis points from the prior year. The increase was primarily due to product mix, lower kit cost due to improved efficiency and increased volume and the favorable impact of currency movements.
Service margin increased by 180 basis points from the prior year period, driven by improved efficiency in our ODL labs and increased volume offset by Imugen’s tick-borne disease service revenue which carries lower margins than our core TB revenue. On a sequential basis, overall gross margin decreased from 55.9% in the third quarter to 52.8% in the fourth quarter of 2016, a decrease of 318 basis points.
Product gross margin decreased 90 basis points driven primarily by the impact of Immunetics’ tick-borne disease revenue and service gross margins fell 500 basis points due to usual impact of decreased seasonal volume in the fourth quarter as well as the impact of Imugen’s tick-borne disease revenues which carry low margins and our core TB revenue.
Turning to upgrading expenses. Sales and marketing expenses were $8.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 up $445,000 from the fourth quarter of 2015. The increase in sales and marketing cost was primarily due to increased headcount. Research and development expenses were $4 million in the fourth quarter, an increase of $1.5 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2015. The increase in R&D expense was primarily due to acquisition, but the acquisitions of Imugen and Immunetics and clinical expenses related to the PROTECT and REACT studies.

General administrative expenses were $7 million in the fourth quarter of 2016, up $2.8 million from the prior year period. The increase in G&A expense was driven by increased headcount, legal cost related to acquisitions, is low as patent litigation and share-based compensation costs. Operating expenses for the fourth quarter included 1.2 million of share-based compensation. We expect this number to increase as we make additional equity awards in 2017 in the future years. We had two accounting changes related to the carrying value associated with the Boulder Diagnostics acquisition that we made in 2014.
As many of you know, we reconsider the carrying value of our acquired assets on a periodic basis. As we have revaluated the R&D programs that we acquired from older diagnostics, we have concluded that the progress we've made on the SpiroFind program since the acquisition is that the current products that we are developing, we line more on IP that we have generated since the acquisition, rather than the IP as it stood at the time of the acquisition. As a consequence you can search SpiroFind continues to be a project. We have written down the value of this specific IP that we acquired from Boulder with the corresponding credit of the associated contingent consideration payments of this IP.
In addition, in conjunction with our ongoing R&D reprioritization that Peter will talk about later, we had chosen to deprioritize a low defined project. And this also formed a modest part of the down charge to our both IP R&D and a corresponding credit from the associated contingent consideration impairment. The net effect of these movements was an expense of approximately $297,000 included in operating expenses. Net loss to the fourth quarter of 2016 was $4.9 million compared to a net loss of $6.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2015.
Net loss includes an income tax benefit of $3.9 million, we write it to the reduction and the valuation reserve of our UK net operating loss and the tax benefit reported as part of the acquisition of Immunetics. EBITDA for the fourth quarter was a loss of $6.9 million compared to a loss of $5.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2015. Adjusted EBITDA which excludes share-based compensation, unrealized foreign currency gains and losses and the two charges that I just discussed related to IP R&D and contingent consideration was a loss of $5.2 million for the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to a loss of $4.7 million in the prior year period. Both EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA are non-GAAP measures.
Turning briefly to a review of results for the full-year of 2016. Revenues for the year was $86.1 million or 37% increase over full-year 2015 revenues of $62.8 million. Revenue grew 35% over the prior year on a constant currency basis. Gross profit was $46.6 million, an increase of $13.4 million over the prior year. Gross margin for the full-year of 2016 was 54.1%, an increase of a 120 basis points compared to 52.9% in 2015. Operating expenses for the full-year of 2016 was $72.6 million, an increase of $15.2 million compared to 2015. Net loss of the full-year of 2016 was $22.3 million compared to a net loss of $24.5 million in 2015.
EBITDA for the full-year was the loss of $22.2 million, compared to a loss of $22.1 million in 2015, and adjusted EBITDA was a loss of $18.5 million for the full year, compared to a loss of $18.2 million in the prior year.
Turning to the balance sheet. We finished the quarter with $59.1 million in cash and cash equivalence. We used approximately $7.3 million of cash in the quarter, $6.6 million of which was directly related to the acquisition of Immunetics both for the purchased price and the acquisition related costs. For the full-year, excluding the acquisitions and related field cost and excluding financing cost, we used $22.2 million of cash which was better than our guidance at the beginning of the year of $25 million in cash usage.

During the quarter, we entered into a debt financing agreement on October 4th, which provided the company with up to $40 million in capital, comprised of a $30 million term loan and a $10 million working capital revolver. Based on our current cash position, we believe we have sufficiently capitalized to allow us to achieve profitability.
I'll now hand it back to Peter, who will discuss our business outlook.
Peter Wrighton-Smith
Thank you, Richard. We're in a exciting transition for the company, as we move from being a one product company to a four product company with TB, tick-borne diseases, blood screening, and transplant. As the management team, we're focused on two priorities. To continue to grow revenue strongly and to start to make progress toward profitability. On the revenue side, we expect to maintain a longstanding record of strong revenue growth. A continuing to drive penetration of TSPOT TB into the very large underpenetrated market of TB screening.
We will work accelerate the growth of our new tick-borne disease portfolio by initializing our commercial infrastructure. Thirdly, we have to add new sources of revenue growth by adding new products into our sales force lab infrastructure including blood screening tests, transplant tests and in the longer term future other tests added by R&D or M&A. taking each of these in turn, we will continue our current strategies to penetrating the US and all US market for TB. They're working well, they're driving growth and the market remains very underpenetrated.
We expect to keep our commercial infrastructure relatively flat this year that we think to reduce our pricing expenses in the percent of revenue. Looking regionally, we expect the US to continue to grow strongly as our sales force continues its strong current productivity. We expect our Europe and rest of world regions continue as recent record of higher growth, we're expecting mid to high single digit constant currency growth, but remindful of the FX is likely to make reported growth based on our models.
Lastly in Asia, despite expected strong underlying tactical in growth, in 2017, the physically we're expecting reported revenues to be relatively flat due to three temporary impacts. Firstly, FX rates have moved significantly against us on the Yen, and so this is a meaningful headwind to reported revenues in Asia. Secondly, given the deterioration of the Chinese Yuan against the Dollar, we have made the decision to reduce our dollar pricing to our Chinese distributor to offset some of this FX change.
Lastly, we made a decision to stop selling certain accessories in Japan. This will have a one-off impact on revenue. So, we done it as we were not making much money on these accessories and this reflects our commitments to also make progress towards profitability. On tick-borne diseases, we expected it will take a couple of quarters for our sales force to come fully trained and then productive. Consequently, we're expecting to see a pointed impact in accounts acquisition towards the end of the year. As the wind had a seasonally it's kind of less testing, it will take until 2018 before such account wins are likely to meaningfully impact the top line growth rate.
Therefore, while 2017 is a critical execution year for us in tick-borne diseases, we do not expect to see the fruits of those labors in revenues into the 60's and starts in earnest in 2018. As it relates to blood screening, we put significant R&D resources into remediating these three BLA since acquiring the Imugen and Immunetics. Our principle objective in 2017 is to obtain a approval for the end of the year for each of our three blood screening test for Babesia. Whilst we do currently obtain what is revenues from these products under cost recovery under our current plan B, we do not expect a meaningful increase contribution from blood screening until we obtain FDA clearance and until a week followed by an FDA mandate for testing.

If we can achieve FDA clearance in late 2017, and then if it is followed swiftly by an FDA mandate, we should see revenues to come more meaningful in 2018. For our transplant pipeline, we look forward to seeing data from the respective clinical trials. Assuming the results are positive, we'll be taking a measure to project commercialization, what's the data builds and consequently you have minimal expectations for revenue this year. Taking all this commentary into account, for the full-year 2017, we expect revenues of between $102 million and $105 million, representing 19% to 22% year-over-year reported growth or 21% to 24% on a constant currency basis.
Turning to the outlook for the first quarter of 2017. We expect revenues of between $20.8 million and $21.3 million, representing 22.5%, 22% to 25% year-over-year reported growth, on a constant currency basis, this reflects 25% to 29% year-over-growth. In the US, we expect to see TB revenues rise sequentially from quarter four, in line of our usual seasonal pattern. Clinical tick-borne disease revenues will likely decline slightly, again inline of the usual seasonal pattern and through the fox, your tick bites in winter months.
Sequentially, we expect decline in Asia revenues due to order timings for China and the impact of the China price decrease. As well as growing revenues, our second major focus this year is on transition in the company towards profitability. We therefore aim to demonstrate progress on both gross and operating margin this year. Although recent FX changes and the Imugen and Immunetics acquisitions will provide a meaningful headwinds to gross margins this year, we are nonetheless aiming to modestly expand our gross margins for the full-year to a continued focus in operational improvements.
We're also looking to drive operating leverage by having our operating expenses come down as percent of revenue. I described how the addition of tick-borne disease revenues through the overlap of co-points leverages ourselves in marketing expenses, however we are also working to see R&D. on R&D specifically, we've begun this process of reprioritizing our pipeline. This is for two reasons. Firstly, we have a lot more opportunity in our pipeline given the new blood screening tests as well as the other pipeline products that came with Imugen and Immunetics.
Secondly, we want to ensure that R&D spending comes down a percent of revenue. Both of these reasons drive us to reprioritize our pipeline so that we focused on our activities in only in the most promising products, so to maximize our ROI from the spend. On G&A, even despite increased litigation expenses associated with bringing the IP infringement case towards trail, we expect to see G&A come down this percent of revenue. On the bottom-line, we're focused on making progress initially on adjusted EBITDA, which we use internally of our best measure of the co-possibility of the business.
We are hoping to see adjusted EBITDA loss which is by almost half to approximately a $10 million loss. We anticipate using approximately $20 million of cash in 2017, off that $20 million, approximately $8 million will let the increase of the working capital influence capital expenditures. We expect this number would decline in subsequent years and believe that we currently have cash on hand from the operating plants reach profitability. Similar to last year, we anticipate the first quarter will highest in terms of cash usage due to accounting and legal fees related to our event filings along with the payment of year-end bonuses and royalties.
That concludes our formal prepared remarks. We'll now open up the line for questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Doug Schenkel with Cowen & Company. Your line is open.

Doug Schenkel
Good afternoon and thank you for taking our questions. First question is on U.S. momentum. When you look back at year-over-year revenue growth in the U.S. quarter-by-quarter in 2016 growth improved every quarter, I know that's a little bit of noisy metric but clearly things are moving, continuing to move in the right direction. It seems like a big part of this is attributable to a larger sales force and relatively your increased penetration into the physician office channel. Heading into 2017 how should we think about this trend, would it be fair to think that if anything you can continue we’ve not gained momentum given your sales force is now more tenured?
Richard Altieri
I think there are number of comments to make on that that question Doug and thank you for it. I think the first thing to say is we expect in around to see similar dollar year-over-year revenue growth in 2017 as we’ve seen in 2016. And that's largely because we have got a relatively stable number of sales reps because we are not planning to materially increase our sales headcount this year and we are expecting rest of the cost and productivity. The puts and takes around that are to your point, the puts might be that with recent guidelines and as our sales force get more tenured and as we continue to learn how to do this better, but that might improve productivity. On the take side of things is obviously the risk of distraction from also having our rep sales tick-borne diseases and we believe those puts and takes are likely to even themselves out. And so our assumption is relatively confident productivity growth. So again, to summarize our expectation is similar dollar year-over-year revenue growth.
Doug Schenkel
Okay. Thank you for that. That is helpful. Change in geographies and moving over to Asia trying to I guess parse out if you will your assessment of the outlook for underlying demand and competitive dynamics in China and Japan is at least at first blush a bit challenging given a lot of moving parts; foreign exchange, your pricing commentary and what you are doing in China the product discontinuation in Japan just to name a few. If you kind of adjust for all those things and I am sure you have internally, I am sure you have some thoughts on how you feel the demand patterns are evolving and how competitive dynamics are evolving. Would you be willing to comment a little bit when you normalize for all the moving parts on what you think about the growth rates in these markets and how competition is evolving?
Richard Altieri
Yes. So, I think the first thing to say is that we are long term believers in the growth outlook for these markets. And although 2017 will appear to be flat for these temporary reasons that I have outlined that doesn't change our underlying belief in the growth in the market and certainly we expect to maintain decent volume growth this year notwithstanding these headwinds to reported revenues. Links to that we don't fundamentally see any change in the capacity scenario in these markets, the one area where obviously we have chosen to reflect those is in our decision to reduce our dollar price for distributor in China. We have the dominant plan China right now we are long term believers in that market. We think it could be a very significant market and we are mindful that continuing to expand our price premium over that locally produce cheaper cloned product mainly that we see more market share to them than we would otherwise like. And so, we think that this decision to make a one-off price reduction is in our long term interest because it help us to preserve our dominant share in the market as this market continues to grow and overtime becomes, we hope very significantly for the company.

Doug Schenkel
Okay. And I guess one last related follow-up and then I will get back in the queue. Some of what you just commented on, Peter really spoke to your long term view on the market your main competitor really your only competitor and late in TB high-growth testing has talked about growth outlook of at least to 20% per year on average for the next five years. In your view does that seem like a reasonable target growth rate for the overall market? Thank you.
Peter Wrighton-Smith
I think that you can separate two factors, what's the overall growth of this TB screening market and then what is the penetration rate of high-growth within that. And so I think the first thing to say is I am very encouraged absolutely about the underlying growth of the screening market, the NHS tender, the USPGA recommendation, the recent guidelines in South Korea. I think the world is starting to ruffle with the TB better given the horrendous TB statistics this year and realizes that TB screening is a more important part of the solution in the path before. So I think the market is going to grow very nicely. And then within that again I see fundamentally impediments to high-growth not being able to continue very strong penetration versus the skin test. The guidelines continues to strengthen high-growths’ favor and generally more and more the market is going to be comfortable with this technology and if not-- and so to wrap it up really I remain a strong believer in the long term outlook for this business and this market.
Doug Schenkel
Okay. Thanks again.
Peter Wrighton-Smith
Thank you.
Operator
And our next question comes from Catherine [indiscernible] with Robert W. Baird. Your line is open.
Unidentified Analyst
Hey guys thanks for the questions. Quickly on the NHS migrant screening program I think they posted an updated last month and it sounds like many of the CCGs have started testing and some are behind the schedule. So just curious how you see this unfolding from a volume perspective in 2017 and then as a follow-up in the regions where you aren't that exclusive provider of testing, what kind of share are you getting so far?
Peter Wrighton-Smith
Great questions. So, we work very cautious at the beginning when we first announced it to say that it would take some time just to get going because we are well aware of the run time structure in NHS and how long it takes them to get things going and this update that you refer to a month ago was totally consistent with our expectations of how slow it would be to get these job up and moving.
In terms of outlook for volumes, I think we do expect 2017 our volumes to grow meaningfully from this in the U.K. from 2016 but even then it's going to be still very under-penetrated, but it would be full penetration that we can expect when this tender finally gets up to full speed. In terms of how we are doing in the areas where we are not exclusive, I have to say I am very satisfied with our success rate in winning business here. We have a lot of thought into how are we going to actually rollout our service so this area you may recall this time last year I talked about making some investments in our U.K. and our services business generally but that's part of our U.K. service and those investments in logistics and figuring out how to make this easy for primary care physicians to access this service are certainly bearing fruit in terms of our capacity versus other players who would take some of this market. So I am very happy about that.
Unidentified Analyst
Okay and then quickly on China, did you make any other changes to your distributor model or strategy aside from just price reduction? Any change in like expanding the market discounts with the distributor?
Peter Wrighton-Smith
No.

Unidentified Analyst
Okay. Thank you.
Peter Wrighton-Smith
Thank you.
Operator
And our next question comes from William Quirk with Piper Jaffray. Your line is open.
William Quirk
Thanks good afternoon. Can you hear me?
Peter Wrighton-Smith
We can hear you fine Bob.
William Quirk
Okay, excellent. So I guess a couple of questions on the BGM and so if I heard you correctly Peter and if I remember reading to the filings correctly you already showing some Babesia into the blood centers. So I think I am curious what sort of conversations have you held with ARC and ABC and I guess how could we gauge the potential uptick or uptake of FDA approved Babesia assays, I am just trying to think through things like logistics and how much volume you are seeing in a serological kit and typically what we have seen historically is that blood banks when they adopt, they adopt pretty rapidly and typically it's comes with or nothing sort of phenomena not just within ARC but within the competitors at ABC as well?
Peter Wrighton-Smith
Yes. So I think, our working assumption is this which is the people who are super motivated to do testing without an FDA mandate already doing that testing via Imugen and Immunetics under the open INDs. And so our view is that FDA approval doesn't really change volumes. It obviously we hope will change price but it won't change volumes. What will change volumes is FDA guidance on source. And we are obviously hopeful the FDA will release guidance at some point once FDA clear tests are available but understanding the timing of that exactly what guidelines will say is clearly not predictable at this point in time. We have to be pack minutes that we can refer to. We can see that the debate has been held in the public domain so far but I can't predict what the FDA will do. So to repeat our assumption is FDA approval doesn't materially change volumes. That might change price favorably but the real inflation in volumes comes if as and when an FDA mandate occurs.
William Quirk
Understood, and then just to be clear in terms of the price change to Fosun when did that occur exactly?
Peter Wrighton-Smith
From the beginning of year and it's a rebate and it will only be given by some headings and minimum volumes. But obviously will be accruing for it throughout the course of the year on the assumption that they will do those volumes so it won’t impact on numbers starting in quarter one.
William Quirk
Okay, understood. And then, did you also stop selling accessories in the first quarter as well? I guess I am just trying to get at some of the weaker performance in the fourth quarter in Asia and just trying to figure out if it was tied in at all to some of the go forward metrics?
Peter Wrighton-Smith
Yes. I think the quarter four in Asia is really separable from the commentary around 2017. It clearly has to do with timing variance and nothing more or less than that. So I don't read too much into quarter four. It's just the usual volatility obviously I have made specific comments around the outlook 2017.
William Quirk
Got it and appreciate the color. Thanks Peter.
Peter Wrighton-Smith
Thank you, Bill.
Operator
And our next question comes from Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan. Your line is open.
Tycho Peterson
Thanks. And maybe Peter on the R&D re-prioritization just wondering to the extent that there are projects that are kind of being pushed up. I am trying to understand, I understand the thought process but trying to understand is there things that are kind of being pushed off that you would kind of highlight and then anything you are willing to say on time line to profitability given you’re placing more of an emphasis on it now?
Peter Wrighton-Smith
Yes. So, what we have communicated obviously is that our gout program has been put on hold at least for the foreseeable future. I don't want to comment on any other pipeline products until we have completed the re-prioritization. That’s going to take a number of months there is a lot of work to do to do that in a disciplined way. And I will expect to give more commentary then about things that we’ve definitely decided not to proceed with for example at that stage, so just too early to say on that.

In terms of timing to profitability again, I don't want to, what I can tell you clearly is that we don't want to get to profitability this year. What I don't want to do is get balanced into providing guidance for next year or beyond. Well, I would say is that we are mindful that we want to show material progress towards profitability, but we want to preserve some flexibility as to the exact timing depend so that we can make appropriate investments not business but long term value creation.
Tycho Peterson
Okay and then, I know its early days on the tick-borne front, but it sounds like you’re not anticipating real revenues this year can you give us a sense of what you have kind of embedded in guidance for Imugen and Immunetics. I know they did about $13 million in 2015. Can you give us a sense of what you are assuming this year?
Peter Wrighton-Smith
Yes. I mean so again, we have been, the guidance we are giving now is very similar to -- identical to what we said when we actually acquired the businesses. So Imugen was $11 million in 2015 and growing kind of 10% a year and we said it wouldn’t make a material impact on that growth rate until 2018. Immunetics was $1.5 million to $2 million of clinical revenues basically flat and again we wouldn't make any impact on that till 2018. So that gives you some, I think, some fairly granular guidance as to what we are expecting for those businesses in 2017.
Tycho Peterson
Okay and then last one on the BCI I know it's again early days there, fairly concentrated customer base. It sounds like when the time comes won't need to place real resources into building out commercial channels. Is that a fair assumption?
Peter Wrighton-Smith
Yes, it's a very good question Tycho. I mean, certainly our assumptions I think one of the attractions of this market is that essentially there is very little sales and marketing cost required because it's a mandate. So obviously, you do need to have some support from a logistics and technical perspective, but sales and marketing charge is related to such business are likely to be very, very small and the consequence of this business can be very profitable in terms of operating margin, there is no doubt it is seen from the recent sale of logics, blood screening business.
Tycho Peterson
Got it, okay, thanks.
Peter Wrighton-Smith
Thank you. 
Operator
And I am showing no further questions. I would now like to turn the call back to Peter Wrighton-Smith for any further remarks.
Peter Wrighton-Smith
Yes. Thank you for joining us to discuss our fourth quarter and full year 2016 results. We are pleased with progress and we continue to make against our growth strategy and this is an exciting time of transition at Oxford Immunotec. We look forward to updating you on our next quarterly call. Thank you.

Inivata Adds to Board of Directors with Appointment of Peter Wrighton-Smith
 
Cambridge, UK – 26 July, 2016 – Inivata, a global clinical cancer genomics company employing the precision of circulating tumour DNA (ctDNA) analysis to improve personalised healthcare in oncology, has appointed Dr Peter Wrighton-Smith to its Board of Directors.  Dr Wrighton-Smith brings strategic product development and international commercialisation experience to Inivata’s Board along with a broad understanding of the clinical service testing market.
Dr Wrighton-Smith is the Chief Executive Officer and Founder of Oxford Immunotec Global PLC, a high-growth global diagnostics company focussing on monitoring immune-regulated conditions.  Peter has led Oxford Immunotec from the foundation stages, through product development to regulatory approval in over 50 countries, and subsequent worldwide commercialisation via both a kit and a CLIA lab model.  Over that time, Oxford Immunotec has raised five rounds of venture funding prior to an IPO on NASDAQ in 2013.  Dr Wrighton-Smith has a Masters in Engineering, Economics and Management, and a Doctorate in Medical Engineering, both from University of Oxford.
“Peter’s strong leadership and commercialisation experience in both the US and UK will further strengthen the Inivata Board as we move towards the launch of InVision®,” said Jeffrey H. Buchalter, Chairman of the Board, Inivata.
Peter Wrighton-Smith said, “Inivata’s liquid biopsy platform, InVision, has enormous potential.  Their demonstrated best-in-class sensitivity and strategically selected gene panel to target actionable mutations for clinicians promises to revolutionise oncologists’ ability to assess and treat their patients.”
Inivata’s molecular profiling utilises a robust and reproducible platform exhibiting the highest sensitivity and specificity for the detection of genomic alterations in ctDNA.  eTAm-Seq profiling of clinical samples has revealed the detection of mutations at frequencies that may be missed by less sensitive assays.  The analytical validation of InVision presented at AACR in 2016 supports its use in prospective clinical studies to demonstrate the clinical validation and utility in using ctDNA analysis for precision medicine applications particularly for patients where tumour tissue is limited or unavailable.  Peter Wrighton-Smith’s experience and expertise in international clinical service testing and commercialisation will further advance Inivata’s liquid biopsy initiatives.
