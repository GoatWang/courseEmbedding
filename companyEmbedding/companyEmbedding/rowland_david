David Lincoln Rowland (February 12, 1924 – August 13, 2010) was an American industrial designer famous for his 40/4 chair, so named because it stacks 40 chairs in 4 feet (120 cm) high. The chair was the first compactly stackable chair invented, and is regarded as the gold standard of stackable chairs, not only for its stackability, but for its comfort, durability, timelessness, and grace.[1] Referring to the 40/4, modern critics have noted that “It is unsurpassed to this day in engineering sophistication and production”.[2] In continuous production since its introduction, the chair has sold in the millions around the world over 5 decades and is found in many prestigious locations, including St. Paul’s Cathedral in London and the Museum of Modern Art in New York City.[3]

Early life[edit]
David Lincoln Rowland was born on February 12, 1924, in Los Angeles, the only child of Neva Chilberg Rowland, a violinist and W. Earl Rowland, a California artist, lecturer and teacher.[4] In 1936 he moved with his parents to Stockton, California where his father became director of the Haggin Museum.[5] In the summer of 1940, when he was only 16, he took a course with Laszlo Maholy-Nagy, one of the founders of The Bauhaus school, at Mills College in Oakland, California on Basic Bauhaus Design, an experience which set the direction of his career. He forever after called it “the best summer of my life!”.[6] After graduation from Stockton High School in 1942,[7] he studied drafting, and worked as a draftsman for the Rheem Manufacturing Co., drawing plans for war munitions, before entering military service in World War II.
Military Service[edit]




Lieutenant Rowland U.S. Army Air Corps ca. 1945


From 1943 through 1945 Rowland served in World War II in the United States Army Air Corps, the 8th Air Force, 94th Bomb Group, 333rd Squadron, as a 1st Lieutenant, B17 (“Flying Fortress”) pilot. He was stationed in Bury St. Edmunds, England and made 22 combat missions over Nazi occupied territory. During that time he was awarded the Air Medal and several clusters.[8] It was during those long, sometimes 12 hour missions, sitting in beastly uncomfortable seats, Rowland said, that “I resolved to do something about that if I ever returned home safely”.[9]
Education[edit]
He resumed his education after the war at Principia College in Elsah, Illinois, where in 1949 he earned his Bachelor of Science degree in Physics.[10] He went on to study industrial design at the University of South California and afterwards at Cranbrook Academy of Art in Bloomfield Hills, Michigan, where he earned his master's degree in Industrial Design in 1951.[11]
Early career[edit]
After Cranbrook, Rowland headed for New York City. There he rented a $40 a month room and started applying to industrial design firms for a job. Each design firm he applied to required he sign a form saying that anything he thought of during his employment that they wanted to get a patent on, he would give them the rights for one dollar. When he wouldn’t sign the form, he didn’t get the job. He opted instead to work three jobs outside of the design field while working on his own designs in his spare time. Later, he took a job as head draftsman doing architectural renderings for Norman Bel Geddes, the noted theatrical and industrial designer, the only one who did not require that he sign a form.[6]
During this time Rowland also designed commercial interiors[12] while developing his own designs and inventions, which included lighting,[13] his Transparent Chair for the No-Sag Spring Co. that was exhibited in La Triennale di Milano in 1957 [14] and his patented Drain Dry Cushion, licensed to Lee Woodard & Sons.[15] In 1956 the royalty income from the Drain Dry Cushion allowed Rowland to move from his $40 a month room to an apartment and to open his own office.
The 40/4 chair[edit]
Off and on for eight years, Rowland worked on and perfected a design for a revolutionary new stacking chair with a wire frame and sculpted seat and back. Forty of them could be stacked just 4 feet high on a specially designed dolly. It not only stacked with ease, but could be ganged together to form rows in a matter of seconds. The slim slender profile of the design completely belies the comfort it offers, an attribute achieved only after long testing to find the contour that would best fit the greatest number of human shapes.[16]
For a long time, however, Rowland had difficulty finding a manufacturer willing to take a license to make his versatile chair. They would always turn it down because they couldn’t imagine the chair would be strong enough when it looked so light. The tide turned when the architectural firm of Skidmore, Owings and Merrill ordered 17,000 of the chairs on behalf of the University of Illinois at Chicago Circle[17] (now the University of Illinois at Chicago). Then the General Fireproofing Co. (GF) willingly took a license from Rowland to make the chairs.[18]

Sales of the chair took off, earning critical recognition in winning the grand prize at the Milan Triennale, was included in the Museum of Modern Art's (MoMA) permanent collection, and has been in continuous production ever since.[18][19] It was recognized by the American Institute of Interior Designers in 1965.[20] Today it is manufactured by the Danish contract furniture manufacturer Howe a/s and sold around the world. The chair can be found in cultural sites, public buildings, places of worship, universities and schools, corporate offices, conference centers, restaurants and homes, including St Paul's Cathedral for the Wedding of Charles, Prince of Wales, and Lady Diana Spencer and on submarines of the United States Navy.[18]
The 40/4 chair has been called “the most universally useful chair ever made and accomplished with the least expenditure of material and labor”.[21] In 2010 Contract Design Magazine named the 40/4 number one of the top 10 commercial interiors products of the past 50 years.[2]
Later versions[edit]
Rowland continuously worked on refinements of the 40/4 chair and developed variations of it in cooperation with Howe a/s. Currently the 40/4 chair family consists of the original side chair, an armchair, lounge chair, barstool, counter chair, outdoor chair and swivel-base chair, each available in a wide variety of materials and colors.[22]

Personal life[edit]
Rowland was married in 1971 to (Miss) Erwin Wassum, a quilt artist, originally from Virginia. They lived in New York City, before moving to Virginia in 2001. Their only children were their many projects. Rowland had a wide variety of interests, including architecture, wind energy, culture, the arts and traveling the world on business. If someone said something was “impossible” to Rowland, he felt challenged to figure out how the impossible could be achieved. His favorite mottos included “Do the most with the least” and “Never give up!” Rowland was a lifelong Christian Scientist.[23]

David Lincoln Rowland (February 12, 1924 – August 13, 2010) was an American industrial designer famous for his 40/4 chair, so named because it stacks 40 chairs in 4 feet (120 cm) high. The chair was the first compactly stackable chair invented, and is regarded as the gold standard of stackable chairs, not only for its stackability, but for its comfort, durability, timelessness, and grace.[1] Referring to the 40/4, modern critics have noted that “It is unsurpassed to this day in engineering sophistication and production”.[2] In continuous production since its introduction, the chair has sold in the millions around the world over 5 decades and is found in many prestigious locations, including St. Paul’s Cathedral in London and the Museum of Modern Art in New York City.[3]

Early life[edit]
David Lincoln Rowland was born on February 12, 1924, in Los Angeles, the only child of Neva Chilberg Rowland, a violinist and W. Earl Rowland, a California artist, lecturer and teacher.[4] In 1936 he moved with his parents to Stockton, California where his father became director of the Haggin Museum.[5] In the summer of 1940, when he was only 16, he took a course with Laszlo Maholy-Nagy, one of the founders of The Bauhaus school, at Mills College in Oakland, California on Basic Bauhaus Design, an experience which set the direction of his career. He forever after called it “the best summer of my life!”.[6] After graduation from Stockton High School in 1942,[7] he studied drafting, and worked as a draftsman for the Rheem Manufacturing Co., drawing plans for war munitions, before entering military service in World War II.
Military Service[edit]




Lieutenant Rowland U.S. Army Air Corps ca. 1945


From 1943 through 1945 Rowland served in World War II in the United States Army Air Corps, the 8th Air Force, 94th Bomb Group, 333rd Squadron, as a 1st Lieutenant, B17 (“Flying Fortress”) pilot. He was stationed in Bury St. Edmunds, England and made 22 combat missions over Nazi occupied territory. During that time he was awarded the Air Medal and several clusters.[8] It was during those long, sometimes 12 hour missions, sitting in beastly uncomfortable seats, Rowland said, that “I resolved to do something about that if I ever returned home safely”.[9]
Education[edit]
He resumed his education after the war at Principia College in Elsah, Illinois, where in 1949 he earned his Bachelor of Science degree in Physics.[10] He went on to study industrial design at the University of South California and afterwards at Cranbrook Academy of Art in Bloomfield Hills, Michigan, where he earned his master's degree in Industrial Design in 1951.[11]
Early career[edit]
After Cranbrook, Rowland headed for New York City. There he rented a $40 a month room and started applying to industrial design firms for a job. Each design firm he applied to required he sign a form saying that anything he thought of during his employment that they wanted to get a patent on, he would give them the rights for one dollar. When he wouldn’t sign the form, he didn’t get the job. He opted instead to work three jobs outside of the design field while working on his own designs in his spare time. Later, he took a job as head draftsman doing architectural renderings for Norman Bel Geddes, the noted theatrical and industrial designer, the only one who did not require that he sign a form.[6]
During this time Rowland also designed commercial interiors[12] while developing his own designs and inventions, which included lighting,[13] his Transparent Chair for the No-Sag Spring Co. that was exhibited in La Triennale di Milano in 1957 [14] and his patented Drain Dry Cushion, licensed to Lee Woodard & Sons.[15] In 1956 the royalty income from the Drain Dry Cushion allowed Rowland to move from his $40 a month room to an apartment and to open his own office.
The 40/4 chair[edit]
Off and on for eight years, Rowland worked on and perfected a design for a revolutionary new stacking chair with a wire frame and sculpted seat and back. Forty of them could be stacked just 4 feet high on a specially designed dolly. It not only stacked with ease, but could be ganged together to form rows in a matter of seconds. The slim slender profile of the design completely belies the comfort it offers, an attribute achieved only after long testing to find the contour that would best fit the greatest number of human shapes.[16]
For a long time, however, Rowland had difficulty finding a manufacturer willing to take a license to make his versatile chair. They would always turn it down because they couldn’t imagine the chair would be strong enough when it looked so light. The tide turned when the architectural firm of Skidmore, Owings and Merrill ordered 17,000 of the chairs on behalf of the University of Illinois at Chicago Circle[17] (now the University of Illinois at Chicago). Then the General Fireproofing Co. (GF) willingly took a license from Rowland to make the chairs.[18]




David Rowland's 40/4 stacking chair


Sales of the chair took off, earning critical recognition in winning the grand prize at the Milan Triennale, was included in the Museum of Modern Art's (MoMA) permanent collection, and has been in continuous production ever since.[18][19] It was recognized by the American Institute of Interior Designers in 1965.[20] Today it is manufactured by the Danish contract furniture manufacturer Howe a/s and sold around the world. The chair can be found in cultural sites, public buildings, places of worship, universities and schools, corporate offices, conference centers, restaurants and homes, including St Paul's Cathedral for the Wedding of Charles, Prince of Wales, and Lady Diana Spencer and on submarines of the United States Navy.[18]
The 40/4 chair has been called “the most universally useful chair ever made and accomplished with the least expenditure of material and labor”.[21] In 2010 Contract Design Magazine named the 40/4 number one of the top 10 commercial interiors products of the past 50 years.[2]
Later versions[edit]
Rowland continuously worked on refinements of the 40/4 chair and developed variations of it in cooperation with Howe a/s. Currently the 40/4 chair family consists of the original side chair, an armchair, lounge chair, barstool, counter chair, outdoor chair and swivel-base chair, each available in a wide variety of materials and colors.[22]

Personal life[edit]
Rowland was married in 1971 to (Miss) Erwin Wassum, a quilt artist, originally from Virginia. They lived in New York City, before moving to Virginia in 2001. Their only children were their many projects. Rowland had a wide variety of interests, including architecture, wind energy, culture, the arts and traveling the world on business. If someone said something was “impossible” to Rowland, he felt challenged to figure out how the impossible could be achieved. His favorite mottos included “Do the most with the least” and “Never give up!” Rowland was a lifelong Christian Scientist.[23]

David Lincoln Rowland (February 12, 1924 – August 13, 2010) was an American industrial designer famous for his 40/4 chair, so named because it stacks 40 chairs in 4 feet (120 cm) high. The chair was the first compactly stackable chair invented, and is regarded as the gold standard of stackable chairs, not only for its stackability, but for its comfort, durability, timelessness, and grace.[1] Referring to the 40/4, modern critics have noted that “It is unsurpassed to this day in engineering sophistication and production”.[2] In continuous production since its introduction, the chair has sold in the millions around the world over 5 decades and is found in many prestigious locations, including St. Paul’s Cathedral in London and the Museum of Modern Art in New York City.[3]

Early life[edit]
David Lincoln Rowland was born on February 12, 1924, in Los Angeles, the only child of Neva Chilberg Rowland, a violinist and W. Earl Rowland, a California artist, lecturer and teacher.[4] In 1936 he moved with his parents to Stockton, California where his father became director of the Haggin Museum.[5] In the summer of 1940, when he was only 16, he took a course with Laszlo Maholy-Nagy, one of the founders of The Bauhaus school, at Mills College in Oakland, California on Basic Bauhaus Design, an experience which set the direction of his career. He forever after called it “the best summer of my life!”.[6] After graduation from Stockton High School in 1942,[7] he studied drafting, and worked as a draftsman for the Rheem Manufacturing Co., drawing plans for war munitions, before entering military service in World War II.
Military Service[edit]




Lieutenant Rowland U.S. Army Air Corps ca. 1945


From 1943 through 1945 Rowland served in World War II in the United States Army Air Corps, the 8th Air Force, 94th Bomb Group, 333rd Squadron, as a 1st Lieutenant, B17 (“Flying Fortress”) pilot. He was stationed in Bury St. Edmunds, England and made 22 combat missions over Nazi occupied territory. During that time he was awarded the Air Medal and several clusters.[8] It was during those long, sometimes 12 hour missions, sitting in beastly uncomfortable seats, Rowland said, that “I resolved to do something about that if I ever returned home safely”.[9]
Education[edit]
He resumed his education after the war at Principia College in Elsah, Illinois, where in 1949 he earned his Bachelor of Science degree in Physics.[10] He went on to study industrial design at the University of South California and afterwards at Cranbrook Academy of Art in Bloomfield Hills, Michigan, where he earned his master's degree in Industrial Design in 1951.[11]
Early career[edit]
After Cranbrook, Rowland headed for New York City. There he rented a $40 a month room and started applying to industrial design firms for a job. Each design firm he applied to required he sign a form saying that anything he thought of during his employment that they wanted to get a patent on, he would give them the rights for one dollar. When he wouldn’t sign the form, he didn’t get the job. He opted instead to work three jobs outside of the design field while working on his own designs in his spare time. Later, he took a job as head draftsman doing architectural renderings for Norman Bel Geddes, the noted theatrical and industrial designer, the only one who did not require that he sign a form.[6]
During this time Rowland also designed commercial interiors[12] while developing his own designs and inventions, which included lighting,[13] his Transparent Chair for the No-Sag Spring Co. that was exhibited in La Triennale di Milano in 1957 [14] and his patented Drain Dry Cushion, licensed to Lee Woodard & Sons.[15] In 1956 the royalty income from the Drain Dry Cushion allowed Rowland to move from his $40 a month room to an apartment and to open his own office.
The 40/4 chair[edit]
Off and on for eight years, Rowland worked on and perfected a design for a revolutionary new stacking chair with a wire frame and sculpted seat and back. Forty of them could be stacked just 4 feet high on a specially designed dolly. It not only stacked with ease, but could be ganged together to form rows in a matter of seconds. The slim slender profile of the design completely belies the comfort it offers, an attribute achieved only after long testing to find the contour that would best fit the greatest number of human shapes.[16]
For a long time, however, Rowland had difficulty finding a manufacturer willing to take a license to make his versatile chair. They would always turn it down because they couldn’t imagine the chair would be strong enough when it looked so light. The tide turned when the architectural firm of Skidmore, Owings and Merrill ordered 17,000 of the chairs on behalf of the University of Illinois at Chicago Circle[17] (now the University of Illinois at Chicago). Then the General Fireproofing Co. (GF) willingly took a license from Rowland to make the chairs.[18]




David Rowland's 40/4 stacking chair


Sales of the chair took off, earning critical recognition in winning the grand prize at the Milan Triennale, was included in the Museum of Modern Art's (MoMA) permanent collection, and has been in continuous production ever since.[18][19] It was recognized by the American Institute of Interior Designers in 1965.[20] Today it is manufactured by the Danish contract furniture manufacturer Howe a/s and sold around the world. The chair can be found in cultural sites, public buildings, places of worship, universities and schools, corporate offices, conference centers, restaurants and homes, including St Paul's Cathedral for the Wedding of Charles, Prince of Wales, and Lady Diana Spencer and on submarines of the United States Navy.[18]
The 40/4 chair has been called “the most universally useful chair ever made and accomplished with the least expenditure of material and labor”.[21] In 2010 Contract Design Magazine named the 40/4 number one of the top 10 commercial interiors products of the past 50 years.[2]
Later versions[edit]
Rowland continuously worked on refinements of the 40/4 chair and developed variations of it in cooperation with Howe a/s. Currently the 40/4 chair family consists of the original side chair, an armchair, lounge chair, barstool, counter chair, outdoor chair and swivel-base chair, each available in a wide variety of materials and colors.[22]

Personal life[edit]
Rowland was married in 1971 to (Miss) Erwin Wassum, a quilt artist, originally from Virginia. They lived in New York City, before moving to Virginia in 2001. Their only children were their many projects. Rowland had a wide variety of interests, including architecture, wind energy, culture, the arts and traveling the world on business. If someone said something was “impossible” to Rowland, he felt challenged to figure out how the impossible could be achieved. His favorite mottos included “Do the most with the least” and “Never give up!” Rowland was a lifelong Christian Scientist.[23]

David Lincoln Rowland (February 12, 1924 – August 13, 2010) was an American industrial designer famous for his 40/4 chair, so named because it stacks 40 chairs in 4 feet (120 cm) high. The chair was the first compactly stackable chair invented, and is regarded as the gold standard of stackable chairs, not only for its stackability, but for its comfort, durability, timelessness, and grace.[1] Referring to the 40/4, modern critics have noted that “It is unsurpassed to this day in engineering sophistication and production”.[2] In continuous production since its introduction, the chair has sold in the millions around the world over 5 decades and is found in many prestigious locations, including St. Paul’s Cathedral in London and the Museum of Modern Art in New York City.[3]

Early life[edit]
David Lincoln Rowland was born on February 12, 1924, in Los Angeles, the only child of Neva Chilberg Rowland, a violinist and W. Earl Rowland, a California artist, lecturer and teacher.[4] In 1936 he moved with his parents to Stockton, California where his father became director of the Haggin Museum.[5] In the summer of 1940, when he was only 16, he took a course with Laszlo Maholy-Nagy, one of the founders of The Bauhaus school, at Mills College in Oakland, California on Basic Bauhaus Design, an experience which set the direction of his career. He forever after called it “the best summer of my life!”.[6] After graduation from Stockton High School in 1942,[7] he studied drafting, and worked as a draftsman for the Rheem Manufacturing Co., drawing plans for war munitions, before entering military service in World War II.
Military Service[edit]




Lieutenant Rowland U.S. Army Air Corps ca. 1945


From 1943 through 1945 Rowland served in World War II in the United States Army Air Corps, the 8th Air Force, 94th Bomb Group, 333rd Squadron, as a 1st Lieutenant, B17 (“Flying Fortress”) pilot. He was stationed in Bury St. Edmunds, England and made 22 combat missions over Nazi occupied territory. During that time he was awarded the Air Medal and several clusters.[8] It was during those long, sometimes 12 hour missions, sitting in beastly uncomfortable seats, Rowland said, that “I resolved to do something about that if I ever returned home safely”.[9]
Education[edit]
He resumed his education after the war at Principia College in Elsah, Illinois, where in 1949 he earned his Bachelor of Science degree in Physics.[10] He went on to study industrial design at the University of South California and afterwards at Cranbrook Academy of Art in Bloomfield Hills, Michigan, where he earned his master's degree in Industrial Design in 1951.[11]
Early career[edit]
After Cranbrook, Rowland headed for New York City. There he rented a $40 a month room and started applying to industrial design firms for a job. Each design firm he applied to required he sign a form saying that anything he thought of during his employment that they wanted to get a patent on, he would give them the rights for one dollar. When he wouldn’t sign the form, he didn’t get the job. He opted instead to work three jobs outside of the design field while working on his own designs in his spare time. Later, he took a job as head draftsman doing architectural renderings for Norman Bel Geddes, the noted theatrical and industrial designer, the only one who did not require that he sign a form.[6]
During this time Rowland also designed commercial interiors[12] while developing his own designs and inventions, which included lighting,[13] his Transparent Chair for the No-Sag Spring Co. that was exhibited in La Triennale di Milano in 1957 [14] and his patented Drain Dry Cushion, licensed to Lee Woodard & Sons.[15] In 1956 the royalty income from the Drain Dry Cushion allowed Rowland to move from his $40 a month room to an apartment and to open his own office.
The 40/4 chair[edit]
Off and on for eight years, Rowland worked on and perfected a design for a revolutionary new stacking chair with a wire frame and sculpted seat and back. Forty of them could be stacked just 4 feet high on a specially designed dolly. It not only stacked with ease, but could be ganged together to form rows in a matter of seconds. The slim slender profile of the design completely belies the comfort it offers, an attribute achieved only after long testing to find the contour that would best fit the greatest number of human shapes.[16]
For a long time, however, Rowland had difficulty finding a manufacturer willing to take a license to make his versatile chair. They would always turn it down because they couldn’t imagine the chair would be strong enough when it looked so light. The tide turned when the architectural firm of Skidmore, Owings and Merrill ordered 17,000 of the chairs on behalf of the University of Illinois at Chicago Circle[17] (now the University of Illinois at Chicago). Then the General Fireproofing Co. (GF) willingly took a license from Rowland to make the chairs.[18]




David Rowland's 40/4 stacking chair


Sales of the chair took off, earning critical recognition in winning the grand prize at the Milan Triennale, was included in the Museum of Modern Art's (MoMA) permanent collection, and has been in continuous production ever since.[18][19] It was recognized by the American Institute of Interior Designers in 1965.[20] Today it is manufactured by the Danish contract furniture manufacturer Howe a/s and sold around the world. The chair can be found in cultural sites, public buildings, places of worship, universities and schools, corporate offices, conference centers, restaurants and homes, including St Paul's Cathedral for the Wedding of Charles, Prince of Wales, and Lady Diana Spencer and on submarines of the United States Navy.[18]
The 40/4 chair has been called “the most universally useful chair ever made and accomplished with the least expenditure of material and labor”.[21] In 2010 Contract Design Magazine named the 40/4 number one of the top 10 commercial interiors products of the past 50 years.[2]
Later versions[edit]
Rowland continuously worked on refinements of the 40/4 chair and developed variations of it in cooperation with Howe a/s. Currently the 40/4 chair family consists of the original side chair, an armchair, lounge chair, barstool, counter chair, outdoor chair and swivel-base chair, each available in a wide variety of materials and colors.[22]

Personal life[edit]
Rowland was married in 1971 to (Miss) Erwin Wassum, a quilt artist, originally from Virginia. They lived in New York City, before moving to Virginia in 2001. Their only children were their many projects. Rowland had a wide variety of interests, including architecture, wind energy, culture, the arts and traveling the world on business. If someone said something was “impossible” to Rowland, he felt challenged to figure out how the impossible could be achieved. His favorite mottos included “Do the most with the least” and “Never give up!” Rowland was a lifelong Christian Scientist.[23]

David Rowland | Work




























David Rowland








David Rowland’s work is that of innovator, problem solver, futurist, minimalist and artist.
It is intelligent, purposeful, refined and enduring.













1949
Automobiles
Rowland’s automobile designs and renderings from his time at the University of Southern California, foreshadow his propensity for sleek, uncluttered form, exquisite attention to detail and, of course, his skill as an artist.












1949
Molded Veneer Chairs
Rowland’s first chair, the Ribbon Chair, is an experimental design constructed of molded veneer. The second chair, also of molded veneer, has a tubular steel cantilever frame, which adds flexibility to the design. Both designs are exceptionally elegant.











1950
Magic Carpet Chair 
Designed and created by Rowland during his time at Cranbrook, the Magic Carpet Chair is “the padded spring chair that isn’t.” It has the comfort of an upholstered chair, without all the padding. The seat and back are constructed of flexible steel wires woven with wool yarn by his classmate, textile designer, Jack Lenor Larsen, and the design can be easily adapted to seating in cars, buses, airplanes, and even tanks. The seats and backs are also bulletproof, a response to Rowland’s fear, as a WWII bomber pilot, of being hit by bullets from beneath his seat. One of Rowland’s Cranbrook professors says that this chair is, “better than Eames!”—the highest praise for the young industrial designer.










1951
Spider Chair
An experimental chair of woven steel wire and yarn, The Spider Chair is developed and created by Rowland in California and at Cranbrook, where Jack Lenor Larsen wove the seat in a manner similar to the Magic Carpet Chair. It also has a unique torsion bar suspension.











1951
License Plate Gas Cap Cover
Rowland had a summer job pumping gas, and he never knew which side of the car the gas cap would be on. This gave him the idea of moving the gas cap to under the rear license plate of the car, where it would be centrally located and neatly hidden. While at Cranbrook, he takes his design to the chief stylist of a major automobile company in the Detroit area in the hopes of securing a summer job. They tell him they aren’t interested in his feature or in hiring him. Six months later, his license plate gas cap cover appears on their cars. Over the years, the feature is incorporated on over 700 million cars. This is a pivotal moment in Rowland’s career, as he learns early about the importance of patenting and protecting his ideas.









1952
Transparent Chair
The No-Sag Spring Company of Detroit gives Rowland his first commission: an experimental chair that would showcase their springs. The Transparent Chair is a thin, resilient chair at just ¼-inch thick, and is soft, without being bulky. Rowland wanted the design to be as pure as possible while highlighting the company’s sinuous springs. The chair is shown to wide acclaim at the National Home Furnishing Show in New York’s Grand Central Palace, and is called, “a chair ahead of its time”.












1951
Lamps
Rowland designs a number of chandeliers and lamps featuring diffused light. He wins first prize for one of them in a contest sponsored by the New York Residential Lighting Forum and the Illuminating  Engineers Society. The second photo shown here includes a glass  top desk and office of Rowland’s design.











1952
Outdoor Furniture Suite for Maria Bergson
Rowland’s first job in New York is designing and fabricating an  outdoor furniture suite for Maria Bergson. Bergson, best known  for revolutionizing and modernizing commercial office design,  commissions Rowland to design and build a complete set of terrace  furniture for the executive offices of the Pacific Coast Borax  Company in Beverly Hills, CA.











1953
Lounge Set
In the early 1950s, during the work on the Bergson project,  Rowland continued to experiment with his key elements of seating—thin cushions, minimal and efficient base structure, and simple lines that respond to the inclined and draped human form.











1953-1955
Norman Bel Geddes Renderings
Norman Bel Geddes, futurist and “Father of Industrial Design” (a title shared with Raymond Loewy), seeks out Rowland, an excellent draftsman, to work freelance on architectural renderings for him. The three drawings shown here are examples of Rowland’s work for Bel Geddes: two of the renderings are of the Walless House, designed with walls that could be opened or closed depending on the weather. In 1955 Bel Geddes takes his staff, with Rowland as head draftsman, to Jamaica for the summer. There, Rowland makes hundreds of renderings, including many for the interiors of Seagram’s liquor stores.











1953
Drain Dry Cushion
At an outdoor furniture showroom in New York, Rowland introduces himself to a furniture company president who asks him to create a special product—a seating cushion that water would easily pass through. For the next two years, Rowland studies different materials and waterproofing processes until he devises a successful design: the Drain Dry Cushion.  He patents the product and licenses it to Lee Woodward & Sons. The royalty income pays Rowland’s rent for the next 15 years and allows him to open his own studio.










1954
Cohen House
Rowland’s design for an architectural renovation of a residence  in Riverdale, NY, recalls the work of Frank Lloyd Wright, an early  childhood influence.










1955
Residential and Commercial Interiors
Rowland’s interior designs include an apartment on Sutton Place and an office at 666 5th Avenue in New York. In keeping with his commitment to making the greatest impact with the least amount of material, he sometimes used diaphanous screens or beaded dividers to separate space (as in these examples), as well as the simplest contemporary furniture.









1955
MOD, Maximum Order  Dimensioning System
After extensive research on the measurements of human anatomy, Rowland invents his Maximum Order Dimensioning System, or the MOD. When one MOD, which is 5 5/8” long, is multiplied by small whole numbers, the result is a series of optimal product dimensions for people—such as the ideal height for seats, desks, doors, beds, etc. Rowland’s dimensioning system is intended to help create furniture that is the most comfortable for the greatest number of people. His 40/4 Chair is based on the MOD.













1956
Museum Wall System
Rowland creates this singular wall system for hanging works of art in museums and galleries. The ingenious design consists of a metal mesh underside covered with panels of yarn, which eliminates the need for the museum or gallery walls to be repainted when an  exhibition changes. It is an example of Rowland’s forward-thinking approach in which he designs a simple, straightforward product to replace the conventional—burdensome and inefficient—way things had been done.










1957
Mesh Chair
This experimental chair is another example of Rowland’s exploration  of minimalist design. The seat and back are made of either knitted steel or plastic mesh stretched across a tubular steel frame.










1957
Zig Zag Cantilever Chair
The Zig Zag Cantilever Chair further develops the principles Rowland worked out in his earlier Transparent Chair. Its unique patented  mechanical and design features include a weatherproof and squeak-proof method of attaching springs to frame, where the springs are simply snapped over the tubular frame and the assembly dip-coated in vinyl plastic. The chair is included in the prestigious 11th Triennale exhibition in Milan, Italy in 1958. It also wins first prize in a contest sponsored by the National Cotton Batting Institute.









1964
40/4 Chair
Rowland’s 40/4 Chair is one of the most revolutionary furniture  designs of the 20th century. 40 chairs can be stacked in a height of  4 feet. The chair is made of 7/16” diameter steel rods, with a contoured seat and back of plastic resin, molded veneer, metal or upholstery. A whole meeting room or lecture hall can be set up or cleared in minutes, with minimal time and effort. In addition to its unsurpassed stacking and handling qualities, the 40/4 is equally renowned for its comfort, durability, and timeless beauty. It wins the coveted Grand Prize at the 13th Triennale exhibition in Milan, Italy, as well as numerous other awards. It is in permanent collections of museums all over the world. Visit our 40/4 page for more.












1966
Take Home Sofa
This completely collapsible sofa is designed to fit into a slim box that the customer can easily take from store to home, with no need to wait for delivery or special order. It has a removable, snug, stretch slipcover that could be purchased in different colors—no upholstery needed. It is another example of Rowland’s desire for compactness, simplicity, practicality, and efficiency in his design work. The Take Home Sofa is the forerunner of his Modulus Seating System,  introduced twenty years later.











1967
Disposable Safety Ashtray
Rowland did not smoke himself, but observed the need for a safer ashtray. In order to prevent cigarettes from causing burns and fires, he invents an ashtray where cigarettes would always fall into the tray. This patented design is composed of two concentric and stackable cup-shaped receptacles, configured in such a way to prevent  cigarettes from falling out, and is made of a disposable, fireproof  material. The topmost ashtray could be easily lifted off, leaving a clean one underneath.
















1968
The Earl Rowland Foundation
David Rowland establishes this non-profit foundation in honor of his father, Earl Rowland, who had been a California Plein Aire artist, and the director of the Pioneer Galleries and Haggin Museum in Stockton, CA from 1937 to 1964. The principle purpose of the foundation was to develop a library of narrated filmstrip documentaries recording significant museum exhibitions, which were then circulated to smaller museums and educational institutions across the country and abroad.











1973
Soflex
Soflex is a material invented by Rowland in which sinuous metal springs are dipped in vinyl plastisol. When cured, the plastisol hardens and holds the springs together, forming a thin, open-mesh, resilient seating material. Previously, if designers wanted a thin seating material, they had to rely on something hard, like plastic or molded plywood. Conversely, if they wanted something soft, it had to be thick and unwieldy, such as foam cushioning. Soflex solved this predicament by yielding an extremely thin material that was also soft and flexible, affording a comfortable seat. It is made in individual units to be applied to unique seat frames.












1979
Softec Chair
The Softec Chair incorporates Soflex, Rowland’s resilient seating material described above. The chair stacks compactly and is produced in numerous variations. In addition to the side chair, there are arm chairs, bar chairs, outdoor chairs, chairs with tablets, and children’s chairs. The design wins two Institute of Business Designers (I.B.D.) Gold Medals.











1982
Modulus Seating System
The Modulus Seating System grows out of Rowland’s Take Home Sofa design of 1966 and is manufactured by Martela of Finland. This versatile, adaptable system includes chairs, settees, sofas, end tables and connecting pieces, to accommodate a large range of seating configurations. It is appropriate for educational, hospitality, business, and residential seating, and it ships flat.










1984
Billow Chair
The Billow Chair, like the Softec Chair, incorporates Rowland’s resilient seating material Soflex, which allows the chair to have a flexible seat and back with a light, thin profile. On the Billow Chair the seat and back seem to “float.” The lumbar curve of the chair back and sloped edge of its seat work together to create a snug, yet relaxed and comfortable body. The chair is a minimalist icon of passive ergonomics: an elegant example of a chair that “passively”, or automatically, adjusts based on the natural movements of the occupant. It is manufactured by Nienkamper of Canada. The chair wins a Resources Council Product Design Award in 1989.
















2004
40/4 Family of Chairs
Rowland expands the design of the 40/4 Chair for HOWE to include the side chair, arm chair, swivel chair, barstool, lounge chair, and all wood chair, further adding to its versatility. This range and ease of application of the 40/4 concept is further testament to the enduring utility of the design. Visit our 40/4 page for more.












1956-2010
Patents
Rowland gave great thought and care in protecting his ideas and inventions with patents. Over his career he was awarded 45 U.S. and foreign patents.

Why it's called the 40/4 chair 





The 40/4 is available as a stackable side chair, armchair or row of chairs, and in a variety of finishes and fabrics. Up to 40 chairs stack quickly and neatly to a height of just 4 feet, which is why the model is called the 40/4.

Introduction David RowlandDavid Rowland CVDavid Rowland AwardsCollections and Museums 40/440_4_story_rowland_uk.pdf 


David Rowland
Designer David Rowland studied at the Cranbrook Academy of Art, the school that helped train Charles and Ray Eames, Florence Knoll, Harry Bertoia and Eero Saarinen. Early in his career, Rowland worked under Lazlo Moholy-Nagy as well as Norman Bel Geddes.
In the process of taking the 40/4 beyond the prototype stage, the road was paved with all sorts of stumbling blocks. Due to his passion and relentless determination, Rowland made his vision a reality in 1964 with its initial launch and has remained in production ever since. Over eight million 40/4 chairs have been sold to date, proof that you need a brilliant idea to create a timeless design. But you also need to believe in it, to produce it.

For nearly a century, organized medicine tried to discredit and destroy chiropractic.  On 24 August 1987, a U.S. court ruled that the American Medical Association and its officials were guilty of participating in an illegal conspiracy to destroy the chiropractic profession.
Today, this suppression is being carried on by Quackwatch (www.quackwatch.org) – not only against chiropractic but also every established profession that competes with orthodox medicine – including acupuncture, homeopathy, naturopathy, herbal medicine, orthomolecular medicine, and nutrition.  Quackwatch has gone so far as to discredit the Nobel Prize winning scientists, Dr. Linus Pauling and Dr. Otto Warburg.
Quackwatch is headed by Stephen Barrett, a delicensed medical doctor who proudly admits his intention is to damage practitioners and businesses that dare to make alternative therapies and products available.  Barrett often resorts to libel and character assassination in his false propaganda campaigns.
To be targeted by Quackwatch is really a badge of honor.  If the medical profession considers you that much of a threat, you must be helping many people in ways that they cannot.

Effective Formulas

Posted on July 31, 2012  by  drowland 


Vitamost® food-based medicines are so effective primarily because they are formulated for totality, by Prof. David W. Rowland.  Each formula is like a symphony orchestra, with certain instruments playing lead parts and others supporting roles.  And every instrument influences the result.
Nutrients work interactively with each other.  Every factor needed by the body (for a particular purpose) has to be present in optimal amounts and must also have its supporting co-partners present in optimal amounts.  If even one nutrient is lacking, the formula becomes like the proverbial chain that is only as strong as its weakest link.
The body has its own wisdom.  It heals itself, if given the raw materials it needs.  Each   formulas provides a buffet of all of the factors the body needs to do a particular job.  And if everything it could possibly use is provided, the body selectively chooses what it needs and in proportion to its need.  Just as you eat more when you’re hungry and less when you’re not, the body consumes large portions of what it lacks and little or none of what it doesn’t need.
Each of is unique biochemically.  We are as different on the inside as we are on the outside.  Our bodies require the same nutrients, but in different proportions.  Every VItamost®  formula is so complete (for its purpose) that people with widely differing needs benefit from it.  Someone may have deficiencies in, say, four nutrients and also require another seven to assist in utilizing those four.  Others will need a quite different combination of nutrients and co-partners.  If all are present in optimal amounts, each person will get what their unique body requires.
David’s formulas also emphasize essential or primary nutrients – the ones that we have to get from our food supply because the body cannot produce them internally.  If the body gets enough of these basics, then it can produce all of the secondary or intermediate factors it needs – according to its own wisdom and priorities.  For example, if the body gets enough vitamin C, it can make all of the coenzyme Q-10 it needs.  Or if the body gets enough linoleic acid (e.g., from flaxseed oil) and enough vitamins and minerals, it can make all the gamma-linolenic acid it needs without having to take supplements of evening primrose oil.
Form of delivery also makes a difference to effectiveness.  Tablets are used for complex formulations, in order to prevent interaction of ingredients (e.g., choline reacting with vitamin C to produce choline ascorbate).  Capsules are used for ingredients that don’t interact.  Liquids are used for sublingual absorption of homeopathics.  Timed-release forms are never used because of their inefficiency; many people’s digestion isn’t strong enough to break down the multiple layers of wax on the ingredients, and many timed-release products end up in the toilet.

Coronary Artery Photos

Posted on July 30, 2012  by  drowland 


The two photos below were taken inside the same coronary artery of the same 68-year old man who followed the arterial cleansing program described in Prof. Rowland’s book, The Nutritional Bypass.  The photo on the left was taken prior to treatment.  The one on the right was taken after five months on the Nutritional Bypass Program.  Notice how much plaque has been removed (represented by the black areas within the circle).

Before: This is an interior photo of a coronary artery in a 68-year old male patient, prior treatment.
After: This is an interior photo of the same coronary artery in the same 68-year old male patient, after five months of nutritional therapy. This therapy consisted of taking 10 tablets per day of a broad spectrum arterial cleansing formula that includes 16 vitamins, 9 minerals, 2 amino acids and 3 glandular concentrates.

The VITALIZED® Difference

Posted on July 30, 2012  by  drowland 


 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The VITALIZED® Patents
Prof. David Rowland discovered a way to manufacture vitamin/mineral tablets that enhances their bio-energetic qualities.  For this innovation, he was awarded U.S. Patent No. 5,405,613 and Canadian Patent No. 2,057,463.
Documented tests and Kirlian photographs show that tablets made by the unique VITALIZED® method have a significantly higher vibratory rate (“vital force“) than the identical formulas made by conventional methods.  This higher energetic frequency stimulates cells to make more efficient use of nutrients.
The above photos of tablets were taken with a highly sensitive Kirlian camera.  This is an instrument that captures the electromagnetic field of energy that surrounds living beings and physical objects.  The camera’s lighting, aperture, timing and frequency settings were kept constant for the pair of photos.
The photo on the left is of a vitamin-mineral tablet that was manufactured in the conventional way.  The photo on the right is of the identical vitamin-mineral formula but manufactured by the Vitalized® method.  Notice the brighter, more intensely radiant beams of energy emanating from the Vitalized® tablet.

Mineral Absorption

Posted on July 28, 2012  by  drowland 


MYTH:  Chelated minerals, citrates and picolinates are more efficiently absorbed than most other mineral compounds.
TRUTH:  Not necessarily.  If mineral supplements are taken with meals, there is usually no significant difference in absorption.
If mineral supplements are taken with meals, there is no difference in their rate of absorption, regardless of the form that those minerals happen to be in.  Always take mineral supplements with meals in order to enable the body to do its own chelating.  The minerals need to be present with food for this to happen in the stomach.  If digestion is weak, then overcome this weakness by taking supplementary digestive enzymes that will improve the body’s ability to utilize both food and supplements.  This approach is far more effective for overall health than taking pre-chelated minerals which bypass digestive weakness.  Chelated minerals may be better absorbed on an empty stomach but offer no particular advantage compared to minerals taken with food.  
In one study, fasting subjects were given 500 mg. of calcium from each of five calcium compounds and milk.  No significant differences in absorption were found among the various sources of calcium.  The mean net calcium absorption in each case was 39% from calcium carbonate 32% from calcium acetate, 32% from calcium lactate, 31% from milk, 30% from calcium citrate, and 27% from calcium gluconate.  Calcium from calcium carbonate is well absorbed if taken with a meal– even if stomach acid is otherwise too low.  Calcium carbonate provides the highest amount of calcium (40%) of all supplementary sources (e.g., calcium citrate provides 24% and calcium gluconate 9%).  Similarly, magnesium oxide provides the highest amount of magnesium (60%) and potassium chloride has the highest amount of potassium (52%).
