History[edit]
The company was created as a corporate spin-off from Penn National Gaming, effective November 1, 2013.[1] The corporate breakup was designed to increase investor returns by taking advantage of the lack of federal income taxes on REITs.[2]
In November 2013, GLPI agreed to finance a proposed billion-dollar casino in Milford, Massachusetts,[3] but the project was killed days later when town voters rejected the casino.[4]
In January 2014, the company acquired the real estate assets of the Casino Queen in East St. Louis, Illinois for $140 million, and leased them back to the casino's operating company for $14 million a year. GLPI also loaned $43 million to the casino.[5]
The company's Argosy Casino in Sioux City, Iowa was forced to close in July 2014, and GLPI then sold the casino's real estate.[6]
In May 2014, GLPI agreed to buy The Meadows Racetrack and Casino in western Pennsylvania from Cannery Casino Resorts for $465 million. The company said it would sell the facility's license to a third-party operator, while retaining ownership of the land and buildings.[7] The deal ran into trouble, with GLPI filing a lawsuit accusing Cannery of fraud in October 2014; the lawsuit was eventually settled with an agreement on a reduced purchase price of $440 million.[8]
After casino operator Pinnacle Entertainment announced its own plan in November 2014 to spin-off a REIT with the real estate assets of its 15 casinos,[9] GLPI approached Pinnacle with an offer to buy those assets, which it said would be simpler and faster than Pinnacle's plan.[10] Pinnacle did not respond to the offer, so GLPI went public with its offer in March 2015.[10] In July, the companies reached a deal for GLPI to buy 14 of Pinnacle's 15 properties for $4.75 billion in stock, and lease them back to Pinnacle, with rent starting at $377 million per year.[11] The acquisition was completed in April 2016.[12] GLPI also completed its purchase of The Meadows in September 2016 and sold the racetrack operation to Pinnacle for $138 million.[13][14]
In May 2015, GLPI agreed to finance the real estate portion of a proposed $650-million casino in New Bedford, Massachusetts,[15] but the plan was canceled months later after developers failed to secure the rest of the needed funding.[16]
In May 2017, GLPI purchased the real estate assets of Bally's Casino Tunica and Resorts Casino Tunica for a total of $83 million, while Penn National simultaneously acquired their operating assets.[17][18]

History[edit]
The company was created as a corporate spin-off from Penn National Gaming, effective November 1, 2013.[1] The corporate breakup was designed to increase investor returns by taking advantage of the lack of federal income taxes on REITs.[2]
In November 2013, GLPI agreed to finance a proposed billion-dollar casino in Milford, Massachusetts,[3] but the project was killed days later when town voters rejected the casino.[4]
In January 2014, the company acquired the real estate assets of the Casino Queen in East St. Louis, Illinois for $140 million, and leased them back to the casino's operating company for $14 million a year. GLPI also loaned $43 million to the casino.[5]
The company's Argosy Casino in Sioux City, Iowa was forced to close in July 2014, and GLPI then sold the casino's real estate.[6]
In May 2014, GLPI agreed to buy The Meadows Racetrack and Casino in western Pennsylvania from Cannery Casino Resorts for $465 million. The company said it would sell the facility's license to a third-party operator, while retaining ownership of the land and buildings.[7] The deal ran into trouble, with GLPI filing a lawsuit accusing Cannery of fraud in October 2014; the lawsuit was eventually settled with an agreement on a reduced purchase price of $440 million.[8]
After casino operator Pinnacle Entertainment announced its own plan in November 2014 to spin-off a REIT with the real estate assets of its 15 casinos,[9] GLPI approached Pinnacle with an offer to buy those assets, which it said would be simpler and faster than Pinnacle's plan.[10] Pinnacle did not respond to the offer, so GLPI went public with its offer in March 2015.[10] In July, the companies reached a deal for GLPI to buy 14 of Pinnacle's 15 properties for $4.75 billion in stock, and lease them back to Pinnacle, with rent starting at $377 million per year.[11] The acquisition was completed in April 2016.[12] GLPI also completed its purchase of The Meadows in September 2016 and sold the racetrack operation to Pinnacle for $138 million.[13][14]
In May 2015, GLPI agreed to finance the real estate portion of a proposed $650-million casino in New Bedford, Massachusetts,[15] but the plan was canceled months later after developers failed to secure the rest of the needed funding.[16]
In May 2017, GLPI purchased the real estate assets of Bally's Casino Tunica and Resorts Casino Tunica for a total of $83 million, while Penn National simultaneously acquired their operating assets.[17][18]

History[edit]
The company was created as a corporate spin-off from Penn National Gaming, effective November 1, 2013.[1] The corporate breakup was designed to increase investor returns by taking advantage of the lack of federal income taxes on REITs.[2]
In November 2013, GLPI agreed to finance a proposed billion-dollar casino in Milford, Massachusetts,[3] but the project was killed days later when town voters rejected the casino.[4]
In January 2014, the company acquired the real estate assets of the Casino Queen in East St. Louis, Illinois for $140 million, and leased them back to the casino's operating company for $14 million a year. GLPI also loaned $43 million to the casino.[5]
The company's Argosy Casino in Sioux City, Iowa was forced to close in July 2014, and GLPI then sold the casino's real estate.[6]
In May 2014, GLPI agreed to buy The Meadows Racetrack and Casino in western Pennsylvania from Cannery Casino Resorts for $465 million. The company said it would sell the facility's license to a third-party operator, while retaining ownership of the land and buildings.[7] The deal ran into trouble, with GLPI filing a lawsuit accusing Cannery of fraud in October 2014; the lawsuit was eventually settled with an agreement on a reduced purchase price of $440 million.[8]
After casino operator Pinnacle Entertainment announced its own plan in November 2014 to spin-off a REIT with the real estate assets of its 15 casinos,[9] GLPI approached Pinnacle with an offer to buy those assets, which it said would be simpler and faster than Pinnacle's plan.[10] Pinnacle did not respond to the offer, so GLPI went public with its offer in March 2015.[10] In July, the companies reached a deal for GLPI to buy 14 of Pinnacle's 15 properties for $4.75 billion in stock, and lease them back to Pinnacle, with rent starting at $377 million per year.[11] The acquisition was completed in April 2016.[12] GLPI also completed its purchase of The Meadows in September 2016 and sold the racetrack operation to Pinnacle for $138 million.[13][14]
In May 2015, GLPI agreed to finance the real estate portion of a proposed $650-million casino in New Bedford, Massachusetts,[15] but the plan was canceled months later after developers failed to secure the rest of the needed funding.[16]
In May 2017, GLPI purchased the real estate assets of Bally's Casino Tunica and Resorts Casino Tunica for a total of $83 million, while Penn National simultaneously acquired their operating assets.[17][18]

(1)   The guidance figures in the tables above present the guidance provided on April 27, 2017, for the three months ended June 30, 2017.

(2)   Funds from operations ("FFO") is net income, excluding (gains) or losses from sales of property and real estate depreciation as defined by NAREIT.

(3)   Adjusted funds from operations ("AFFO") is FFO, excluding stock based compensation expense, debt issuance costs amortization, other depreciation, amortization of land rights, straight-line rent adjustments and direct financing lease adjustments, reduced by capital maintenance expenditures.

(4)   Adjusted EBITDA is net income excluding interest, taxes on income, depreciation, (gains) or losses from sales of property, stock based compensation expense, straight-line rent adjustments, direct financing lease adjustments and the amortization of land rights.
Chief Executive Officer, Peter M. Carlino, commented, "Our business model promotes stability through long-term master leases with large fixed components and highly respected operators with market-leading assets.  With this structure, as demonstrated by our second quarter results, we are able to consistently deliver reliable cash flow for our investors. For the quarter, Adjusted EBITDA exceeded guidance primarily as the result of solid performance at our TRS Properties, Hollywood Casino Baton Rouge and Hollywood Casino Perryville, as well as incremental rent from Hollywood Casino Toledo, which is managed by Penn National Gaming, Inc. (NASDAQ:PENN)."
Mr. Carlino continued, "On May 1, 2017, we completed the acquisition of the Bally's Casino Tunica and Resorts Casino Tunica ("Tunica Properties") for $82.9 million.  These assets were added to the master lease with PENN and will generate $9.0 million of incremental annual rent.  The accretive Tunica Properties acquisition along with the addition of an annual $5.8 million escalator on the Pinnacle Entertainment, Inc. (NASDAQ:PNK) master lease resulted in our Board deciding to increase our quarterly dividend to $0.63 per share.  Our quarterly dividend has grown at a compounded annual rate of 6.6% in the last three years, with five dividend increases during that period."
"Additionally during the quarter, we completed funding the equity portion of The Meadows Casino and Tunica Properties acquisitions through our existing ATM program.  GLPI sold 3,864,872 shares of common stock with an average price of $36.22. This equity transaction demonstrates our focus on accretive growth while responsively managing our balance sheet for long-term stability and potential future acquisitions."
The Company's second quarter 2017 net income, AFFO and Adjusted EBIDA as compared to its guidance were primarily impacted by the following:

Income from rental activities had a favorable variance of $0.4 million, primarily due to incremental rent from Hollywood Casino Toledo;
Results from the TRS Properties were favorable to guidance by $0.5 million due to higher performance; and
Finalization of the Tunica Properties transaction. 

Portfolio Update
GLPI owns over 4,400 acres of land and approximately 15 million square feet of building space, which was 100% occupied as of June 30, 2017. At the end of the second quarter of 2017, the Company owned the real estate associated with 38 casino facilities and leases 20 of these facilities to PENN, 15 of these facilities to PNK and one to Casino Queen in East St. Louis, Illinois. Two of the gaming facilities, located in Baton Rouge, Louisiana and Perryville, Maryland, are owned and operated by a subsidiary of GLPI, GLP Holdings, Inc., (collectively, the "TRS Properties").
Capital maintenance expenditures at the TRS Properties were $1.2 million for the three months ended June 30, 2017.
Balance Sheet Update
The Company had $29.5 million of unrestricted cash and $4.5 billion in total debt, including $1.1 billion of debt outstanding under its unsecured credit facility term loans and $15.0 million outstanding under its unsecured credit facility revolver at June 30, 2017.  The Company's debt structure as of June 30, 2017 was as follows:

Disclosure Regarding Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Funds From Operations ("FFO"), Adjusted Funds From Operations ("AFFO") and Adjusted EBITDA, which are detailed in the reconciliation tables that accompany this release, are used by the Company as performance measures for benchmarking against the Company's peers and as internal measures of business operating performance, which is used for a bonus metric. The Company believes FFO, AFFO, and Adjusted EBITDA provide a meaningful perspective of the underlying operating performance of the Company's current business.  This is especially true since these measures exclude real estate depreciation, and we believe that real estate values fluctuate based on market conditions rather than depreciating in value ratably on a straight-line basis over time. In addition, in order for the Company to qualify as a REIT, it must distribute 90% of its REIT taxable income annually.  The Company adjusts AFFO accordingly to provide our investors an estimate of taxable income for this distribution requirement. Direct financing lease adjustments represent the portion of cash rent we receive from tenants that is applied against our lease receivable and thus not recorded as revenue and the amortization of land rights represents the non-cash amortization of the value assigned to the Company's assumed ground leases.
FFO, AFFO and Adjusted EBITDA are non-GAAP financial measures, that are considered a supplemental measure for the real estate industry and a supplement to GAAP measures. NAREIT defines FFO as net income (computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles), excluding (gains) or losses from sales of property and real estate depreciation.  We have defined AFFO as FFO excluding stock based compensation expense, debt issuance costs amortization, other depreciation, amortization of land rights, straight-line rent adjustments and direct financing lease adjustments, reduced by capital maintenance expenditures. Finally, we have defined Adjusted EBITDA as net income excluding interest, taxes on income, depreciation, (gains) or losses from sales of property, stock based compensation expense, straight-line rent adjustments, direct financing lease adjustments and the amortization of land rights.
FFO, AFFO and Adjusted EBITDA are not recognized terms under GAAP.  Because certain companies do not calculate FFO, AFFO, and Adjusted EBITDA in the same way and certain other companies may not perform such calculation, those measures as used by other companies may not be consistent with the way the Company calculates such measures and should not be considered as alternative measures of operating profit or net income. The Company's presentation of these measures does not replace the presentation of the Company's financial results in accordance with GAAP.

 NEWS 27 July 2017
Gaming and Leisure Properties Inc. revenue grows 17% in Q2



By Manuel Marti 





									Casino giant Gaming and Leisure Properties Inc. (GLPI) has reported a 17% increase in its total revenue figures during the second quarter of 2017. 
The company posted revenue of $243m at the April-June interval, improving on the $207m generated during the same period last year. 
GLPI reported better-than-expected Adjusted EBITDA results in Q2 of 2017. The corporation’s guidance expected a total of $221m, but it topped $222m. This resulted in a 22% improvement from the prior year’s data. 
Equally impressive results came from its Adjusted Funds From Operations, which were up by 23%, reaching a total of $167m. 
In a corporate statement accompanying the released figures, Chief Executive Officer, Peter M. Carlino, said: “Our business model promotes stability through long-term master leases with large fixed components and highly respected operators with market-leading assets.”
The self-managed real estate investment trust operates by acquiring, financing and owning properties to be leased to gaming operators in triple net lease arrangements. It functions within two segments: GLP Capital L.P - a wholly owned subsidiary of GLPI through which GLPI owns all of its real estate assets - and the TRS Properties, which mainly consists of Hollywood properties. 
GLPI owns over 4,000 acres of land and approximately 15 million square feet of building space, which was all occupied as of June 30, 2017. The company’s latest acquisition was Bally's Casino Tunica and Resorts Casino Tunica Real Estate Assets for $82m. 
Carlino commented on the transaction: “The accretive Tunica Properties acquisition along with the addition of an annual $5.8m escalator on the Pinnacle Entertainment, Inc. master lease resulted in our Board deciding to increase our quarterly dividend to $0.63 per share.
“Our quarterly dividend has grown at a compounded annual rate of 6.6% in the last three years, with five dividend increases during that period."
Following this H1 data, GLPI analysts are optimistic and they expect GLP to finish 2017 in a similar vein. If this was the case, the company would reach $971m total revenue by December 2017, an increase of over $100m compared to last year.

PROMOTING RESPONSIBLE GAMING IS A CORE VALUE OF GAMING AND LEISURE PROPERTIES INC.
Gaming and Leisure Properties Inc. ('GLPI') wants all of our casinos' customers to have fun and to enjoy the casinos safely. We are committed to a policy of responsible gaming. While we recognize that the overwhelming majority of customers at our casinos enjoy our various forms of gambling and non-gambling amenities responsibly, we also understand that there is a small proportion of the population who do not.
To protect them, and others affected by their behavior, our casinos have established a set of policies and guidelines modeled after the American Gaming Association’s Code of Conduct for Responsible Gaming. The “Code” establishes minimum standards that address problem gambling, underage gambling, improper use of alcohol, responsible marketing and advertising and the prevention of unattended minors.
Our casinos use a variety of approaches to promote Responsible Gaming including employee training programs, customer awareness campaigns, self-exclusion and financial restriction programs, written procedures for recognizing and managing these issues, use of outside experts, and ongoing monitoring and review to gauge the effectiveness of these programs.
RECOGNIZING THE PROBLEM
It is widely believed that 1-2% of all gamblers are compulsive and that most experience varying degrees of depression and problems in their lives. Participating in games of chance becomes a self-medicating distraction, providing only temporary relief from underlying problems associated with compulsive behavior.
HOW DO YOU KNOW IF YOU HAVE A GAMBLING PROBLEM?
Review the following questions:
You have often gambled longer than you had planned.
You have often gambled until your last dollar was gone.
Thoughts of gambling have caused you to lose sleep.
You have used your income or savings to gamble while letting bills go unpaid.
You have made repeated, unsuccessful attempts to stop gambling.
You have broken the law or considered breaking the law to finance your gambling.
You have borrowed money to finance your gambling.
You have felt depressed or suicidal because of your gambling losses.
You have been remorseful after gambling.
You have gambled to get money to meet your financial obligations.
If you or someone you know answers yes to any of these questions, consider seeking professional help or advice by calling the National Problem Gambling Helpline at 1-800-522-4700.
WHAT CAN YOU DO IF YOU HAVE A PROBLEM?
Admit that you have a progressive illness that won't go away by itself. Thousands of people have received help through Gamblers Anonymous or other programs designed specifically for people with gambling problems.
CONCERN FOR CHILDREN
GLPI is committed to its casinos providing a safe and secure environment for all of their guests, visitors and team members. An important part of this commitment is to ensure that casino patrons do not leave minors unattended at the facilities. Our casinos post signage informing parents and guardians not to leave children unsupervised. Employees are trained to be on the lookout for any unattended children and to report any such children to the casino security department while keeping an eye on the child until security arrives on the scene.
PREVENTION OF UNDERAGE GAMBLING/ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION
GLPI casinos require persons to be aged 21 or older in order to gamble or to purchase/consume alcohol. Team members at the casinos are extensively trained to be on the lookout for persons under 21 trying to enter the casino and staff is trained to request identification of anyone appearing to be under age. Team members are authorized to ask any person gambling or purchasing/drinking alcohol for proof of age. Casino staff will confiscate any false or altered IDs and may inform outside law enforcement and gaming agents. We have zero tolerance for underage persons trying to circumvent the law.
RESOURCES AVAILABLE
Besides the National Problem Gambling Helpline, individual states also run free confidential problem gambling help lines and provide on-line information on problem gambling. For those seeking more information, or assistance with these issues the following individual state resources are available:

ABOUT GAMING AND LEISURE PROPERTIES, INC.
Gaming and Leisure Properties, Inc. (“GLP”) is a self-administered and self-managed Pennsylvania real estate investment trust company (“REIT”) that was incorporated on February 13, 2013. GLP elected on its U.S. federal income tax return for the taxable year beginning on January 1, 2014 to be treated as a REIT and intends to continue to be organized and to operate in a manner that will permit it to qualify as a REIT. The Company’s primary business consists of acquiring, financing, and owning real property to be leased to gaming operators in “triple net” lease arrangements.
GLP’s portfolio currently consists of 38 gaming and related facilities, which are geographically diversified across 14 states. Its tenants include Penn National Gaming, Inc., Casino Queen, and Pinnacle Entertainment, Inc. GLP also owns and operates the assets and liabilities of Louisiana Casino Cruises, Inc. (“Hollywood Casino Baton Rouge”) and Penn Cecil Maryland, Inc. (“Hollywood Casino Perryville”) through an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary, GLP Holdings, Inc.
GLP owns substantially all of the real estate assets of its tenants and leases those assets back to its tenants for use by their operating subsidiaries pursuant to master leases. In April 2016, the Company acquired substantially all of the real estate assets of Pinnacle Entertainment, Inc. (“Pinnacle”) for approximately $4.8 billion and GLP leases the related assets back to Pinnacle under a triple-net lease.
GLP expects to grow its portfolio by pursuing opportunities to acquire additional gaming facilities to lease to gaming operators. GLP also anticipates diversifying its portfolio over time by acquiring properties outside the gaming industry. The expertise of GLP’s management team will allow it to secure additional avenues for growth beyond the gaming industry and allow it to pursue other acquisitions that may prove complementary to GLP's gaming facilities.

History[edit]
The company was created as a corporate spin-off from Penn National Gaming, effective November 1, 2013.[1] The corporate breakup was designed to increase investor returns by taking advantage of the lack of federal income taxes on REITs.[2]
In November 2013, GLPI agreed to finance a proposed billion-dollar casino in Milford, Massachusetts,[3] but the project was killed days later when town voters rejected the casino.[4]
In January 2014, the company acquired the real estate assets of the Casino Queen in East St. Louis, Illinois for $140 million, and leased them back to the casino's operating company for $14 million a year. GLPI also loaned $43 million to the casino.[5]
The company's Argosy Casino in Sioux City, Iowa was forced to close in July 2014, and GLPI then sold the casino's real estate.[6]
In May 2014, GLPI agreed to buy The Meadows Racetrack and Casino in western Pennsylvania from Cannery Casino Resorts for $465 million. The company said it would sell the facility's license to a third-party operator, while retaining ownership of the land and buildings.[7] The deal ran into trouble, with GLPI filing a lawsuit accusing Cannery of fraud in October 2014; the lawsuit was eventually settled with an agreement on a reduced purchase price of $440 million.[8]
After casino operator Pinnacle Entertainment announced its own plan in November 2014 to spin-off a REIT with the real estate assets of its 15 casinos,[9] GLPI approached Pinnacle with an offer to buy those assets, which it said would be simpler and faster than Pinnacle's plan.[10] Pinnacle did not respond to the offer, so GLPI went public with its offer in March 2015.[10] In July, the companies reached a deal for GLPI to buy 14 of Pinnacle's 15 properties for $4.75 billion in stock, and lease them back to Pinnacle, with rent starting at $377 million per year.[11] The acquisition was completed in April 2016.[12] GLPI also completed its purchase of The Meadows in September 2016 and sold the racetrack operation to Pinnacle for $138 million.[13][14]
In May 2015, GLPI agreed to finance the real estate portion of a proposed $650-million casino in New Bedford, Massachusetts,[15] but the plan was canceled months later after developers failed to secure the rest of the needed funding.[16]
In May 2017, GLPI purchased the real estate assets of Bally's Casino Tunica and Resorts Casino Tunica for a total of $83 million, while Penn National simultaneously acquired their operating assets.[17][18]

Short Interest In Gaming & Leisure Properties Declines 16.8%
The most recent short interest data has been released for the 04/28/2017 settlement date, which shows a 1,087,136 share decrease in total short interest for Gaming & Leisure Properties, Inc , to 5,376,325, a decrease of 16.82% since 04/13/2017. Total short interest is just one way to look at short data; another metric that we here at Dividend Channel find particularly useful is the "days to cover" metric because it considers both the total shares short and the average daily volume of shares traded.

History[edit]
The company was created as a corporate spin-off from Penn National Gaming, effective November 1, 2013.[1] The corporate breakup was designed to increase investor returns by taking advantage of the lack of federal income taxes on REITs.[2]
In November 2013, GLPI agreed to finance a proposed billion-dollar casino in Milford, Massachusetts,[3] but the project was killed days later when town voters rejected the casino.[4]
In January 2014, the company acquired the real estate assets of the Casino Queen in East St. Louis, Illinois for $140 million, and leased them back to the casino's operating company for $14 million a year. GLPI also loaned $43 million to the casino.[5]
The company's Argosy Casino in Sioux City, Iowa was forced to close in July 2014, and GLPI then sold the casino's real estate.[6]
In May 2014, GLPI agreed to buy The Meadows Racetrack and Casino in western Pennsylvania from Cannery Casino Resorts for $465 million. The company said it would sell the facility's license to a third-party operator, while retaining ownership of the land and buildings.[7] The deal ran into trouble, with GLPI filing a lawsuit accusing Cannery of fraud in October 2014; the lawsuit was eventually settled with an agreement on a reduced purchase price of $440 million.[8]
After casino operator Pinnacle Entertainment announced its own plan in November 2014 to spin-off a REIT with the real estate assets of its 15 casinos,[9] GLPI approached Pinnacle with an offer to buy those assets, which it said would be simpler and faster than Pinnacle's plan.[10] Pinnacle did not respond to the offer, so GLPI went public with its offer in March 2015.[10] In July, the companies reached a deal for GLPI to buy 14 of Pinnacle's 15 properties for $4.75 billion in stock, and lease them back to Pinnacle, with rent starting at $377 million per year.[11] The acquisition was completed in April 2016.[12] GLPI also completed its purchase of The Meadows in September 2016 and sold the racetrack operation to Pinnacle for $138 million.[13][14]
In May 2015, GLPI agreed to finance the real estate portion of a proposed $650-million casino in New Bedford, Massachusetts,[15] but the plan was canceled months later after developers failed to secure the rest of the needed funding.[16]
In May 2017, GLPI purchased the real estate assets of Bally's Casino Tunica and Resorts Casino Tunica for a total of $83 million, while Penn National simultaneously acquired their operating assets.[17][18]

In May 2015, GLPI agreed to finance the real estate portion of a proposed $650-million casino in New Bedford, Massachusetts,[15] but the plan was canceled months later after developers failed to secure the rest of the needed funding.[16]
In May 2017, GLPI purchased the real estate assets of Bally's Casino Tunica and Resorts Casino Tunica for a total of $83 million, while Penn National simultaneously acquired their operating assets.[17][18]
