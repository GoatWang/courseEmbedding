Learn Why Cvi Investments Inc Just Opened Huge Tengion Inc Position


10/02/2015  by OctaStaff 
			in SEC 13G & 13D Filings 












Share with your friendsYour NameYour EmailRecipient EmailEnter a MessageI read this article and found it very interesting, thought it might be interesting for you. The article is called Learn Why Cvi Investments Inc Just Opened Huge Tengion Inc Position and is was published by Octafinance.com at http://www.octafinance.com/learn-why-cvi-investments-inc-just-opened-huge-tengion-inc-position/213410/.CaptchaSubmitCvi Investments, Inc New Position in Tengion Inc
Cvi Investments, Inc has filled a SC 13G form regarding Tengion Inc . Filing Link: 000110465915068777. Per Cvi Investments, Inc’s filing, the filler now owns 9.9% of the company, holding 4,464,229 shares.
 Tengion Inc is a newly disclosed equity position and the filing was required due to activity on September 23, 2015. This most probably shows Cvi Investments, Inc’s confidence and optimism in the future of the company.
Company Profile
Tengion, Inc. is a regenerative medicine company focused on discovering, developing, manufacturing and commercializing a range of neo-organs, or products composed of living cells, with or without synthetic or natural materials, implanted or injected into the body to engraft into, regenerate, or replace a damaged tissue or organ. The Company, by using its Organ Regeneration Platform, it creates neo-organs using patient’s own cells. The Company, based on its clinical and preclinical experience is leveraging its Organ Regeneration Platform to develop Neo-Kidney Augment for patients with advanced chronic kidney disease and Neo-Urinary Conduit for bladder cancer patients who are in need of a urinary diversion. The Company’s product candidates are intended to delay or eliminate the need for chronic disease therapies, organ transplantation, and the administration of anti-rejection medications.

Form 13G is used when the filer owns between 5% and 20% of the company and plans to hold it only as a passive investor. If the filler intend to exert control and if the stake’s size exceeds 20%, then a 13D must be filed. Therefore, activist investors and practices such as: hostile takeovers, company breakups, and other “change of control” events, are not permitted by 13G filers.
