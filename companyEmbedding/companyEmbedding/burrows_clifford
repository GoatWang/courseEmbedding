                The Top 4 Starbucks Shareholders (SBUX)            


    By Matt Rego | Updated December 2, 2016 — 1:02 PM EST    






Share
























































The Starbucks Corporation's (NASDAQ: SBUX) rise to fame started from a single coffee shop in Seattle's Pike Place Market in 1971. As of October 2, 2016, the coffee giant owned over 25,000 company-operated and licensed stores globally. With humble beginnings, Starbucks' explosive success is among the many great American business stories that entrepreneurs study.
While Starbucks is known for its coffee, the company continues to find growth through other beverages, such as tea, beer and wine. Starbucks has also continued to focus on its café presence through a wider range of food options, stylish restaurant remodeling, a revamped rewards program and continued international expansion. As the company reported another strong year of earnings per share (EPS) at $1.90 per share in fiscal 2016, Starbucks' top shareholders stand to be the major beneficiaries.
Howard Schultz
The founder and chief executive officer (CEO) of Starbucks Corporation, Howard Schultz is the single largest holder of Starbucks shares. According to Yahoo Finance, Schultz holds around 29.6 million shares of the coffee giant's stock as of December 2015. Schultz joined the Starbucks Coffee Company as the director of retail and marketing in 1982. He later incorporated Starbucks in 1985, after his Il Giornale Coffee Company bought up Starbucks Coffee Company's assets. Since returning to Starbucks in 2008, Schultz served as the president and CEO. At the end of 2016, he announced that he would be turning over the position of CEO to Kevin Johnson in 2017. 
John Culver
After longtime chairman and large shareholder James Shennan Jr. sold off a majority of his Starbucks stake in February 2016, John Culver became the newly-minted second-largest individual shareholder of Starbucks stock. As of May 2016, Culver held 314,768 shares of Starbucks according to Yahoo Finance. Since joining Starbucks in August 2002, Culver has held many positions, including president of Starbucks' China and Asia-Pacific business, president of Starbucks Coffee International, and served in other senior executive roles with the company's Global Consumer Products segment, food service business and Seattle's Best Coffee business. Culver currently is a group president of Global Retail at Starbucks.
Clifford Burrows
Clifford Burrows, who has worked at Starbucks since April 2001, is the third-largest individual shareholder of Starbucks, with 280,024 shares as of November 2015 according to Yahoo Finance. Burrows served as a vice president of U.K. Starbucks in 2006 and president of the company's Europe, Middle East and Africa business from 2006 to 2008. He managed Starbucks Coffee U.S. from 2008 to 2011 and took over supervision of Americas and U.S. in 2011. In 2014, Burrows joined Teavana as the company's group president of U.S. and Americas. Burrows has since become Starbucks' group president of Siren Retail as of September 2016.
Mellody L Hobson
Mellody Hobson surpassed newly appointed CEO Kevin Johnson by the number of shares in 2016. Hobson served on the Starbucks board of directors since February 2005 and as of September 1, 2016, owns 163,743 shares of the company according to Yahoo Finance. Since 2000 Hobson served as a president of Ariel Investments LLC, a Chicago-based firm and is one the board of directors at Estee Lauder Companies, Inc. and DreamWorks Animation SKG, Inc.

University of Bath in September 2003. 
The focus of the volume is principally on motion control
systems, with an emphasis on hydraulic and pneumatic systems and
components as the means of power transmission. 
The book will be of considerable interest to researchers and
practitioners concerned with mechatronics, and drive systems and
their control. 
 Contents include:

A statistically-based fault detection technique for
single-stage electro-hydraulic proportional valves
Catalytic effects of copper on the oxidation of ester-based
lubricants
Effect of model characteristics on numerical results for a
hydraulic high-pressure nozzle system
The effect of parameter uncertainty on the response of a
pressure compensated mobile valve
Closed loop velocity control of a small teleoperated hydraulic
machine
Active structural control using hydraulic actuator
Stabilization of a hydraulic steering unit OSPF
FMECA of an offshore man-riding winch
A new approach to predict the load carrying ability of the gap
between valve plate and cylinder block
Development of ceramic pistons and slippers for radial piston
pumps
