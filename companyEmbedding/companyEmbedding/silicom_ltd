					Full Description



Silicom Ltd. (Silicom), incorporated on February 4, 1987, is engaged in the design, manufacture, marketing and support of networking and data infrastructure solutions for a range of servers, server-based systems and communications devices. The Company's products include server network interface cards with and without bypass (Server Adapters); Intelligent and programmable cards, with features, such as encryption, acceleration, data compression, redirection, time stamping, network capture solutions, field programmable gate array (FPGA) based ultra-low latency solutions, other offload features and/or compute blades (Smart Cards), and standalone Products.The Company's market segments for its products include network appliances, including wide area network (WAN) optimization, Internet security, cyber security, application delivery, traffic Management network monitoring and analytics, high frequency trading (HFT) for the financial service market and other mission-critical segments; servers; data storage, including Big Data; The Cloud, virtualized data centers, with and without software-defined networking (SDN), and Internet of Things (IOT). The Company's products are sold to original equipment manufacturer (OEM) customers offering networking appliances, servers and storage devices.Server AdaptersThe Company is involved in the development of a line of products for the server networking industry, which facilitates interaction between servers and switches, allowing them to communicate with each other through ports. The Company designs products that allow server-based systems to use 1/10/40/100 Gigabit Ethernet. These products have either one, two, four, six or eight ports, which plug into the servers that need to have such capabilities. The Company also designs some of these same server adapter products with a bypass feature. Gigabit Ethernet Bypass Networking Cards feature bypass circuitry to maintain continuity of network connectivity in the event of an appliance failure.Smart AdaptersThe Company's Smart Adapter products include server adapters, such as redirector cards; encryption and data compression hardware acceleration cards; time stamping and full FPGA based network capture and mobile operational support systems (OSS) distribution solutions; Network processor acceleration cards; VHIO-a product off-loading virtualization switching from the Central Processing Unit (CPU); FPGA based ultra-low latency solutions, and compute blades which offer general compute capability in networking intensive environment.The Company's redirector cards provide traffic filtering in order to reduce the amount of traffic received by the server, limiting it to only essential traffic for the server CPU, as well as load-balancing between external servers and/or CPUs and/or CPU cores. The Company's product line of encryption cards independently executes encryption tasks, thereby accelerating the encryption process and freeing the CPUs of such appliances for other activities. Its Peripheral Component Interconnect Express (PCI-E) Network processor-based smart cards are targeted for server acceleration by providing a packet processing platform which can be used to off-load packet processing applications from the main CPU onto a processor card, and consequently freeing CPU cycles for the main application and improving server performance.Standalone ProductsThe Company's Standalone Products include Bypass Switches and Intelligent Bypass Switches, which allow the use of its solutions even where the networking component of the solution is already present; the Server To Appliance Converter (SETAC) product family, a solution that enables standard servers to be configured as network appliances with front networking ports, including Switched SETAC, which adds the functionality of a switch to such a solution; the Customer premise equipment (CPE)/Enhanced Data for Global System for Mobile communications (GSM) Evolution EDGE/Low End Appliance Units, which integrate its compute blades and enable to offer a standalone solution with general compute capability in networking intensive environment to the customer.The Company's SETAC products convert standard servers to network appliances. The SETAC product line includes SETAC converters, consisting of PCI-Express G2 and G3 adapters, cables and backplane, which interface with its front loading I/O Express Modules adapters. SETAC products are installed by a process of placing the Company's I/O Express Modules adapters into a server's hard drive slots. This combination provides standard servers to be configured as network appliances with server-grade reliability, front-end access, field replaceable architecture and a stable technology environment.The Company competes with Intel, Interface Masters, Portwell, Casewell, Lanner, Adlink, Cavium, Mellanox, Netronome, Napatech, CSP, Exar, IXIA, Advantech, Nexcom and Gigamon.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.
