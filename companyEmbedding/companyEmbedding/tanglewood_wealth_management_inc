                Brian Merrill, partner at Houston-based Tanglewood Wealth Management Inc., would welcome… more 

                Gittings HEX            








 



San Francisco-based Charles Schwab Corp. (NYSE: SCHW) jolted wealth managers from complacency a few weeks ago when it launched its very own robo-adviser service, also known as a Schwab Intelligent Portfolios, a fully automated investment management service allowing investors with lesser assets the freedom to manage their own investments for free.
"Everybody loves free," said Brian Merrill, partner at Houston-based Tanglewood Wealth Management Inc. "I mean you can’t compete on price (with) free."

But from the comprehensive wealth manager's vantage point, the addition of such automated services into the market could be a welcome game changer.

When Charles Schwab launched its intelligent portfolios service, it also heralded the launch of an institutional version of the service targeting registered investment advisors sometime in the second quarter. It's this new offering that has firms like Tanglewood eager with anticipation.
"We’re actually thinking about using it," said Merrill.
Merrill said it would come into consideration for the firm's retail accounts for which Tanglewood doesn't have the discretion to manage, typically offshoots from the firm's $2 million-plus wealth management accounts.
"It (would) make us more efficient by letting us focus on the discretionary accounts that we manage," said Merrill.
The new platform would fit into Tangelwood's broader strategy of streamlining different account types: the large wealth management accounts, investment management accounts which vary in size starting at roughly $500,000, and the smaller retail accounts that are less than $200,000. The smallest of the three is where an automated system could come into play.




 


Tanglewood ranked 18th on the Houston Business Journal's List of Largest Houston-Area Money Management Firms with $840 million in assets under management.
In truth, Tanglewood would rather spend less time on accounts that don't give the firm managerial discretion, as would most wealth managers in Houston, said Merrill. The addition of a Schwab-like robo-adviser to Tanglewood's platform wouldn't even be something the firm would necessarily advertise, but rather just have in the back pocket to make that particular service leaner and more self-sufficient.
"Everyone who wants to play in that area (smaller retail accounts), good luck, ya'll have fun," said Merrill. "We’re going to focus on true wealth management, which is comprehensive financial planning and investment management."

	Tanglewood Total Wealth Management is an award-winning wealth management ﬁrm that has been serving the quietly wealthy since 1979.

	We have been working with the quietly wealthy for more than 35 years to manage and make the most of their wealth. We know wealth can create complexity, even when you crave simplicity. It can bring uncertainty when what you want is clarity. Wealth brings many things, but what matters most to us is what you want it to bring to your life.

	Any ﬁrm can make claims of expertise, personal service and putting clients ﬁrst. But it is the rare ﬁrm that truly delivers on these high standards and expectations. When choosing a wealth management ﬁrm, it’s not what you see that matters; it’s what you don’t see that makes all the diﬀerence.

	At Tanglewood, we approach each client with the same care, concern and attention one would give a dear friend. Some would call this old-fashioned. We call it Signature Service.

	Just like a tailor custom-ﬁts a suit made to your exact speciﬁcations, our Total Wealth Management process is hand-crafted for you—and with you—reﬂecting who you are, what is important to you and why.

	We closely partner with you to ensure every aspect of your plan delivers clarity and provides conﬁdence for your ﬁnancial path. We draw on our decades of experience working with generations of wealth to simplify the complicated, keep you informed and completely comfortable.

	We work to inspire an uncommon level of conﬁdence that allows you to sleep better at night knowing we’re working hard on protecting and growing your wealth.

	Welcome to Tanglewood Total Wealth Management. We invite you to Experience the Diﬀerence.
