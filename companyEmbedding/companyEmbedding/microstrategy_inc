MicroStrategy 8 hits the market with OLAP reporting, a reimagined report and dashboard design interface, and enhanced data source support.





2009
In 2009, MicroStrategy undertook a redesign of its platform architecture—the result, MicroStrategy 9, was the company’s biggest release in over 15 years.





2010
The release of MicroStrategy Mobile revolutionized the business intelligence landscape and changed the way that business people interact with data.





2011
MicroStrategy Cloud launches, combining all the enterprise analytics and mobility functionality of the MicroStrategy platform with powerful cloud data services.

History[edit]
Michael J. Saylor started MicroStrategy in 1989 with a consulting contract from DuPont, which provided Saylor with $250,000 in start-up capital and office space in Wilmington, Delaware. Saylor was soon joined by company co-founder Sanju Bansal, whom he had met while the two were students at MIT.[10] The company produced software for data mining and business intelligence using nonlinear mathematics,[7] an idea inspired by a course[which?] that they took at MIT.[11] During this time period, the company experienced rapid growth. In 1992, it gained its first major client when it signed a $10 million contract with McDonald's, and increased revenues by 100% every year between 1990 and 1996.[10] In 1994, they moved the company's offices and its 50 employees from Delaware to Tysons Corner, Virginia.[12] MicroStrategy had its initial public offering in June 1998.[13] On its first day of trading, the stock price doubled.[14]
In 2000 MicroStrategy founded Angel an IVR and voice application company. In March 2000, after a review of its accounting practices, MicroStrategy announced that it would restate its financial results for the preceding two years,[15] which resulted in an investigation by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.[16] A lawsuit was subsequently filed against MicroStrategy and certain of its officials over fraud.[17] In December 2000, Saylor, Bansal, and the company's former CFO settled with the SEC without admitting wrongdoing by each paying $350,000 in fines. The officers also paid a combined total of $10 million in disgorgement. The firm itself was charged with a number of violations and settled with the SEC by hiring an independent director to ensure regulatory compliance.[18][19]
By the fourth quarter of 2003, the company added over 200 new corporate customers[20] and posted increased revenue for every quarter through the end of 2007.[21] In 2007 and 2008, the company was named one of the 200 Best Small Companies in America by Forbes.[22]
In 2009, the company introduced OLAP Services with a shared data set cache, to accelerate reports and ad hoc queries.[23] The relational nature of the OLAP services allowed users to drill down through the database to the transaction-level detail.[24]
In 2010, the company began developing and deploying business intelligence software for mobile platforms, such as the iPhone and iPad.[25] Also in 2011, it expanded its offerings to include a cloud-based service, MicroStrategy Cloud.[26]
In 2013, MicroStrategy sold Angel to Genesys Telecommunications Laboratories for $110 Million USD.[27]
In January 2014, the company announced a new feature of the platform called PRIME (Parallel Relational In-Memory Engine), co-developed with Facebook. It is a massively parallel processing engine that the company said can support a data volume of 4.6TB and 200 billion rows.[28] In May, 2014, Microstrategy announced the availability of its enterprise software platforms available via subscription on the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Marketplace.[29]
The company slashed Saylor's salary from $875,000 to $1 in September 2014 at his request.[30] In October 2014 the company announced plans to lay off 770 employees.[31]
In April 2015, MicroStrategy introduced enterprise security platform Usher™ and debuted the Usher Software Development Kit. In June 2015, MicroStrategy announced the general availability of MicroStrategy 10™, combining enhanced business-intelligence functionality with data discovery, mobile analytics and enterprise-grade security.[32]
In March 2016. MicroStrategy 10 was showcased in the BI Bake-Off, a product face-off that took place at the Gartner Business Intelligence and Analytics Summit at the Gaylord Texan Hotel & Convention Center in Grapevine, Texas.[33] In March 2017, the company announced the general availability of MicroStrategy 10.7, the latest update to the company's MicroStrategy 10 platform. The release included a new set of APIs and data integration options for building custom connectors to external sources.[34]

Product details[edit]

MicroStrategy Analytics allows large organizations to analyze vast amounts of data and securely distribute actionable business insight throughout an enterprise, while also being able to cater to smaller workgroups and departmental use via MicroStrategy Desktop. MicroStrategy Analytics delivers reports and dashboards, and enables users to conduct ad hoc analysis and share insights via mobile devices (via MicroStrategy Mobile) or the Web (via MicroStrategy Web). It also combines the agility of self-service visual data discovery with the security, scalability, and governance features of enterprise-grade business intelligence. MicroStrategy Analytics is available both as on-premises software and as a hosted service offering in MicroStrategy Cloud.[38]
MicroStrategy Mobile, introduced in 2010, is a software platform integrating Analytics capabilities into mobile business apps for the iPhone, iPad, Android, and BlackBerry. It allows improved transactional efficiencies and easier access to intelligence data without needing to reformat the data for different platforms.[28] Apps using it can deliver business intelligence and transactional data derived from their existing data sources, including data warehouses, ERP, CRM and other information systems.[39]
Usher is a digital credential and identity intelligence product that offers a secure, convenient way for organizations to control digital and physical access. By replacing physical badges and passwords with secure digital badges, Usher is able to generate critical information on user behavior and resource usage that can be used to make organizations more productive and secure.[40][41] Usher's technology architecture incorporates the use of three-factor authentication, out-of-band channels, time-limited codes, and bidirectional public key infrastructure encryption.[42]

Awards and recognition[edit]
In 2011, Apple recognized MicroStrategy's iOS app as one of the best business apps of the year.[43] In 2012, the Business Application Research Center (BARC) ranked MicroStrategy first overall in Mobile BI in the BI Survey 12.[44] Also in 2012, Information Management named MicroStrategy one of the "Forty Vendors We’re Watching" for its ability to understand new business trends.[45]

History[edit]
Michael J. Saylor started MicroStrategy in 1989 with a consulting contract from DuPont, which provided Saylor with $250,000 in start-up capital and office space in Wilmington, Delaware. Saylor was soon joined by company co-founder Sanju Bansal, whom he had met while the two were students at MIT.[10] The company produced software for data mining and business intelligence using nonlinear mathematics,[7] an idea inspired by a course[which?] that they took at MIT.[11] During this time period, the company experienced rapid growth. In 1992, it gained its first major client when it signed a $10 million contract with McDonald's, and increased revenues by 100% every year between 1990 and 1996.[10] In 1994, they moved the company's offices and its 50 employees from Delaware to Tysons Corner, Virginia.[12] MicroStrategy had its initial public offering in June 1998.[13] On its first day of trading, the stock price doubled.[14]
In 2000 MicroStrategy founded Angel an IVR and voice application company. In March 2000, after a review of its accounting practices, MicroStrategy announced that it would restate its financial results for the preceding two years,[15] which resulted in an investigation by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.[16] A lawsuit was subsequently filed against MicroStrategy and certain of its officials over fraud.[17] In December 2000, Saylor, Bansal, and the company's former CFO settled with the SEC without admitting wrongdoing by each paying $350,000 in fines. The officers also paid a combined total of $10 million in disgorgement. The firm itself was charged with a number of violations and settled with the SEC by hiring an independent director to ensure regulatory compliance.[18][19]
By the fourth quarter of 2003, the company added over 200 new corporate customers[20] and posted increased revenue for every quarter through the end of 2007.[21] In 2007 and 2008, the company was named one of the 200 Best Small Companies in America by Forbes.[22]
In 2009, the company introduced OLAP Services with a shared data set cache, to accelerate reports and ad hoc queries.[23] The relational nature of the OLAP services allowed users to drill down through the database to the transaction-level detail.[24]
In 2010, the company began developing and deploying business intelligence software for mobile platforms, such as the iPhone and iPad.[25] Also in 2011, it expanded its offerings to include a cloud-based service, MicroStrategy Cloud.[26]
In 2013, MicroStrategy sold Angel to Genesys Telecommunications Laboratories for $110 Million USD.[27]
In January 2014, the company announced a new feature of the platform called PRIME (Parallel Relational In-Memory Engine), co-developed with Facebook. It is a massively parallel processing engine that the company said can support a data volume of 4.6TB and 200 billion rows.[28] In May, 2014, Microstrategy announced the availability of its enterprise software platforms available via subscription on the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Marketplace.[29]
The company slashed Saylor's salary from $875,000 to $1 in September 2014 at his request.[30] In October 2014 the company announced plans to lay off 770 employees.[31]
In April 2015, MicroStrategy introduced enterprise security platform Usher™ and debuted the Usher Software Development Kit. In June 2015, MicroStrategy announced the general availability of MicroStrategy 10™, combining enhanced business-intelligence functionality with data discovery, mobile analytics and enterprise-grade security.[32]
In March 2016. MicroStrategy 10 was showcased in the BI Bake-Off, a product face-off that took place at the Gartner Business Intelligence and Analytics Summit at the Gaylord Texan Hotel & Convention Center in Grapevine, Texas.[33] In March 2017, the company announced the general availability of MicroStrategy 10.7, the latest update to the company's MicroStrategy 10 platform. The release included a new set of APIs and data integration options for building custom connectors to external sources.[34]
Products[edit]

Product details[edit]

MicroStrategy Analytics allows large organizations to analyze vast amounts of data and securely distribute actionable business insight throughout an enterprise, while also being able to cater to smaller workgroups and departmental use via MicroStrategy Desktop. MicroStrategy Analytics delivers reports and dashboards, and enables users to conduct ad hoc analysis and share insights via mobile devices (via MicroStrategy Mobile) or the Web (via MicroStrategy Web). It also combines the agility of self-service visual data discovery with the security, scalability, and governance features of enterprise-grade business intelligence. MicroStrategy Analytics is available both as on-premises software and as a hosted service offering in MicroStrategy Cloud.[38]
MicroStrategy Mobile, introduced in 2010, is a software platform integrating Analytics capabilities into mobile business apps for the iPhone, iPad, Android, and BlackBerry. It allows improved transactional efficiencies and easier access to intelligence data without needing to reformat the data for different platforms.[28] Apps using it can deliver business intelligence and transactional data derived from their existing data sources, including data warehouses, ERP, CRM and other information systems.[39]
Usher is a digital credential and identity intelligence product that offers a secure, convenient way for organizations to control digital and physical access. By replacing physical badges and passwords with secure digital badges, Usher is able to generate critical information on user behavior and resource usage that can be used to make organizations more productive and secure.[40][41] Usher's technology architecture incorporates the use of three-factor authentication, out-of-band channels, time-limited codes, and bidirectional public key infrastructure encryption.[42]

Awards and recognition[edit]
In 2011, Apple recognized MicroStrategy's iOS app as one of the best business apps of the year.[43] In 2012, the Business Application Research Center (BARC) ranked MicroStrategy first overall in Mobile BI in the BI Survey 12.[44] Also in 2012, Information Management named MicroStrategy one of the "Forty Vendors We’re Watching" for its ability to understand new business trends.[45]

Our history.

For over 25 years we've been building software that helps organizations transform their data into intelligence. Our software helps people discover new opportunities, make better decisions, and drive real results.






1989
MicroStrategy was founded in Wilmington, DE, by MIT alumni Michael J. Saylor and Sanju Bansal. The company’s early focus was on developing data mining software for businesses.





1991
MicroStrategy released its first business intelligence product, an executive information system designed to provide graphical analyses of data.





1998
MicroStrategy (NASDAQ: MSTR) launched a successful IPO of 4 million shares priced at $12 each.





2000
MicroStrategy 7 introduces a web interface, revised technical architecture, and multi-level caching, and was selected as a PC Magazine’s Editor Choice.





2005
MicroStrategy 8 hits the market with OLAP reporting, a reimagined report and dashboard design interface, and enhanced data source support.





2009
In 2009, MicroStrategy undertook a redesign of its platform architecture—the result, MicroStrategy 9, was the company’s biggest release in over 15 years.





2010
The release of MicroStrategy Mobile revolutionized the business intelligence landscape and changed the way that business people interact with data.





2011
MicroStrategy Cloud launches, combining all the enterprise analytics and mobility functionality of the MicroStrategy platform with powerful cloud data services.

Nomination Title: MicroStrategy Analytics Desktop

1. Tell the story about this nominated product or service (up to 525 words). Describe its function, features, benefits, and performance to date:

MicroStrategy Analytics Desktop is a free self-service business analytics tool that empowers business people to analyze data without specialized expertise.

It introduces a paradigm shift in Business Intelligence, by placing enterprise-caliber analytical capabilities, traditionally the domain of specialized IT operations, in the hands of decision-making executives.

It enables any business person, regardless of technical skill, to access and analyze data on their own, and to collaborate with an unprecedented number of users, creating a new breed of decision-makers; self-reliant business people who know how to leverage technology to analyze information on their own.

With the ability to deliver timely access to essential information, Analytics Desktop dramatically accelerates executive’s decision-making, ultimately helping companies gain a formidable advantage over competition. Despite unlocking powerful analytical capabilities, Analytics Desktop remains very accessible and can be downloaded and setup, in minutes, without any assistance. Analytics Desktop makes instant and secure access to a variety of data sources possible, from personal spreadsheets and Salesforce.com reports, to Big Data Hadoop distributions and cloud or on-premises databases. There is no need to architect a data model or write SQL scripts, making the process of implementing Business Intelligence deployments faster and more cost-effective than ever before. Renowned industry analyst Cindy Howsen commented, “The new data blending feature will boost this enterprise solution’s agility, and the easier-to-use, more appealing interface will up the ante in the competitive visual data discovery market”.

Analytics Desktop offers a large library of unique and insightful data visualizations that enhance information comprehension and support decision-making. Any user can build professional dashboards with a suite of intuitive and interactive data discovery tools. It allows users to easily discover trends, and relationships hidden in the data by defining new metric calculations, zooming into details with filters, color-coding the results with thresholds, among other intuitive actions.

A big advantage with Analytics Desktop is that dashboards can be created offline locally, and later shared with other users. Coupled with its ability to analyze large scale data, Analytics Desktop also incorporates a strong, robust set of analytical functions ranging from data summarization to trend analysis, benchmarking, relationship analysis and projections. Over 300 rich analytical functions are readily available to business users, offering easy to use ways to embrace sophisticated analytical approaches. The product also integrates with R, the world’s most popular advanced analytical package, through which intelligent and complex decisions can be made faster than ever before.

For the first time in visual data discovery, Analytics Desktop provides a seamless migration path to governed Business Intelligence. Users can easily export dashboards into Analytics Enterprise®, to experience the power of mobile applications, enterprise dashboards, predictive analytics, and much more, combining self-service productivity with the security, scalability, and governance of a trusted BI solution.

Analytics Desktop is a revolutionary product in the business intelligence industry. Launched late in 2013, in just a little over 3 months, there are over 25,000 Analytics Desktop users across more than 80 countries.

Customer Support
N/A






I've been testing the latest version 10 and it is really good, it has new features to create dashboards in an easy and quickly way more similar to what the market for self service BI is requiring




Pros
Good design, easy to use, development is really fast letting you select the data and object that you want to visualize and therefore just create a dashboard within seconds.




Cons
The best is to have a well designed data model first or a data warehouse to pull the data and just do some of the latest transformation with the tool, that way you can get the most of it. 




Advice to Others
Definetiley a good competitor in this sector, I like the responsive design, mobility and ease of use they have enhanced in this versions I tested.

Likes Best
The technology is great. Even though this is one of the legacy BI vendors, their technology has kept up with the newer vendors.




Likes Least
The support has been slow for the past year or so.




Recommendations
If money is not an issue, MicroStrategy should be seriously considered. The features it offers are among the most complete. If simple reporting is needed, MicroStrategy may be too expensive. The problem is, reporting usually gets more sophisticated as time goes by, and sometimes it's hard to predict how complex it will get from the beginning. If your company needs for instance, language support, some of the new tools like Birst need you to manuallly do translations by duplicating projects. If you are also concerned about a centralized approach and reliable security,  performance and scalability, MicroStrategy is the way to go.

This software is loaded with features/functionality; I don't think I've run into anything that it just can't do. Their training and user forums are also extremely helpful.




Likes Least
Very steep learning curve for administration/development and requires very knowledgeable support staff to get and keep it going. I think that is to be expected with such a complex product however for a smaller company it can present challenges.




Recommendations
It seems like it is great for either very small organizations that want to maybe just use some of the basic functionality/cloud version or large organizations with a team that can be well-trained and dedicated to support/maintenance. If you don't have people you can dedicate to send to the training (which was free for us) and to work with it on a regular basis then purchasing this software may be "biting off more than you can chew".

Insight into operations and licensing without needing the internal data warehouse knowledge




Pros
The software is very easy to use with an uncluttered interface and generating reports is a breeze. The option to share and schedule reports helps to be on top of business, across multiple users and teams. 




Cons
The app could use some UI modernization. A mobile app to look at reports and dashboards would be great.

Using this tool, to learn and get into enterprise analytics was fun.   The free desktop version also allowed folks to analyze excel and other data sources.   this gave them some useful utility to look their own data and seeing trends.




Pros
quick to learn and start using from no experience.  The videos on you-tube also helped pickup some of the concepts.  The free desktop tool, also had a good guide and videos to get started.

Hello, Microstrategy is a great tool for Business Intelligence. Many years after the beginning of the company, they knew how to  follow up their product.
Best product in terms of self-service bi, vizualization, reporting and scalability !
We've tested a lot of reporting tools ( BO, Qkvw, Tableau, Oracle) but none of them are better on the full list of functionalities of Microstrategy.




Pros
Number of functionnalities compared to challenger




Cons
Before the v10, Microstrategy was late on specific topics but now they did the good investment for the future.




Advice to Others
Good strategy, good visibility and very strong product, happy to be a Microstrategy customer.

What Is the FrontRunners Quadrant?
A Graphic of the Top-Performing BI Products
FrontRunners quadrants highlight the top software products for North American small businesses. All products in the quadrant are top performers. Small businesses can use FrontRunners to make more informed decisions about what software is right for them.
To create this quadrant, we evaluated over 200 BI products. Those with the top scores for their capability and value made the quadrant.
Scores are based largely on reviews from real software users, along with other product performance details (e.g., what features they offer, how many customers they have).
Is One Quadrant Better Than the Others?
Nope, Products in Any Quadrant May Fit Your Needs
Every product in this quadrant offers a balance of capability (how much the products can do) and value (whether they’re worth their cost) that makes them stand out in the race for small business software success. Moreover, we’ve homed in on products that offer the right set of capabilities for this market.
FrontRunners has four sub-quadrants:

Upper Right = Leaders: Leaders are all-around strong products. They offer a wide range of functionality to a wide range of customers. These products are considered highly valuable by customers.
 
Upper Left = Masters: Masters may focus more heavily on certain key features or market segments than Leaders do. If you need a more specialized set of functionality without bells and whistles, then a product in the Masters quadrant might be right for you.
 
Lower Right = Pacesetters: Pacesetters may offer a strong set of features, but are not rated as highly on value. For example, a Pacesetter might offer greater functionality, but cost more.
 
Lower Left = Contenders: Contenders may focus on a more specialized set of capabilities that are priced at a higher point. This makes them ideal for companies willing to pay more for specific features that meet their unique needs.

Depending on the specific needs of a software buyer, a product in any of these sub-quadrants could be a good fit.
Why? To even be considered for this FrontRunners, a product had to achieve a minimum user rating score of 3.8 for capability and 3.8 for value. This means that all products that qualify as FrontRunners are top-performing products in their market. Their positions in the quadrant are plotted relative to how their peers performed.
For some buyers, a specific FrontRunners quadrant might be best. For example, products in the “leaders” quadrant have very high ratings for both product capabilities and value provided to users. However, these products may use licensing schemes that are more expensive for small businesses than dashboard-focused vendors in the “contenders” and “pacesetters” quadrants, even though contenders and pacesetters such as Domo and Birst offer comparable functionality.
You can download the full FrontRunners for BI report here. It contains individual scorecards for each product on the Frontrunners quadrant.
How Are FrontRunners Products Selected?
Products Are Scored Based on User Reviews and Other Data
You can find the full FrontRunners methodology here, but the gist is that products are scored in two areas, Capability and Value.
To be considered at all, products must have at least 10 reviews and achieve minimum user rating scores. They also have to offer a core set of functionality—for example, self-service visual analytics and custom dashboards.
From there, user reviews and other product performance details, such as the product's customer base and the features it offers, dictate the Capability and Value scores. Capability is plotted on the x-axis, and Value is plotted on the y-axis.

One Last Thing—How Do I Reference FrontRunners?
Just Follow Our External Usage Guidelines
Check out the FrontRunners External Usage Guidelines when referencing FrontRunners content. Except in digital media with character limitations, the following disclaimer MUST appear with any/all FrontRunners reference(s) and graphic use:
FrontRunners scores and graphics are derived from individual end-user reviews based on their own experiences, vendor-supplied information and publicly available product information; they do not represent the views of Gartner or its affiliates.







Runners Up
Providers listed as Runners Up were considered for inclusion in the quadrant, but were
                                ultimately not included for one or more reasons: they did not have enough reviews; they did
                                not meet the reviews score minimum; they did not meet the ultimate Value and Capability minimum
                                scores; or they did not meet our functionality requirements for the market.

Last Updated: July 21, 2017 







Business intelligence (BI) software has gained considerable traction since its introduction as "decision support systems" in the 1960s. Today, there are over 100 BI software companies selling some type of business intelligence tool. We put together this buyer's guide to help buyers understand the market. In this guide, we'll review:

What Is Business Intelligence Software?
BI software helps organizations organize and analyze data to make better decisions. This could include internal data from company departments as well as from external sources, such as marketing data services, social media channels or even macroeconomic information.
The BI market is growing rapidly because of the proliferation of data to analyze. Over the past few decades, companies that have deployed Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP), Customer Relationship Management (CRM) and other applications are now sitting on a mountain of data that can be analyzed. In addition, the growth of the Web has increased the demand for tools that can analyze large data sets.
One of the biggest trends in the BI market is the shift in software architecture and design to more user-friendly applications. These applications are now being used by business users—not just IT staff—to analyze particular sets of departmental data, including marketing, procurement, retail and Web data.

Common Features of Business Intelligence Software
BI software can be divided into three broad application categories: data management tools, data discovery applications and reporting tools (including dashboards and visualization software). In the next section, we'll explain how these applications can help your organization's decision-making process become more data-driven.
What BI tools you need depends on how your data is currently managed and how you would like to analyze it. For example, if it is currently scattered across disparate transactional databases, you might need to build a data warehouse to centralize it and invest in data management tools that offer Extract, Transform and Load (ETL) functionality to move and re-structure it.
Once data is given a common structure and format, you can invest in data discovery solutions such as Online Analytical Processing (OLAP), data mining and semantic or text mining applications, with the capability to create custom, ad hoc reports. And because information is stored within the warehouse, users can quickly pull reports without impacting the performance of the organization’s software applications, such as CRM, ERP and supply chain management solutions.
We’ve illustrated this concept in the image below:



 But this isn’t the only way to implement BI within your organization. If you’re only analyzing data from a single source, ETL and data warehouses are unnecessary. Alternatively, you might require multiple warehouses, and thus, require different tools to connect data between both these servers and other BI applications that need access to this data.
We'll cover these in detail in the next section, but in general, the features you should seek in a new BI solution should include:

Data quality management
Extract, transform and load (ETL)
Data mining
Online analytical processing (OLAP)
Predictive analytics
Semantic and text analytics
Visualizations
Dashboards

Data Management Tools
Better decision-making starts with better data. Data management tools help clean up "dirty data," organize information by providing format and structure and prepare databases for analyses.



Functionality
Description


Data quality management
Helps organizations maintain clean, standardized and error-free data. Standardization is especially important for BI implementations that integrate data from diverse sources. Data quality management ensures that later analyses are correct and can lead to improvements within the business.


Extract, transform and load (ETL)
Collects data from outside sources, transforms it and then loads it into the target system (a database or warehouse). Because primary data is often organized using different schemas or formats, analysts can use ETL tools to normalize it for useful analysis.




Data Discovery Applications
The ability to sift through data and come to meaningful conclusions is one of the most powerful benefits of adopting business intelligence tools. Data discovery applications help users make sense of their data, whether it be through quick, multivariate analysis during OLAP or via advanced algorithms and statistical computations during data mining.



Functionality
Description


Data mining
Sorts through large amounts of data to identify new or unknown patterns. It is often the first step that other processes rely on, such as predictive analytics. Databases are often too large or convoluted to find patterns with the naked eye or through simple queries. Data mining helps point users in the right direction for further analysis by providing an automated method of discovering previously neglected trends.


Online analytical processing (OLAP)
Enables users to quickly analyze multidimensional data from different perspectives. It is typically made up of three analytical operations: data consolidation, data sorting and classification ("drill-down") and analysis of data from a particular perspective ("slice-and-dice"). For example, a user could analyze sales numbers for various products by store and by month. OLAP allows users to produce this analysis.


Predictive analytics
Analyzes current and historical data to make predictions about future risks and opportunities. An example of this is credit scoring, which relies on an individual's current financial standing to make predictions about their future credit behavior.


Semantic and text analytics
Extracts and interprets large volumes of text to identify patterns, relationships and sentiment. For example, the popularity of social media has made text analytics valuable to companies with a large social footprint. Understanding semantic trends is a powerful tool for organizations evaluating purchase intent or customer satisfaction among users of these channels.




Reporting Tools
In the words of John W. Tuckey, “the greatest value of a picture is when it forces us to notice what we never expected to see.” Reporting applications are an important way to present data and easily convey the results of analysis.
BI users are increasingly business users—not IT staff—who need quick, easy-to-understand displays of information. In response, software vendors have been working to mask the complexity of these applications and increasingly focus on the user experience.



Functionality
Description


Visualizations
Helps users create advanced graphical representations of data via simple user interfaces. The ability to visualize information in a graphical format (as opposed to words or numbers) can help users understand data in a more insightful way. In addition, new interactive tools can provide teams the ability to both analyze and manipulate reports in real-time.


Dashboards
Dashboards typically highlight key performance indicators (KPIs), which help managers focus on the metrics that are most important to them. Dashboards are often browser-based, making them easily accessible by anyone with permissions.


Report writers
Allows users to design and generate custom reports. Many CRM and ERP systems include built-in report writing tools, but users can also purchase standalone applications, such as Crystal Reports, to create ad hoc reports based on complex queries. This is especially helpful for organizations that continually modify analyses and need to generate new reports quickly.


Scorecarding
Scorecards attach a numerical weight to performance and map progress toward goals. Think of it as dashboards taken one step further. In organizations with a strategic performance-management methodology (e.g., balanced scorecard, Six Sigma etc.), scorecards are an effective way to keep tabs on key metrics. For example, a scorecard might establish a grade of “A+" to 40 percent year-over-year growth if the goal was set at 14 percent.




What Type of Buyer Are You?
Before evaluating software, you must determine what type of buyer you are.  Business users and departmental buyers. These buyers favor small data-discovery vendors and BI tools over the big, traditional BI systems. Ease-of-use and fast deployment are more important than in-depth functionality and integration. They are usually business users rather than IT staff.  IT buyers. Traditional buyers are more focused on functionality and integration within their information infrastructure stacks or other ERP applications. Integration across different entities and departments is usually more important than ease of use.

Market Trends to Understand
As you begin your software comparison and evaluation, there are a couple trends to consider:
In-memory processing. OLAP systems of the past would pre-calculate every possible combination of data. These calculations would be stored in the “cube,” and users could retrieve them when they needed a certain analysis. Creating these cubes was very time-consuming—sometimes taking as long as a year—and required expertise. Today, computer processors and memory are faster, cheaper and more powerful overall. This same process can happen in-memory, rather than using a disk-based approach with cubes. Analytic software built on an in-memory architecture can retrieve data and perform calculations in real-time or on-the-fly.
Big Data. The Internet is rapidly creating vast amounts of data. This phenomenon is being dubbed “Big Data” among IT and business leaders. Business analytics software companies are beefing up their data warehousing and analytics capabilities to keep up with demand.
However, according to Gartner, through 2015, 85% of Fortune 500 organizations will be unable to exploit big data for competitive advantage. The right BI tools can help harness the power of so much data.
Companies dealing with large amounts of data may also want to consider investing in dedicated IT security suites to support their computer security needs.
Business users to outnumber IT staff. This is a major trend playing out in the market. More business users—rather than traditional IT staff—are evaluating and purchasing software. So usability is becoming more important than functionality during software evaluations. As a result, small data discovery vendors that develop really good interactive visualization tools are gaining market share. Meanwhile, traditional BI vendors are parroting new market entrants by promoting ease of use.  Software-as-a-Service (SaaS). A growing number of organizations are considering SaaS or “cloud” BI software instead of traditional, on-premise software that you install on-location. Cost is a major driver of this trend. The poorly performing economy is motivating companies to look at lower-cost BI software from SaaS and open source vendors. Of course, perceived ease of use, faster implementations and reduced IT needs are also driving this trend. On-premise BI vendors are responding by committing development resources to cloud technology.  Mobile BI applications. Proliferation of the iPhone, iPad and other mobile devices is pushing vendors (e.g., Microsoft and Oracle) to develop on-the-go business intelligence applications. Analysts think mobile BI could expand the population of BI users to a larger, mainstream audience.

The Commission has determined that it is appropriate to accept the Offer of MicroStrategy and accordingly is issuing this Order.  
III.

  FACTS
 Based on the foregoing, the Commission finds that:2
A. Respondent
MicroStrategy, Inc. is a Delaware corporation with principal offices in Vienna, Virginia.  From its IPO on June 11, 1998 to the present, MicroStrategy's common stock was registered pursuant to Section 12(g) of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. § 77l(g)] and was quoted on the NASDAQ National Market System.
B. Summary
From the time of its initial public offering in June 1998 through March 2000, MicroStrategy, Inc., a software company whose securities are listed on NASDAQ, materially overstated its revenues and earnings contrary to Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ("GAAP").  The company's public financial reports during this time showed a growing software and information services company enjoying positive net income.  In fact, as investors later learned, MicroStrategy should have reported net losses from 1997 through the present.
The company's restatement reduced revenues over the three-year period by approximately $66 million of the $365 million reported.  Approximately $54 million, or 80%, of these restated revenues were in 1999.  The company's reporting failures primarily derived from its premature recognition of revenue arising from the misapplication of AICPA Statement of Position 97-2 in connection with multiple element deals in which significant services or future products to be provided by MicroStrategy were not separable from the upfront sale of a license to MicroStrategy's existing software products.  Additional restatements resulted from deals in which MicroStrategy had not properly executed contracts in the same fiscal period that revenue was recorded from those deals, as well as other accounting errors.
The incorrect financial results were reported in various periodic reports filed with the Commission and disseminated to the investing public from the fourth quarter of 1998 through year-end 1999, and in registration statements filed in connection with a June 1998 initial public offering and a pending public offering filed in February 2000 that was subsequently withdrawn.
On March 20, 2000, MicroStrategy announced that it intended to restate its financial results for the fiscal years 1998 and 1999.  MicroStrategy stock, which had recently reached a high of $333 per share, dropped over 60% of its value in one day, dropping from $260 per share to close at $86 per share on March 20, 2000.  The stock price continued to drop in the following weeks.  By April 13, 2000, after MicroStrategy announced that it would also restate its fiscal 1997 financial results, the company's stock closed at $33 per share. 
C. MicroStrategy's Background
MicroStrategy was incorporated in Delaware in November 1989.  The company's primary business in the early years consisted of providing software consulting services to help customers build custom software systems to access, analyze and use information contained in large-scale transaction-level databases.  During 1994 and 1995, MicroStrategy began focusing its efforts on the development and sale of data-mining and decision support software and related products.
By 1996 a majority of MicroStrategy's revenues resulted from software license sales.  The company licensed its software through its direct sales force and through value added resellers ("VAR") and original equipment manufacturers ("OEM").  By 1997 sales through VARs and OEMs, sometimes known as "channel partners," accounted for more than 25% of MicroStrategy's total revenues.
Since 1996, MicroStrategy's revenues have been derived primarily from three sources: (i) product licenses; (ii) fees for maintenance, technical support and training; and (iii) consulting and development services.
Shortly after going public in June 1998, MicroStrategy began in the third quarter 1998 to engage in a series of increasingly larger and more complex transactions involving the sale of software as well as extensive software application development and consulting services.
By late 1998, MicroStrategy began developing an information network - initially known as Telepath, now known as Strategy.com - supported by the MicroStrategy software platform.  The network as conceived would deliver personalized finance, news, weather, traffic, travel and entertainment information to individuals through cell phones, fax machines, e-mails, etc.  For a fee, an entity could become a Strategy.com affiliate and offer the Strategy.com channels and services on a co-branded basis directly to their customers and in turn share with MicroStrategy a percentage of the subscription revenues from end-users.
During the relevant time period, Strategy.com affiliate deals ranged from the relatively simple purchase of the right to offer customers access to the Strategy.com channels for a flat fee to much more complex transactions involving, in addition to an affiliation with MicroStrategy, a large scale commitment of consulting and development services to build custom information delivery systems.
D. Accounting For Software Sales
Generally Accepted Accounting Principles require that revenue from the sale of software be recognized consistent with Statement of Position 97-2.  SOP 97-2 contains specific guidance on whether a company may recognize revenue from a software license sale at the time of the sale, or whether the sale must be recognized consistent with contract accounting principles.
If an arrangement to deliver software or a software system does not require significant production, modification, or customization, SOP 97-2 specifies that the following four criteria must be met prior to recognizing revenue for a single-element arrangement or for amounts allocated to individual elements of a multiple-element arrangement: (i) persuasive evidence of an arrangement, (ii) delivery has occurred, (iii) vendor's fee is fixed or determinable, and (iv) collectibility is probable.
SOP 97-2 further requires that if the software being licensed requires significant production, modification, or customization or any of the above four criteria are not present the company may not recognize revenue from the software or software system at the time of the transaction but instead must apply contract accounting.
Where the software transaction contains multiple-elements (i.e., software, upgrades/enhancements and/or consulting services) SOP 97-2 provides guidance concerning when the software license component may be considered a separate element and thus permit the company to recognize some revenue at the time of the transaction.  SOP 97-2 provides that when an arrangement contains multiple-elements, the company must also assess whether the services being sold as part of the arrangement are considered by the customer to be integral to the functionality of the software product license component.  If the company determines that the service component of the arrangement is integral to the functionality of the software license component, the company must apply contract accounting.
MicroStrategy's Form 10-K and Annual Report for the fiscal year-end December 31, 1998 and subsequent public filings all stated that "subsequent to December 31, 1997, the Company began recognizing revenue in accordance with SOP 97-2, `Software Revenue Recognition'."  In addition, MicroStrategy's internal revenue recognition policy in effect during the relevant time period stated that the company recognized revenue in accordance with SOP 97-2.  MicroStrategy, however, had not complied with SOP 97-2, instead recognizing revenue earlier than allowed under GAAP.
E. Accounting Errors
Contract Signing By MicroStrategy
As is common in the software industry, the majority of MicroStrategy's transactions closed in the final days of the fiscal period.  As a result, at the end of a quarter MicroStrategy's contracts department received numerous contracts signed by customers that needed (according to company policy) to be signed by MicroStrategy.
To maintain maximum flexibility to achieve the desired quarterly financial results, MicroStrategy held, until after the close of the quarter, contracts that had been signed by customers but had not yet been signed by MicroStrategy.  Only after MicroStrategy determined the desired financial results were the unsigned contracts apportioned, between the just-ended quarter and the then-current quarter, signed and given an "effective date."  In some instances, the contracts were signed without affixing a date, allowing the company further flexibility to assign a date at a later time.
GAAP and MicroStrategy's own accounting policies required the signature of both MicroStrategy and the customer prior to recognizing revenue.  
Other Contracts Not Signed by Quarter Close
In at least three instances, MicroStrategy recognized revenue on transactions that were not completed or signed by either party prior to the close of the quarter.  On December 31, 1999, MicroStrategy was engaged in final negotiations with Primark Corporation, a Massachusetts based financial, economic and market research information company.  Sometime prior to midnight negotiations broke down over an issue that was not resolved until the following week.  Although neither the Primark representative nor MicroStrategy signed the final contract until the week of January 3, 2000, $5 million was recognized by MicroStrategy in its quarter ended December 31, 1998.  As discussed below, the Primark transaction was ultimately restated due to a misapplication of the multiple-element transaction requirements of SOP 97-2.  Revenue improperly recognized from this contract was material to MicroStrategy's reported financial results for the quarter.
Similarly, on September 30, 1999, the last day of MicroStrategy's 1999 third quarter, negotiations with NCR Corporation over a $27.5 million transaction continued past midnight.  MicroStrategy signed the final contract sometime in the early hours of October 1, 1999.  Although the contract had not been signed by the end of the quarter, MicroStrategy recognized $17.5 million in revenue from the transaction in the quarter ended September 30, 1999.  The NCR transaction was ultimately restated due to a misapplication of SOP 97-2's provisions regarding the delivery of future products in a multiple-element arrangement.  Revenue improperly recognized from this contract was material to MicroStrategy's reported financial results for the quarter.
For the quarter ended March 31, 1999, MicroStrategy recognized $956,000 in revenue from a contract with Choicepoint, Inc. that had been signed by Choicepoint on April 2, 1999 but dated March 31, 1999.  Revenue improperly recognized from this contract was material to MicroStrategy's reported financial results for the quarter.
 Accounting for Multiple Element Transactions
After the IPO, MicroStrategy's business moved increasingly away from the straight-forward sale of software toward multi-faceted increasingly complex transactions with extensive service obligations.
Generally for accounting purposes, product revenue is recognized immediately, while revenue from services is recognized as the services are provided.  Consistent with SOP 97-2, in a transaction with software and service elements, revenue is recognized on the software only if the software sale is separable from the sale of services and only after revenue attributable to the service element is deducted.   In a number of the restated transactions, MicroStrategy improperly (i) separated product license sales from service elements, and (ii) characterized revenue in multiple element transactions as product or software revenue and recognized it at the time of the transaction.
For example, in the fourth quarter of 1998, MicroStrategy negotiated a $4.5 million transaction with ShopKo Stores, Inc. to provide software licenses as well as, among other things, extensive consulting and development services and a warrant permitting ShopKo to purchase 50,000 shares of MicroStrategy common stock.  The services were, in part, to develop software applications for the MicroStrategy software platform.  The overwhelming majority of the software licenses purchased by Shopko were to be used in conjunction with the to-be-developed applications.  Although the product and the service elements were interdependent, MicroStrategy accounted for the software product element as though it were separate from the service and warrant obligations.  In addition, MicroStrategy recognized the entire $4.5 million received in the transaction as software product license revenue, allocating no revenue to the extensive service obligations or the warrant.  The $4.5 million in revenue improperly recognized was material to MicroStrategy's reported financial results for the quarter.
In the fourth quarter of 1999, MicrStrategy negotiated a multiple element transaction with Exchange Applications, Inc. which included, among other things, software and extensive consulting and development service elements.  The focus of the transaction was the development of "Customer Relationship Management" software and applications leveraging existing MicroStrategy and Exchange Applications software technology.  Exchange Applications agreed to pay MicroStrategy $65 million dollars for the: (i) right to resell MicroStrategy's product line as a VAR; (ii) consulting and development services of a dedicated business unit of MicroStrategy employees; and (iii) intellectual property rights to product developed by the dedicated business unit.  Again, MicroStrategy improperly separated the software product element of the transaction from the service component and as a result recognized $14.1 million in the fourth quarter of 1999.  The $14.1 improperly recognized was material to MicroStrategy's reported financial results for the quarter.
Strategy.com Transactions
The Strategy.com transactions combine similar service and software elements and thus presented similar revenue recognition issues as those discussed in the preceding section.
In the fourth quarter of 1998, when the company began to sell the first Strategy.com affiliations, Strategy.com was in the development stage.  At the time, only a single preliminary version of a finance channel existed.  For the affiliation fee, the affiliate had access to certain MicroStrategy software for the limited purpose of providing access to the Strategy.com network. This software was not delivered to the affiliate, nor did the affiliate have the ability to use the software outside the context of the network.  MicroStrategy, in essence, hosted the network.  Since there was little initially to host or to offer affiliate subscribers, many of the early Strategy.com transactions had a development component - some required that MicroStrategy develop additional or specialized channels, others required the development of customized applications for the channels.  These often involved additional software, licenses and services. MicroStrategy improperly recognized revenue up front on certain Strategy.com transactions by improperly characterizing transactions as the sale of software product.
For example, in the second quarter of 1999, MicroStrategy recognized $6 million in product revenue from a Strategy.com transaction with Ameritrade Holding Corporation.  As part of the arrangement, MicroStrategy agreed to develop customized systems for Ameritrade to provide certain channels to its customers.  Ameritrade also purchased from MicroStrategy the software product licenses necessary in order to eventually provide its customers with access to the to-be-developed applications.  Since the service element of the transaction was not separable from the software element, MicroStrategy should have recognized revenue over the term of the contract.  Instead, MicroStrategy characterized the entire $6 million received from Ameritrade at the time of the transaction as software product license and recognized it at the time of the transaction. The $6 million in revenue improperly recognized was material to MicroStrategy's reported financial results for the quarter.
The same issue arises in several other Strategy.com deals, including Metrocall, Inc. in the fourth quarter of 1998, and Primark in the fourth quarter of 1999.  In each of these transactions, MicroStrategy was obligated to provide services related to the development or delivery of channels.  In both cases, MicroStrategy improperly recognized the full contract revenue ($1 million for Metrocall, $5 million for Primark) as product revenue, rather than recognizing the revenue over the term of the agreement.
Other Accounting Issues
MicroStrategy's financial statements suffered from other revenue recognition problems.  For example, MicroStrategy's agreement with NCR included a license to "all current and future generally available software products in MicroStrategy's product line."  Because a company cannot provide "Vendor Specific Objective Evidence" of the fair market value for unspecified future products, SOP 97-2 requires the application of contract accounting to arrangements containing unspecified future product obligations.  The $17.5 million in revenue improperly recognized from this transaction was material to MicroStrategy's reported financial results for the third quarter of 1999.
In the third quarter of 1999, MicroStrategy recognized $5 million of revenue from a transaction with Sybase, Inc. in which the two companies essentially swapped $5 million of software.  Consistent with GAAP, this transaction should have been accounted for as a barter transaction and would have resulted in no revenue being recognized until such time as the software was used by MicroStrategy internally or was sold to another party.  The $5 million in revenue improperly recognized was material to MicroStrategy's reported financial results for the quarter.
In the first quarter of 1999, MicroStrategy entered into an arrangement with KMart Corporation to provide software licenses, maintenance and services.  In connection with the transaction, the sales staff issued a side letter to KMart promising the delivery of future product at no cost.  MicroStrategy improperly recognized approximately $2.3 million in revenue that quarter. The revenue was later deferred since the value of the future product could not be determined and the product had yet to be delivered.  The $2.3 million in revenue improperly recognized was material to MicroStrategy's reported financial results for the quarter.

LEGAL DISCUSSION
A. MicroStrategy Violated the Reporting Provisions of the Exchange Act
Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act requires issuers to file such annual and quarterly reports as the Commission may prescribe and in conformity with such rules as the Commission may promulgate.  Rules 13a-1 and 13a-13 require the filing of annual and quarterly reports that comply with the Commission's Regulation S-X, which requires that financial statements be presented in conformity with GAAP.  
As described above, the periodic reports and registration statements filed by MicroStrategy between June 1998 and January 2000 were not in conformity with GAAP.  Consequently, MicroStrategy violated Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 13a-1 and 13a-13 thereunder.  
B. MicroStrategy Violated the Record-Keeping and 
Internal Controls Provisions of the Exchange Act
Section 13(b)(2)(A) of the Exchange Act requires public companies such as MicroStrategy to make and keep books and records which accurately and fairly reflect its transactions and dispositions of assets.  As discussed above, MicroStrategy failed to keep accurate books and records reflecting, among other things, the quarter in which revenue was recognized and the amount of recognizable revenue. MicroStrategy violated Section 13(b)(2)(A) of the Exchange Act.
Section 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act requires MicroStrategy to devise and maintain a system of internal accounting controls sufficient to provide reasonable assurance that, among other things, transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP and to maintain accountability of assets.  As described above, MicroStrategy's internal accounting controls were inadequate.  Specifically, MicroStrategy routinely affixed earlier dates to contracts signed after the close of a quarter and had inadequate procedures to ensure appropriate revenue recognition in conformity with GAAP.  Thus, MicroStrategy violated Section 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act.
V.
The Commission finds that MicroStrategy violated Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act and Rules 13a-1 and 13a-13 thereunder.
VI.
ACCORDINGLY, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED, pursuant to Section 21C of the Exchange Act, that MicroStrategy:
  Cease and desist from committing or causing any violations and any future violations of Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act and Rules 13a-1 and 13a-13 thereunder; and

   Comply with, and take steps to effect future compliance with, Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act and Rules 13a-1 and 13a-13 thereunder upon such terms and conditions as MicroStrategy has undertaken to implement the following:
Corporate Governance Undertakings
1. Corporate Governance and Audit Committee Composition
MicroStrategy's Board of Directors currently includes Saylor, Bansal and four independent directors.  MicroStrategy shall add one additional independent director to the Board who is independent of the company and is not objectionable to the Commission.  The new director shall have prior experience as a Chief Financial Officer of a public company (or other officer primarily responsible for external financial reporting) or as a member of an Audit Committee of a public company.
2. Non-Management Board Members Departures
MicroStrategy shall for a period of three years report to the Commission within ten days on the full facts and circumstances surrounding the departure (for any reason whatsoever) of any non-management member of the Board of Directors including, but not limited to, any disagreements with the departing director on accounting principles, practices or procedures employed by MicroStrategy or over the quality of MicroStrategy's internal control environment.  The statement shall be shown to the departing director before its submission to the Commission and the departing director shall be given the opportunity to comment to the Commission on the statement.
3. Audit Committee and Charter Enhancements
MicroStrategy shall adopt an updated charter for the Audit Committee consistent with the recommendations of the Blue Ribbon Committee on Improving the Effectiveness of Corporate Audit Committees and the Commission's recently adopted rules on Audit Committee disclosure.  The Charter shall include provisions relating to:
 the independence of Audit Committee members;

 the oversight responsibilities of the Audit Committee, including those with respect to the positions and functions of the Chief Financial Officer and Director of Internal Audit; and

 the reporting obligations of the Audit Committee under Item 306 of Regulation S-K and Item7(e)(3) of Schedule 14(a).
Management Undertakings
MicroStrategy shall add to its management a Director of Internal Audit.  In addition, MicroStrategy shall create an Internal Audit Department appropriate for the size and business.  The Director of Internal Audit shall be an individual with appropriate qualifications and experience for the position and shall be hired after consultation with and approval by the Audit Committee.
Compliance Undertakings
1. Corporate Code of Conduct
MicroStrategy shall adopt and implement through a comprehensive worldwide training effort a Code of Conduct appropriate for the Company's size and business within 30 days of the date of these undertakings.  Prior to its adoption the Code of Conduct shall be reviewed and approved by the Board of Directors.
The Code of Conduct shall at a minimum include policies relating to financial reporting, documentation of transactions, confidentiality of Company information, compliance with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, transactions in Company securities and communications with investors, analysts and the media about Company matters.  The Code of Conduct shall also contain procedures by which employees may report suspected violations of the Code of Conduct or other Company policies.
The Company shall require that each officer, director and employee sign a certification of compliance with the Code of Conduct on an annual basis.
2. Global Revenue Recognition Policy
MicroStrategy shall adopt and implement a Global Revenue Recognition Policy within 30 days of the date of these undertakings.  The Policy shall include procedures to ensure compliance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles including, but not limited to, AICPA Statement of Position 97-2 and any future amendments.
3. Contract Approval, Execution and Processing Policy and Procedures
MicroStrategy shall adopt and implement Contract Approval, Execution and Processing Policies and Procedures within 60 days of the date of these undertakings.  The policy shall require the development of standard contract forms complying in all respects with the Company's Global Revenue Recognition Policy and will establish procedures for the Chief Financial Officer's approval prior to execution of any non-standard agreement.  The policy shall reflect the requirement in the Company's Global Revenue Recognition Policy that all material terms of all contracts (except purchase orders issued against previously executed reseller or other similar agreements) shall be signed by all parties to the transaction at least by the end of the period in which revenue on the contract will be recognized.  The Policy shall also, at a minimum:
  formalize procedures governing the signing and dating of contracts, including the creation and maintenance of a contract signature log to track contracts through the approval and execution process,

 establish procedures requiring the delivery of contracts signed by all parties (or valid purchase orders) to the appropriate accounting personnel prior to revenue recognition, invoicing or delivery of software, and

 implement procedures for the retention of all necessary contract documents, including drafts and correspondence.
4. Comprehensive Policies and Procedures Manual
MicroStrategy shall adopt and implement within 90 days of the date of these undertakings a Comprehensive Policies and Procedures Manual for its accounting, finance, contracts and other related operations personnel.  In addition to the Global Revenue Recognition Policy and the Contract Approval, Execution and Processing Policies and Procedures described above, the Manual shall include polices and procedures relating to the following:
  reporting and review of material transactions entered into by the Company's foreign subsidiaries,

 establishment and documentation of subjective reserves and allowances,

 bank, payroll and other account reconciliation,

 fixed asset inventories, accounting and security,

 customer credit policies and due diligence,

 collections and accounts receivable,

 non-monetary, barter or reciprocal arrangements,

 documentation or controls relating to reseller arrangements, and 

 documentation of estimates used in contract accounting and other accounting areas dependent on estimates.
5. Training and Education on Policies and Procedures
MicroStrategy shall provide all officers, directors and employees subject to the policies and procedures in these undertakings with the necessary training and education on the new policies and procedures.  In addition to the provision of the policies and procedures, together with relevant background materials, such training and education will include, at a minimum, both initial training sessions immediately following adoption of the policy (as part of the implementation process) and annual training updates.
Compliance with the Undertakings
The new independent member of the Board of Directors, appointed pursuant to these undertakings, shall review the Company's implementation of and compliance with these undertakings.  The new director's review shall begin no earlier than six months from the date of these undertakings and the new director shall report the results of the review to the Company and the Commission within three months after the start of the review.
By the Commission.

History[edit]
Michael J. Saylor started MicroStrategy in 1989 with a consulting contract from DuPont, which provided Saylor with $250,000 in start-up capital and office space in Wilmington, Delaware. Saylor was soon joined by company co-founder Sanju Bansal, whom he had met while the two were students at MIT.[10] The company produced software for data mining and business intelligence using nonlinear mathematics,[7] an idea inspired by a course[which?] that they took at MIT.[11] During this time period, the company experienced rapid growth. In 1992, it gained its first major client when it signed a $10 million contract with McDonald's, and increased revenues by 100% every year between 1990 and 1996.[10] In 1994, they moved the company's offices and its 50 employees from Delaware to Tysons Corner, Virginia.[12] MicroStrategy had its initial public offering in June 1998.[13] On its first day of trading, the stock price doubled.[14]
In 2000 MicroStrategy founded Angel an IVR and voice application company. In March 2000, after a review of its accounting practices, MicroStrategy announced that it would restate its financial results for the preceding two years,[15] which resulted in an investigation by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.[16] A lawsuit was subsequently filed against MicroStrategy and certain of its officials over fraud.[17] In December 2000, Saylor, Bansal, and the company's former CFO settled with the SEC without admitting wrongdoing by each paying $350,000 in fines. The officers also paid a combined total of $10 million in disgorgement. The firm itself was charged with a number of violations and settled with the SEC by hiring an independent director to ensure regulatory compliance.[18][19]
By the fourth quarter of 2003, the company added over 200 new corporate customers[20] and posted increased revenue for every quarter through the end of 2007.[21] In 2007 and 2008, the company was named one of the 200 Best Small Companies in America by Forbes.[22]
In 2009, the company introduced OLAP Services with a shared data set cache, to accelerate reports and ad hoc queries.[23] The relational nature of the OLAP services allowed users to drill down through the database to the transaction-level detail.[24]
In 2010, the company began developing and deploying business intelligence software for mobile platforms, such as the iPhone and iPad.[25] Also in 2011, it expanded its offerings to include a cloud-based service, MicroStrategy Cloud.[26]
In 2013, MicroStrategy sold Angel to Genesys Telecommunications Laboratories for $110 Million USD.[27]
In January 2014, the company announced a new feature of the platform called PRIME (Parallel Relational In-Memory Engine), co-developed with Facebook. It is a massively parallel processing engine that the company said can support a data volume of 4.6TB and 200 billion rows.[28] In May, 2014, Microstrategy announced the availability of its enterprise software platforms available via subscription on the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Marketplace.[29]
The company slashed Saylor's salary from $875,000 to $1 in September 2014 at his request.[30] In October 2014 the company announced plans to lay off 770 employees.[31]
In April 2015, MicroStrategy introduced enterprise security platform Usher™ and debuted the Usher Software Development Kit. In June 2015, MicroStrategy announced the general availability of MicroStrategy 10™, combining enhanced business-intelligence functionality with data discovery, mobile analytics and enterprise-grade security.[32]
In March 2016. MicroStrategy 10 was showcased in the BI Bake-Off, a product face-off that took place at the Gartner Business Intelligence and Analytics Summit at the Gaylord Texan Hotel & Convention Center in Grapevine, Texas.[33] In March 2017, the company announced the general availability of MicroStrategy 10.7, the latest update to the company's MicroStrategy 10 platform. The release included a new set of APIs and data integration options for building custom connectors to external sources.[34]
Products[edit]
MicroStrategy develops scalable enterprise software platforms. MicroStrategy 10 is the company’s flagship product, and it consolidates analytics and mobility on a single integrated platform, available both as on-premise software and as a hosted service offering in MicroStrategy Cloud. It uses business intelligence and predictive analytics to search through and perform analytics on big data from a variety of sources, including data warehouses, Excel files, and Hadoop distributions.[35] MicroStrategy 10, the current suite of software, consists of MicroStrategy Analytics, MicroStrategy Mobile, and Usher. The most recent major release of the software is 10.7, which was released in March 2017.[36]

Product details[edit]

MicroStrategy Analytics allows large organizations to analyze vast amounts of data and securely distribute actionable business insight throughout an enterprise, while also being able to cater to smaller workgroups and departmental use via MicroStrategy Desktop. MicroStrategy Analytics delivers reports and dashboards, and enables users to conduct ad hoc analysis and share insights via mobile devices (via MicroStrategy Mobile) or the Web (via MicroStrategy Web). It also combines the agility of self-service visual data discovery with the security, scalability, and governance features of enterprise-grade business intelligence. MicroStrategy Analytics is available both as on-premises software and as a hosted service offering in MicroStrategy Cloud.[38]
MicroStrategy Mobile, introduced in 2010, is a software platform integrating Analytics capabilities into mobile business apps for the iPhone, iPad, Android, and BlackBerry. It allows improved transactional efficiencies and easier access to intelligence data without needing to reformat the data for different platforms.[28] Apps using it can deliver business intelligence and transactional data derived from their existing data sources, including data warehouses, ERP, CRM and other information systems.[39]
Usher is a digital credential and identity intelligence product that offers a secure, convenient way for organizations to control digital and physical access. By replacing physical badges and passwords with secure digital badges, Usher is able to generate critical information on user behavior and resource usage that can be used to make organizations more productive and secure.[40][41] Usher's technology architecture incorporates the use of three-factor authentication, out-of-band channels, time-limited codes, and bidirectional public key infrastructure encryption.[42]

Awards and recognition[edit]
In 2011, Apple recognized MicroStrategy's iOS app as one of the best business apps of the year.[43] In 2012, the Business Application Research Center (BARC) ranked MicroStrategy first overall in Mobile BI in the BI Survey 12.[44] Also in 2012, Information Management named MicroStrategy one of the "Forty Vendors We’re Watching" for its ability to understand new business trends.[45]

MicroStrategy is headquartered in the Washington, D.C. metro area and has worldwide operations in 27 countries.[2][6] The CEO and chairman of the board of MicroStrategy is Michael J.

History[edit]
Michael J. Saylor started MicroStrategy in 1989 with a consulting contract from DuPont, which provided Saylor with $250,000 in start-up capital and office space in Wilmington, Delaware. Saylor was soon joined by company co-founder Sanju Bansal, whom he had met while the two were students at MIT.[10] The company produced software for data mining and business intelligence using nonlinear mathematics,[7] an idea inspired by a course[which?] that they took at MIT.[11] During this time period, the company experienced rapid growth. In 1992, it gained its first major client when it signed a $10 million contract with McDonald's, and increased revenues by 100% every year between 1990 and 1996.[10] In 1994, they moved the company's offices and its 50 employees from Delaware to Tysons Corner, Virginia.[12] MicroStrategy had its initial public offering in June 1998.[13] On its first day of trading, the stock price doubled.[14]
In 2000 MicroStrategy founded Angel an IVR and voice application company. In March 2000, after a review of its accounting practices, MicroStrategy announced that it would restate its financial results for the preceding two years,[15] which resulted in an investigation by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.[16] A lawsuit was subsequently filed against MicroStrategy and certain of its officials over fraud.[17] In December 2000, Saylor, Bansal, and the company's former CFO settled with the SEC without admitting wrongdoing by each paying $350,000 in fines. The officers also paid a combined total of $10 million in disgorgement. The firm itself was charged with a number of violations and settled with the SEC by hiring an independent director to ensure regulatory compliance.[18][19]
By the fourth quarter of 2003, the company added over 200 new corporate customers[20] and posted increased revenue for every quarter through the end of 2007.[21] In 2007 and 2008, the company was named one of the 200 Best Small Companies in America by Forbes.[22]
In 2009, the company introduced OLAP Services with a shared data set cache, to accelerate reports and ad hoc queries.[23] The relational nature of the OLAP services allowed users to drill down through the database to the transaction-level detail.[24]
In 2010, the company began developing and deploying business intelligence software for mobile platforms, such as the iPhone and iPad.[25] Also in 2011, it expanded its offerings to include a cloud-based service, MicroStrategy Cloud.[26]
In 2013, MicroStrategy sold Angel to Genesys Telecommunications Laboratories for $110 Million USD.[27]
In January 2014, the company announced a new feature of the platform called PRIME (Parallel Relational In-Memory Engine), co-developed with Facebook. It is a massively parallel processing engine that the company said can support a data volume of 4.6TB and 200 billion rows.[28] In May, 2014, Microstrategy announced the availability of its enterprise software platforms available via subscription on the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Marketplace.[29]
The company slashed Saylor's salary from $875,000 to $1 in September 2014 at his request.[30] In October 2014 the company announced plans to lay off 770 employees.[31]
In April 2015, MicroStrategy introduced enterprise security platform Usher™ and debuted the Usher Software Development Kit. In June 2015, MicroStrategy announced the general availability of MicroStrategy 10™, combining enhanced business-intelligence functionality with data discovery, mobile analytics and enterprise-grade security.[32]
In March 2016. MicroStrategy 10 was showcased in the BI Bake-Off, a product face-off that took place at the Gartner Business Intelligence and Analytics Summit at the Gaylord Texan Hotel & Convention Center in Grapevine, Texas.[33] In March 2017, the company announced the general availability of MicroStrategy 10.7, the latest update to the company's MicroStrategy 10 platform.

Product details[edit]

MicroStrategy Analytics allows large organizations to analyze vast amounts of data and securely distribute actionable business insight throughout an enterprise, while also being able to cater to smaller workgroups and departmental use via MicroStrategy Desktop. MicroStrategy Analytics delivers reports and dashboards, and enables users to conduct ad hoc analysis and share insights via mobile devices (via MicroStrategy Mobile) or the Web (via MicroStrategy Web). It also combines the agility of self-service visual data discovery with the security, scalability, and governance features of enterprise-grade business intelligence. MicroStrategy Analytics is available both as on-premises software and as a hosted service offering in MicroStrategy Cloud.[38]
MicroStrategy Mobile, introduced in 2010, is a software platform integrating Analytics capabilities into mobile business apps for the iPhone, iPad, Android, and BlackBerry. It allows improved transactional efficiencies and easier access to intelligence data without needing to reformat the data for different platforms.[28] Apps using it can deliver business intelligence and transactional data derived from their existing data sources, including data warehouses, ERP, CRM and other information systems.[39]
Usher is a digital credential and identity intelligence product that offers a secure, convenient way for organizations to control digital and physical access. By replacing physical badges and passwords with secure digital badges, Usher is able to generate critical information on user behavior and resource usage that can be used to make organizations more productive and secure.[40][41] Usher's technology architecture incorporates the use of three-factor authentication, out-of-band channels, time-limited codes, and bidirectional public key infrastructure encryption.[42]

Awards and recognition[edit]
In 2011, Apple recognized MicroStrategy's iOS app as one of the best business apps of the year.[43] In 2012, the Business Application Research Center (BARC) ranked MicroStrategy first overall in Mobile BI in the BI Survey 12.[44] Also in 2012, Information Management named MicroStrategy one of the "Forty Vendors We’re Watching" for its ability to understand new business trends.[45]

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
