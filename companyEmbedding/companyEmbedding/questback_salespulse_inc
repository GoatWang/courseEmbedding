Press Releases



Questback Salespulse Inc. Announces the Launch of QB Salespulse on the Salesforce AppExchange






Dec 14, 2016, 8:10am EST














HOUSTON, Dec. 14, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Questback Salespulse Inc., a part of the Questback Group, a global leader in enterprise feedback management, announced today it has launched QB Salespulse to increase organizations' insight into their sales performance and sales processes, empowering businesses to connect with their customers in entirely new ways.
Questback Salespulse Inc. will debut the QB Salespulse app at the Salesforce World Tour in New York on December 15th, 2016.
Built on the Salesforce App Cloud, QB Salespulse will be available on the AppExchange. 
"Salesforce offers a powerful Customer Success Platform and an excellent platform for managing your sales process. By partnering with Salesforce, we provide customers with the ability to measure, optimize, and increase the performance and quality of their sales reps and their sales managers. And, at the same time, acquire vital information about their offering as perceived by your customers - all in your current Salesforce user interface."- Audun Moen Stuland, CEO, Questback Salespulse Inc.
"In order to turn your average performers into top performers, you need to know what areas require coaching and which people have the most potential. QB Salespulse provides you with this critical insight – analyzing sales feedback to determine strengths, weaknesses, patterns, and trends."
"Companies are looking to transform the way they connect with customers, partners, and employees to thrive in the age of the customer," said Kori O'Brien, Senior Vice President, Application Innovation Partner Sales, at Salesforce. "By leveraging the power of the Salesforce App Cloud, Questback provides customers with an exciting new way to gain insight into their sales performance and sales processes."
Key Features QB Salespulse provides a resource to measure and reinforce learning based on applied data and analytics. Sales coaching that happens in a continuous learning environment results in knowledge that is sustained over a longer period of time.

Win more deals by focusing on your Sales quality KPIs – In order to continually improve your sales performance and keep your sales people winning against competition, you need to measure and quickly adapt your approach to your customer's needs. QB Salespulse gives you the ability to react instantly, focus, and train based on your Sales quality KPIs. 
Boost motivation with a leaderboard of top performers – Drive competition among your sales team by displaying a leaderboard of the sales reps your customers value the most. 
Measure your selling strategy - QB Salespulse acts as a measurement tool to establish how well your selling strategy and practices are working. It has ready-made suggestions for best practice customer questions based on your chosen sales methodology. 
Coach your sales reps with more than just financial numbers - QB Salespulse answers the question of why do top performers consistently exceed targets while others barely meet or fall short of their targets? It gives you the complete sales picture rather than basing your assumptions only on gut feelings and achieving sales quotas.
