 Anelis Nick Mosich   August 30, 1928 - December 31, 2014   Dr. Anelis Nick "Andy" Mosich, 86, beloved husband, father and grandfather, passed away peacefully at home surrounded by his loving family on December 31, 2014, after a brief illness.   Andy was born in Croatia on August 30, 1928 to Dinko and Josephine Mosich. In 1939, at the age of 10, Andy and his family immigrated to the United States and settled in San Pedro, CA. He was an intelligent, industrious young boy who quickly learned English, did well in school, and was entrepreneurial in organizing his friends in various money making endeavors while growing up. After graduating from San Pedro High School in 1947, he became the first in his family to attend college. He started at Compton College and then transferred to UCLA, graduating in 1951 with a Bachelor of Science degree in Business, and two years later with an MBA. He had become a naturalized citizen in 1951, and after receiving his MBA, Andy was drafted into the United States Army where he served in California and Japan until his discharge from the service in 1955.  After leaving the service and returning to UCLA to teach accounting courses, Andy met Dorothy Rasich, and they were married a year later in 1958. Recognizing Andy's love of teaching, Dorothy encouraged him to pursue his doctorate degree, completing his dissertation in fewer than four months, and earning his Ph.D. in May 1963. In 1964, Andy accepted a teaching position at the University of Southern California, where he taught for nearly 30 years. Andy considered his teaching years at USC to be "the Golden Years" of his professional life, especially during the 1970s and early 1980s, when "students knew how to study hard and have fun." He and Dorothy made lifelong friends with students and faculty, held impromptu parties at La Fonda and frequented Jimmy's restaurant. Andy knew how to have fun, but he was famous for his strictness in the classroom and high expectations of the students he taught. He truly cared about his students and took a personal, and often paternal, interest in contributing to their success, going above and beyond to assist in their education and careers and maintaining many of those friendships long after their years at USC.  In addition to being widely regarded as one of the most influential professors of his generation, Andy also co-authored a series of well-respected accounting textbooks, had great success as a consultant and as an expert witness, and attained legendary status for his fund raising efforts on behalf of USC and the Leventhal School of Accounting. Much of his fund raising legacy will continue to benefit students and accounting education for decades.   After retiring in 1993, Andy embarked on what he would say were the best years of his life with Dorothy and his family, who adored him. He loved his simple everyday life at home with Dorothy, good champagne and cigars, frequent family dinners and fine dining. Andy remained in good health & young at heart until the end. His humor, zest for life and insight will be missed by all who knew him.  Andy is survived by his loving wife of 56 years, Dorothy; their three children, Lori Pecarich (Nick), Lisa Newman (Kermit), and Jeff Mosich (Borka); grandchildren, Anelise, Maxwell and Colin Newman; sister, Joanne Zupanovich (James) and numerous cousins, nieces, nephews and dear friends. He was preceded in death by his parents and sister, Freida Sliskovich.  Although he was widely respected for his professional accomplishments, Andy will be remembered most as a devoted and loving husband and father who told his kids amazing original bedtime stories when they were growing up, taught them all that the most important thing in the world was to love each other, and still looked forward to going out on dates with Dorothy, his soulmate. He was a truly lovable and unforgettable man whose influence and love will never be forgotten.   A private family Funeral Service was held. A Memorial Service honoring Andy is being held by the Leventhal School of Accounting at USC on Sunday, March 29, 2015. To RSVP or for more information, please contact Danielle Galvan in Dean William Holder's office at (213) 740-2431 or daniellm@marshall.usc.edu.   Memorial donations in Andy's honor can be made to the A.N. Mosich Endowed Scholarship Fund at the USC Leventhal School of Accounting. Please mail donations to the office of Dean William W. Holder, USC Leventhal School of Accounting, University of Southern California, 3660 Trousdale Parkway, ACC 101A, Los Angeles, CA 90089-0441.
