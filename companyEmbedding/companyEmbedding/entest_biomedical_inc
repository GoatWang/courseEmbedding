					Full Description



Entest BioMedical, Inc., incorporated on September 24, 2008, is engaged in the development and commercialization of immunotherapeutic therapies for the veterinary market, as well as the acquisition and operation of veterinary hospitals. The Company is engaged in the development and commercialization of ImenVax, a therapeutic cancer vaccine for use in canines, and the development and commercialization of certain intellectual property for non-human veterinary therapeutic use. The Company's products include ImenVax I, ImenVax II, ImenVax III and ENT-576.ImenVax IImenVax I is a therapeutic for canine cancer, which involves isolating tumor cells from the patient and then placing the cells into a cell implant device that is inserted subcutaneously into the patient. The resulting expression of tumor antigens from the device is intended to generate an anti-tumor immune response. The implant chamber device provokes immune responses to the tumor cells isolated from the patient's own tumor through a process known as indirect presentation. Tumor cells implanted in the device are exposed to conditions that are distinct from the tumor's environment from which they were isolated. This altered environment allows for anti-tumor responses that are not ordinarily observed in the natural tumor progression.ImenVax IIThe Company's product, ImenVax II, is in early-stage of development. ImenVax II utilizes cell lines for sustained release of immunologically relevant cytokines for maximum anti-tumor immune responses. The Company intends to include adjuvant cytokine(s) along with tumor cells into the implantation device. The adjuvants can be added through cytokine expressing cell line.ImenVax IIIThe Company's product, ImenVax III, is intended to function by harnessing the ability of placental extracts to combat canine cancers. ImenVax III is intended to treat existing tumors through stimulation of immune responses to kill tumor cells directly; indirectly kill tumor cells by cutting off the tumor blood supply, and block the ability of the tumor to suppress the immune system.ENT-576The Company is developing ENT-576 for the treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The Company's ENT-576 therapy consists of extracting a therapeutic number of cells from a tissue containing in part a stem cell population; processing said population of cells derived from said tissue so as to concentrate said stem cell population; systemic re-administration of said cell population into the same patient, and exposing the patient lung to a sufficient intensity and frequency of laser irradiation necessary to augment therapeutic activity of said cells in said patient suffering from COPD.

Our Mission
​"Putting together the brightest minds involved in basic science, drug development, veterinary medical practice and commercialization to develop new cures through the most rapid means possible."








Zander Therapeutics, Inc. is a veterinary biotechnology company that is wholly owned by Entest BioMedical Inc. (a publicly traded company -- OTCPINK: ENTB). Zander is focused on developing veterinary treatments for cancer and autoimmune disorders (such as arthritis). We are targeting canine cancer, especially considering that 50% of all dogs over the age of 10 years will develop some form of cancer. Feline Leukemia (FL) is another focal point, with 2-3% of all cats in the United States carrying the feline leukemia virus. Additionally, we are looking at arthritis in animals from dogs and cats to thoroughbred horses. Our goal is to utilize small molecule therapies for treating autoimmune disorders (arthritis) in animal companions, feline leukemia (cats) and canine cancer (dogs). Currently, Zander Therapeutics is developing products treating blood disorders using small molecules based on nuclear receptor NR2F6 under an exclusive license agreement for veterinary use from Regen BioPharma Inc. (OTCQB: RGBP).
 






 



Ongoing objectives include gene silencing for treating cancer with immunotherapy, modulating key molecular processes in cancer stem cells through Zander’s patented molecular targeting approaches and repairing damaged bone marrow in animals with aplastic anemia and bone marrow suppression due to side effects of chemotherapy/radiotherapy-treated cancer patients.














Products
Zander Therapeutics' main areas of interest include: autoimmune disorders such as arthritis, immunotherapies for cancer treatment in canines and bone marrow suppression therapy for animals treated with chemotherapy and radiation therapy.Complete listing, click "READ MORE".

TENS Units from LGMedSupply
LGMedSupply has a large selection of portable TENS units for pain relief. Whether youre looking for pain relief from back pain or in other areas of your body, you will find that we offer the best TENS machines and warranties. TENS units are often used as a non-invasive way of electric stimulation for pain relief. A substantial amount of pain relief can be achieved by using a TENS unit properly as the electrode pads cause electric stimulation that travels along nerve fibers, thus creating a pain relieving sensation.
EMS Units from LGMedSupply
We also carry many EMS units. An EMS unit, also known as an electrical muscle stimulator, electronic muscle stimulator, electric muscle stimulator or electro muscle stimulator, can be used as a therapy tool for patients, a strength training tool for athletes and healthy individuals, and even as a testing tool for the evaluation of neural and muscular function.
Electrical muscle stimulation is the use of electric impulses to cause muscle contraction. EMS units provide electrical current that passes through the muscle and causes the muscle to contract. Electrical impulses generated by the EMS machine are delivered through electrodes placed on the skin next to the muscles that need electronic muscle stimulation.  Electrical muscle stimulation can also accelerate the muscle learning process by providing its users with repeated contractions.
A Large Selection of TENS EMS Combo Units
TENS units and EMS units work the same way. An EMS unit will stimulate muscles, whereas a TENS unit will stimulate nerve endings. Many pain sufferers use a combination of both TENS and EMS to provide a maximum amount of relief and muscle stimulation. We carry a large selection of portable Combo TENS / EMS units to combine the benefits of nerve ending stimulation and electronic muscle stimulation.
Portable Ultrasound Machines for the Home from LGMedSupply
We also carry a large selection of portable ultrasonic machines for use at home. These home ultrasound machines stimulate tissue beneath the skin surface by using very high frequency sound waves. Home ultrasound machines can make the healing process much faster by increasing blood flow. They can also diminish the amount of pain due to a decrease in swelling and edema. Portable ultrasound machines provides the user a gentle massage of tendons and/or ligaments without adding any stress, all while softening scar tissue.
Having a portable ultrasound machine at home offers long-term pain relief, cost savings, portable therapy, and can reduce healing time and chronic inflammation.


Google Trusted Store Customer RatingsHave brought many items for LG Medical since 2012 and never had an issue. Service is always great and the products are excellent quality for a great price. If you have a question and call they are knowledgeable about their products plus the LG web site has many videos and tip. I will continue to buy from LG Medical as I feel the are one of the best in their field. DMD- Written on June 17, 2016 READ MORE REVIEWSA family member ordered from LGMedSupply in the past and had great service, and that is why I felt safe ordering from them. And they didn't let me down. I got exactly what I ordered and it got to me when it was supposed to so that is why I gave them the top rating.- Written on July 19, 2016 READ MORE REVIEWSGreat product, Great Shipping, Great Customer service. AAA+++- Written on July 17, 2016 READ MORE REVIEWS I was very happy with the service that I got from the staff at LG Med Supply. I looked all over the net for over a year to see who was the main Co. that had not only what I needed but who was the Co. that seemed to be the main Manufacturer of the Tens Unit. Then I started checking who had all of the Conductive Designed Pads That my Dr. wanted me to have and here again LG Med Supply had all of the items and were offering the best prices on all of the items that I needed. LG Med Supply was hands down the best in all of the categories as far as who had all of the items that I needed from the Back Belt Strap/Neck electrode/Shoulder and Knee Conductive Designed Pads that my Dr. wanted me to start therapy with. LG Med Supply is the only web site that had a vast selection of different shaped Electrodes which deliver a totally different stimulation that really gives you a completely different feeling then a straight square pad electrode. Thank You LG Med Supply for being there in my time of need.

TENS Units from LGMedSupply
LGMedSupply has a large selection of portable TENS units for pain relief. Whether youre looking for pain relief from back pain or in other areas of your body, you will find that we offer the best TENS machines and warranties. TENS units are often used as a non-invasive way of electric stimulation for pain relief. A substantial amount of pain relief can be achieved by using a TENS unit properly as the electrode pads cause electric stimulation that travels along nerve fibers, thus creating a pain relieving sensation.
EMS Units from LGMedSupply
We also carry many EMS units. An EMS unit, also known as an electrical muscle stimulator, electronic muscle stimulator, electric muscle stimulator or electro muscle stimulator, can be used as a therapy tool for patients, a strength training tool for athletes and healthy individuals, and even as a testing tool for the evaluation of neural and muscular function.
Electrical muscle stimulation is the use of electric impulses to cause muscle contraction. EMS units provide electrical current that passes through the muscle and causes the muscle to contract. Electrical impulses generated by the EMS machine are delivered through electrodes placed on the skin next to the muscles that need electronic muscle stimulation.  Electrical muscle stimulation can also accelerate the muscle learning process by providing its users with repeated contractions.
A Large Selection of TENS EMS Combo Units
TENS units and EMS units work the same way. An EMS unit will stimulate muscles, whereas a TENS unit will stimulate nerve endings. Many pain sufferers use a combination of both TENS and EMS to provide a maximum amount of relief and muscle stimulation. We carry a large selection of portable Combo TENS / EMS units to combine the benefits of nerve ending stimulation and electronic muscle stimulation.
Portable Ultrasound Machines for the Home from LGMedSupply
We also carry a large selection of portable ultrasonic machines for use at home. These home ultrasound machines stimulate tissue beneath the skin surface by using very high frequency sound waves. Home ultrasound machines can make the healing process much faster by increasing blood flow. They can also diminish the amount of pain due to a decrease in swelling and edema. Portable ultrasound machines provides the user a gentle massage of tendons and/or ligaments without adding any stress, all while softening scar tissue.
Having a portable ultrasound machine at home offers long-term pain relief, cost savings, portable therapy, and can reduce healing time and chronic inflammation.


Google Trusted Store Customer RatingsHave brought many items for LG Medical since 2012 and never had an issue. Service is always great and the products are excellent quality for a great price.

AAA+++- Written on July 17, 2016 READ MORE REVIEWS I was very happy with the service that I got from the staff at LG Med Supply. I looked all over the net for over a year to see who was the main Co. that had not only what I needed but who was the Co. that seemed to be the main Manufacturer of the Tens Unit. Then I started checking who had all of the Conductive Designed Pads That my Dr. wanted me to have and here again LG Med Supply had all of the items and were offering the best prices on all of the items that I needed. LG Med Supply was hands down the best in all of the categories as far as who had all of the items that I needed from the Back Belt Strap/Neck electrode/Shoulder and Knee Conductive Designed Pads that my Dr. wanted me to start therapy with. LG Med Supply is the only web site that had a vast selection of different shaped Electrodes which deliver a totally different stimulation that really gives you a completely different feeling then a straight square pad electrode. Thank You LG Med Supply for being there in my time of need.

Sees Entry Into $300 Million Veterinary Cancer Care Market Through Veterinary Hospital AcquisitionsMarketwireSeptember 4, 2012ReblogShareTweetShareSAN DIEGO, CA--(Marketwire -09/04/12)- Entest BioMedical Inc. (ENTB) (ENTB) a company focused on veterinary biotechnology and veterinary hospital acquisition / operation, announced today that it has begun the process of interviewing qualified candidates to fill the Company's newly created position of Director of Corporate Affairs.A Company spokesman stated that, "The primary responsibilities of the Director of Corporate Affairs shall be to identify veterinary hospitals suitable for acquisition, substantially assist in the structuring of those acquisitions, and work with the company to integrate newly acquired veterinary hospitals into the Company. The Company's current business model involves acquiring veterinary clinics / hospitals to be utilized as potential distribution channels for its products under development. The Company believes that, in addition to serving as distribution channels for the Company's immuno-therapeutic cancer vaccine for canines, these clinics will be able to generate revenue for the Company from current operations.""Our primary goal is to continue growing the number of Veterinary Hospitals we own," stated Dr. David Koos, Chairman and CEO of Entest BioMedical. "In pursuing this segment of our business model, we will be able to continue growing our asset base, increase our current revenue stream and establish an initial distribution channel for our products and therapies; the first of these products being Entest's ImenVax immune-therapeutic canine cancer vaccine currently under development. Having a qualified Director of Corporate Affairs whose duties will consist primarily of identifying hospitals for acquisition and who possesses the skills required to substantially assist us in negotiating favorable purchase terms will be valuable in assisting the Company in achieving its goal of acquiring up to 10 additional veterinary clinics within the next 16 months." Entest currently owns and operates the McDonald Animal Hospital of Santa Barbara, CA which the company purchased in 2011. This facility serves as both a revenue source for Entest as well as a research facility for the biomedical company.Dr. Koos continued, "One in every three dogs will develop cancer during its lifetime. Sadly, such cancers kill nearly half of all pet dogs over the age of ten; animals that are family to millions of pet owners. Pet owners are willing to pay the cost for the necessary treatments meant to save the lives of their loved ones. We believe we will be able to provide families the needed cancer therapies for their canines, within the appropriate facilities, should we continue pursuing our growth model. With the ASPCA citing approximately 78 million dogs as pets within the United States, the veterinary care market represents enormous revenue potential. It has been estimated that the U.S. market for veterinary cancer care amounts to approximately $300 million per year."Dr. Koos concluded, "Canine cancer impacts 60% of all dogs over six years of age in the United States (http://dogcanceradvice.com/canine-cancer-information/overview/). Cancer in canines is still predominantly treated through surgical excision, chemotherapy and radiation therapy. These treatment methods can be highly invasive and can result in numerous unpleasant side effects. We believe our products under development, which utilize the patient's own immune system to battle the cancer, will be able to offer a lower cost, less traumatic alternative to veterinarians and pet owners. As both the CEO of Entest and a loving pet owner my objectives are twofold; to contribute economic value to Entest as well as to contribute to the lifelong happiness of families who are pet owners."About Entest BioMedical Inc.:Entest BioMedical Inc. (ENTB) (ENTB) is a developer of veterinary medicines that harness the animal's own reparative / immunological mechanisms. The company's products include an immuno-therapeutic cancer vaccine for canines (ImenVax™). The company's immuno-therapeutic cancer vaccine utilizes an encapsulation device as the vaccine delivery system and requires a simple implant procedure.DisclaimerThis news release may contain forward-looking statements.
