Artificial lift integral system for the production of hydrocarbons for oil wells by means of pneumatic pumping with natural gas autonomously supplied by oil wells



Patent number:  8757271
                                            

Abstract:  A system and a method for the artificial pneumatic production of oil and gas which is self-supplied is provided. The well's originating gas separates in a skid of separation of oil and after gas is rectified, gas is injected again into the well; the gas injection is made to a pressure enough to lift the oil-gas mixture inside the well. The excess of gas is exhausted toward the closer processing station.
                        

Type: 
                                                    Grant
                                            

Filed: 
                        February 10, 2011

                                                        June 24, 2014
                        

Assignee: 
                                                                        ENX Compressors SA DE CV
                                

Inventor:
