VK Media & Internet Services, LLC. - Video Production, Web Hosting and Design, Photography








































































Patrick Mirucki 
Patrick
                  Mirucki, President of VK Media & Internet Services, LLC, sums up his philosophy
                  about the video production and internet business when he says, "Hey
                  Babe! Lets Do It !" 
Mr. Mirucki has
                      been doing it in New Jersey since he fell in love with
                      the blues scene in Asbury Park in the early 80's and created The
                      Underground Café for CTN (the Cable Television
                      Network of New Jersey) to cover the burgeoning talent that
                      sprung from this area and spread throughout the Metropolitan
area.


Mr. Mirucki went
                    on to become the General Manager for OBC-TV, a commercial/public
                    access channel in Northeastern New Jersey where he developed
                    local programming for the surrounding twelve communities.
                    The shows covered everything from sports to the acclaimed Meet
              the Mayor, as well as his beloved music scene.


Mr. Mirucki became
                    great friends with all-around entertainer, Mark Dacey. He
                    could sing'em and play'em straight, or blend his Hot Tuna
                    guitar licks into a Rock'n Roll version of the Victor Borge
                    Show. Mark's show, The
                    Mark Dacey Show-Unsigned, was a showcase for his unique
                    talent as well as a vehicle for the volume of talent throughout
New Jersey.
Uncle Floyd, New
                    Jersey's crown prince of comedy for over twenty years, invaded
                    the OBC-TV studios in the late eighties with his zany cast
of supporting players.

Mark Dacey 





Uncle Floyd 
The
                    Uncle Floyd Show  flourished on OBC-TV and helped launch
                    two additional shows, one of which reflected Pat's continuing
                    interest in the local music scene. Local, Live Licks
                    with Uncle Floyd helped promote some of New Jersey's
                    local talent and featured guest artists from the Major record
                    companies. It was produced at the Facility of Power
                    Play Music Television. Uncle Floyd's New Jersey presented
                    a walking tour of residential and business communities throughout
                    New Jersey.  Uncle Floyd plays piano every Tuesday evening
                    at Colucci's in 
Haldon, New Jersey




Anyone who was alive
                    and well and tuning in to Channels 20 and 36 on the TCI and
                    Suburban cable systems in the mid-90s at eleven o'clock on
                    a Saturday night, were witnessing local cable TV history
                    in the making with a show directed by Patrick Mirucki. The
                    11th Hour, the brainchild of Mugsy,
                    from The Uncle Floyd Show, was a 3 hour live show
                    that went one step further than Saturday Night Live. No topic
                    was too taboo, no public personality was too revered, no
                    catastrophe too great, no headline so important that they
                    could escape the twisted comic scrutiny of the Uncle Floyd
                    alumni. The 11th Hour became labeled the most
                    dangerous show. The 11th Hour, like many of
                    the other OBC-TV programs, gave promising young talent a
                    chance to do their stuff. Some had great stage presence,
like Karon Brandt.

Mugsy





Karon Brandt 
Pat talked Karon
                    Brandt into hosting her own Blues show, The Blues with
                    Karon Brandt to show off her talent and to further explore
                    the ever-expanding New Jersey blues scene. Pat persuaded,
                    friend and fellow blues fanatic (and booking agent), Jim
                    Signorini to join the show. Jim helped The Blues with
                    Karon Brandt go statewide with his ability to draw such
legendary figures as B.B. King to the show.


In 1992, Mr. Mirucki
                    saw the need for a movie review show. A mutual friend introduced
                    him to movie fanatic and self-confessed 'closet film historian',
                    Greg Murray. With the help of staff producer, Mike Doyle,
                    they launched Film
                    Flicks & Video Pix. Greg introduced clips, sound
                    bites, and featurettes, often linking them together to stress
                    the points of view of the writers and directors. He recommended
                    videos of older films that reflected similarities in writing,
                    directing, acting, theme, historical perspective, or good
                    old-fashioned entertainment value. In 1993, Film Flicks & Video
                    Pix was seen in twenty-nine states, and as far away
                    as Trinidad. In 1997, Greg was invited to join The Broadcast
              Film Critics Association (BFCA).
In the early 90's Mr. Mirucki
                    realized the Internet Explosion was a reality that could
                    not be avoided. Designing and Hosting Websites for small
                    businesses and creating a cyberspace neighborhood was the
                    next logical step for VK Media & Internet Services, LLC. The outgrowth of

What is a difference between  Federal Tax Lien and a Levy?
 by Viktoriya Khusit | May 22, 2017 | Blog | 0 commentsA Federal Tax Lien is a claim against property. When you don’t pay your fist tax due a lean is filled and it is attached to any property you owe or any future rights you may have to a property. This lien is reported to credit reporting agencies and have negative effect on your credit rating and make difficult for you to receive a credit such a loan or a credit card. Once your debt is fully paid off, Federal Tax Lien gets “released” or it can be “withdraw” if you make arrangements with IRS such as installment Agreement.
Levy is a seizure of property. While a Lien is  claim against your property, Levy is actual legal seizure where IRS actually takes your property or a right to a property to satisfy your tax debt. If you have current Installment agreement or  Offer in Compromise, IRS cannot asses a levy.
Example of property that can be “levy”:
-Wages, salary or commission, bank accounts, federal payments, house, car or other property
Property that cannot be seized:
-Unemployment benefits, certain pension benefits, workers compensation, certain public assistance payments, minimum weekly exempt income, court ordered child support

 

Ways of paying a balance due on your tax return: Installment Agreement or Offer in Compromise
 by Viktoriya Khusit | May 9, 2017 | Blog | 0 commentsNow tax season is over and hopefully you filled your tax return. In my practice I have a few clients who owe a balance due on their returns. My first and main advise- FILE. File your returns regardless of you having funds to pay your balance due. If you don’t file before a due date, you will be automatically assessed a fee for ” failure to file your tax return”. You filled on time-you already saved money.
So you have a balance, what is your options of paying it.
Best option is to pay it in full before a due date or after if you have to. This can be done via direct debit ( and IRS will take only amount you indicated on the date you indicated on your authorization. Second option is a payment via credit/debit card. You can do it by go to https://www.irs.gov/uac/pay-taxes-by-credit-or-debit-card
Third option you can mail a physical check to the IRS.
What if you need time or help  to pay your balance. There are two options available:
Installment Agreement and Offer of Compromise
Installment Agreement is a contract with IRS, where IRS allows to make smaller periodic payments over time. You can apply online https://www.irs.gov/individuals/online-payment-agreement-application
or over the phone 1-800-829-1040
or by mail. If your balance is less than $25,000 you need form 9465 if more than $25,000, use form 9465-FS . Also you can fill out form 2159 Payroll Deduction agreement.
and of course in person.
Remember you will still be charged applicable penalties and interest. Also, a Notice of Federal Tax Lien can be filled against you, and this lien goes on your credit until you pay your balance in full, but IRS will send you a letter warning you that they are planning on filling a lien.
Offer in Compromise may be accepted by IRS if you cannot pay in full or even through installments. In short, you will ask IRS to settle unpaid taxes for less than what you owe. Offer in Compromise may be accepted if:
– IRS agrees that tax debt amount may not be  accurate,
-Taxpayer has insufficient assets and income to pay balance due
– or you have exceptional circumstances and paying a balance due would course an economic hardship or would be unjust
 
Form 656-L needs to be filled out if tax debt inaccurate or form 656 if a taxpayer unable to pay due to hardship

 

Employer’s Annual Federal Unemployment (FUTA) Tax Return
 by Viktoriya Khusit | Jan 23, 2017 | Blog | 0 commentsForm 940 Employer’s Annual Federal Unemployment (FUTA) Tax Return is due By January 31. If the fourth quarter FUTA liability, PLUS any deposited FUTA tax from a previous quarter is $500 or less, you can either deposit the tax or pay the tax with your Form 940 filed by January 31. When the deposit due date falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday, you may deposit the tax by the next business day.
This video will show how to fill out this form if you pay tax in California ( click on the link)
 
 

 

Your housekeeper is your employee and needs W2, did you know that?
 by Viktoriya Khusit | Jan 11, 2017 | Blog | 0 commentsYou have a household employee if:
– you hired someone to do household work
– you can control what work is done
– you can control how work is done
– worker is using your tools and equipment
– hired  full time or part time or for the job/project
-you pay by an hour, daily, weekly, or by the job, (how you pay does not matter)
Household work is done in or around your house, and examples of workers are as follow: babysitters, caretakers, cooks, drivers, health aids, house cleaning workers, housekeepers, maids, nannies, private workers and yard workers. However, if your workers runs a business and offers his services to the general public, provides his/her own supplies, tools and equipment, hires help if needed, this person is not your employee.
So you determine that your worker is your employee, what’s next?

You need to obtain I-9 form, Employment Eligibility Verification from your worker to make sure person is legally authorize to work in the US.
You need to withhold and pay Social Security and Medicare taxes, pay Unemployment tax. You don’t have to withhold federal income tax , but if your employee asks, you can.
You also need to get by January 31 of the following year you employed your worker a Employer Identification Number, give your employee W2, file Copy A of W2 and W3 form with the Social Security Administration.
By April 15 (tax due date) file Schedule H- household employment taxes with your income tax return, and if you don’t have to file you income tax return, than Schedule H by itself with IRS

 
Don’t forget that each state had different tax rates and you need to check with your state Employment Development Department. Since I am in California, video reflects Schedule H for California state. Click HERE to see Youtube video how to fill out Schedule H for California state.
It looks complicated and overwhelming, but your tax professional can handle this and file a correct way.

 

 

W2 excluded from Gross Income for IHSS providers.
 by Viktoriya Khusit | Dec 29, 2016 | Blog | 2 commentsThis is information for all the WPCS (Waiver personal care services)providers who live with the recipient of the services in the same household. IRS ruled that starting March 1, 2016 that IHSS wages received by IHSS (In home supportive services) providers who live in the same household with the person who receives those services are excluded from gross income for the purposes of Federal Income Tax.
Providers have to self certify i.e. complete a live-in self-certification form SOC2298 in order to exclude wages from Federal income tax. This form is available on the CDSS California department of social services website www.cdss.ca.gov starting November 15, 2016.
Remember that until you send in form in, your wages still will be considered income for Federal income taxes. That means that any W2 received prior 2016 and any wages paid in 2017 prior receiving self-certification form will not be amended and will be a part of your gross income for tax purposes.
You need to complete and submit this form only once, and it will work as long as you continue to work for and live with recipient. If you living arrangement change and recipient no longer lives with you, but you continue providing cervices, you need to file form SOC 2299-Live-in self-certification cancellation form. And form SOC 840 Change of address with the IHSS county office.
In situations where you providing services and live in with more than one person, you need to fill out and mail in form for each recipient of your services, for example, if you providing services and living with 2 people, you need to send in two forms.

 

What are ITINs and who needs them?
 by Viktoriya Khusit | Dec 9, 2016 | Blog | 0 commentsIRS issue ITIN – Individual Taxpayer Identification Number, to all individuals who are required to have US taxpayer identification number, but do not have or not eligible to get a social security number. This is a 9 digit number that starts with 9 and has 7 or 8 as a fourth number. 9NN-7N-NNNN
Here is some people who might need to get an ITIN:
• A nonresident alien required to file a U.S. tax return
• A U.S. resident alien (based on days present in the United States) filing a U.S. tax return
• A dependent or spouse of a U.S. citizen/resident alien
• A dependent or spouse of a nonresident alien visa holder
You cannot:
-work with this number,
-be eligible for Social Security benefits or
-qualify a dependent for Earned Income Tax Credit,
but can:
-file tax return and
-be eligible for Child Tax Credit or
-American Opportunity credit,
where if one spouse has social security number and second does not have any numbers, these credits are not available.
 
In order to receive ITIN individual need to submit form W7 to IRS
 
Important update this year:  Any ITIN issued prior 2013 are starting to expire starting with ITINs that has middle numbers starting with 78 or 79 (9NN-78-NNNN). Also, if you did not use your ITIN, i,e. did not file a tax return in the past 3 years, starting January 1, 2017 you numbers will no longer be valid on US tax return. IRS started accepting renewals as of October 1, 2016. To renew an expiring ITIN, you must submit a completed Form W-7, Application for IRS Individual Taxpayer Identification Number, and all required identification documents to the IRS. No tax return is required for a renewal application.
