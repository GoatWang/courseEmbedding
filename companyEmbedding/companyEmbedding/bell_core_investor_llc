Power shift
Not long ago, coal provided 98% of the electricity for the pulp-and-paper mills and iron-ore producers around the western edge of Lake Superior, as well as the nearby city of Duluth, Minn.

Bell Partners Closes $600 Million Apartment Fund VI

Private Equity Real Estate Fund to Focus on Investments in Well-Located, High-Quality Apartment Communities in Major Markets Across the United States




Jun 19, 2017, 9:17am EDT














GREENSBORO, N.C., June 19, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Bell Partners Inc., one of the nation's leading apartment investment and management companies, announced today that it has completed its second and final close of Bell Apartment Fund VI, LLC.  The Fund was materially oversubscribed and closed at its fund size limit with $600 million of total equity commitments.  With debt leverage, the Fund has the capacity to acquire over $1.7 billion in apartment investments. 
Bell Apartment Fund VI is a fully discretionary, value-add fund that invests in high-quality, well-located multifamily properties across the United States and leverages Bell's extensive operating platform to enhance cash flow through value-add activities.  The Fund's investor base is comprised of institutional investors from across the globe and accredited high-net-worth individuals. CBRE Capital Advisors acted as placement agent for select U.S. investor capital commitments.
Jon Bell, CEO of Bell Partners Inc., said: "We are grateful to our investors for their commitment to our most recent value-add fund and are very pleased with the reception that Fund VI received from both domestic and international investors.  The extremely positive investor response demonstrates a high level of confidence in Bell's strategy, management team, and vertically integrated operating platform, as well as the recognition of our strong track record.   We are confident that this investment opportunity will generate attractive current income and provide strong total returns for our investors."
With the recent opening of Bell's San Francisco office, Bell continues the expansion of its investing capabilities and is well positioned to acquire apartment investments within its national footprint.  Fund VI seeks to invest in multifamily properties in targeted major metropolitan areas across the U.S. with healthy fundamentals.  Through renovation, enhanced operations and investing in transitioning locations, Fund VI seeks to add value and produce superior risk adjusted returns.  In addition to Bell's series of value-add apartment funds, Bell also invests in stabilized, core apartments through a $1 billion separate account with a German real estate special fund managed by HANSAINVEST.   The venture is focused on acquiring stabilized core multifamily properties located across its major markets in the U.S. 
During 2016, Bell completed nearly $1.3 billion in total apartment transactions.  Since 2002, Bell has completed over $12 billion of apartment transactions on behalf of its investors.   Bell Partners was recently ranked by Preqin Global Real Estate Report for the third year in a row as one of the top performing, most consistent real estate fund managers. 
About Bell Partners Inc. Established in 1976, Bell Partners Inc. ("Bell Partners" or the "Company") is a privately held, vertically integrated apartment investment and management company focused on high-quality multifamily communities throughout the United States. With approximately 60,000 units under management, Bell Partners is the 15th largest apartment operator in the United States (according to The National Multi-Housing Council, 2017) and one of the largest renovators in the country. The Company has more than 1,500 associates and 7 offices (including its headquarters in Greensboro, N.C.) and offers an extensive and full service platform containing expertise in acquisitions and dispositions, financing, property operations, accounting, risk management and all other related support functions. Bell Partners is led by a senior management team with an average of over 20 years of experience that has invested throughout all phases of the real estate cycle and has helped the Company complete over $12 billion of apartment transactions since 2002, including nearly $1.3 billion in 2016 transactions.

Environmental Financial Products, LLC (EFP) and CBOE Holdings, Inc. (CBOE) Announce New Interbank Lending Exchange and Interest Rate Benchmark

























      2015-09-10
      





American Financial ExchangeSM (AFXSM) to Support U.S. Mid-Size Banking Sector  


Note for Journalists: A Teleconference Will Be Held This Morning Beginning at 9:00 a.m. CT (Call-In Details Provided Below)
CHICAGO, IL – September 10, 2015 – Environmental Financial Products, LLC (EFP) and CBOE Holdings, Inc. (CBOE) today announced plans to launch the American Financial Exchange (AFX), an electronic marketplace for small and mid-sized banks to lend and borrow short-term funds. EFP is a prominent, successful exchange incubator headed by Dr. Richard Sandor, universally recognized as the “father of financial futures.”  CBOE is the creator of the listed options market and numerous other market and product innovations, including securities index options and the CBOE Volatility Index® (VIX® Index).
AFX was designed to bring the benefits of exchange trading, including standardization, transparency and a rules-based process, to interbank lending, while substantially reducing transaction costs through an electronic market. Importantly, AFX will also respond to the critical need for a transaction-based interest rate benchmark through weekly auctions of a new benchmark rate for U.S. interbank lending, called AmeriborTM. The first AFX auction of Ameribor, which is based on proprietary calculation methodology developed by EFP, is expected to take place in the fourth quarter of 2015.
“Mid-sized U.S. banks are disproportionately responsible for lending to small businesses, directly contributing to job creation and economic growth in the real economy,” said Dr. Richard Sandor, Chairman and CEO of Environmental Financial Products. “An efficient and transparent market can benefit participants and the economy as a whole by providing an efficient way to borrow and lend money, as well as generating indices that truly reflect the bank’s cost of funds.” Dr. Sandor will act as Chairman and CEO of AFX.
“We couldn’t be more pleased to work with Dr. Sandor and his team to create and develop the AFX marketplace,” said Edward T. Tilly, CEO of CBOE Holdings. “The opportunity to bring transparency, price efficiency and transaction-based benchmarks to interbank lending is very compelling to us and is closely aligned with CBOE’s values and core strengths.  We look forward to hosting, operating and helping to further develop a new and truly innovative marketplace.”

AFX was designed with the input of participating banks, and will continue to evolve based on the needs of mid-sized banks.  The initial interbank loan market will be a daily market for overnight and 30-day loans. AFX will focus on 1,740 community and regional banks with between $500 million and $125 billion in assets, which hold a combined total of $4.7 trillion in assets.
“We view having an index interest rate that is truly set by market forces as a real plus in today’s environment,” said Bill Sirakos, Senior Executive Vice President and Capital Markets Division Head at Frost Bank in San Antonio, Texas.  “The potential for growth in the use of the AFX is quite high, both among commercial banks as well as, eventually, today’s commercial paper issuers.”
CBOE will operate the web-accessible, secure, electronic trade matching engine and will also support surveillance and membership services. Northern Trust will serve as the settlement bank.
AFX has been in development for three years, and has been advised and represented by Sullivan & Cromwell, LLP (regulatory matters), Jenner & Block (corporate matters) and Sandler O’Neill & Partners, LP. Chicago-based Connamara Systems developed the software for the electronic trading platform using EFP’s proprietary methodology.
“AFX has been designed to be a monument to transparency, an efficient market for interbank funds and ultimately, an expanded source of liquidity for American banks,” said Robert Albertson, Partner and Chief Strategist at Sandler O’Neill.  “Ameribor will be a cleansed and true indication of heartland American banking’s cost of funds.  AFX will not only simplify interbank transactions, it also has the potential to reduce costs and add select corporate, investment and government pools of liquidity – all long overdue.”
