How to Take Gorgeous Product Photos





January 28, 2013 • Jason Lawrence

Editor’s Note: We welcome Jason Lawrence as our newest contributor. He is a computer scientist, researcher, educator, and entrepreneur, having co-founded Arqspin, a mobile phone-based platform for creating 360 spins. He is also an associate professor in the Computer Science Department at the University of Virginia.
The way you present your products online has a significant impact on sales. Amateur-looking product shots erode consumers’ trust and could send them fleeing. Fortunately, you don’t need to spend $10,000 on equipment or hire a professional to create beautiful product photography that will instill faith in your online store and get results.
In this article, I’ll show you, in eight simple steps, how to save money on product photography and improve your store’s look and performance.
1. Camera
It’s important to use a nice camera. Fortunately, they have become very affordable. You can’t go wrong with a modern digital single-lens reflex (DSLR) model. I prefer the Nikon D7000 in terms of its price vs. performance tradeoff. Be sure to choose a camera that can capture video, and invest in decent lenses. I normally use a 50mm lens — here’s an example — which can accommodate mid-range and portrait work. A 105mm lens — here’s one from Adorama — while a bit expensive, is great for close-up work and jewelry product photography.
Although it used to be that having a DSLR was necessary for taking quality product photographs, smartphones have dramatically changed the game. The iPhone 5 has an 8-megapixel sensor and can produce professional grade shots. It’s received glowing reviews, like this one from The Sydney Morning Herald. I strongly encourage you to explore using your smartphone after you have the proper setup before committing to purchasing a higher-end camera. You may be surprised.
You may be surprised at the quality similarities between an iPhone and DSLR photo.
2. Lights
You will need some good lights. Of course, Mother Nature has a built-in option, which can produce great results. But the Sun is fickle. I like the Elinchrom D-Lite 4 Kit, which includes two lights, tripods, and attachable diffuser squares. While there are many photography lighting kits available, what’s most important for your setup is to get lights that operate in “continuous” mode — versus flash only — as this allows using them for video as well. In fact, I prefer to shoot even still photographs with my lights in continuous mode as I find this makes previewing the shot easier and adds depth to the result.
3. Tripod
You need to take longer exposures; holding your camera by hand will produce blurry images that shoppers will not like. I prefer Manfrotto tripod products. There are also some very functional tripods for smartphones such as the Woxom Slingshot.
4. Photo Setup
I like to shoot products in front of a continuous background — often white or neutral grey. It’s a simple and professional look that is often used by major online retailers. Fortunately, it’s simple to achieve.
Just purchase a few rolls of craft paper and some metal clamps. Roll the craft paper down a long and wide table and use the clamps to attach one end of the paper to something a few feet above the table. This will produce a smooth ramp. Place your product on the craft paper just after it comes into contact with the table.
Craft paper and clips can make a nice do-it-yourself product shoot setup.
Place your setup near a big, sunny window if you want natural light, or in a dark room if you want to use your photo lights. For about $50 you have a professional studio like my setup below. If you’re looking for a ready-made setup, Modahaus carries a good line of all-in-one tabletop photography studios.
The author’s custom photography setup.
5. Use a Wide Aperture
The aperture is the opening that lets light into your camera and is specified by an “f-number” like “f/16” or “f/4”. A wide aperture (small f-number) produces a narrow depth of field that makes your photos look richer and more professional. I’ve found that shooting with a narrow depth of field works particularly well for product photos of electronics. Set the aperture on your DSLR to something like “f/1.8” or “f/2”. You will need to have your camera in “aperture priority” mode to do this. Check your manual.
These images below are from my iPad app, “Bokeh: A Book About Cameras.” The images illustrate the effect of a camera’s aperture on the final shot. The image on the left was captured with a wide aperture and has a narrow depth of field. The image on the right was from a narrow aperture and has a wide depth of field. In short, use a wide aperture to produce product photos with a more professional look.
 Enlarge This Image
Wide aperture settings produce a narrow depth of field, such as the image on the left. Narrow apertures produce a wider depth, as in the image on the right.
6. Pay Attention to Shadows
Avoid harsh backlighting and other setups that cast shadows on the surface of the object. Keep the lights on the same side of the object as your camera, or slightly off to one side.
7. Clean Up
A big fingerprint on your product or dust on your lens produce poor, amateur results. Buy some microfiber rags and wipe everything down carefully before shooting.
8. Don’t be Afraid
The biggest obstacle to doing something new is often ourselves. Don’t be afraid to experiment. Be creative. You will make a few mistakes on your way to gaining a deeper understanding of the process. Not only will your sales increase, you will likely develop a new hobby along the way. When you’re ready to delve deeper there are many wonderful books. I like The Art of Photography, by Bruce Barnbaum.
Summary
You are well on your way to having an outstanding photography studio. Your product photos will appear as if you spent thousands on them. But really you did it all yourself.

          "You are well on your way to having an outstanding photography studio. Your product photos will appear as if you spent thousands on them. But really you did it all yourself. "
So, buy a $900 light kit, a $1000 DSLR camera, $300 lens and a $100 photo editing software, and then if you can use the three of them proficiently, you can do it all yourself for cheap!  
Sound good!
Customer generated product photos that I’ve normally get suffer from two problems.  First lighting issues (Low light noise, color balance issues) and second product placement issues (Poor background, too close to the background, poor shot angles, trying to shoot in too small of a space).
I agree that buying all of that equipment and learning how to use it would greatly increase the quality of most images, but beyond the quality of the photography, the setup of the products is normally lacking.  When I shoot products, I normally bring an assistant to do the actual shooting and spend my time setting up the products, which is very important.   







				Mary Wilkinson				January 29, 2013				Reply


          Thanks for all the tips. I am a bit confused in regards to the aperture. The ipad photo above on the right looks much more crisp & clean, the one on the left is blurry, less defined. You said the left one is how it should be done, but how is a blurry photo more professional?







				Jason Lawrence				January 29, 2013				Reply


          Marv, Thanks for the feedback, but don’t overlook the quality of the product photo I shot with my iPhone. That one required sunlight (free) + iPhone 4S ($400 that you might already own) + craft paper and clamps ($40). You are correct: a good backdrop and composition are often the most important aspect of producing nice product photos (and the two things most commonly overlooked). I wanted to emphasize that investing in a nice camera will only get you part of the way home and that smartphone cameras are getting quite good.







				Jason Lawrence				January 29, 2013				Reply


          Mary, That may not have been the best image comparison to make my point. 
Here is a better example.:
[http://blog.arqspin.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/shoe_dof_example.jpg](http://blog.arqspin.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/shoe_dof_example.jpg)
Notice that the narrow depth of field leaves only a thin part of the shoe in sharp focus. Other parts are rendered blurry. This has the effect of drawing the viewers’ attention to a specific feature (in this case, the brand name of the item) while creating, in my opinion, a more interesting and professional look.
Thanks for asking me to clarify.







				Shocked				September 29, 2013				Reply


Well intentioned but simply misguided article.  The author knows enough to be dangerous, but not enough to teach you anything. 
Beware anyone that says that an iphone will be just as good – notice the distortion of the product in the iphone shot?  No one selling a product will want their product distorted, and no one buying photography will want the file from an iphone!  Also, his aperture advice is far from true.
I could go on – but I’ll just give you a word of advice.  Get more opinions on lighting before spending $$$ based on this articles advice.







				sam				October 8, 2013				Reply


Thanks for the article Jason.
As someone who does quite a bit of product photography I must say it’s perplexing to see you recommending a wide aperture.
Usually the goal with the product photography is for it to be crystal clear and sharp all over. E.g. F8 – F32 range. That’s half the reason to light it artificially too, so that you can have that deep focus and a low ISO for maximum sharpness and zero image noise. After all F/2 (like you recommended) lets in so much light that you’d hardly need two big lights pointing at your product, you could get away with a diffused flash or natural light.
Anyway, that’s my 2 cents.

I personally use Stock.XCHNG has a more complex image licence agreement than some of the competition, though, so read that carefully before you start. 
But here are some product photos for mock ups http://123productphotos.com/free-samples

I have to disagree with the Aperture. I always use f/10 – f/16. What you can do to bring somewhat more detail is shoot two pictures and blend them together (f/2) and (f/16). This will give even more detail and richness.







				Jan Hanus				November 27, 2013				Reply


I agree with Marv. Shooting product photography is not that easy. If you want to get good photos it demands some skills not just in shooting but lighting, Photoshop and so on. If I need good affordable product photos I go to http://123productphotos.com/ and I get clean color accurate images for my clients.







				Alex Choi				January 15, 2014				Reply


I think everyone makes a valid point but it’s all relevant to the degree in which you need the photos.  I’m a graphic designer of almost 2 decades and you simply cannot substitute a reliable, professional product photography service with a quick FPO work.  On numerous occasions, I’ve done what the author describes but not for my final print/online product image.  Although I use Photoshop everyday, I am by no means an expert like my photographer is.  They have color calibrated monitors that help them achieve color correctness that I simply cannot achieve… reliable photographers know how to use their tools of trade.  And I like to leave the tast to the expert.  Like couple of the reviewers above, I use 123 Product Photos… http://www.123productphotos.com.  They’ve been very reliable and cost effective for my design shop.  We ship the products we need photographed and in a few days, we have high-resolution images that we can use for our clients.

I am a professional product photographer and I am currently writing a book on this subject. The information above is not at all accurate, Please do not invest in equipment based on its advice. 
It mentions that Jason Lawrence ‘ is a computer scientist, researcher, educator, and entrepreneur, having co-founded Arqspin, a mobile phone-based platform for creating 360 spins. He is also an associate professor in the Computer Science Department at the University of Virginia.’
It does not mention anywhere that he is a product photographer. 
Taking high quality product shots at home is most definitely achievable, but the kit and methods required to do so are based on the type of products your shooting and how big you require the images to be. 
Without getting into too much detail, corrections to the above article:
Do not feel the need to buy Manfrotto tripods. Buy the cheapest tripod that will hold your camera steady. 20 bucks might well do the job, instead of $150. Your not shooting in a hurricane, in your home, keeping the kids from knocking the camera over will more likely be the issue. Even an expensive manfrotto can’t overcome stuff like that!
USE THE SMALLEST APERTURE AT YOUR DISPOSAL!
On a camera phone, this does generally not apply (it probably will soon enough though), this is to achieve MAXIMUM DETAIL throughout the image. Focus 1/3rd the way into your product and shoot it at maximum aperture and you have the most detailed shot you can get of it. FACT!
Technical reasons make this happen, but its the same with every camera, every lens and every product, so make sure to do it!
Lighting: Goodness, if only it was so simple!
Lighting your product depends on your product. I have lit literally hundreds of thousands of shots and believe me, lighting can come from any and every angle. 
I would love to be able to explain all about product photography in eight simple points, but it is taking me a long, illustrated book to do so. As there are may products, there are in turn, many ways to shoot them.  
Jason, I applaud you trying to help retailers get their images online, but next time please consult a subject matter expert before throwing in some expensive brands, bad information and leading people in the wrong direction.







				John				March 9, 2014				Reply


Going to disagree on the f-stop. F10 would be my recommendation if you want the details of the product preserved. Small f-stops are for arty shots and blur effects (bokeh). Otherwise good advice.







				Jeff Delacruz				May 29, 2014				Reply


Hey Jason,
I think the article is great! I don’t nessesarily agree with everything (ie using continuous light, fstop), but what I do think is  that most people would get pretty good shot from this and would definitely learn something. 
I think some people have been a little heavy handed here but I appreciate what your doing.
Thanks

I found it interesting that you start out talking about DSLR cameras then switch to smartphone cameras.  There’s a HUGE world in between!  There’s are a ton of mid-range cameras that produce amazing images (compared to smartphones) but are WAY cheaper than a SLR.  A 12-mpx zoom camera will smoke a smartphone in image quality and-especially- zoom capability… and cost in the mid-$300 range.  These cameras have the advantage of having REAL apertures, OPTICAL (not digital) zoom and shutter control. so you can play with them and learn the relationship.  This is very important if you want to be serious about photographing.  Smartphone cameras are not designed for professional photographs, although I agree their quality has gone up dramatically.
Also, all of the technology going into smartphone lenses/image software will obviously go into cameras too, so a good camera is a worthy investment for much less $.  The only advantage I can see for a smartphone is the potential for photo-editing apps that you can use in real-time… but then, on that tiny screen, I’d say that might be a risk if you really care about your images!
Anyway, for those with a more limited budget who really truly want to learn to photograph… get a midrange camera! Just my 2 cents :)

Dear Jason;
My name is Safak and I am living istanbul turkey.  I have been searching for building a home based prodcut photography studio. I have two questions. If you answer me, I would be appreciated.
My first question is about the strobe power. I am planning to but an elinchrom strobe kit.  But I don’t know  how much power do I need.
I am gonna shoot prodcut photographs and still life photographys. There is a 500watt kit .  elincyhrom BRx 500.  Is it too much for me?  Please advice me.
And my second question is about the aperture. I read your article  and you are talking about suing wide aperture is better.  But on the other hand,  if you apply narrow aperture, then you get more depth of field. and it means you have bigger focused area in your pictures. Am I right?
let’s pretent, I wanna shoot a wrist watch with my 105mm macro lens . And I need the whole face of this watch to be sharp. If I use a wide aperture, then I could get sharpness on only a part of the face. right?  So it would be bad for me.
can you explain me this?
I am waitng your reply
thank you
Safak

				robert				May 19, 2015				Reply


Elinchrom D-Lite 4 Kit is rather pricey.You have any hints on what I can gather up at home or cheap prices to make a studio for taking product pics for a online store site I,am starting. I have outta my cameras… a Samsung nx1000 which may fit the purpose.i assume the lighting  home made setup is the most concern . whats your suggestion as I,am pretty good on making things outta stuff one thinks is no good for anything. macgyver I guess I,ll await your reply thank you Robert.







				Spinthiras Media				October 27, 2015				Reply


Great tutorial! It’s true that the right lighting and perfect click will surely going improve your online store’s look and performance.







				Jenah				November 29, 2015				Reply


So for this exact kind of set up….using the soft light boxes, white craft paper, and setting it in or close to natural light…there’s a lot of light to work with. What settings would I set my camera on? Would auto work? I’m totally confused. I have a Canon Rebel EOS. Thanks! :) I also have an Etsy shop and take product photos of vintage t shirts. I’m having the hardest time getting my photos to look clear when they’re blown up (like if you have a touchscreen computer or an ipad and you want to blow them up for more detail.) They look clear in the small photos and blurry  in the large ones. I’ve tried everything and it’s  driving me CRAZY! I’m a vintage buyer and otherwise artist, but NOT a professional photographer, which so often is almost required of being a successful Etsy seller. Help! http://jmsvintagets.etsy.com

Great little tutorial for product shots, thank you for sharing. If I had to be picky, rule 5 shouldn’t be a rule at all as only certain types of product pics benefit from bokeh. The rule is completely backwards for most of my product shots.







				Robert				May 15, 2016				Reply


Sir.
Is there any room in the market for any more Placement  photographs   ?







				Jessica				June 12, 2016				Reply


Hey, I agree with your quick tutorial here and the other commenters who think you’re a hack.  The commenters obviously have not been trolling the bargain basements of blurry flash-photo ebay.  I totally get what you’re trying to go for, and I think your advice is GREAT for the true photo hacks who clutter my ebay screen with unintelligible images.  I’ve got a professional-enough setup myself now for, like, I’m thinking ten bucks with a free tripod.  It looks exactly like yours without the lamps (I love sunlight and refuse to do any kind of color balancing).  And I have an art (painting) degree, and college coursework in photo.  Nice work.







				Rosalind				September 26, 2016				Reply


Thank you so much I appreciate the fact that you took the time to help a person trying to make it work. I am new at all of this and your comments have helped me greatly. I didn’t have a clue as to what kind of camera to buy someone told me to buy a D90 and get a lens that’s from 18 to 200.  what that meant I had no clue. you helped me greatly thank you so very much I left my email if you want to drop any other comments. be blessed thank you so much I appreciate

To be honest, If you want to get more sells and CTR then you have to optimize your product image. If you optimize properly your product image you will definitely get better sells. any clipping path experts could help you for them. Thanks a lot for sharing your nice content.
Search on Google clipping path experts or photoshop clipping path experts then they will help you to optimize your product photography.

5.0 out of 5 starsThis book is a real helpByMaxon August 23, 200730 years after taking Geometry in High School, I started back to college recently to get my degree. Problem: I had forgotten almost everything I had learned 30 years ago, and not only that, but 30 years ago I hadn't really paid much attention and didn't learn the material well anyway. I discovered this book "Geometry the easy way" and it has been excellent. It is extremely well-written and the subject is made simple for almost anyone who desires to learn Geometry, including High School students. Obviously, Mr. Leff knows his subject well, and knows how to explain it the best way possible. I give it my highest recommendation, and I almost never write these reviews, so that's saying a lot from me.BTW, I tried "Algebra the Easy Way" and was extremely disappointed. I thought that book was terrible because it tried to tell a fictional story along with the material as a way of making it simpler, but it failed miserably with this tactic, at least with me.

After she began using this guide she has soared to an 'A' in the class and brags about how this book has been a lifesaver for her.  I love these tools, too and believe in them.0Comment|

There was a problem loading comments right now. Please try again later.4.0 out of 5 starsGeometry reviewByOmar L. Hacallaron November 24, 2008Format: Paperback|Verified PurchaseThis book primarily covers plane geometry which is the bulk of a traditional geometry course. Books back in the day, covered more with dihedral angles, and proofs in 3-dimensions. This book covers the essence. Proofs that range from 8 to 13 to 14 steps as I encountered. I like the examples, and the problems are not directly the same, so they dont exactly regurgitate and to me that is learning. Congruent triangles, proving a quadrilateral is a parallelogram, rhombus, so forth is covered extensively, each chapter has exercises at the end of the chapter with review problems. Theres only solid geometry on spheres, cylinders, cubes, and prisms.They ask you to calculate the surface area and volume. There is also calculations on the volume of a cone. They dont however go into calculating surface area, lateral area of cones, or composite figures hemispheres attached to cylinders, or areas of pyramids inscribed in cones, or area of a circus tent, story problems (cylinders attached to cones) Thats my major gripe Im very fastidious for education and a consumer, I give this book 4 stars, not 5 if this was added I would have given great study tool, better exercises than watered down books. This is not even a text book, thats what makes it so unique. A student will succeed from most geometry books with this book, ample examples. I guarantee it. You have to put the time in though and understand the material not just memorize, you have to apply the concepts, investigate, analyze, and use reasoning. Now thats critical thinking and true learning.0Comment|

Please try again later.5.0 out of 5 starsSuperb plane geometry primer for children's self-studyByA customeron January 4, 1999Format: Paperback|Verified PurchaseEasy to follow, logical, and methodical exposition of elementary classical plane geometry.  Every term and concept is defined; therefore, it presupposes absolutely no prior knowledge (of either geometry or algebra).  Yet, after four chapters it is possible for a child to knowledgeably  explain Euclid's Fifth Postulate.  The beauty of forms and patterns, the  triumph of solving seemingly insoluble problems, the revelation of the  power of logical thinking -- all serve to captivate my 9 year old  daughter's attention.  Most highly recommended for anyone who wishes to  provide the means for a child to do his/her best original thinking.  No  cartoons, no shoot-em-up diversions, only the austere beaty of logic in an  assimilable format for children.  Every child in America should have the  opportunity to go through this book with his/her parents. And every parent  should have the oportunity of direct participation in the intellectual  voyage of discovery of his/her child that this book affords.0Comment|

The Barron's Easy Way series is swiftly becoming a source of choice when I need to refresh myself on a subject.  It has been so long since I used Geometry regularly that I easily confuse formulae for area, angle measure, etc., for polygons n=5 or above.  It is very helpful to have a ready reference to hone my skills after such a long respite.0Comment|Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuseCommentInsert product linkPaste the product's web address below:Product not found.

Can a breakthrough new supplement bring your erections to their maximum hardness?
Adult Star's Secret To 
                    Keeping It Up At Any Age... 
 


Dear Friend,
I have a question for you.
It's about hardness. Think about how hard you were able to get in your younger years. Not when you were in your 30's, but even before then. When you were in your 20's and able to get it up no matter what. Now tell me

By John Lawrence
                          
                        Professional Adult Star and Creator of PHGH




How much better was sex for you at that time? 


How much more enjoyable was it for you without the stress of not being able to get it up?


And.. how much better was your relationship knowing you could give your girl the assurance that she's the one of you? 


If you are like most men, you would probably say the sex you would have with a full, hard erection.. at full arousal would be...
The Best Sex You Could Ever Possible Have..
Now I want you to put that thought aside and consider the type of sex adult stars are able to have on set.
As you know, there's a lot of pressure on set when male stars are required to keep it up on set the entire time. 
Do you think this is natural? Sure they have some natural ability, but I can tell you.. that natural ability quickly fades. 
What many adult stars don't want you to know is that they "DO NOT" natually keep it up on set. They use supplements to do it and here I would like to tell you how it's done and how you can do it just like they do -  with your maximum, full erection that makes sex better than you've   						ever had before... right now, today.
My name is John Lawrence. You may know me as an a male pornstar who's starred in over 100 films. Here, I'm going to reveal the secret that allowed me to do it... and if you're serious about getting bigger, harder erections that make women CRAZY for you...regardless  of your size or even if you can't get it up, then this may be the most important letter you ever read...                  
The reason I created PHGH was because the "other"  pills stopped working for me. 
This was a very hard time for me because I so desparately needed something to keep me performing at my best in my adult career. 
 During that time I researched hundreds of different  ingredients and other male enhancement formulas in an attempt to figure out something that would work for me. 
What I discovered was shocking.
What I found was most male enhancement pills are severely  lacking in the key components that make them effective.
And today I want to share with you those very things to make sure you don't get ripped off by a low quality supplement. 
 Here are a few of the serious problems many male enhancement products have: 


Many supplements are completely devoid of any  ingredients that actually work.
 
Others contain ingredients in such minuscule  amounts they are useless.  Often the  quantity listed on their label is much higher than the amount actually in the  capsule.


Some illegally contain elements of pharmaceutical  drugs, unknown to the user.


Many use only powdered versions of certain  ingredients instead of using extracts, which is the only way to  provide enough of the active elements to actually work.


Even the supplements which claim to contain  extracts often use invalid extraction processes, which render the active  ingredients essentially useless.


Many other supplements do NOT employ a testing  lab to verify the chemical composition of their products, and the manufacturers  often have no idea what their capsules contain.


Every supplement contains binders and fillers (called excipients), but  many of my competitors use potentially harmful excipients, such as: Methyl  paraben, Microcrystalline cellulose, Methacrylic copolymer, corn starch, or  Talcum powder.
Other products use unreliable suppliers who have no quality  control procedures in place.


In many cases, my competitors use only ONE active  ingredient to remedy men's sexual health.   In fact, there are 5 active ingredients which help in this matter, and  because all men respond differently to each compound, it is ESSENTIAL to use all five ingredients.


When  I became aware that most other manufacturers routinely used these unscrupulous  practices, I decided to take no shortcuts and develop a pure and  untainted formula. 
I wanted a premium product and I would use only the highest standards of quality at every  level.  As soon as I made this  decision, I knew it would be a huge undertaking.  I also knew it would be much more expensive  to produce a higher quality product.  
But my  personal experience with not being able to perform had given me  insight into just how significant the problem is.  In fact, there's not a word in the dictionary  which truly captures the feeling of helplessness in that situation or how  desperately I wanted to find a solution.
You see, I  created PHGH because other products were just not working for me.  And I desperately needed something to  work!  So I made it my personal priority  that my formula would ensure the highest-quality product on the  market.  I genuinely wanted to help other  men who were going through the miserable experience I had gone through.
Why  PHGH is the most effective and highest-quality product on the market:
1) PHGH uses only ingredients that come from their  native regions.  I personally developed  close and lasting relationships with Chinese herbalists and with tribesmen in  Indonesia to ensure I was getting the highest quality Epimedium and Tongkat Ali straight from the source.  I still  rely on these men for my raw ingredients.   I follow this same procedure for every ingredient in my unique  formula.
2) There are five herbal compounds which help to maximize men's sexual  health.  These are ALL included in  the formula for PHGH, but most other supplements use only one, or maybe two at  most.  What is crucial to understand is  that these five compounds must all work together to achieve maximum  results.
DO  NOT BUY ANY SUPPLEMENT LACKING EVEN ONE OF THE FOLLOWING FIVEINGREDIENTS:


Tribulus Terrestris - a potent  herb which serves to instigate the production of testosterone, a crucial  chemical in terms of the male sex drive itself.                  


Arginine - an amino acid which BOOSTS the level of nitric  oxide in your blood.  When your nitric  oxide levels are higher, your blood vessels are more relaxed…and consequently blood  flows more freely to the right places.


Tongkat Ali - this herb has been used by tribesmen in  Indonesia for centuries to boost testosterone and to stimulate dopamine  production in the brain which, in turn, boosts libido.                  


Epimedium (aka Horny Goat Weed) - an ancient Chinese  herb which also helps to open up blood vessels and maximize blood-flow directly  to where it's needed.


Maca - another rare folk medicine which increases  volume of semen as well as sperm count, and also contributes to increased  libido.                  


You see, there  are actually quite a few conditions that contribute to male sexual  difficulties, and it's often difficult to pinpoint the exact cause.  The compounds in these herbs each target  different systems in our bodies.  For  that reason, an effective male supplement must contain all FIVE of  the above ingredients.  PHGH  is made with all five. 
3) I have also developed quite a close relationship with the lab that  manufactures, tests, and analyzes my product.   The bio-chemists at this lab have several duties regarding PHGH:


They test and verify that the herbal extracts do, in fact, consist of  the chemical compounds they're supposed to contain: the ACTIVE  components that increase libido & accelerate blood-flow.


They test and confirm that the milligram amount of the ingredients  listed on the label of PHGH corresponds exactly to the actual milligram  amount contained in each capsule.


Once the chemical composition is confirmed, they manufacture the  capsules using ONLY binding agents or fillers that DO NOT contain any impurities  or possible carcinogens. 


WARNING!  Never Buy Any Supplement Containing The Following Binders or Fillers:




Methyl paraben 


Microcrystalline  cellulose 


Methacrylic  copolymer 





Corn Starch 


Talcum Powder




When I began  to shop around for labs to test my first "homemade" batches of PHGH,  I encountered several lab managers who immediately started trying to convince  me to use some of these cheaper fillers.   They said it was standard in the industry, insisting that the actual  "quality" of the supplement was of very little concern.  They stressed over and over that only the  "marketing" mattered.  It turns  out that most other products do use these potentially dangerous fillers.
These same lab  managers also tried to pitch me on yet another proposition: they suggested  adding a few milligrams of the little blue pharmaceutical pill to my  formula.  Now, I knew this was ILLEGAL,  but more importantly I knew it was extremely dangerous to combine this drug  with other medications.  These  laboratory managers also knew this, of course, but they insisted it was a very  common practice and that there was no way to get "caught."
I rejected  these unscrupulous offers and walked out of those labs right away.  I kept searching until I finally found a  laboratory with not only high standards of quality control and scientific  rigor, but a high degree of integrity as well.  I knew I could trust these men.   When we made the agreement to start production, I added two clauses that  were non-negotiable: 
1) PHGH  will never use any cheap or possibly dangerous fillers to cut costs.
2) The formula  must remain exactly as I created it, and illegal drugs shall NEVER be  used under any conditions.

The PHGH Mission: 

                    Our  #1 Priority Is Helping Men Take Their Libidos To Their Highest Level, Giving Them Full, Hard Erections,  at Any Age.
Finally, I'd  like to mention a feature of PHGH that I often neglect due to my emphasis on  the five essential active ingredients in the formula such as Tribulus or Epimedium.
One of the  additional elements is a naturally occurring chemical called Piperine.  Now, this is an alkaloid compound which, by  itself, has no direct connection to the male sex drive.  However, Piperine has been found to  inhibit drug metabolism and increase the availability of various other  compounds.  
It sounds  complex, but simply: Piperine makes other chemicals work better in  your body.  
That's the  reason I included it in the formula…because it enhances and maximizes the work  that the other active ingredients are doing to open blood vessels and  stimulate certain hormones in your brain.
I'm confident  that all the effort has paid off.  I  truly believe I have created the highest-quality and most effective male  enhancement supplement yet.  I did it  without cutting corners and I kept ONE THING first and foremost in my mind: helping men have better lives.
If there is  any reason whatsoever that you feel dissatisfied with your order within the  first full month, you can rest secure and trust in my 100% Money-Back  Guarantee.  There will be no  questions asked and no hassel. 
I have personally gone through the fear of failure that accompanies not being able to perform, and I've experienced the humiliation and damage to my self-esteem it creates.  But there is one thing I can say to you with certainty: There's hope for the future...for a satisfying and even amazing sex life.
But don't just  take my word for it.  One bottle of PHGH can start the transformation that will radically transform your  libido.  You've got nothing to lose  except your fear of failure, but you've got everything to gain by giving  it a shot: quite possibly the BEST SEX of your life. 
Sincerely,
John Lawrence
Other  companies use wild claims…I will never make claims above what I know this  product can do.

 World renowned pediatricians T. Berry Brazelton and Joshua Sparrow see discipline as a parent s gift to a child. By following the doctors unique approach, which emphasizes teaching over punishment, parents will find effective solutions for common behavior problems. Not only will parents feel more confident and at ease but they will also experience the joy of raising children who learn to discipline themselves. The vital advice covers six stages of discipline, the power of consequences, ways to encourage moral development and empathy, dealing with misbehavior (from biting and fighting to cheating, lying and using foul language), and special disciplinary challenges (including academic pressure, illness, and digital technology)."

Johnsonon May 11, 2016Format: Paperback|Verified PurchaseDr. Brazelton was actively involved in the raising of our children 40+ years ago.  We met with him frequently, especially about sibling rivalry.  His methods worked then, and I am sure the recent revisions of his books have resulted in complete relevance for the new generation of children.  He is one of the most loving and caring people I have known.Read more0Comment|

I have been lost in this life. Too often Ive ridden down the wrong trail--sometimes because I didnt know better but occasionally even when I did.One day a surprising thing happened. Without knowing why, I sat down and wrote the first draft of Dusty and the Cowboy. It wasnt until this story of the cowboy and his horse was recorded as an audio track that I figured it out.Dusty and the Cowboy launches me on my Christian walk.

Publisher's Description▼▲
’A thoroughly biblical and practical survival manual for anyone who has faced life’s worst. This book is salve for the deepest wounds.’--Stan Toler, bestselling author, pastor, and speaker’A resounding message of hope for those who are dealing with loss, failure, rejection, or abuse. The authors apply God’s deepest truths to life’s deepest hurts.’--Jo Anne Lyon, Executive Director, World Hope InternationalNo matter what you have suffered, God can heal your broken heart.Perhaps it’s a divorce. Or, maybe you’ve suffered the loss of a child or the loss of a job. No one expects to suffer these heartaches when they’re dreaming about the future and thinking about the way that life will turn out. No one prepares to face the devastations that life can visit upon us. Life’s trials can leave us disillusioned, angry at God, and questioning our faith. In their book, Jerry Brecheisen and Lawrence W. Wilson walk you through your difficult experiences and disappointments, bringing you to the point of healing--the place where God brings redemption to suffering.

            It's so hard to find an author that actually meets you where you are, spends time with you where you're hurting because he knows what it feels like and actually offers relevant compassion and advice. Lawrence Wilson does this in this book. I'm grateful.

Author/Artist Review▼▲
Author: Lawrence W. WilsonLocated in: Anderson, INSubmitted: January   29, 2004    Who are your influences, sources of inspiration or favorite authors / artists?  After about 40 years of living, I began to notice 
that my life hasnt turned out quite the way I 
planned. I thought Id be rich, or at least 
handsome, incredibly successful and deliriously 
happy all the time.
Isnt that what we all expected?
On top of being thoroughly average, Ive 
experienced some of the worse things life has to 
offer. Ive lived with chronic arthritis for more than 25 years and have had 
surgery to replace all the major joints in my 
body. My wife and I have three wonderful kidsbut 
one of them went to heaven after only five months 
on earth.
None of this was supposed to happen to me. My 
life was going to be different.
Life seldom turns out exactly as planned, and 
most of us have experienced some form of trauma. 
From sexual abuse to chronic illness to betrayal 
to failure to grief, nearly everyone has had some 
reason to say This isnt the life I had in mind.
Thats why Jerry Brecheisen and I teamed up to 
write When Life Doesnt Turn Out the Way You 
Expect. Between his brain tumor (removed) and my 
prostheses (implanted) we know something about 
navigating unexpected twists in the road of life. 
And based on our more than 40 years of pastoral 
experience, weve identified some insights from 
Gods Word for those who suffer.
But the book isnt about us.
The heroes of our story are the nine real men and 
women who have shared theirs tales of trauma and 
recovery. Weve spoken to average people who have 
learned how to overcome sexual abuse, forgive an 
unfaithful spouse, face each day with chronic 
pain, and rise above moral and professional 
failure.
To a person, they offer the same affirmation: God 
can heal your broken heart.

    Anything else you'd like readers / listeners to know:  No matter who you are or what you have suffered, 
God can heal your broken heart.
