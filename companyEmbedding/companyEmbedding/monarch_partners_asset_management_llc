About the Monarch Butterfly
        The Monarch butterfly is a milkweed butterfly, in the family Nymphalidae. It is perhaps the best known of all North American butterflies. Since the 19th century, it has been found in New Zealand, and in Australia since 1871 where it is called the Wanderer. In Europe it is resident in the Canary Islands, the Azores, and Madeira, and is found as an occasional migrant in Western Europe. Its wings feature an easily recognizable orange and black pattern, with a wingspan of 3½–4 inches. The Viceroy butterfly has a similar size, color, and pattern, but can be distinguished by an extra black stripe across the hind wing. Female Monarchs have darker veins on their wings, and the males have a spot called the "androconium" in the center of each hind wing from which pheromones are released. Males are also slightly larger.  The Monarch is famous for its southward migration and northward return in summer in the Americas which spans the life of three to four generations of the butterfly.
-From Wikipedia, December 2010.  
	 

Why the Name Monarch Partners Asset Management?
        “I chose the name Monarch for a very special reason.  My Mother passed away many years ago at a very young age,and before she died, she told me that she would someday come back as a butterfly.  Because of this, butterflies have been a big part of my life, and I have always been enamored with the Monarch.”
        - Wayne J. Archambo, CFA

Our Investment Philosophy
    	Monarch Partners’ Investment Philosophy is based on Value Discipline, Focused Internal Research and Risk Aversion.
        
We identify undervalued companies that possess catalysts that will enhance shareholder value.  We avoid value traps.
Our research is performed by a dedicated, experienced research team.  Our bottom up process is 90% fundamental and 10% quantitative.
Risk aversion includes diversification, daily monitoring of portfolio exposures, and a strict sell discipline. 

        Just as important, Monarch Partners has a committed sell discipline.  We sell stocks when:
        
Full value appreciation to target price occurs
Business Fundamentals deteriorate
Identified Catalysts reverse
Downside Risk is assessed daily

        As mentioned above, Risk Aversion is a main tenet of our Investment Philosophy.  Risk Aversion to Monarch Partners means:
		
Diversification (25-90 stocks, depending upon the strategy)
Maximum position size of less than 10% of the outstanding shares of a portfolio company
Sector weightings at +/- 10 percentage points of the respective Russell Index            

Example - If consumer Discretionary is 12% of the index, Monarch can allocate between 2% & 22%

Minimal cash

Analyst Ratings
Consensus Ratings for Casella Waste Systems (NASDAQ:CWST) (How are Consensus Ratings Calculated?) MarketBeat calculates consensus ratings using the most recent rating from each brokerage that has rated a stock within the last twelve months. Since brokers often use different ratings systems, each rating is normalized to a standardized rating score of 1 (sell), 2 (hold), 3 (buy) or 4 (strong buy). Consensus ratings scores are calculated using the mean average of the number of normalized sell, hold, buy and strong buy ratings. Each stock's consensus rating is derived from its calculated consensus ratings score (0-1.5 = Sell, 1.5-2.5 = Hold, 2.5-3.5 = Buy, >3.5 = Strong Buy). MarketBeat's consensus price targets are a mean average of the most recent available price targets set by each analyst that has set a price target for the stock in the last twelve months.MarketBeat will no longer include ratings and price target data in its consensus calculation if a broker drops coverage and MarketBeat has received a report that coverage was dropped. Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.Ratings Breakdown: 2 Hold Ratings, 4 Buy RatingsConsensus Rating:Buy (Score: 2.67)Consensus Price Target: $15.33 (9.96% downside)

A smart product management hub for retailthat streamlines digital content and data sharing






 





















Our mission
 
We have made it our mission to provide brands and retailers simple and affordable tools that tackle many challenges in digital product management and distribution by:













Solving the practical challenge of organizing, sourcing, and sharing product content.









Giving brands and retailers access to a whole new level of detailed ecommerce data and analytics
















Take control of your products with Plytix
 









Our Story
 
The idea for Plytix evolved from our time at Google, when we were working with some of the biggest companies in the e-commerce space. At the time, technology allowed tracking user behaviour on individual websites, but we wanted to give brands and retailers access to a whole new level of detailed data, bringing them a better understanding of their products through 3rd party product analytics. 
 
Since then Plytix has evolved into an end-to-end product management eco-system where brands and retailers can organize, analyze, and share product content and performance in a user-friendly and efficient way without breaking the bank. 
 




























Our Team
 
We're a diverse, international team passionate about creating extraordinary client experiences and serious about revolutionizing e-commerce. We are growing rapidly and we're always on the look out for smart, driven people to join our team.

About the Monarch Butterfly
        The Monarch butterfly is a milkweed butterfly, in the family Nymphalidae. It is perhaps the best known of all North American butterflies. Since the 19th century, it has been found in New Zealand, and in Australia since 1871 where it is called the Wanderer. In Europe it is resident in the Canary Islands, the Azores, and Madeira, and is found as an occasional migrant in Western Europe. Its wings feature an easily recognizable orange and black pattern, with a wingspan of 3½–4 inches. The Viceroy butterfly has a similar size, color, and pattern, but can be distinguished by an extra black stripe across the hind wing. Female Monarchs have darker veins on their wings, and the males have a spot called the "androconium" in the center of each hind wing from which pheromones are released. Males are also slightly larger.  The Monarch is famous for its southward migration and northward return in summer in the Americas which spans the life of three to four generations of the butterfly.
-From Wikipedia, December 2010.  
	 

Why the Name Monarch Partners Asset Management?
        “I chose the name Monarch for a very special reason.  My Mother passed away many years ago at a very young age,and before she died, she told me that she would someday come back as a butterfly.  Because of this, butterflies have been a big part of my life, and I have always been enamored with the Monarch.”
        - Wayne J. Archambo, CFA
