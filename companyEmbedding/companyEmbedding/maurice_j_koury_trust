AGREEMENT

This Agreement (the
“ Agreement ”) is entered into this 18
th
day of
August, 2008, by and between Cape Fear Bank Corporation, a
North Carolina corporation (the “ Company ”),
and Cape Fear Bank, a North Carolina chartered bank (the “
Bank ” and, together with the Company, the “
Company Parties ”), on the one hand, and each of The
Maurice and Ann Koury Charitable Trust, The Maurice J. Koury
Foundation, Maurice J. Koury, Scott C. Sullivan, Miltom E. Petty,
Mort Neblett, Haywood Cochrane, Jr., James S. Mahan III, David
Lucht and Robert Isser (each, a “ Shareholder Group
Member ” and, collectively, the “ Shareholder
Group ”), on the other hand (collectively, the “
Parties ”). For purposes of this Agreement, the
Shareholder Group shall also include all parties to the Schedule
13D with respect to Company common stock of any or all members of
the Shareholder Group, as now or hereinafter filed with the SEC
(“ Schedule 13D ”).

RECITALS

WHEREAS , the Parties desire to set forth certain
covenants and agreements to resolve their respective views
regarding various matters as to the Company, including the
composition of the Company’s Board of Directors (the “
Board ”); and

WHEREAS , the Parties have agreed that Walter Lee
Crouch, Jr., Becky Parker O’Daniell, Craig S. Relan, Walter
O. Winter, Scott C. Sullivan, Mort Neblett, James S. Mahan III,
David Lucht and one independent director nominee selected as set
forth herein shall be appointed to the Board.

NOW, THEREFORE
, in consideration for the covenants
and other agreements contained herein, and for other good and
valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which is
hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto hereby agree as
follows:

1. Board and Annual Meeting
Matters . The Parties covenant and agree that:

(a) On the date hereof, the Company
shall take all actions necessary to postpone the 2008 annual
meeting of shareholders of the Company (the “ 2008 Annual
Meeting ”).

(b) As promptly as practicable, but
no later than the first business day after the date of this
Agreement, the Board shall duly convene and hold a meeting of the
Board and at such meeting (i) the Board shall fix the number
of directors at eight to reflect the reconstitution of the Board as
provided herein, (ii) the Board shall appoint Scott C.
Sullivan, Mort Neblett, James S. Mahan III and David Lucht
(collectively, the “ Shareholder Nominees ”) to
the Board, with Walter Lee Crouch, Jr. to serve as the Chairman of
the Board, and (iii) the Board shall accept the resignations
described in Section 1(h) of each of the current
directors not forming a part of the New Board (as defined
below).

(c) The newly constituted Board
(the “ New Board ”), consisting of the
Shareholder Nominees and the four incumbent directors, Walter Lee
Crouch, Jr., Becky Parker O’Daniell, Craig S. Relan and
Walter O. Winter (the “ Incumbent Nominees ”)
shall



form a special committee of the Board comprised
of two of the Shareholder Nominees and two of the Incumbent
Nominees to identify and select a ninth independent member of the
Board (the “ Selection Committee ”). The
Selection Committee shall act in good faith to select a qualified
independent director nominee (the “ Independent
Nominee ”) to serve as the ninth member of the Board as
soon as practical. The Selection Committee shall first solicit
recommendations from River Oaks Capital LLC and Banc Funds Company,
L.L.C., two of the Company’s institutional shareholders.
After receiving such recommendations, the Selection Committee may
solicit recommendations from outside advisors (including
Hunton & Williams LLP, Hogan & Hartson LLP and
Ward & Smith, P.A.) or other sources in the sole
discretion of the Selection Committee. The Selection Committee
shall give preference to residents of the state of North Carolina.
The selection of the Independent Nominee by a majority or unanimous
vote of the Selection Committee shall be final and binding on all
Parties. Upon such selection by the Selection Committee and
agreement by the Independent Nominee, the New Board shall appoint
the Independent Nominee to the Board.

(d) The New Board shall be
responsible for determining the date of the postponed 2008 Annual
Meeting and the New Board shall recommend and nominate the
Shareholder Nominees, the Incumbent Nominees and the Independent
Nominee, if one has been selected (collectively, the “
Combined Slate ”), to stand for election at the 2008
Annual Meeting.

(e) In the event that the
Independent Nominee is included in the Combined Slate to stand for
election at the 2008 Annual Meeting, the Board shall be classified
as follows: (i) Walter Lee Crouch, Jr., Becky Parker
O’Daniell and Scott C. Sullivan shall be nominated as Class I
directors with terms expiring in 2009; (ii) Craig S. Relan,
Mort Neblett and James S. Mahan III shall be nominated as Class II
directors with terms expiring in 2010; and (iii) Walter O.
Winter, David Lucht and the Independent Nominee shall be nominated
as Class III directors with terms expiring in 2011.

(f) The board of directors of the
Bank (the “ Bank Board ”) shall be comprised of
the same individuals that comprise the Board. James S. Mahan III
shall be appointed to serve as Chairman of the Bank
Board.

(g) To the extent practicable and
consistent with Nasdaq and SEC rules, each committee of each of the
Board and the Bank Board shall have a equal number of Shareholder
Nominees and Incumbent Nominees. Neither the Board nor the Bank
Board shall form an executive committee without the approval of at
least two-thirds of their respective directors.

(h) No later than the date on which
the New Board is appointed, each of the current directors of each
of the Company and the Bank not forming a part of the Combined
Slate shall submit his or her respective irrevocable resignation
from the Board and the Bank Board, in each case effective
immediately prior to the effectiveness of the appointment of the
Shareholder Nominees.

(i) Until the third anniversary of
the date of this Agreement (i) the number of Continuing
Shareholder Group Directors and Continuing Incumbent Directors
(each as defined below in this Section 1(i) ) serving
on the Board shall be maintained at four and four, respectively,
(ii) all vacancies on the Board created by the cessation of
service of a Continuing Shareholder Group Director for any reason
shall be filled by a nominee designated to the Board by a committee
of the Board constituted solely of the Continuing Shareholder Group
Directors (the “ Continuing Shareholder Group Directors
Committee ”), and (iii) all vacancies on the Board
created by the cessation of service of a Continuing Incumbent
Director for any reason shall be filled by a nominee designated to
the Board by a committee of the Board constituted solely of the
Continuing Incumbent Directors (the “ Continuing Incumbent
Committee ”). The terms “ Continuing Shareholder
Group Directors ” and “ Continuing Incumbent
Directors ” shall for purposes of this Agreement mean,
respectively, the Shareholder Nominees or Incumbent Nominees, as
the case may be, who were appointed or designated to serve as
directors of the Company pursuant to this Agreement, and any other
directors of the Company who take office after the date hereof and
prior to the third anniversary of the date hereof who are nominated
or designated to the Board by the Continuing Shareholder Group
Directors Committee or the Continuing Incumbent Directors
Committee, as the case may be.

(j) The Board shall nominate and
recommend for election at the 2008, 2009, 2010 and 2011 annual

the Shareholder Group with the SEC, (b) this Agreement and the
settlement negotiations which preceded this Agreement, and
(c) SEC filings made by the Shareholder Group with respect to
ownership of Company common stock; provided , however
, that such reimbursement shall not exceed Five Hundred Thousand
Dollars ($500,000) in the aggregate. Such invoices need not include
any detail that may be deemed to waive the attorney-client
privilege between Mr. Koury and his counsel. In accordance
with the foregoing, the Company shall promptly, but in no event
later than five (5) business days after his request for
reimbursement is made to the Company, reimburse Mr. Koury for
such fees and expenses.

3. Covenants of the Shareholder
Group . Each Shareholder Group Member covenants and agrees
that, in reliance on the covenants and agreements of the Company
Parties set forth herein:

(a) such Shareholder Group Member
will support the election of the Combined Slate, agree to vote all
shares beneficially owned by them in favor of the Combined Slate,
and agree to refrain from taking any action inconsistent with the
foregoing, in each case, at the Annual Meetings.

(b) such Shareholder Group Member
will not solicit authority, directly or indirectly, from any
shareholder of the Company to elect or vote for any candidate or
candidates for election to the Board at the Annual Meetings other
than the Combined Slate or otherwise present for consideration to
any shareholder of the Company in connection with the Annual
Meetings any candidates other than the Combined Slate (except as
may be modified pursuant to Section 1(i) hereof) or any
proposal for any action (other than the ratification of the
Company’s independent auditors), nor will such Shareholder
Group Member engage in any campaign or efforts to have votes
withheld from or otherwise campaign against any of the Combined
Slate (except as may be modified pursuant to Section 1(i)
hereof) in connection with the Annual Meetings.

(c) from the date hereof through and
including the date that is one year after the date hereof, such
Shareholder Group Member will not form, join or in any way

When an agreement is made without adjudication during an impending lawsuit, a settlement agreement lays out the terms of agreement between the parties. The parties (''Plaintiff'') and (''Defendant'') will come to an agreement on how they will cease the actions of the lawsuit.Settlement agreements enable opposing parties to bypass a lengthy court process by agreeing to specific terms and conditions which may include relief to plaintiff, method of payment (if any), attorney fees and other incurred costs.These agreements almost always contain confidentiality agreements, wherein the plaintiff of the lawsuit agrees to not disclose any details concerning the nature of the settlement to the press or other individuals.  A settlement agreement may be used in a divorce case or civil lawsuit.
