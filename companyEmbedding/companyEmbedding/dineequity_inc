DineEquity, Inc., formerly known as IHOP Corporation, is an American company that franchises and operates IHOP and Applebee's restaurants. The company is headquartered in Glendale, California, and was founded in 1976 as IHOP until after it acquired Applebee's when it changed its corporate identity.[3] IHOP Corporation announced on July 16, 2007 that it intended to acquire the bar-and-grill chain Applebee's International, Inc. in an all-cash transaction that was valued at approximately US$2.1 billion. Under the deal, IHOP paid $25.50 per share for Applebee's. IHOP stated it would franchise most of Applebee's 500 company-owned stores. In 2015, Applebee's had 2,033 restaurants overall worldwide, all operated by franchisees.[1][4]
Julia Stewart, who originally worked as a waitress at IHOP and worked her way up through the restaurant industry, became Chief Executive Officer of IHOP Corporation. She had previously been President of Applebee’s, but left after being overlooked for that company's CEO position. She became CEO of IHOP in 2001, and returned to manage her old company due to the acquisition. She later stepped down as the CEO in March 2017. [5]
With a larger than 70% vote, Applebee's stockholders approved the takeover, which closed on November 29, 2007. The deal beat 26 other offers to purchase the economically slumping Applebee's. A number of executives from Applebee's voted against the offer. The chain's largest individual shareholder, Applebee's director Burton "Skip" Sack, believed the purchasing price was unfair to the shareholders and planned to take IHOP to court. As part of the purchase, a brand re-marketing scheme and revitalization of the Applebee's image was undertaken.[6]

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion

Data Format: N-Triples RDF

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.


RDF

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)

The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).

DineEquity's Home Page Content

One of the largest full-service dining companies in the world.

DineEquity was created from a foundation established by IHOP® - an American icon
to our guests and a franchising company focused on providing strategic, visionary
leadership for our franchisees, unparalleled opportunities for our team members, and
enhancing value for our shareholders. By bringing Applebee's® together with IHOP
in November 2007, we made a bold, new commitment to our brand-revitalization abilities
and to the power of franchising. DineEquity has successfully made our
two businesses more powerful and more successful than either brand could have been apart.
Our dedicated focus combined with a core expertise in brand revitalization and franchising
know-how is the basis for the winning formula that has defined the financial success of
our business in recent years. As reported by Nation's Restaurant News, Applebee's and IHOP
are the category leaders in casual and family dining.



With more than 3,700 Applebee's and IHOP restaurants in 18 countries and a 99%-franchised system of more
than 400 franchisee partners, DineEquity is one of the largest full-service restaurant companies in the world.










Applebee's

With more than 2,000 restaurants in 50 states, Puerto Rico and 15 other countries
around the world, Applebee's is one of the world's largest Casual Dining brands.
Founded in 1980 in Atlanta, Georgia by Bill and T.J. Palmer, Applebee's offers classic
bar-and-grill menu items featuring higher-quality ingredients and premium preparation techniques,
reasonable prices, and quality service in a neighborhood setting. Today, we are building
upon this heritage and further differentiating Applebee's to maintain the brand's position
at the top of the Casual Dining segment. We expect to generate sustainable same-restaurant-sales
momentum for the Applebee's brand by significantly increasing the effectiveness of Applebee's
marketing efforts, making meaningful improvements to the operational performance of our restaurants,
and continuously introducing fresh, innovative dishes for our guests to enjoy.












IHOP

When Al and Jerry Lapin opened the first International House of Pancakes in Toluca Lake,
California on July 7, 1958, they never dreamed that five decades later the family restaurant
they founded would become the American icon it is today. From humble beginnings, we have grown
to become the leading Family Dining brand with 1,709 IHOP restaurants in 50 states,
the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, Guam and Saipan. Internationally, IHOP has locations in Bahrain, Canada, United Arab Emirates, Guatemala, Kuwait, Mexico, The Philippines, Qatar, Panama and Saudi Arabia. Today,
IHOP is the place where people connect over breakfast, enjoy study breaks, grab a bite before or
after sporting events, and so much more. And no matter what menu items they order, there's one
ingredient that's always constant—a smile. And as the leader in Family Dining, our 99%-franchised
system delivers strong free cash flow results that have been the hallmark of the brand's financial
performance for more than half a century.

DineEquity, Inc., formerly known as IHOP Corporation, is an American company that franchises and operates IHOP and Applebee's restaurants. The company is headquartered in Glendale, California, and was founded in 1976 as IHOP until after it acquired Applebee's when it changed its corporate identity.[3] IHOP Corporation announced on July 16, 2007 that it intended to acquire the bar-and-grill chain Applebee's International, Inc. in an all-cash transaction that was valued at approximately US$2.1 billion. Under the deal, IHOP paid $25.50 per share for Applebee's. IHOP stated it would franchise most of Applebee's 500 company-owned stores. In 2015, Applebee's had 2,033 restaurants overall worldwide, all operated by franchisees.[1][4]
Julia Stewart, who originally worked as a waitress at IHOP and worked her way up through the restaurant industry, became Chief Executive Officer of IHOP Corporation. She had previously been President of Applebee’s, but left after being overlooked for that company's CEO position. She became CEO of IHOP in 2001, and returned to manage her old company due to the acquisition. She later stepped down as the CEO in March 2017. [5]
With a larger than 70% vote, Applebee's stockholders approved the takeover, which closed on November 29, 2007. The deal beat 26 other offers to purchase the economically slumping Applebee's. A number of executives from Applebee's voted against the offer. The chain's largest individual shareholder, Applebee's director Burton "Skip" Sack, believed the purchasing price was unfair to the shareholders and planned to take IHOP to court. As part of the purchase, a brand re-marketing scheme and revitalization of the Applebee's image was undertaken.[6]

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.
