Information Required For Selecting a Camera Link Cable:

Cable length - Considering the placement of the camera relative to the host computer,
              what cable length is required to connect the camera to the frame grabber?
 Frame grabber  connection - Does the frame grabber require a cable with
              an MDR (standard) or SDR (mini) Camera Link connector?
Camera connection - Does the camera require a cable with an MDR (standard) or
              SDR (mini) Camera Link connector?
PoCL - Is a PoCL (Power over Camera Link) cable required?
One or two cables - What does the connection between camera and frame grabber require?


Cable Length:
Camera Link cables are available in lengths of 1, 2, 3, 5, and 10 meters. Custom lengths are available –
            ask for a quote. Longer cables are available. EPIX, Inc. offers a cable with conditioned / amplified signals
            for distances up to 20 meters. Fiber optic Camera Link extenders for spanning distances up to hundreds of meters
            are also available.

Frame Grabber Connection:

            All PIXCI® Camera Link frame grabbers for desktop computers (PIXCI® CL series or PIXCI® E series Camera
            Link boards) require a cable with an MDR (standard) connector. All PIXCI® Camera Link frame
            grabbers for notebook computers (PIXCI® EC series boards), require a cable with an SDR (mini) connector.

Camera Connection:

            Refer to the camera's User Manual to determine the type of connector required.

PoCL Compliant:

            Refer to the camera's User Manual to determine if the camera is PoCL compliant or if it requires an external power supply.
            When ordering a Camera Link cable (or frame grabber) for a PoCL camera, be sure your sales person knows your
            camera is PoCL compliant.

One or Two Cables:

            If the Camera Link camera is base configuration, then only one cable is required. If the camera is Medium, Full, or Extended
            (DECA) configuration, then two cables are required. Look at the back of the camera. How many Camera Link connectors
            are there?

Custom Cables:
Contact EPIX, Inc., or an authorized distributor            of EPIX® imaging products for a quote on your cable requirements.

CAMERA LINK ANNOTATOR
Photonics SpectraMar 2007Ionetrics Inc.Request Info 
        

Ionetrics Inc. has introduced the Annotator CL for stamping Camera Link data streams with precise time tags, a 32-bit frame number and other data. The time stamp can be synchronized to a modulated IRIG-B input with event time accuracy of ±50 μs, and the unit also can operate in free-running mode with maximum time drift of 0.1 ms/h and with a time base set by the host system. Digital and text modes of annotation are supported and can be used together or separately and can be independently disabled or enabled at user-defined positions. Master and slave Camera Link outputs are synchronized to the same output data stream.Visit company websitehttp://www.ionetrics.comAbout this supplier/Company.aspx?CompanyID=16500
