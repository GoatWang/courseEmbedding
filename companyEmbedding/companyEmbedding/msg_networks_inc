P/E Ratio (TTM) The Price to Earnings (P/E) ratio, a key valuation measure, is calculated by dividing the stock's most recent closing price by the sum of the diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the trailing 12 month period.  Earnings Per Share (TTM) A company's net income for the trailing twelve month period expressed as a dollar amount per fully diluted shares outstanding. Market Capitalization Reflects the total market value of a company. Market Cap is calculated by multiplying the number of shares outstanding by the stock's price. For companies with multiple common share classes, market capitalization includes both classes. Shares Outstanding Number of shares that are currently held by investors, including restricted shares owned by the company's officers and insiders as well as those held by the public. Public Float The number of shares in the hands of public investors and available to trade. To calculate, start with total shares outstanding and subtract the number of restricted shares. Restricted stock typically is that issued to company insiders with limits on when it may be traded. Dividend Yield A company's dividend expressed as a percentage of its current stock price.

Money Flow Uptick/Downtick Ratio Money flow measures the relative buying and selling pressure on a stock, based on the value of trades made on an "uptick" in price and the value of trades made on a "downtick" in price. The up/down ratio is calculated by dividing the value of uptick trades by the value of downtick trades. Net money flow is the value of uptick trades minus the value of downtick trades.

   Fiscal 2017 third quarter revenues of $183.2 million   Fiscal 2017 third quarter operating income of $83.1 million   Fiscal 2017 third quarter adjusted operating income of $88.0 million  NEW YORK, May 05, 2017 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- MSG Networks Inc. (NYSE:MSGN) today reported financial results for the fiscal third quarter ended March 31, 2017.  For the fiscal 2017 third quarter, MSG Networks Inc. generated revenues of $183.2 million, an increase of 2% as compared with the prior year period.  In addition, the Company generated operating income of $83.1 million, adjusted operating income of $88.0 million and income from continuing operations of $44.2 million. (1) President and CEO Andrea Greenberg said, "For our fiscal third quarter, MSG Networks' exclusive live content and critically-acclaimed original programming continued to drive solid revenue and adjusted operating income results.  In addition to our sustained financial performance, we believe the strength and popularity of our programming and our full complement of digital media rights will lead to new opportunities to distribute and monetize our content.  We are on track for another strong year of AOI and free cash flow generation and, looking ahead, remain confident in our ability to continue creating long-term value for our shareholders."     Fiscal Year 2017 Third Quarter Results           (In thousands, except per share data)    Three Months Ended         March 31,         2017     Revenues    $ 183,247       Operating income   83,054       Adjusted operating income   88,019       Income from continuing operations    44,155       Diluted EPS from continuing operations    $ 0.58                       1. The Company formerly referred to adjusted operating income as adjusted operating cash flow. The components of adjusted operating income are identical to the components of adjusted operating cash flow.  See page 3 of this earnings release for the definition of adjusted operating income included in the discussion of non-GAAP financial measures.        Summary of Reported Results from Continuing Operations Fiscal 2017 third quarter total revenues of $183.2 million increased 2%, or $3.7 million, as compared with the prior year period.  Affiliation fee revenue increased $3.8 million, primarily due to higher affiliation rates, partially offset by the impact of a low single-digit percentage decrease in subscribers versus the prior year period and the absence of the impact of a favorable affiliate adjustment recorded in the prior year period.  Advertising revenue decreased $0.3 million primarily due to a higher net increase in deferred revenue related to ratings guarantees, partially offset by increased sales from the telecast of live professional sports programming, as compared with the prior year period.  Other revenues increased $0.2 million as compared with the prior year period.  Excluding the impact of the favorable affiliate adjustment recorded in the prior year quarter, fiscal 2017 third quarter affiliation fee revenue increased $5.4 million and total company revenues increased $5.2 million, or 3%, both as compared with the prior year period.   Direct operating expenses of $75.7 million increased 3%, or $2.4 million, as compared with the prior year period.  The increase was primarily due to higher rights fees expense, partially offset by other programming-related cost decreases.
