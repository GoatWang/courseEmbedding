ROOTGROW and ROOTGROW GEL
Rootgrow combats rose soil sickness and solves the rose re-plant problem A great new product for plants - especially roses. Rootgrow is a mycorrhiza - a 'friendly fungus' that when used, attaches itself to the roots and grows a second root system that not only benefits the plant during transplanting, but helps it become stronger, healthier and more vibrant. More importantly, as far as roses are concerned, it combats rose sickness. With Rootgrow, roses can be planted in existing rose beds without changing the soil - making an easy effective solution.

UNCLE TOM'S ROSE TONIC
Feeds and defends against disease
A terrific new plant food that not only feeds your roses but also promotes healthier growth and dramatically improves disease resistance. It is used by professionals and recommended by the British Rose Growers Association.
Use after pruning and every week or two during the growing season for healthier, happier roses. Can be used as a drench or foliar spray.
One litre will treat approximately 100 rose bushes for a season.

FLOWER CARE
Bulk Garden Roses are shipped directly from our farms without water tubes. Before shipping your flowers, we prepare them for their journey with proper hydration methods. If your flowers appear sleepy and thirsty after their journey, it is absolutely NORMAL. Just follow these simple steps and the flowers will bloom delightfully.

Remove flowers from box by cutting any straps. Our Garden Roses are shipped in special packaging that may or may not include water boxes, water tubes or wet foam. No matter the packaging, your Garden Roses have been properly prepared for shipping. Remove any of this special packaging including any plastic wrapping in order to prevent condensation which will cause rotting, but do NOT remove the cardboard sleeve or the rubber bands holding the flowers together in a bunch. 
Fill containers with at least 4 inches of fresh, cool water. 
Add floral food to prevent bacteria from forming in the water and to give added nutrients to the Roses. If you do not have flower food, it can be purchased at any local florist. 
Remove any leaves that fall below the water line. Not removing the leaves may cause bacteria to form and shorten the Rose's life. 
Using sharp scissors or a knife, cut the stems diagonally under running water approximately one inch from each stem's bottom edge. 
Immediately after cutting, place the stems in the prepared water. 
Allow flowers at least 4 hours to hydrate well. Garden Roses may take up to 12 hours to properly hydrate. Leave the plastic or cardboard packaging around the blooms for a minimum of 4 hours. This will allow the Roses sufficient time to hydrate properly.
Keep flowers away from direct sunlight, drafts or excessive heat. 
To keep the Garden Roses fresh, change the water every 24 to 48 hours or when the water becomes cloudy. Assure that your flowers have sufficient water. The flowers will drink an exceptionally large amount of water upon arrival.

We ship our Garden Roses with guard petals in order to protect the blooms during shipping. Upon removal of the protective packaging, remove any brown or discolored guard petals. It is not uncommon to remove an average of 5 to 10 petals per bloom.
Remember that exposing Garden Roses to warmer environments (outside, a hot room, etc) will help the flower bloom, and storing your Roses in a cooler environment will slow down the opening process.

Allow flowers at least 4 hours to hydrate well. Garden Roses may take up to 12 hours to properly hydrate. Leave the plastic or cardboard packaging around the blooms for a minimum of 4 hours. This will allow the Roses sufficient time to hydrate properly.
Do not remove guard petals from David Austin Garden Roses. These petals keep the inner petals secure as the bloom opens. 
Keep flowers away from direct sunlight, drafts or excessive heat. 
To keep the Garden Roses fresh, change the water every 24 to 48 hours or when the water becomes cloudy. Assure that your flowers have sufficient water. The flowers will drink an exceptionally large amount of water upon arrival.

Remember that exposing Garden Roses to warmer environments (outside, a hot room, etc) will help the flower bloom, and storing your Roses in a cooler environment will slow down the opening process.
