Global Investment Outlook and Strategy
July 2017



Synchronized global growth, improving corporate earnings, benign inflation, and positive economic surprises have contributed to the solid performance of U.S. Equities in 2017.  Earnings growth has been the driver of stock appreciation in 2017.  Potential economic outcomes from the Trump administration’s policies, if effectively implemented, could boost U.S. Economic growth, but the impact of Washington’s partisan conflicts and the Federal Reserve’s unwinding of its bloated balance sheet are unknown.
Increases in the target fed funds rate have continued to move short-term yields higher, while the modest reduction of stimulus has partially relieved fears of rising inflation, which resulted in modestly lower longer-term yields.  The taxable bonds yield curve has flattened with a historically steep position, and we expect it to assume a naturally flatter shape as the Fed continues to normalize monetary policy.  As a result of the Fed’s implementation of balnace sheet reduction, we expect spreads to increase modestly on current coupon mortgages and, coupled wit the anticipated rise in interest rates, could lead to meaningful increases in mortgage rates.
The AAA tax-exempt municipal bond yield curve flattened during the second quarter due primarily to sizable yield declines across the middle and the long end of the curve.  Meanwhile, yields rose slightly on maturities of two years and less.  All durations of municipal bond indices posted a second consecutive quarter of positive returns, with longer maturities performing best for the period.  All investment-grade municipal bond index returns continued to be positive on the year.  Bonds with A and/or BBB ratings have generally outperformed more highly rated bonds.
In Europe, Brexit-related uncertainty, the Italian general election, and the eventual moderation of accommodative monetary policy remain key issues, but Euro Area economic data has consistently surprised to the upside in 2017.  Business activity and consumer confidence measure are near historically high levels, with domestic demand continuing to be the driver of incremental growth.  Employment conditions are improving, yet economic momentum is starting to show signs of moderation.





For more details, including a longer discussion on the recent low volatility of financial markets, please see the complete Sit Investment Associates’ July 2017 Global Investment Outlook and Strategy paper. Click here: Global Outlook and Strategy (Adobe Acrobat).

Performance figures are historical and do not guarantee future results. Investment returns and principal value will vary, and you may have a gain or loss when you sell shares. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance data quoted.  Performance data current to the most recent month-end is available. Returns include changes in share price as well as reinvestment of all dividends and capital gains. Returns do no reflect the deduction of taxes that a shareholder would pay on Fund distributions or the redemption of Fund shares. Management fees and administrative expenses are included in the Fund’s performance. Returns for periods greater than one year are compounded average annual rates of return.

Fund Objectives and Strategy
The Sit U.S. Government Securities Fund objective is high current income and safety of principal.  The Fund seeks to achieve its objective by investing exclusively in U.S. government securities, which are securities issued, guaranteed or insured by the U.S. government, its agencies or instrumentalities.  In selecting securities for the Fund, the Adviser seeks securities providing high current income relative to yields currently available in the market.  In making purchase and sales decisions for the Fund, the Adviser considers their economic outlook and interest rate forecast, as well as their evaluation of a security’s prepayment risk, yield, maturity, and liquidity.


Risk-Reward Profile

The Sit U.S. Government Securities Fund has lower risk and lower reward potentials.


Investment Style
The Fund invests in high-quality, short-duration government bonds.


Investment Adviser
The Sit Mutual Funds’ investment adviser is Sit Investment Associates, Inc.  It is an employee-owned firm founded in 1981 in Minneapolis, Minnesota and currently manages $13.6 billion.  The firm’s sole business is investment management.

Notes
Performance listed above is current to the most recent quarter-end. Performance data current to the most recent month-end can be found on the Performance Summary page.
Mutual fund investing involves risk; principal loss is possible.  There is no guarantee the Fund’s investment objectives will be achieved. Fixed-income securities present issuer default risk.  Securities held by the Fund may not be backed by the full faith and credit of the United States.  Market risk may affect a single issuer, sector of the economy, industry or the market as a whole. An increase in interest rates may lower the value of the fixed-income securities held by the Fund.  Declining interest rates may compel borrowers to prepay mortgages and debt obligations underlying the mortgage-backed securities owned by the Fund. The proceeds received by the Fund from prepayments may be reinvested at interest rates lower than the original investment, thus resulting in a reduction of income to the Fund.  Rising interest rates could reduce prepayments and extend the life of securities with lower interest rates, which may increase the sensitivity of the Fund’s value to rising interest rates.  There may be limited liquidity for certain fixed-income securities.  The Fund may hold securities for which prices from pricing services may be unavailable or are deemed unreliable. More information on these risks considerations, as well as information on other risks to which the Fund is subject such as futures contacts and options, are included in the Fund’s prospectus.  The prospectus may be obtained by calling Sit Mutual Funds at 1-800-332-5580 or downloaded from this website.  Read the prospectus carefully before investing.  Investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate so that an investor’s shares when redeemed may be worth more or less than their original cost.  Carefully consider the Fund’s investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses before investing.
Fund holdings, sector allocations (as % of market value) and portfolio characteristics may change at any time and are not investment recommendations. The Bloomberg Barclays Intermediate Government Index is a sub-index of the Bloomberg Barclays Government Bond Index covering issues with remaining maturities of between three and five years.  The Bloomberg Barclays Government Bond Index is an index that measures the performance of all public U.S. government obligations with remaining maturities of one year or more.  The returns include the reinvestment of income and do not include any transaction costs, management fees or other costs.  It is not possible to invest directly in an index.  Duration is a measure of estimated price sensitivity relative to changes in interest rates.  Portfolios with longer durations are typically more sensitive to changes in interest rates.  For example, if interest rates rise by 1%, the market value of a security with an effective duration of 5 years would decrease by 5%, with all other factors being constant.  The correlation between duration and price sensitivity is greater for securities rates investment-grade than it is for securities rated below investment-grade.  Duration estimates are based on assumptions by the Adviser and are subject to a number of limitations.  Effective duration is calculated based on historical price changes of securities held by the Fund, and therefore is a more accurate estimate of price sensitivity provided interest rates remain within their historical range.

Summary







 


Overall Rating

5 out of 5 Stars

Morningstar has awarded this fund 5 stars based on its risk-adjusted performance compared to the 105 funds within its Morningstar Category.



How is it determined?


The Overall Morningstar RatingTM for a fund is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its 3-, 5-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics, which are based on risk-adjusted returns, as of the date stated.

What does it mean?


A fund's Morningstar Rating is a quantitative assessment of a fund's past performance that accounts for both risk and return, with funds earning between 1 and 5 stars. As always, this rating system is designed to be used as a first step in the fund evaluation process. A high rating alone is not sufficient basis upon which to make an investment decision.











 


Returns


LOW
AVG
HIGH


High


This fund scored High because it delivered returns that were in the top 10% when compared to other funds within its Morningstar category over a 3-year period.





How is it calculated?



This rating is based on a fund's Morningstar Return (its annualized return in excess to the return of the 90-day U.S. Treasury bill over a three-, five-, or ten-year period). The Morningstar Returns in each category are then scored against each other on a bell curve. In each Morningstar Category: top 10% - High next 22.5% - Above Average middle 35% - Average next 22.5% - Below Average bottom 10% - Low




What does it mean?



While past performance is no guarantee of future results, the Morningstar Return shows how the fund has done in the past in comparison to similar funds in its peer group. It does not, however, show the effects of risk.Therefore, the Morningstar Return is most helpful when used in conjunction with the Morningstar Risk Score. For example, an investor could use these two scores when comparing between funds that have the same Morningstar Star Rating and similar Morningstar Risk Adjusted Returns but different levels of risk.










 


Expenses


LOW
AVG
HIGH


Average


This fund's expenses are rated as Average because they fall between the 40th and 60th percentiles when compared with other funds in the category.





How is it calculated?


This Morningstar data point compares the fund's net expense ratio to the net expense ratio of all the other funds within its Morningstar Category grouping.





What does it mean?


Excessive expenses can detract from overall returns and can be a drain on performance. While you should not base any investment decision entirely on expenses or expense ratios, a fund's expense structure may be one factor to consider.











 


Risk of this Type of Fund


LOWER
HIGHER





Morningstar assigns a risk level to each of its mutual fund categories. These risk levels range from 1 for those funds with least amount of risk to 10 for those with the greatest amount of risk.






How is it calculated?



Morningstar calculates these risk levels by looking at the Morningstar Risk of the funds in the Category over the previous 5-year period. Morningstar Risk is the difference between the Morningstar Return, based on fund total returns, and the Morningstar Risk Adjusted Return, based on fund total returns adjusted for performance volatility. The Category Risk Level is based on the equal weighted average Morningstar Risk of the funds in the category.  Morningstar's Research Committee evaluates the Category Morningstar Risk and assigns the Category Risk Level after further qualitative judgment.




What does it mean?



This score can help you understand the risk involved with a particular Morningstar category of funds, which may be helpful in evaluating the risk associated with a specific investment. The Category Risk Level is based on the equal weighted average performance of the funds in the category. It does not reflect the risk associated with any individual fund or the relative risk of a fund within a particular Morningstar category.  Because the score is based on past performance, it may not reflect the future risk of the category. In addition to risk, you should evaluate a fund's investment objective, strategy, fees and other characteristics before making your investment decision.Learn more

Fund Overview




Objective



The investment seeks current income and safety of principal.




Strategy



The fund invests exclusively in U.S. government securities, which are securities issued, guaranteed or insured by the U.S. government, its agencies or instrumentalities. It invests a substantial portion of its assets in pass-through securities. The Adviser attempts to maintain an average effective duration for the portfolio of approximately 2 to 5 years. The fund's dollar-weighted average maturity will, under normal market conditions, range between 15 and 25 years.


Risk



In general the bond market is volatile, and fixed income securities carry interest rate risk. (As interest rates rise, bond prices usually fall, and vice versa. This effect is usually more pronounced for longer-term securities.) Fixed income securities also carry inflation risk and credit and default risks for both issuers and counterparties. Unlike individual bonds, most bond funds do not have a maturity date, so avoiding losses caused by price volatility by holding them until maturity is not possible. Additional risk information for this product may be found in the prospectus or other product materials, if available.




Additional Disclosures

This description is only intended to provide a brief overview of the mutual fund. Read the fund's prospectus for more detailed information about the fund.
Weighted average maturity (WAM) is the weighted average of all the maturities of the securities held in a fund. WAM for money market funds can be used as a measure of sensitivity to interest rate changes. Generally, the longer the maturity, the greater the sensitivity. WAM for money market funds is based on the dollar-weighted average length of time until principal payments must be paid, taking into account any call options exercised by the issuer and any permissible maturity shortening devices, such as demand features and interest rate resets. For bond funds, WAM can be used as a measure of sensitivity to the markets. Generally, the longer the maturity, the greater the sensitivity. The WAM calculation for bond funds excludes interest rate resets and only takes into account issuer call options if it is probable that the issuer of the instrument will take advantage of such options.

Risk


LOW
AVG
HIGH


Average

This fund scores Average because Morningstar has rated its risk between the 40th and 60th percentiles when compared to other funds within its Morningstar category.




How is it calculated?


Risk is calculated using the Sharpe ratio, which compares portfolio returns to a rate comparable to U.S. Treasury bonds, relative to the fund's overall volatility. For this measure, Morningstar has compared the Sharpe ratio of this fund against all other funds that invest in it's Morningstar Category.




What does it mean?


A higher Sharpe implies better risk-adjusted returns. Therefore, if a fund has a Sharpe ratio higher than its category average, it's returns relative to it's risk were better than other similar funds. If its Sharpe ratio is lower, that's usually a sign that the risk-adjusted returns were lower than other similar funds.










 


Returns


LOW
AVG
HIGH


High


This fund scored High because it delivered returns that were in the top 10% when compared to other funds within its Morningstar category over a 3-year period.





How is it calculated?



This rating is based on a fund's Morningstar Return (its annualized return in excess to the return of the 90-day U.S. Treasury bill over a three-, five-, or ten-year period). The Morningstar Returns in each category are then scored against each other on a bell curve. In each Morningstar Category: top 10% - High next 22.5% - Above Average middle 35% - Average next 22.5% - Below Average bottom 10% - Low




What does it mean?



While past performance is no guarantee of future results, the Morningstar Return shows how the fund has done in the past in comparison to similar funds in its peer group. It does not, however, show the effects of risk.Therefore, the Morningstar Return is most helpful when used in conjunction with the Morningstar Risk Score. For example, an investor could use these two scores when comparing between funds that have the same Morningstar Star Rating and similar Morningstar Risk Adjusted Returns but different levels of risk.










 


Risk of this Type of Fund


LOWER
HIGHER





Morningstar assigns a risk level to each of its mutual fund categories. These risk levels range from 1 for those funds with least amount of risk to 10 for those with the greatest amount of risk.






How is it calculated?



Morningstar calculates these risk levels by looking at the Morningstar Risk of the funds in the Category over the previous 5-year period. Morningstar Risk is the difference between the Morningstar Return, based on fund total returns, and the Morningstar Risk Adjusted Return, based on fund total returns adjusted for performance volatility. The Category Risk Level is based on the equal weighted average Morningstar Risk of the funds in the category.  Morningstar's Research Committee evaluates the Category Morningstar Risk and assigns the Category Risk Level after further qualitative judgment.




What does it mean?



This score can help you understand the risk involved with a particular Morningstar category of funds, which may be helpful in evaluating the risk associated with a specific investment. The Category Risk Level is based on the equal weighted average performance of the funds in the category. It does not reflect the risk associated with any individual fund or the relative risk of a fund within a particular Morningstar category.  Because the score is based on past performance, it may not reflect the future risk of the category. In addition to risk, you should evaluate a fund's investment objective, strategy, fees and other characteristics before making your investment decision.Learn more

Risk



In general the bond market is volatile, and fixed income securities carry interest rate risk. (As interest rates rise, bond prices usually fall, and vice versa. This effect is usually more pronounced for longer-term securities.) Fixed income securities also carry inflation risk and credit and default risks for both issuers and counterparties. Unlike individual bonds, most bond funds do not have a maturity date, so avoiding losses caused by price volatility by holding them until maturity is not possible. Additional risk information for this product may be found in the prospectus or other product materials, if available.

The Morningstar RatingTM for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for funds with at least a three-year history. (Exchange-traded funds and open-end mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes.) It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a fund's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of  funds in each fund category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

The Morningstar information contained herein: (1) is proprietary to Morningstar and/or its content providers; (2) may not be copied or redistributed; and (3) is not warranted to be accurate, complete or timely. Neither Morningstar nor its content providers are responsible for any damages or losses arising from any use of this information. Fidelity does not review the Morningstar data and, for fund performance, you should check the fund's current prospectus or other product materials for the most up-to-date information concerning applicable loads, fees and expenses.

In general the bond market is volatile, and fixed income securities carry interest rate risk. (As interest rates rise, bond prices usually fall, and vice versa. This effect is usually more pronounced for longer-term securities.) Fixed income securities also carry inflation risk and credit  and default risks for both issuers and counterparties. Unlike individual bonds, most bond funds do not have a maturity date, so avoiding losses caused by price volatility by holding them until maturity is not possible.

The "Mutual Funds" area at the top of each page allows access to mutual fund holdings with individual and joint Fidelity non-retirement accounts. Individual stock positions, ETFs and 529 funds are not available through this view. For the full list of your holdings visit Portfolio Summary.Mutual Funds are priced as of the previous business day's market close when the market is open. Mutual fund positions are priced as of the official market close (typically 4p.m.) and prices are generally available between 5 p.m. and 6p.m.

The performance data featured represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results.  Investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate; therefore, you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares.  Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance data quoted.











1. No Transaction Fee funds are available without paying a transaction fee. No Transaction Fee funds will also be offered without a load or on a load waived basis. However, the fund may charge a short term trading fee or a redemption fee. Other fees and expenses, including those which apply to a continued investment in the fund, are described in the fund's current prospectus. Fidelity Brokerage Services LLC ("FBS"), or its affiliates, receives compensation in connection with (i) access to, purchase or redemption of, and/or maintenance of positions in mutual funds and other investment products ("funds"), (ii) infrastructure needed to support such funds as well as additional compensation for shareholder services, start-up fees, infrastructure support and maintenance, and other programs and/or (iii) a fund's attendance at events for FBS's clients and/or representatives, and opportunities for the fund to promote its products and services. This compensation may take the form of sales loads and 12b-1 fees described in the prospectus and/or additional compensation paid by the fund, its investment adviser or an affiliate. Additional information about the source(s) and amount(s) of this compensation as well as any other remuneration received by FBS or its affiliates will be furnished upon request.
2. Total returns are historical and include change in share value and reinvestment of dividends and capital gains, if any. Cumulative total returns are reported as of the period indicated.  Life of fund figures are reported as of the commencement date to the period indicated and are cumulative if the fund is less than one year old. Total returns do not reflect the fund's [%] sales charge. If sales charges were included, total returns would have been lower.
3. The Morningstar Category Average is the average return for the peer group based on the returns of each individual fund within the group, for the period shown. This average assumes reinvestment of dividends.
4. This chart illustrates the performance of a hypothetical $10,000 investment made in this investment product (and a benchmark or category average, if shown) from the beginning date shown or on the inception date of the product (whichever is later).  The inception date used for products with underlying funds, or multiple shares classes, or are offered as a separate account, strategy or sub account, may be the inception date of the underlying fund, the earliest share class of the product, or the date composite performance for the product was first made available. The product's returns may not reflect all its expenses. Any fees not reflected would lower the returns. Benchmark returns include reinvestment of capital gains and dividends, if any, but do not reflect any fees or expenses. It is not possible to invest in an index. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. This chart is not intended to imply any future performance of the investment product.
5. Initial minimum investments into group retirement accounts such as Fidelity Simplified Employee Pension-IRA, Keogh, Self-Employed 401(k), and Non-Fidelity Prototype Retirement accounts are $500 or higher. Additional investments into Regular, IRA, and Group accounts are $250 or higher.
6. A standard yield calculation developed by the Securities and Exchange Commission for bond funds. The yield is calculated by dividing the net investment income per share earned during the 30-day period by the maximum offering price per share on the last day of the period. The yield figure reflects the dividends and interest earned during the 30-day period, after the deduction of the fund's expenses. It is sometimes referred to as "SEC 30-Day Yield" or "standardized yield".
7. Any holdings, asset allocation, diversification breakdowns or other composition data shown are as of the date indicated and are subject to change at any time. They may not be representative of the fund's current or future investments. Some breakdowns may be intentionally limited to a particular asset class or other subset of the fund's entire portfolio, particularly in multi-asset class funds where the attributes of the equity and fixed income portions are different. Under the asset allocation section, international (or foreign) assets may be reported differently depending on how an investment options reports its holdings.  Some do not report international (or foreign) holdings here, but instead report them in a "Regional Diversification" section.  Some report them in this section as an to the equity, bond and other allocation shown.  Others report international (or foreign) holding as a subset of the equity and bond allocations shown.  If the allocation without the foreign component (or round to) 100%, then international (or foreign) is a subset of the equity and bond percentage shown.
8. Percent Rank in Category is the fund's total-return percentile rank relative to all funds that have the same Morningstar Category.  The highest (or most favorable) percentile rank is 1 and the lowest (or least favorable) percentile rank is 100. The top-performing fund in a category will always receive a rank of 1. % Rank in Category is based on total returns which include reinvested dividends and capital gains, if any, and exclude sales charges.
9. Fixed Income StyleMap® StyleMap® depictions of mutual fund characteristics are produced using data and calculations provided by Morningstar, Inc. StyleMapsSM estimate characteristics of a fund's fixed income holdings over two dimensions: credit quality and interest rate sensitivity.  Current StyleMap characteristics are calculated each time Morningstar receives updated portfolio holdings from a fund and are denoted with a dot. Historical StyleMap characteristics are calculated for the shorter of either the past 3 years or the life of the fund, and are represented by the shading of the box(es) previously occupied by the dot. StyleMap characteristics represent an approximate profile of the fund's holdings, are based on historical data, and are not predictive of the fund's future investments. Although the data are gathered from reliable sources, accuracy and completeness cannot be guaranteed.


Generally, data on Fidelity mutual funds is provided by FMR, LLC, Morningstar ratings and data on non-Fidelity mutual funds is provided by Morningstar, Inc. and data on non-mutual fund products is provided by the product's investment manager, trustee or issuer or the plan sponsor whose plan is offering the product to  participants.  Although Fidelity believes the data gathered from these third-party sources is reliable, it does not review such information and cannot warrant it to be accurate, complete or timely.  Fidelity is not responsible for any damages or losses arising from any use of this third-party information.

Before investing, consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the fund or annuity and its investment options. Contact Fidelity for a free prospectus and, if available, summary prospectus containing this information. Read it carefully.
