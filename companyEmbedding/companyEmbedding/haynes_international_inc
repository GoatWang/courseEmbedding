History[edit]
The company was founded by Elwood Haynes in 1912 in Kokomo, Indiana, as Haynes Stellite Works.[2] Haynes had recently received a patent for a metal he created, which he named Stellite.[3]
In 1920, the company was purchased by Union Carbide.[3]
In 1922, the company invented its first alloy under the Hastelloy brand, derived from the first letters of the words Haynes Stellite Alloy.[3]
In 1927, Charles Lindberg's aircraft, the Spirit of St. Louis, which included hard-surfaced engine valves manufactured by Haynes, crossed the Atlantic Ocean.[3]
In 1970, Cabot Corporation purchased the company.[3]
In 1989, the investment banking firm of Morgan, Lewis, Githens, and Ahn purchased the company.[3]

History[edit]
The company was founded by Elwood Haynes in 1912 in Kokomo, Indiana, as Haynes Stellite Works.[2] Haynes had recently received a patent for a metal he created, which he named Stellite.[3]
In 1920, the company was purchased by Union Carbide.[3]
In 1922, the company invented its first alloy under the Hastelloy brand, derived from the first letters of the words Haynes Stellite Alloy.[3]
In 1927, Charles Lindberg's aircraft, the Spirit of St. Louis, which included hard-surfaced engine valves manufactured by Haynes, crossed the Atlantic Ocean.[3]
In 1970, Cabot Corporation purchased the company.[3]
In 1989, the investment banking firm of Morgan, Lewis, Githens, and Ahn purchased the company.[3]
In 1997, the Blackstone Group purchased the company.[3] The debt incurred ultimately forced Haynes into bankruptcy in March 2004, from which it emerged 5 months later in August 2004.[2]
In 1999, the company opened an office in Singapore, its first sales office in Asia.[3]
In 2004, the company acquired Branford Wire & Manufacturing of Mountain Home, North Carolina.[3][4]
In March 2007, Haynes completed a public equity offering.[5]
Current operations[edit]
In addition to Kokomo, Haynes has manufacturing facilities in Arcadia, Louisiana, and Mountain Home, North Carolina. The Kokomo facility specializes in flat products, the Arcadia facility in tubular products, and the Mountain Home facility in wire products.[2]
The space shuttle’s engines have a total of 47 parts made from Haynes 188 alloy and 7 from Haynes' Hastelloy B alloy. Hastelloy C-22 alloy is used for the fuel line bellows that assist in achieving takeoff.[3]
The company's revenues in fiscal year 2016 were derived from the following industries:[2]

History[edit]
The company was founded by Elwood Haynes in 1912 in Kokomo, Indiana, as Haynes Stellite Works.[2] Haynes had recently received a patent for a metal he created, which he named Stellite.[3]
In 1920, the company was purchased by Union Carbide.[3]
In 1922, the company invented its first alloy under the Hastelloy brand, derived from the first letters of the words Haynes Stellite Alloy.[3]
In 1927, Charles Lindberg's aircraft, the Spirit of St. Louis, which included hard-surfaced engine valves manufactured by Haynes, crossed the Atlantic Ocean.[3]
In 1970, Cabot Corporation purchased the company.[3]
In 1989, the investment banking firm of Morgan, Lewis, Githens, and Ahn purchased the company.[3]
In 1997, the Blackstone Group purchased the company.[3] The debt incurred ultimately forced Haynes into bankruptcy in March 2004, from which it emerged 5 months later in August 2004.[2]
In 1999, the company opened an office in Singapore, its first sales office in Asia.[3]
In 2004, the company acquired Branford Wire & Manufacturing of Mountain Home, North Carolina.[3][4]
In March 2007, Haynes completed a public equity offering.[5]
Current operations[edit]
In addition to Kokomo, Haynes has manufacturing facilities in Arcadia, Louisiana, and Mountain Home, North Carolina. The Kokomo facility specializes in flat products, the Arcadia facility in tubular products, and the Mountain Home facility in wire products.[2]
The space shuttle’s engines have a total of 47 parts made from Haynes 188 alloy and 7 from Haynes' Hastelloy B alloy. Hastelloy C-22 alloy is used for the fuel line bellows that assist in achieving takeoff.[3]
The company's revenues in fiscal year 2016 were derived from the following industries:[2]

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)
language_code

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).

Welding and Fabrication Overview

The HAYNES® and HASTELLOY® alloys fall into two main categories:
Corrosion-resistant Alloys (CRA), which are generally used at temperatures below 1000°F, and are able to withstand corrosive liquids.
High-temperature Alloys (HTA), which are generally used above 1000°F, at which temperatures they possess considerable strength and resistance to hot air and/or other hot gases.
The high-temperature alloys can also be sub-categorized according to the mechanism used to provide their strength. Many of the alloys contain significant quantities of atomically-large elements; these provide strength through a mechanism known as solid-solution strengthening. Other HTA materials use a mechanism known as age-hardening (also known as precipitation-hardening) to attain the required strength levels. There is also one age-hardenable, corrosion-resistant alloy.
The heat treatments required to strengthen the age-hardenable materials are normally performed after welding and hot/cold-working, and prior to these heat treatments, there is much in common with the fabrication techniques/parameters employed with the solid-solution strengthened alloys, as long as they are supplied in the annealed condition.
As with the stainless steels and other alloy systems, it is advantageous to have a rudimentary understanding of the metallurgical changes that might occur in the HAYNES® and HASTELLOY® alloys, if exposed to the heat of welding, the high temperatures involved with hot-working, or the effects of annealing after cold-working. If brazing is to be attempted, it is very important to understand how the temperatures involved with brazing might affect the HAYNES® and HASTELLOY® materials, or conversely how subsequent age-hardening (in the case of the age-hardenable alloys) or annealing treatments (in the case of any of the alloys) might affect the brazed joint.
In addition to the general purpose alloys manufactured by Haynes International, there are several special purpose alloys, requiring different fabrication approaches. One is a titanium alloy made only in the form of tubulars, and for which fabrication references are given. One is a high-temperature, nickel-based alloy that requires a nitrogen diffusion treatment to impart strength to the material, and for which there are some specific fabrication issues. The other two are cobalt-based, wear-resistant alloys, one of which is not normally welded or formed; the other is easily welded, but somewhat resistant to cold-working due to a high work-hardening rate.
