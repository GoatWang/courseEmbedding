Richard D. DiMarchi, Ph.D.
Endocrinology & Drug Development
	Dr. DiMarchi is the Linda & Jack Gill Chair in Biomolecular Sciences and 
	Professor of Chemistry at Indiana University. He is a retired Group Vice 
	President for Biotechnology and Product Development at Eli Lilly & Company 
	where for more than two decades he provided leadership in biotechnology, 
	endocrine research and product development. Professor DiMarchi is recognized 
	for the discovery and development of rDNA-derived Humalog® (LisPro-human 
	insulin). This designer insulin represents the first demonstration that 
	structurally altered rDNA-derived, biosynthetic proteins can improve 
	pharmacological performance without increasing the risk of an abnormal 
	immunological response. As scientist and administrator at Lilly, Dr. 
	DiMarchi participated in the commercial development of Humulin®, Humatrope®, 
	Xigris®, and Forteo®. The goal of his current research and commercial 
	endeavors is to develop proteins with enhanced therapeutic properties 
	through biochemical optimization with non-natural amino acids, an approach 
	he has termed chemical-biotechnology. Dr. DiMarchi received his Ph.D. from 
	Indiana University.
