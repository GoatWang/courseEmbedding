Oxithion
Contains highly bioavailable reduced L-Glutathione Sublingual Tablets.

Due to the oxidative stress placed on our bodies by normal metabolism, bad habits, bad food and bad environmental conditions, all adults should be taking supplemental dosages of antioxidants.
Oxithion Sublingual Tablets  is a supplement containing reduced L-Glutathione (100mg), a natural tripeptide. It is the most powerful endogenous anti-oxidant. Glutathione protects the body from oxidative stress, inflammation and toxins, thereby improving the body’s functional status. Oxidative stress causes damage to cellular macromolecules resulting in physiological aging and the degenerative processes that occur in age-related diseases. Glutathione supplementation helps to delay the aging and degenerative processes, thereby keeping the body healthy and youthful.
The innovative sublingual Oxithion Sublingual Tablets  is formulated as fast dissolving sublingual tablets, with an innovative patented technology, thanks to which glutathione is rapidly absorbed through the sublingual mucosa before reaching the systemic circulation without being metabolized and then inactivated by the liver. 
To achieve maximum benefits, please allow the tablet to dissolve completely n the mouth and allow absorption to take place through the mouth mucosa, do not chew and swallow.

Sigvaris


 
Sigvaris Stockings
SIGVARIS® Medical Compression Stockings
SIGVARIS® medical compression stockings offers support for veinous insufficiency and their symptoms – such as varicose veins.
Compression therapy utilizes a simple and efficient mechanical principle of applying an elastic garment around the leg. By compressing the limb with graduated decreasing compression from the ankle up to the leg - Sigvaris stocking aids the body in moving blood upwards against the pull of gravity. This mechanism increases venous return, decreases venous pressure, prevents venous stasis and deterioration of venous walls, and efficiently relieves aching and heavy legs.
This treatment may be prescribed by a physician to assist treatment of phlebitis, thrombosis and aftercare following surgery, sclerotherapy and any other forms of varicose vein treatment, and also to relieve all conditions of chronic venous disease (heavy legs, varicose veins, oedemas, leg ulcers). It can also be prescribed to prevent venous issues during pregnancy and long distance travel.
SIGVARIS® compression products are designed to provide maximum comfort and effective compression, encouraging better patient compliance. Contact us for information on where you can purchase SIGVARIS® MAGIC and SIGVARIS® COTTON products in Singapore.

 AboutAuthorisation detailsProduct informationAssessment historyAboutThis is a summary of the European Public Assessment Report. Its purpose is to explain how the assessment done by the Committee for Medicinal Products for Veterinary Use (CVMP) on the basis of the documentation provided, led to the recommendations on the conditions of use.This summary cannot replace a face-to-face discussion with your veterinarian. If you need more information about your animal’s medical condition or treatment, contact your veterinarian. If you want more information on the basis of the CVMP recommendations, read the scientific discussion (also part of the EPAR).What is Novem and what is it used for?Novem is an anti-inflammatory medicine used in cattle and pigs. It contains the active substance meloxicam.In cattle, Novem is used to treat:acute respiratory infection (infection of the lungs and airways) together with antibioticsdiarrhoea in calves of over one week of age and young, non-lactating cattle together with oral re-hydration therapy (medicines given by mouth to restore water levels in the body)pain following dehorning in calvesacute mastitis (inflammation of the udder) together with the main treatment with antibiotics.In pigs, Novem is used to treat:lameness and inflammation in non-infectious locomotor disorders (diseases that affect the ability to move)pain following minor soft tissue surgery such as castrationinfections that occur after farrowing (giving birth) such as puerperal septicaemia and toxaemia (mastitis-metritis-agalactia syndrome) together with the main treatment with antibiotics.How is Novem used?Novem is available as a solution for injection and can only be obtained with a prescription. The dose to use depends on the animal and its bodyweight. Injections are given under the skin for cattle and into the muscles for pigs.How does Novem work?Novem contains meloxicam, which belongs to a class of medicines called non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Meloxicam acts by blocking an enzyme called cyclooxygenase which is involved in the production of prostaglandins. As prostaglandins are substances that trigger inflammation, pain, exudation (fluid that leaks out of blood vessels during an inflammation) and fever, meloxicam reduces these signs of disease.What benefits of Novem have been shown in studies?Appropriate studies have been carried out in various target animals to show that Novem is effective and safe in its approved uses. The studies showed that the addition of Novem to antibiotic therapy significantly improved clinical parameters and reduced fever compared to antibiotics alone. Similarly, treatment combining rehydration solution and Novem was shown to be superior to rehydration solution alone.What are the risks associated with Novem?In cattle and pigs both subcutaneous and intramuscular administration are well tolerated; only a slight temporary swelling at the injection site following subcutaneous administration was observed in less than 10% of the cattle treated in clinical studies.In very rare cases anaphylactoid (allergic) reactions which may be serious (including fatal) may occur and should be treated symptomatically.What are the precautions for the person who gives the medicine or comes into contact with the animal?People who are hypersensitive (allergic) to NSAIDs should avoid contact with Novem. If the product is accidentally self-injected, the advice of a doctor should be sought immediately.What is the withdrawal period in food-producing animals?The withdrawal period is the time allowed after administration of the medicine and before the animal can be slaughtered and the meat or milk used for human consumption.CattleThe withdrawal period is 15 days for meat and five days for milk.PigsThe withdrawal period for meat is five days.Why is Novem approved?The Agency’s Committee for Medicinal Products for Veterinary Use (CVMP) concluded that Novem’s benefits are greater than its risks and recommended that it be approved for use in the EU.Other information about NovemThe European Commission granted a marketing authorisation valid throughout the European Union, for Novem on 2 March 2004. For more information about treatment with Novem, animal owners or keepers should read the package leaflet or contact their veterinarian or pharmacist.

                    " Used: As a pre-workout.
" Taste: 8.5/10 - Very much your classic fruit punch taste. Not sweet at all in my opinion. Definitely one of the better tasting pre workouts I've encountered.
" Solubility 10/10 - Zero issues with clumping or chunks. Almost zero leftover in my water bottle that I used to shake it. Took minimal effort to mix fully.
" Experiences: - Effects could be felt pretty early on after use. Definitely lasted long enough for my workout, but I wouldn't say the effects lasted much longer afterwards. More of a burst of energy than long lasting sustained increase. Does get the job done though. No jitters and no crash after.
" Overall Impression: 9/10 - I was definitely pleased with the results this product gave me. Would use again

                    This was an OK pre-workout.  It didn't give me the boost of energy I was looking for.  The vascularity that it gives you is amazing though.  Worked out great to take right before getting on stage!

                    The was my first preworkout product. I did have increased energy in the gym, but I have found other preworkouts more effective at giving me long lasting endurance. Good starting place. I should note that the flavor is quite hard to swallow, and has an acidic throatfeel.

                    Novem is a well put together pre work out. It has a good amount of beta alanine and creatine that you need pre work out for endurance and strength. However on the pump side it is lacking a little. This is ok because novem is currently getting blown out for the up coming psycho pre work out and you can buy a ingredient like agmatine to throw in to the pre work out for cheap. Overall good product just needs a little more for the pump!

                    I've taken Novem for about a month. I've tried about a dozen other PWOs over the years and this is a pretty solid product. The serving size is 2 scoops but I found that 1.5 worked fine for me. The classic PWO ingredients are all there. I have some tingling for the first 20 minutes or so, which I don't mind. Heads up though, the aftertaste/smell is awful for the first couple days. Surprisingly, after a couple days it seemed to taste fine once I got used to it.

                    I won a free tub of this, and honestly didn't expect much since the scoop was so small and it didn't make any crazy claims. To my surprise it gave me a solid 40 workouts, 40 servings per tub is amazing too, great focus and energy, not the best pump but still a good strength increasing pre workout

                    Flavour isnt that great but your suppose to drink it quickly anyway,
insane energy from this product and more 'tingles' on your face and hype then any other preworkout (including the old jackd)

                    I was very unimpressed with this product.  I bought it after a sample worked really well for me.  The tub I got was clumpy and didn't mix well.  The taste was ok at best but the product didn't work very well.  I got no energy from it, even after going to 2 scoops quickly.  Will not buy again.  Very dissapoint.  Probably rated it higher than I should have.

                    This stuff basically screwed up my workouts when I started taking it. Every few months I'll switch up pre-workouts just to see whats out there and unfortunately I came across SciVation Novem seeing it with such high ratings figuring I'd give it a try. I was highly disappointed! All I had was a gritty, unsteady jittery feeling with a super crash. The type of energy it gave me was me feeling ****** off not knowing what to do with myself with the annoyance of NO STRENGTH! Made me totally weak. I didn't get this product for pumps obviously bc its clearly just an energy supplement but, it is not the clean energy I expected. Thumbs down! I threw the last half of the bottle away. This stuff is crap

                    I already used several pre workouts, and here is my opinion on some of them (Jack3d 8.5; NEUROCORE 8.5; 1MR 8; NO XPLODE 7; NO XPLODE 2.0 8.0, Super Pump 250 7; SUPER PUMP MAX 7, 5; ASSAULT 8; C4 8; RAZOR 8 5.0; SUPER CHARGE 6.5.) But I'm very impressed with the NOVEM my grade for this product is 9.5 because there is still some pre workouts that still want to experience before qualifying note 10 a pre workout. In all these I used this gave me energy throughout the workout and incredible strength. worth trying this product.

                    I have used a heap of preworkout supps over the last 12 months and had to keep changing because I never felt energized. I know that it was doing all the nice science stuff that was improving my workout but that wasn't enough for me. I needed to feel that rush. Closest I ever came to that before was C4 and I used to do 2-3 scoops of that one. Anyways, I got Novum and recommended I try half a scoop first. I knew I had a high tolerance so I went for 1 scoop instead, not expecting much. It was like I had been hit by a lightning bolt. Energy levels were off the charts and all I wanted to do was lift. The 10 mins I had to wait for my partner were insane, and then I had one of the best leg days of my life. TRY IT, IT IS AMAZING!

                    Another great pre-workout! So many great pre-workouts in the market and this is definitely worth the money. It gave me that extra boost of energy I needed on leg days. Enough focus to keep on track and not take 5 min breaks lol. Pumps that lasted during and well after. The stand out effect like I said earlier was the amount of energy I was hit with if you want that extra burst this is the pre for you.

                    Great pre-workout. Focus is great. good pump. good energy. One thing though. For some reason its smells terrible. I mean it taste okay but the smell is horrendous. I dont think I can say what it smells like on here but I'll tell you it smells like something that comes out of the southern region of the body. I dont know if I got a bad batch or what. But, I have never had a preworkout smell like this. But, still overall it is a good product definitely got good workouts using this.

                    This supplement works great. Ive tried many pre-workouts but the proprietary blend in this one has tried and true ingredients that just simply work. I never lost my energy and only used a scoop throughout. definitely give this one a try.

The Novem Story
Our Philosophy





Company Profile
Since 2000, Novem has developed into a strong local player in the distribution, sales and marketing of a wide range of pharmaceuticals, medical devices and health supplements. All business activities from the importation, sales and marketing, regulatory services as well as storage and distribution are done in-house.
Dedicated to be a provider of quality healthcare, we constantly keep abreast in the latest research developments in order to provide innovative healthcare solutions to our customers. We focus on supplying excellent products and services to contribute to a better quality of life.
To achieve this purpose, we work with reputable partners who are dedicated to this same business philosophy of providing high quality and innovative pharmaceuticals, medical devices and health supplements for the improvement of health.












Our People
We strongly believe that our employees are our most valuable asset. Novem invests in attracting talents in the field to join us. At the same time, we invest in our staff and enable them to contribute to our community by creating value for our customers, partners, and business.
Sales and Marketing Team: At Novem, we have a dynamic and committed sales and marketing team reaching out to various sectors including private and restructured hospitals, private specialist clinics, family medicine clinics, government institutions, nursing homes and other non-healthcare institutions. Novem participates actively in trade shows, medical conferences and symposiums, professionally representing our partners at these events.
Regulatory/Medical Affairs Team: Our team has years of experience in handling the registration of pharmaceuticals and medical devices in Singapore. At the same time, we work closely with our partners to provide medical information services to healthcare professionals for the products we handle.
Distribution Team: The import and distribution of goods are carried out in-house within our HSA-approved premises. With more than 3 professional pharmacists at the helm of the business operations, we ensure all business activities adhere to GDP practices and at the same time promptly respond to our customer’s needs.












The Novem Story
Novem Healthcare Pte Ltd was founded in Year 2000 by our Director Mr Albert Ng, a pharmacist by training.
Spurred by the lack of a service provider offering a complete range of rehabilitation and home care products, Novem started as a wholesaler in this area. It was then housed in a small shop house at Foch Road Singapore, equipped with a small goods van that delivers goods to hospital pharmacies at short notice. The sincerity and commitment with which we respond to customers’ needs soon earned us a good name. The homecare range was later discontinued so that we can focus on other professional areas.
We are thankful to our customers, who had highly recommended our service to other companies who were looking for distributors in Singapore. We have, through the years, continuously added new product lines to our portfolio.
Milestones
2000 – 2002
Novem started with the import, assembly and sale of rehabilitation equipment supplied to major institutions in Singapore. We rapidly build the distribution network and gain market presence within the first 2 years. At the same time, we formed exclusive partnerships with multinational companies for the distribution of pharmaceuticals and medical devices in Singapore such as with:
- Hexal Group of Companies, Germany (First partnership) (Generic Pharmaceuticals)
- Coloplast A/S, Denmark (Wound, Ostomy and Continence Care appliances)
- Sigvaris AG, Switzerland in Singapore & Malaysia (Medical Compression Stockings)
- Pharma Nord ApS, Denmark (Health supplements)
2002 -2006
Novem expanded our sales team into 3 major divisions: Pharmaceutical, Medical Device & Procurement Division to spearhead sales to meet increasing market demands.
Novem continued to form new partnerships with the following: Drossapharm Ltd, Switzerland; Farmigea SpA, Italy; TransLite LLC, USA; Goldshield Group, UK; PH&T SpA, Italy, Tabuk Pharmaceutical Manufacturing Co to expand and complement our range of healthcare products.
2007 – 2009
New distribution rights:
- Secured exclusive rights to market Collatamp G, a surgical implant from Eusa Pharma.
- Rights to distribute Kimberly Clark (now Halyard) medical disposables were obtained.
Novem also forged partnerships with reliable pharmaceutical manufacturers to produce our house brand of generics and niche supplements, complementing the existing range of products.
2009 – 2012
This period saw consolidation of the businesses. The procurement division was separated as a new company operating under the same management whilst the existing company develops strategies to grow current business focusing on new innovative products.
2012 – 2015
The company enters a new phase of growth that came about due to increase in CME activities and launch of new innovative products. Novem also completed the GDPMDS certification process. New innovative products from Biocer GmbH (Germany), Genewel Co. Ltd (Korea) and Aptissen SA (Switzerland) were added, further developing our capabilities in the orthopedics and surgical specialty.
To date, Novem continues to have a strong presence in the healthcare scene with a wide range of products and services to meet the ever changing medical needs of the country.
