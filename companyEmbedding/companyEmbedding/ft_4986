                    Stone Mountain is a diverse community.  Anchored by Stone Mountain itself, complete with the park and all its amenities, with the Village of Stone Mountain right at its base, with a quaint mixture of shops and restaurants.  Expand out to clusters of subdivisions on both sides of the mountain, spreading out to touch Decatur, Clarkston, Lithonia, and Lilburn.  The area is close to downtown and midtown, with public transportation available, close to suburbs that are farther out, easy access to interstate highways, but with a lovely neighborhood feel.   You have the advantages of being close to the city, but not too close.

            Is this also an outdoor rug that I can use on my deck?
        
Asked by: BT

            Hello,
              This rug can be used outside but we do not recommend leaving it outside for extended amounts of time as the weather would impact and fade the color.

        Not bad but not great
Looks nice but the color is nothing like the picture. It's more of a dark burgundy than a true Iowa state red. Probably not worth the money

This is a pretty big throw rug I currently have in my basement. The design is spot on and very clear. So far the rug is highly durable and overall a great value for the price.
