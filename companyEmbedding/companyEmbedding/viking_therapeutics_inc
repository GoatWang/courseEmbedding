Steer Clear Of Viking Therapeutics' IPO - Viking Therapeutics (NASDAQ:VKTX) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»Steer Clear Of Viking Therapeutics' IPOSep.16.14 | About: Viking Therapeutics (VKTX) Don Dion Long/short equity, special situations, momentum, event-drivenMarketplaceIPO InsightsSummaryVKTX, a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical firm developing treatments for metabolic and endocrine disorders, plans to raise $55.0 million in its upcoming IPO.Though VKTX does have a broad portfolio of product candidates, none of them are any where near the point of commercialization.Even if VKTX’s lead product candidate did receive regulatory approval, it could likely struggle to effectively market its products against the likes of Johnson & Johnson and Merck.We plan to avoid this IPO.Viking Therapeutics, Inc (NASDAQ:VKTX), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical firm developing treatments for metabolic and endocrine disorders, plans to raise $55.0 million in its upcoming IPO.
The San Diego, California-based firm will offer 5.0 million shares at an expected price range of $10-$12 per share. If the IPO finds the midpoint of that range at $11 per share, VKTX will command a market value of $167 million.
VKTX filed on July 1, 2014.
Lead Underwriters: Oppenheimer and Co., Inc; Roth Capital Partners, Inc
Underwriters: Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC; MLV & Co. LLC; Summer Street Research Partners
Summary: Development of Therapies for Metabolic and Endocrine Disorders
VKTX is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical firm seeking to develop therapies for metabolic and endocrine disorders. The firm currently has a portfolio of five drug candidates in clinical or pre-clinical trials, the most advanced of which is VK0612, which is entering a Phase 2b clinical trial for type 2 diabetes scheduled to commence in early 2015 and to be completed in 2016. VK0612 helps to regulate blood glucose levels in diabetes patients by inhibiting an enzyme involved in the body's synthesis of glucose. VKTX's portfolio also includes treatments targeting Cancer Cachexia, Dyslipedmia, Obesity Dyslipidemia, and anemia. Of these treatments, only VK5211 for Cancer Cachexia has begun clinical trials.


(Source)
VKTX's drug candidates are based on small molecules licensed from Ligand Pharmaceuticals. Ligand plans to purchase approximately $5 million in VKTX share in the upcoming IPO.
President and CEO Brian Lian, Ph.D. has served in his current roles and as a director of VKTX since its 2012 inception. He previously served as Managing Director and Senior Research Analyst at SunTrust Robinson Humphrey and as Managing Director and Senior Research Analyst at Global Hunter Securities. He also worked as Senior Healthcare Analyst at The Agave Group, LLC and an Executive Director and Senior Biotechnology Analyst at CIBC World Markets. He also has performed scientific research with Amgen and Microcide Pharmaceuticals.
Dr. Lian received an MBA in accounting and finance from Indiana University, an MS and Ph.D. in organic chemistry from The University of Michigan, and a BA in chemistry from Whitman College.
Potential Competition From Merck, J&J, Eli Lilly, and Others
If VKTX's product candidates receive regulatory approval, they will face competition both from currently marketed treatments for similar indications and from advanced treatments currently in clinical and pre-clinical development.
Some of these competing products are marketed by firms with significantly greater financial or technical capacities than VKTX, such as Merck & Co. (NYSE:MRK), Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY), Takeda Pharmaceutical Company, and Morphosys AG.
Valuation
VKTX offers the following figures in its S-1 balance sheet for the six months ended June 30, 2014:
Revenue: $0.00
Net Loss: ($23,011,729.00)
Total Assets: $2,014,090.00
Total Liabilities: $25,271,974.00
Stockholders' Equity: ($23,257,000.00)
VKTX's current lack of revenues is not unusual in a pre-commercial biopharmaceutical firm, and should not be taken as an indication of the firm's potential for future success. The firm will not be able to generate substantial revenues until one or more of its candidates have received regulatory approval and have been successfully commercialized.

Conclusion: Steer Clear
We plan to avoid this IPO.
Though VKTX does have a broad portfolio of product candidates, none of them are any where near the point of commercialization.
Even if the firm's lead product candidate did receive regulatory approval, it would face significant competition both from current treatments for diabetes and potentially from the numerous other products being developed for diabetes.
VKTX would likely struggle to effectively market its products against the likes of Johnson & Johnson and Merck.
We believe that there are better buys available for investors interested in biopharmaceutical IPOs.

Viking Therapeutics   –  EPOR Agonist Program

































































 






EPOR Agonist Program

Overview and Profile
Erythropoietin (EPO) acts on its receptor to stimulate the differentiation of bone marrow hematopoietic cells to form red blood cells. Various recombinant human EPO derivatives are marketed as erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) for the treatment of anemia due to renal failure or cancer chemotherapy (e.g., AranespTM, EpogenTM, EprexTM, and ProcritTM).

Epogen Receptor Activation Stimulates Multiple Signaling Pathway

Activation of downstream signaling pathways results in proliferation, survival (anti-apoptosis) and differentiation of thyroid progenitor cells into red blood cells


We are developing a series of orally-available, small molecule agonists of the EPO receptor that may provide additional benefit in the treatment of anemia with improved safety, tolerability, and patient acceptance due to the convenience of oral administration and the lack of excessive erythropoietic stimulation.  Anemia results from a decrease in red blood cells and is typically experienced by patients with renal complications, cancer patients and HIV/AIDS patients.  These patients currently receive recombinant human EPO and other erythropoiesis-stimulating agents, or ESAs. 
 Several small molecule EPOR agonists have been identified with encouraging in vitro and in vivo profiles.  We plan to conduct further pre-clinical and clinical development in pursuit of a potential IND filing.

Viking Therapeutics   –  DGAT-1 Inhibitor Program

































































 






DGAT-1 Inhibitor Program

Overview and Profile
DiacylGlycerol Acyl Transferase-1 (DGAT-1) is a key enzyme involved in the formation of triglycerides and is highly expressed in human fat metabolism sites such as intestine, liver, and adipose.  Dietary triglycerides cannot be absorbed directly in the gastrointestinal, or GI, tract and are broken down into free fatty acids and monoglycerol in the intestine by pancreatic lipase.  Once absorbed, the free fatty acids and glycerol are reassembled into triglycerides at the site of absorption, called an enterocyte, and packaged into chylomicron particles to be transported in the lymphatic system to be used throughout the body.  DGAT-1 is one of two enzymes that catalyze the steps of triglyceride biosynthesis from mono- or diacylglycerol and fatty acids, and is mainly distributed in the intestine, liver and adipose tissue.
 
DGAT-1 Mediates Absorption of Fats from the GI Tract

Inhibition of DGAT-1 in the enterocyte reduces post-prandial fat deposition; increases nutrient sensing, satiety. 
Inhibition of the enzyme has shown to reduce fat storage in animal models and clinical trials, leading to reduction of body weight. However, non-selective systemic reduction of fat formation can lead to undesirable side effects demonstrated in DGAT-1 null mice.  By introducing a unique chemical function group into the DGAT-1 inhibitors, Viking is developing a series of lead compounds that selectively inhibited DGAT-1 at enterocytes, the intestinal absorptive cells responsible for the absorption of dietary fat, and that demonstrated efficacy in animal models of dietary induced obesity.

The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.
