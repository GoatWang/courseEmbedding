Our approach

Leaders of small and mid-sized businesses have multiple roles and competing priorities. You want a best-in-class retirement plan but may be unsure about all the complexities and requirements. You may be uncertain about the costs and fees involved. You need a provider focused solely on retirement and aligned with your needs and goals—and fully committed to you, your participants, and the ongoing improvement of retirement investing.

Vanguard is committed to the retirement business and is a leader in the retirement plan industry. Best of all, you can benefit from Vanguard's unique ownership structure: We're owned by our clients and not by outside investors or stockholders. That means you never need to question whose interests come first for us. This approach serves as a foundation for all that we do with Vanguard Retirement Plan Access™, our 401(k) offer for small and mid-sized plans. You can count on our expertise to remove the uncertainties from managing your plan and our leadership to help you offer a strong plan for your participants. 



Key benefits




You can:

Have confidence in your plan.
Understand your costs.
Focus on your business.





Cost-conscious?
As a business owner and plan fiduciary, you want to eliminate ambiguity in retirement plan costs. Research has shown that plan costs for the smaller end of the market tend to be higher, and you need a retirement plan provider that not only provides transparent pricing but has a fair and reasonable cost structure.1
With Vanguard Retirement Plan Access:

You receive an All-in Fee Report that shows the total cost of your plan.
You have access to low-cost Vanguard index funds, plus the opportunity to choose from among more than 12,000 non-Vanguard funds.
Your annual recordkeeping price is based on a per-participant fee—a fee that doesn't jump as your assets grow, as with many small to mid-sized retirement plans.
You have flexibility in how you cover your plan costs—including a recordkeeping credit depending on the share class selected.




Too busy?
 As a business owner, you're pressed for time and focused on many aspects of business. With Vanguard Retirement Plan Access, you can rely on high-quality recordkeeping and administration to ease your administrative burden and help your employees stay on track for retirement.

Thornburg Mutual Funds









































Thornburg Investment Management offers a variety of mutual funds that can serve as critical components of a diversified portfolio. We seek to add value with active portfolio management
to help investors reach their long-term goals. Now more
than 30 years into our mission,
Thornburg’s
investment
lineup represents a wide range of fixed income
and equity
solutions. Each of our offerings
originated organically
from responsible, sustainable growth, applying the same
fundamental research and team approach we have
practiced over time.

Thornburg offers a different point of view—a broader
outlook
on the financial landscape. Our disciplined
portfolio
construction, flexible perspective, and collaborative
structure are the reasons why it’s more than what
we do. It’s how we do it.

Investments carry risks, including possible loss of principal.  Additional risks may be associated with investments outside the United States, especially in emerging markets, including currency fluctuations, illiquidity, volatility, and political and economic risks.  Investments in small- and mid-capitalization companies may increase the risk of greater price fluctuations. Portfolios investing in bonds have the same interest rate, inflation, and credit risks that are associated with the underlying bonds. The value of bonds will fluctuate relative to changes in interest rates, decreasing when interest rates rise.  This effect is more pronounced for longer-term bonds.  Unlike bonds, bond funds have ongoing fees and expenses. Investments in mortgage backed securities (MBS) may bear additional risk. Investments in lower rated and unrated bonds may be more sensitive to default, downgrades, and market volatility; these investments may also be less liquid than higher rated bonds. Investments in derivatives are subject to the risks associated with the securities or other assets underlying the pool of securities, including illiquidity and difficulty in valuation. A short position will lose value as the security's price increases. Theoretically, the loss on a short sale can be unlimited. Investments in the Funds are not FDIC insured, nor are they bank deposits or guaranteed by a bank or any other entity.  
The performance data quoted represents past performance; it does not guarantee future results.
Income earned from municipal bonds is exempt from regular federal and in some cases, state and local income tax. Income may be subject to the alternative minimum tax (AMT).
Class I shares may not be available to all investors. Minimum investments for the I share class may be higher than those for other classes.
To determine a fund's Morningstar Rating™, funds and other managed products with at least a three-year history are ranked in their categories by their Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return scores. The top 10% receive 5 stars; the next 22.5%, 4 stars; the middle 35%, 3 stars; the next 22.5%, 2 stars; and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. The Risk-Adjusted Return accounts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance (excluding sales charges), placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. Other share classes may have different performance characteristics. © 2017 Morningstar, Inc. All Rights Reserved. The information contained herein: (1) is proprietary to Morningstar and/or its content providers; (2) may not be copied or distributed; and (3) is not warranted to be accurate, complete or timely.

Thornburg Investment Management: About Us









































Building Real Wealth for More Than 30 Years

Founded in 1982 by Garrett Thornburg, Thornburg Investment Management (Thornburg) is an independent global investment management firm that provides a range of active investment strategies to serve a broad spectrum of client needs.

Headquartered in Santa Fe, New Mexico, Thornburg is geographically removed from the world’s major financial centers. Being far from the status quo investment arena inspires us to think outside of popular opinion and base our decisions on unconventional wisdom and a larger frame of reference.

Many investment managers may do what we do. Setting us apart from them, however, is how we do it: how we think, how we invest, and how we’re structured. 



Our Flexible Perspective 
We bring a more flexible perspective than that of other investment firms. We view a wider range of opportunities and look beyond conventional boundaries to find hidden value.
Constant Collaboration 
We collectively hone ideas via borderless  cross-pollination across our investment team for better judgement and competitive  results.
 

 

By Conviction, Not Convention 
We invest differently. We take a disciplined approach to portfolio construction, guided more by convictions than convention. 

  Rather than using benchmarks as our starting point, we apply active management to seek the best value for our clients. Thorough analysis and our relative-value framework lead to conviction in our securities selection, which may result in a focused portfolio. 
 

 

Our Team Approach
 Thornburg’s collaborative, relative-value research structure is such that we consider all members of the investment team to be resources for all of the firm’s strategies. All analysts may make contributions to multiple strategies. 

Portfolio managers also serve as research analysts. This allows them to integrate with, rather than be separated from, the discovery of investment ideas.


Far From the Herd
 Our headquarters are located in the hills of Santa Fe, New Mexico. This allows for distraction-free idea generation away from the more conventional wisdom of large or urban-centered investment houses.

Access and Transparency
 Putting our clients first is also a key principle. Proud of our investment strategies and thoughtful of our practices, we consider transparency and openness imperative to building our investors’ trust and confidence in us.

Always Independent 
 From the beginning, we have thrived through private ownership and we are firmly committed to this structure. Our independence removes the distractions of  a corporate parent and  lets us focus on what we’re supposed to do:  generate attractive investment returns over time.
 
We seek to add value with active portfolio management to help investors reach their long-term goals. Now more than 30 years into our mission, Thornburg’s Investment lineup represents a wide range of fixed income, equity and liquid alternative solutions.

Actively Managed. Structured for Excellence.
 Far from the groupthink of Wall Street, we can offer clients a broader, unconstrained view of the financial landscape to help them reach their long-term goals.





Everyone on the investment team– from our fixed income to equities experts – spend time together debating, disagreeing, critiquing and learning from one another. The result is a steady flow of better, more unconventional ideas.
Jason Brady, President and CEO

Our approach

Leaders of small and mid-sized businesses have multiple roles and competing priorities. You want a best-in-class retirement plan but may be unsure about all the complexities and requirements. You may be uncertain about the costs and fees involved. You need a provider focused solely on retirement and aligned with your needs and goals—and fully committed to you, your participants, and the ongoing improvement of retirement investing.

Vanguard is committed to the retirement business and is a leader in the retirement plan industry. Best of all, you can benefit from Vanguard's unique ownership structure: We're owned by our clients and not by outside investors or stockholders. That means you never need to question whose interests come first for us. This approach serves as a foundation for all that we do with Vanguard Retirement Plan Access™, our 401(k) offer for small and mid-sized plans. You can count on our expertise to remove the uncertainties from managing your plan and our leadership to help you offer a strong plan for your participants. 



Key benefits




You can:

Have confidence in your plan.
Understand your costs.
Focus on your business.





Cost-conscious?
As a business owner and plan fiduciary, you want to eliminate ambiguity in retirement plan costs. Research has shown that plan costs for the smaller end of the market tend to be higher, and you need a retirement plan provider that not only provides transparent pricing but has a fair and reasonable cost structure.1
With Vanguard Retirement Plan Access:

You receive an All-in Fee Report that shows the total cost of your plan.
You have access to low-cost Vanguard index funds, plus the opportunity to choose from among more than 12,000 non-Vanguard funds.
Your annual recordkeeping price is based on a per-participant fee—a fee that doesn't jump as your assets grow, as with many small to mid-sized retirement plans.
You have flexibility in how you cover your plan costs—including a recordkeeping credit depending on the share class selected.




Too busy?
 As a business owner, you're pressed for time and focused on many aspects of business. With Vanguard Retirement Plan Access, you can rely on high-quality recordkeeping and administration to ease your administrative burden and help your employees stay on track for retirement.
