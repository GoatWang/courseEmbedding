My Story and Services


About Bill
Bill has been with Morgan Stanley and its predecessor firms for more than 20 years. He joined Legg Mason (which was later acquired by Morgan Stanley), and serves as a long-time branch manager. In this role, Bill became familiar with the firm's extensive palette of services and offerings. Over the years, he has developed a process that helps clients as they near retirement, and keeps working for them for the rest of their lives. His plans are designed to help people make informed decisions about their lives; by answering questions about what they can afford, whether they have enough money, his goal is to help them enjoy their retirement years. Bill's investments are designed to help see people through their retirements -he uses an investment strategy called Time-Segmented Bucketing to divide client assets into various time-frames, so their money is invested based on whey they will need it. This strategy is aimed at achieving the goals that they have.A Maine native, Bill is a son of Aroostook County. His undergraduate degree was earned at Bates College in Lewiston, ME. Bill and his wife Joan raised their three (now grown) children in South Portland, ME where he and Joan still live today. Former and current board memberships include the South Portland Public Library, church finance committee, Catherine McAuley High School, and President of the Holy Cross Home and School Association. A life-long exercise enthusiast, Bill enjoys a weekly tennis game with friends, is frustrated by his golf game and recently completed the Authentic Marathon in Athens, Greece.

Our Clients

Specialize in retirementAs people approach or enter retirement, financial needs change. We focus specifically on this life stage, crafting strategies and tactics designed to reach your goals. Wealth management is complicated – by specializing in this particular area, we help make it simpler.Dynamic, interactive retirement strategy“Will I have enough to retire on if I do (blank)?” Many people want to see what would happen if they retire early, or purchase a second home. Our plans are dynamic and interactive, so it’s easy to manipulate whatever variable you want to answer your most pressing questions.Income-focused investment alternativesIt’s not uncommon for investors to focus more on reducing risk and generating income as they approach or enter retirement. Most traditional income-producing investments offer such low returns these days that investors are seeking alternatives. We have paid particular attention to this type of investment in recent years, and can provide informed, knowledgeable opinions and recommendations for your situation.Focus on clients with moderate wealthYou have many choices when selecting a financial advisor. Why not work with someone who focuses on individuals and couples like you? Most of our clients have accumulated moderate wealth in their lives, and are primarily interested in funding their retirements successfully; that is our specialty.Experience, wisdom, steady handThe onset of retirement can be a stressful time. We have more than 30 years experience working with people in or near retirement, so we know what issues are important (and which ones are not), and how to help be sure you stay on track.
