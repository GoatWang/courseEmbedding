Item Description: ReInk Books, 2017. Softcover. Book Condition: NEW. Reprinted from edition. Volume: NIST Technical Note 1391 Language: eng. NO changes have been made to the original text. This is NOT a retyped or an ocr'd reprint. Illustrations, Index, if any, are included in black and white. Each page is checked manually before printing. As this reprint is from very old book, there could be some missing or flawed pages, but we always try to make the book as complete as possible. Fold-outs, if any, are not part of the book. If the original book was published in multiple volumes then this reprint is of only one volume, not the whole set. This paperback book is SEWN, where the book block is actually sewn (smythe sewn/section sewn) with thread before binding which results in a more durable type of paperback binding. It can also be open wide. The pages will not fall out and will be around for a lot longer than normal paperbacks. This print on demand book is printed on high quality acid-free paper. Original Publisher: National Institute of Standards and Technology (U.S.) 50 pages Volume: NIST Technical Note 1391.  Bookseller Inventory # 457950620

Lexmark appoints David Reeder as chief financial officer

						 from   Lexmark International, Inc. 











 
















































 

 




















 


LEXINGTON, Ky., Dec. 22, 2014 /PRNewswire/ --

Lexmark International, Inc. (NYSE:   LXK) today announced the appointment of David Reeder as vice president and chief financial officer (CFO), effective Jan. 9, 2015.  

Reeder has been CFO for Electronics for Imaging (NASDAQ:   EFII) since January 2014, with responsibilities for finance, accounting, IT, real estate, security and treasury, audit, tax and investor relations. 

From 2012 until 2014, he was vice president and CFO for Cisco's Enterprise Networking Division, a multi-billion dollar revenue organization. 

Reeder also served in manufacturing and operations management for Broadcom Corporation from 2007 until 2012. Prior to this role, he served in finance and operations roles for both Texas Instruments and the Millipore Corporation, which is now EMD Millipore. 

Reeder holds a bachelor's degree in chemical engineering from the University of Arkansas and a master's degree in business administration from Southern Methodist University. 

Lexmark's interim CFO, Gary Stromquist, will remain with the company and resume his duties as vice president of finance for Lexmark's Imaging Solutions and Services division and the Corporate Finance group.  
Supporting Quotes:
"I am pleased to appoint David to Lexmark's leadership team," said Paul Rooke, Lexmark chairman and chief executive officer. "David's experience with hardware and software solutions markets, combined with his finance and operations experience, make him the ideal executive to help drive Lexmark's performance as the company continues to transform into a leading provider of solutions that help customers solve their unstructured information challenges.
"Further, on behalf of the Board of Directors, shareholders and employees, I would like to thank Gary for his leadership as the interim CFO during this transition period," Rooke added.  
"Lexmark continues to innovate and has made tremendous progress toward helping customers seamlessly manage their unstructured data," said David Reeder, Lexmark's incoming chief financial officer. "I very much look forward to joining Lexmark's leadership team and engaging with the broader Lexington community."
