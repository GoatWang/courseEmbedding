Investment Services

Successful Investing begins with clearly defined goals: building a family business, planning for retirement, passing on a legacy. Your goals direct your investment strategy.
Our investment managers must first understand what you need and want to accomplish with the capital you entrust us to manage. We will work extensively with you to define your investment objectives, assess your risk tolerances and, finally, design a strategy to achieve your objectives.
The ideal blend of assets is one that maximizes the return potential of your portfolio while keeping you comfortable with the risk involved. Once we understand your investment goals and desired safety level, we then build your investment portfolio with individual securities to achieve this optimum balance. Typically, fixed income investments are introduced to your portfolio to increase current income and reduce volatility, while equity investments are used to expose the portfolio to growth opportunities. 
We offer portfolio diversification through our Core and Satellite approach. Depending on your objectives, you may consider supplementing your core holdings with additional asset classes which may offer lower portfolio volatility.  Examples include non-proprietary institutional class Mutual Funds and Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) in the US Small Cap, US Mid Cap and International markets. We also offer alternative investments such as Commodities, High Yield and Real Estate.
Managing information is fundamental to managing money.  As an investor today, you have ready access to more information than ever before. But do you really have the right information, or the time and resources to bring that information into critical focus?
We do.
Strategy for the serious investor focuses on the future. Investing is a long term proposition. Wise investing is a lifetime process.
At Hilliard Lyons Trust Company we adhere to a philosophy emphasizing long term ownership of high quality businesses. We seek consistent, steady returns without assuming excessive risk or generating costly portfolio turnover. It is a strategy designed both to preserve and enhance our clients' wealth. We believe our approach meaningfully reduces the risk of significant and permanent loss of capital and yet, affords ample opportunity for superior returns.

Diversification, rebalancing and buying up devalued stock may help stabilize an investment portfolio for the short term, but to navigate potential economic storm clouds in the future, every investor needs a trusted financial advisor to set up solid objectives and an overall strategy.

Long-term care options are broader than you think – if you act in time

When we are young and healthy, we imagine that we are “bulletproof.” We prefer not think about how we would take care of ourselves and our families financially if we became ill or disabled. But that’s precisely when we should think about it – long before a debilitating health event occurs.

Create the legacy you choose and make the challenge of transferring your wealth less challenging
When you have a substantial amount of wealth, transferring your assets to your loved ones can be complicated. Rather than allowing taxes to eat away at your legacy, take advantage of the strategies and tools available to preserve the wealth you have accumulated. Hilliard Lyons—in conjunction with its affiliate company, Hilliard Lyons Trust Company, LLC and your own attorneys and accountants — can develop a wealth transfer plan that takes into account your hopes and dreams for your family, any special needs they may have, your philanthropic goals, and the amount of money you need to retain for your own purposes. and your own attorneys and accountants
Transferring Wealth Effectively
If you’re not careful, taxes can quickly erode your estate. There are steps you can take today to better protect your assets for your beneficiaries.
The key to effective estate planning is to minimize the taxes that will be imposed on your heirs. Transferring assets to your children or other beneficiaries, such as charitable causes, over the course of your lifetime can substantially reduce the taxable value of your estate at death.
Hilliard Lyons Trust Company can help you sort through the myriad of wealth transfer strategies which can help you maximize the value of your estate and achieve your desired goals.
Making the most of your assets requires an understanding of complex tax laws and a strategy which effectively removes assets from your taxable estate. Hilliard Lyons can help you figure out how much you can comfortably afford to give away and the best ways to do so. This will depend upon a number of factors, such as the size of your portfolio, your time horizon and your goals for the future. We will help you determine how much you need to keep to meet your own needs, and the best ways to give away the assets you don’t need.
You can use gifting strategies, set up trusts or make charitable contributions as ways of meeting your estate planning goals. It typically makes sense to start by giving away assets that are most likely to appreciate. It also makes sense to take advantage of tax-advantaged gifting strategies. Taxpayers are allowed to give away $14,000 per beneficiary ($28,000 for married couples) per year without being subject to gift tax, and make an unlimited amount of educational or medical gifts provided they are paid directly to an institution.
For those with significant wealth, these strategies may not be enough to transfer a sufficient amount of assets. Hilliard Lyons Trust Company can help with other, more sophisticated and tax-efficient ways to transfer wealth, such as setting up a Charitable Remainder Trust or establishing a private foundation.
Trust services are offered through Hilliard Lyons Trust Company, LLC, an affiliate of J.J.B. Hilliard, W.L. Lyons, LLC. J.J.B. Hilliard, W.L. Lyons, LLC does not offer tax or legal advice. Please consult your tax advisor ot attorney before making any decision that may affect your tax or legal situation.
