                                    Patents by Inventor Kevin J. Zugibe
                                




                    Kevin J. Zugibe has filed for patents to protect the following inventions. This listing includes patent applications that are pending as well as patents that have already been granted by the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO).
                







Hydraulic system for recovering refrigerants



Patent number:  5502974
                                            

Abstract:  A hydraulic refrigerant recovery system and method moves refrigerant liquid or refrigerant vapor. Substantial pressure is developed by the hydraulic unit for moving a substantially larger piston to increase the pumping rate for refrigerant. Only the size of the inlet line for the hydraulic unit limits the pumping capacity, unlike the capability experienced previously with pneumatic motion for refrigerant liquids. The invention system includes a hydraulic pump, oil reservoir, a hydraulic cylinder, a spool valve and a limit switch assembly.
                        

Type: 
                                                    Grant
                                            

Filed: 
                        September 1, 1994
                    

Date of Patent: 
                                                        April 2, 1996
                        

Assignee: 
                                                                        Hudson Technologies, Inc.
                                

Inventor: 
                                                                
                                Kevin J. Zugibe
                            





Method and apparatus for refrigerant reclamation



Patent number:  5377499
                                            

Abstract:  A method and apparatus for reclaiming refrigerant are described to include a bypass line for hot gas is coupled to a distillation liquid temperature control, which controls the temperature of the system to remain at a very low temperature setting in order to prevent moisture carry-over, and maintain an exact liquid level. The distillation chamber itself contains a heat exchange system and comprises an outlet subsystem for distilled refrigerant, as well as an inlet for contaminated refrigerant. Vapor forms above the liquid in the chamber which is discharged into a compressor, which feeds back hot gases through a helical coil arrangement immersed in the distillation chamber. The compressor alternatively bypasses the helical coil under the control of the temperature controller. In either event, either from the bypass or from the coil a small air cooled dispenser dissipates heat from the compressor work.
