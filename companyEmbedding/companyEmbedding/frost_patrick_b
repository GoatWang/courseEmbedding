Kelley and Pat Frost Endowed Scholarship in Business
Resources





The Kelley and Pat Frost Endowed Scholarship in Business was established by the Board of Regents of The University of Texas System on Aug. 10, 2009, to benefit The University of Texas McCombs School of Business. Gift funds were provided by Kelley L. and Patrick B. Frost.


Pat Frost

Pat Frost earned his MBA from the McCombs School of Business in 1984. He is president of San Antonio-based Frost Bank, which was founded by his great-great-grandfather 144 years ago. He began his career at Frost Bank in 1984 and has been president of the bank since 1993.Pat feels blessed that he was able to create an endowment and give back to the university he loves. He is so proud of The University of Texas that he says, “God bless the Texas Longhorns” on his voicemail message. He is also proud to have his MBA professional report “Securities Activities of Commercial Banks” in UT’s Perry-Castañeda Library. Pat was named “Outstanding Young Texas Ex” by the University of Texas Ex-Students Association, “Outstanding Young Man of the Year” by the San Antonio Junior Chamber of Commerce, and with his wife, Kelley, was honored as United Way Volunteer of the Year-Family Service.
