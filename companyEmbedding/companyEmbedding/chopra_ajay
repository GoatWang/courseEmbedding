Employees







Chopra Ajay
Owner


















Before you Hire

Here are some rules, regulations, and laws governing general contractors
in New York:













Does Chopra Ajay carry a valid contracting license?



Any person or business involved in a home improvement project more than $200 must get a license from the Department of Consumer Affairs to operate legally in New York.
Chopra Ajay currently holds license 032351 (Architecture), which was Active when we last checked. 











How important is contractor licensing in New York?



New York City maintains high standards for licensing. To obtain a home improvement license, applicants must pass a written exam.











Your liability risk when hiring Chopra Ajay



Licensed contractors in NYC are required to carry workers' compensation insurance.











Financial recourse when hiring Chopra Ajay



Licensed contractors contribute $200 to DCA's Trust Fund at the time of application and each time they renew or post a bond. DCA's Trust Fund reimburses homeowners who hired a licensed contractor who subsequently damaged their home and went out of business or left town.











What else should I know before hiring Chopra Ajay



NYC home improvement contractors are required to submit a copy of their fingerprints to the DCA and pass a criminal background check.











How is the BuildZoom score calculated?



The BuildZoom score is based on a number of factors including the contractor's license status, insurance status, verified work history, standing with local consumer interest groups, verified reviews from other BuildZoom users and self-reported feedback from the contractor.











Why you should hire through BuildZoom



When it comes to major construction work or even minor alterations to your home, hiring the wrong contractor could result in incomplete or defective work. You may even find yourself dealing with huge liability claims. BuildZoom does the homework for you and helps you hire the right contractor.











You should get several bids before hiring a contractor



The NYC Department of Consumer Affairs recommends getting at least three written bids before hiring a contractor. Do not automatically accept the lowest bid - an abnormally low bid may indicate the contractor made a mistake and is not including the same work quoted by their competitors. We've made the bid collection process extremely simple (and free). Just click here to get started.

BuildZoom has one simple purpose: To help you find the perfect contractor
for any job, commercial or residential.

not have a license - please

and we’ll try to help!

Parineeti Chopra‘s upcoming film alongside Ayushmann Khurrana, Meri Pyaari Bindu is up for a May 12, 2017 release and she is leaving no stones unturned to promote the film. In fact not just her even her Golmaal team is helping her promoting the film albeit a unique way. Every now and then Ajay Devgn posts a pic from the sets of Golmaal Again, promoting Meri Pyaari Bindu. Just like last time when they promoted the song, this time Ajay Devgn as well as Arshad Warsi posted a pic of the Golmaal gang standing around a cutout of actress Bindu, while Parineeti Chopra is seen standing next to them fully amused. The pic features Ajay Devgn, Arshad Warsi, Tusshar Kapoor, Kunal Kemmu, Shreyas Talpade and Parineeti Chopra.
While Ajay Devgn captioned the image with just two hashtags, “#MeriPyaariBindu#GolmaalAgain”, Arshad Warsi posted the same image with caption, “Team #GolmaalAgain loves #MeriPyaariBindu”. Also read: Parineeti Chopra and Ajay Devgn have got the Golmaal swag right! – view pic
Check out the hilarious image as well as the two twitter posts by Ajay Devgn and Arshad Warsi below:

Earlier when Parineeti Chopra had released her debut song as a singer, Maana Ke Hum Yaar Nahin from Meri Pyaari Bindu she has made sure the Golmaal gang gets enough of it. It so happened that Parineeti, who was damn excited for her music debut, made the Golmaal 4 boys listen to the song almost 10 times! Ajay shared this pic on Insta where he and the entire Golmaal 4 team is seen sleeping while Parineeti is loving every bit of the song. “This is the 10th time today we are being forced to see #MaanaKeHumYaarNahin, but still loving it! Great job @ParineetiChopra!,” he captioned the pic on Insta. Also read: The most menacing Golmaal villain joins Ajay Devgn, Parineeti Chopra for the fourth installment
