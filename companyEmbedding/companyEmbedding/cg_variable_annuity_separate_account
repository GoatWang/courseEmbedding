Participation and Protection: With No Annual Fees




When planning for retirement, you can’t risk everything and you can’t protect everything.
But there is a way to have some of both.










A Shield Annuity from Brighthouse Financial can help you use a portion of your assets to take advantage of market
            growth with a level of downside protection that other options may not provide. Shield is designed to provide
            some protection in an unpredictable endeavor — investing.





Protect your retirement assets
A Brighthouse Shield Annuity is designed to provide a level of protection that, when markets inevitably turn volatile,
            ensures your losses are limited.



Participate in growth opportunities
With a Shield Annuity, balance is built-in. This means that even with the protection you enjoy, you can still take
            advantage of growth opportunities in the market up to a certain percentage.



Pay no annual fees
Unlike many financial products, you pay no annual fees with a Shield Annuity.

                                            Your Retirement Big Picture: Where Do Annuities Fit?

1 Guarantees are subject to the financial strength and claims-paying ability of the issuing insurance company.
2 Shield annuities do not invest directly in any index.
3 Product guarantees are subject to the financial strength and claims-paying ability of the issuing insurance company and are solely the responsibility of the issuing insurance company. Annuities and life insurance are issued by Brighthouse Life Insurance Company, Charlotte, NC 28277 and in New York, only by Brighthouse Life Insurance Company of NY, New York, NY 10017 and not by MetLife.
If you're buying an annuity to fund a qualified retirement plan or IRA, you should do so for the annuity's features and benefits other than tax deferral. That's because tax deferral is not an additional benefit of the annuity. References throughout this material to tax advantage, such as tax deferral and tax-free transfers, are subject to this consideration. In addition, non-qualified annuity contracts owned by corporations do not receive tax deferral on earnings. 

Prospectuses for variable annuities issued by a Brighthouse Financial insurance company, and for the investment portfolios offered thereunder, are available from Brighthouse Financial. The contract prospectus contains information about the contract's features, risks, charges and expenses. The investment objectives, risks and policies of the investment options, as well as other information about the investment options, are described in their respective prospectuses. Please read the prospectuses and consider this information carefully before investing. There is no guarantee that any of the variable investment options in a variable annuity product will meet their stated goals or objectives. The account value is subject to market fluctuations and investment risk so that, when withdrawn, it may be worth more or less than its original value even when an optional protection benefit rider is elected. Product availability and features may vary by state. Please refer to the contract prospectus for more complete details regarding the living and death benefits.

Annuities are long-term investments designed for retirement purposes. Brighthouse Financial annuities have limitations, exclusions, charges, termination provisions and terms for keeping them in force. All contract guarantees, including optional living and death benefit riders and annuity payout rates, are backed by the claims-paying ability and financial strength of issuing insurance company. They are not backed by the broker/dealer from which an annuity is purchased, by the insurance agency where an annuity is purchased, or any affiliates to those entities, and none makes any representations or guarantees regarding the claims-paying ability and financial strength of the issuing insurance company. Similarity, the issuing insurance company and the underwriter do not back the financial strength of the broker/dealer or its affiliates. Please contact your financial professional for complete details. 

Withdrawals of taxable amounts are subject to ordinary income tax and if made before age 59½, may be subject to a 10% federal income tax penalty. Some broker/dealers and financial professionals may refer to the 10% federal income tax penalty as an "additional tax" or "additional income tax" or use the terms interchangeably when discussing withdrawals taken prior to age 59½. Distributions of taxable amounts from a non-qualified annuity may also be subject to the 3.8% Unearned Income Medicare Contribution Tax on Net Investment Income if your modified adjusted gross income exceeds the applicable threshold amount. Withdrawals will reduce the living and death benefits and account value. Withdrawals may be subject to withdrawal charges. 

Any discussion of taxes is for general informational purposes only, does not purport to be complete or cover every situation, and should not be construed as legal, tax, or accounting advice. You should confer with your qualified legal, tax, and accounting advisors as appropriate.

Brighthouse Financial, an operating segment of MetLife, Inc. (NYSE: MET), announced on March 6, 2017 that it is now offering its suite of life insurance and annuity products under the Brighthouse Financial brand. 
*Data as of March 31, 2017. Total assets includes certain adjustments for transactions associated with the separation from MetLife, Inc.

Ratings as of May 2017. Operating entities collectively rated include Brighthouse Life Insurance Company (BLIC), NELICO, and Brighthouse Life Insurance Company of NY (BLNY); note, Moody’s and Fitch do not rate BLNY.
A.M. Best’s Financial Strength Rating is an independent opinion of an insurer’s financial strength and ability to meet its ongoing insurance policy and contract obligations. A Financial Strength Rating is not assigned to specific insurance policies or contracts and does not address any other risk, including, but not limited to, an insurer’s claims-payment policies or procedures; the ability of the insurer to dispute or deny claims payment on grounds of misrepresentation or fraud; or any specific liability contractually borne by the policy or contract holder. A Financial Strength Rating is not a recommendation to purchase, hold, or terminate any insurance policy, contract or any other financial obligation issued by an insurer, nor does it address the suitability of any particular policy or contract, for a specific purpose or purchaser. Ratings explanations can be found at www.ambest.com.
Fitch’s Insurer Financial Strength Rating provides an assessment of the financial strength of an insurance organization. The Insurer Financial Strength Rating is assigned to the insurance company’s policyholder obligations, including assumed reinsurance obligations and contract holder obligations, such as guaranteed investment contracts. Ratings explanations can be found at www.fitchratings.com.
Moody’s Insurance Financial Strength Rating is an opinion of the ability of an insurance company to pay punctually senior policyholder claims and obligations and also reflect the expected financial loss suffered in the event of default. Specific obligations are considered unrated unless they are individually rated because the standing of a particular insurance obligation would depend on an assessment of its relative standing under those laws governing both the obligation and the insurance company. Ratings explanations can be found at www.moodys.com.
S&P Global Insurer Financial Strength Rating is a forward-looking opinion about the financial security characteristics of an insurance organization with respect to its ability to pay under its insurance policies and contracts in accordance with their terms. This opinion is not specific to any particular policy or contract, nor does it address the suitability of a particular policy or contract for a specific purpose or purchaser. Ratings explanations can be found at www.standardandpoors.com.

In order to supplement the description in the Prospectus, the following provides
additional information about CG Life and the Contracts which may be of interest 
to you, the Contract Owner.                                                     

 The Contracts -- General Provisions

The Contracts                                                                   

A Contract, attached riders, amendments, the application, and any applications  
for additional amounts, form the entire contract. Only the President, a Vice    
President, an Assistant Vice President, a Secretary, a Director, or an Assistant
Director of the Company may change or waive any provision in a Contract. Any    
changes or waivers must be in writing.                                          

We may change or amend the Contracts, if such change or amendment is necessary  
for the Contracts to comply with or take advantage of any state or Federal law, 
rule or regulation.                                                             

Loans                                                                           

The Contracts do not permit loans.                                              

Non-Participating Contracts                                                     

The Contracts do not participate or share in our profits or surplus earnings.

Misstatement of Age                                                             

If the age of the Annuitant is misstated, then we will adjust the amounts       
payable by us to those amounts that the Premium Payments would have purchased   
for the correct age. We will make these adjustments according to our effective  
rates on the Date of Issue. If we overcharge, then we will charge our next      
payments succeeding the adjustment, with interest at the rate of 6% per year,   
compounded annually. We will pay any underpayment in a lump sum.                

Assignment                                                                      

During the lifetime of the Annuitant, you, the Owner, may assign any rights     
under a Contract as security for a loan or other reasons. This does not change  
the ownership of a Contract, but your rights and the rights of any Beneficiary  
are subject to the terms of the assignments. An assignment will not bind us     
until the original assignment or a certified copy has been filed at the Customer
Service Center. We are not responsible for the validity of the assignment. An   
assignment may have adverse income tax consequences. You may not assign rights  
under                                                                           
Qualified Contracts. You should consult your legal or tax counsel before        
assigning any rights under a Contract.                                          

Evidence of Survival                                                            

We reserve the right to require evidence of the survival of any Payee at the    
time any payment to that Payee is due under the following Annuity Options: Life 
Annuity (fixed); Life Annuity with Certain Period (fixed); Cash Refund Life     
Annuity (fixed); Variable Life Annuity; Variable Life Annuity with Certain      
Period.                                                                         

Endorsement of Annuity Payments                                                 

Allstate Life Insurance Company and Allstate Life Insurance Company of New York 
("Allstate"), the administrator of the Contract, will send each annuity payment 
by check. The Payee must personally endorse each check. We may require proof of 
the Annuitant's survival.                                                       

 Investment Experience

On any Valuation Date, the Variable Account value is equal to the totals of the 
values allocated to the Contract in each Variable Sub-Account. The portion of   
your Annuity Account Value held in any Variable Sub-Account equals the number of
sub-account units allocated to a Contract multiplied by the Sub-Account         
accumulation unit value as described below.                                     

Variable Accumulation Unit Value and Variable Accumulation Value                

When we receive a Premium Payment we will credit that portion of the Premium    
Payment to be allocated to the Variable Sub-Accounts to the Variable Account in 
the form of Variable Accumulation Units. We determine how many Variable         
Accumulation Units to credit by dividing the dollar amount allocated to a       
particular Sub-Account by the Variable Accumulation Unit Value for that         
particular Sub-Account during the Valuation Period that we receive the Premium  
Payment. For the initial Premium Payment, we use the Valuation Period during    
which we accept the Premium Payment.                                            

The Variable Accumulation Unit Value for each Variable Sub-Account was          
established at $10.00 for the first Valuation Period of the particular Variable 
Sub-Account. We determine the Variable Accumulation Unit Value for the          
particular variable Sub-Account for any subsequent Valuation Period by          
multiplying the Variable Accumulation Unit Value for the particular Variable    
Sub-Account for the immediately preceding Valuation Period by the Net Investment
Factor for the particular Variable Sub-Account for such subsequent Valuation    
Period. The Variable Accumulation Unit Value for each Variable Sub-Aaccount for 
any Valuation Period is the value determined as of the end of the particular    
Valuation Period and may increase, decrease, or remain constant from Valuation  
Period to Valuation Period.                                                     

The variable accumulation value of the Annuity Account, if any, for any         
Valuation Period is equal to the sum of the value of all Variable Accumulation  
Units of each Variable Sub-Account credited to the Variable Account for such    
Valuation Period. The variable accumulation value of each Variable Sub-Account  
is determined by multiplying the number of Variable Accumulation Units, if any, 
credited to each Variable Sub-Account by the Variable Accumulation Unit Value of
the particular Variable Sub-Account for such Valuation Period.                  

 Net Investment Factor

The Net Investment Factor is an index applied to measure the investment         
performance of a variable sub-account from one Valuation Period to the next. The
Net Investment Factor may be greater or less than or equal to 1.0; therefore,   
the value of a Valuable Accumulation Unit may increase, decrease, or remain the 
same.                                                                           

The Net Investment Factor for any variable sub-account for any Valuation Period 
is determined by dividing (a) by (b) and then subtracting (c) from the result   
where:                                                                          

(a) is the net result of:                                                       

  (1)  the net asset value of a Fund Portfolio share held in the
            variable sub-account determined as of the end of the Valuation
Period, plus                                      

   (2)  the per share amount of any dividend or other distribution
        declared on the Fund portfolio shares held in the variable
               sub-account if the "ex-dividend" date occurs during the Valuation
Period, plus or minus                             

       (3)  a per share credit or charge with respect to any taxes that we
               pay or reserve for during the Valuation Period which we determine
         to be attributable to the operation of the Variable Account
Sub-account.                                      

(b)  is the net asset value of the Fund portfolio shares held in the variable   
     sub-account determined as of the end of the preceding Valuation Period; and

(c)  is the total of charges for mortality and expense risks, and the           
administrative expense fee during the Valuation Period.               

Sample Calculations and Tables

Variable Account Calculations                                                   

     Variable Accumulation Unit Value Calculation. Assume the net asset value of
a Fund portfolio share at the end of the current Valuation Period is $16.50; and
its value at the end of the immediately preceding Valuation Period was $16.46;  
the Valuation Period is one day; and no dividends or distributions caused Fund  
shares to go "ex-dividend" during the current Valuation Period. $16.50 divided  
by $16.46 is 1.002430134. Subtracting the one day risk factor for mortality and 
expense risks and the administrative expense charge of .00003723754 (the daily  
equivalent of the current total charge of 1.35% on an annual basis) gives a net 
investment factor of 1.00239289646. If the value of the Variable Accumulation   
Unit for the immediately preceding Valuation Period had been $14.7036925, the   
value for the current Valuation Period would be $14.73887691 ($14.7036925 X     
1.00239289646).                                                                 

Variable Annuity Unit Value Calculation. The assumptions in the above 
example exist. Also assume that the value of an Annuity Unit for the immediately
preceding Valuation Period had been $13.5791357. If the first variable annuity  
payment is determined by using an assumed interest rate of 3% per year, the     
value of the Annuity Unit for the current Valuation Period would be $13.61016662
($13.5791357 X 1.00239289646 (the net investment factor) X 0.999892552).        
0.999892552 is the factor, for a one day Valuation Period, that neutralizes the 
assumed interest rate of four percent (4%) per year used to establish the       
Annuity Payment Rates found in the Contract.                                    

    Variable Annuity Payment Calculation. Assume that a Participant's Variable
Annuity Account is credited with 5319.7531 Variable Accumulation Units of a     
particular variable sub-account; that the Variable Accumulation Unit Value and  
the Annuity Unit Value for the particular Variable Sub-Account for the Valuation
Period which ends immediately preceding the Annuity Date are $14.7036925 and    
$13.5791357 respectively; that the Annuity Payment Rate for the age and option  
elected is $6.52 per $1,000; and that the Annuity Unit Value on the day prior to
the second variable annuity payment date is $13.61017004. The first variable    
annuity payment would be $509.99 (5319.7531 X $14.7036925 X 6.52 divided by     
1,000). The number of Annuity Units credited would be 37.5569 ($509.99 divided  
by $13.5791357) and the second variable annuity payment would be $511.16        
(37.5569 X $13.61017004).                                                       

Fixed Account Calculation - Withdrawal Charge and Market Value Adjustment Tables

The following example illustrates the detailed calculations for a $100,000      
deposit into the Fixed Account with a guaranteed rate of 8% for a duration of   
five years. The intent of the example is to show the effect of the Market Value 
Adjustment ("MVA") and the 3% minimum guarantee under various interest rates on 
the calculation of the cash surrender value. The effect of the MVA is reflected 
in the index rate factor in column (2) and the minimum 3% guarantee is shown    
under column (4) under the "Surrender Value Calculation". The effect of the     
withdrawal charge and any taxes, such as premium taxes, is not shown. The       
"Market Value Adjustment Tables" and "Minimum Value Calculation" contain the    
explicit calculation of the index factors and the 3% minimum guarantee          
respectively.

 State Regulation of CG Life

CG Life, a Connecticut corporation, is subject to regulation by the Connecticut 
Department of Insurance. We file an annual statement with the Connecticut       
Department of Insurance each year covering our operations and reporting on the  
financial condition as of December 31 of the preceding year. Periodically, the  
Connecticut Department of Insurance or other authorities examine our liabilities
and reserves and the Variable Account. The Connecticut Department of Insurance  
also periodically conducts a full examination of our operations. In addition, we
are subject to the insurance laws and regulations of other states within which  
we are licensed to operate.                                                     

The law of the state in which the Contract is delivered governs the Contract.   
The values and benefits of each Contract are at least equal to those required by
such state.                                                                     

Administration

Allstate performs certain administrative functions relating to the Contracts,   
the Fixed Account, and the Variable Account. These functions include, among     
other things, maintaining the books and records of the Variable Account, the    
Fixed Account, and the Sub-Accounts, and maintaining records of the name,       
address, taxpayer identification number, contract number, Annuity Account number
and type, the status of each Annuity Account and other pertinent information    
necessary to the administration and operation of the Contracts. Allstate is     
responsible for servicing the Contracts, including the payment of benefits, and 
contract administration.                                                        

 Distribution of the Contracts

We are no longer offering new Contracts for sale. The Contracts have been sold  
by licensed insurance agents in those states where the Contracts may be lawfully
sold. Such agents were registered representatives of broker-dealers registered  
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 who are members of the National       
Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. ("NASD") and who have entered into      
distribution agreements with the Company and the principal underwriter for the  
Variable Account, Lincoln Financial Distributors, Inc. ("LFD"), Hartford,       
Connecticut. LFD is registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission under
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as a broker-dealer and is a member of the   
NASD. LFD also acts as the principal underwriter for certain other separate

will not be more than 8.50% of premium payments.                                

As of January 1, 1998, LFD, formerly Sagemark Consulting, formerly CIGNA        
Financial Advisors, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of CIGNA Corporation, became
a wholly owned subsidiary of The Lincoln National Life Insurance Company        
("Lincoln Life"), an Indiana corporation, whose principal businesses are        
insurance and financial services. Lincoln Life is wholly owned by Lincoln       
National Corporation, a publicly-held insurance holding company domiciled in    
Indiana.                                                                        

The Prospectus describes the sales charges that apply to the Contracts. There   
are no variations in sales load.                                                

 Custody of Assets

We are the Custodian of the Variable Account's assets. We or our agent will     
purchase the Fund's shares at net asset value according to the Purchasers'      
instructions. We will redeem the Fund's shares at net asset value in order to   
meet the Variable Account's contractual obligations, pay charges relative to the
Variable Account or make adjustments for annuity reserves held in the Variable  
Account. We hold the Variable Sub-Accounts' assets separate and apart from the  
assets of any of our other segregated asset accounts and separate and apart from
our general account assets. We maintain records of all purchases and redemptions
of shares of the Fund held by each of the Variable Sub-Accounts of the Variable 
Account. Our fidelity bond provides additional protection for the Variable      
Account's assets. The fidelity bond covers the acts of our officers and         
employees. Its policy limit as of May 1, 2003, is $100,000,000.                 

 Historical Performance Data

 Money Market Variable Sub-account Yield

We may disclose the current annualized yield of the Money Market Variable       
Sub-account, which invests in the Money Market Portfolio, for a 7-day period in 
a manner which does not take into consideration any realized or unrealized gains
or losses on shares of the Money Market Fund or on its portfolio securities. We 
compute this current annualized yield by determining the net change (exclusive  
of realized gains and losses on the sale of securities, unrealized appreciation 
and depreciation, and income other than investment income) at the end of the    
7-day period in the value of a hypothetical account having a balance of one unit
of the Money Market Variable Sub-Account at the beginning of the 7-day period,  
dividing such net change in account value by the value of the account at the    
beginning of the period to determine the base period return, and annualizing    
this quotient on a 365-day basis. The net change in account value reflects (i)  
net income from the Money Market Portfolio attributable to the hypothetical     
account; and (ii) charges and deductions imposed under a Contract that are      
attributable to the hypothetical account.                                       

We may also disclose the effective yield of the Money Market Variable           
Sub-Account for the same 7-day period, determined on a compounded basis. We     
calculate the effective yield by compounding the unannualized base period return
by adding one to the base period return, raising the sum to a power equal to 365
divided by 7, and subtracting one from the result.                              

We calculate the effective yield by compounding the unannualized base period    
return according to the following formula:                                      

       Effective Yield = [(Base Period Return + 1)(to the power of 365/7)] - 1

The yield on amounts held in the Money Market Variable Sub-Account normally will
fluctuate on a daily basis. Therefore, the disclosed yield for any given past   
period is not an indication or representation of future yields or rates of      
return. The Money Market Variable Sub-Account's actual yield is affected by     
changes in interest rates on money market securities, average portfolio maturity
of the Money Market Portfolio, the types and quality of portfolio securities    
held by the Money Market Portfolio and its operating expenses. The yield figures
do not reflect withdrawal charges or premium taxes.                             

Other Variable Sub-Account Yields                                               

We may advertise or disclose the current annualized yield of one or more of the 
variable sub-accounts of the Variable Account (except the Money Market Variable 
Sub-Account) for 30-day periods. The annualized yield of a Variable Sub-Account 
refers to income that the variable sub-account generates over a specific 30-day 
period. Because the yield is annualized, the yield generated by a Variable      
Sub-Account during the 30-day period is assumed to be generated each 30-day     
period over a 12-month period. We compute the yield by dividing the net         
investment income per accumulation unit earned during the period by the maximum 
offering price per unit on the last day of the period, according to the         
following formula:                                                              

Yield = 2 [(a - b + 1)(6) - 1]

cd

Where:

a   = net investment income earned during the period by the particular portfolio
attributable to shares owned by the variable sub-account.               

b = expenses accrued for the period.                                            
c = the average daily number of accumulation  units outstanding during the      
period.                                                                 
d = the  maximum  offering  price per  accumulation  unit on the last day of the
period.                                                                 

Because the Variable Account imposes charges and deductions, a Variable         
Sub-Account's yield will be lower than the yield for its corresponding Fund. The
yield calculations do not reflect the effect of any premium taxes or withdrawal 
charges that may apply to a particular Contract. Withdrawal charges range from  
7% to 1% of the amount withdrawn on total Premium Payments paid, less prior     
partial surrenders, depending on the Contract Year of surrender.                

The yield on amounts held in the Variable Sub-Accounts normally fluctuates over 
time. Therefore, the disclosed yield for any given past period does not indicate
or represent future yields or rates of return. The types and quality of the     
Fund's investments and its operating expenses affect a Variable Sub-Account's   
actual yield.                                                                   

 Standard Variable Sub-Account Total Returns

We may advertise or disclose annual average total returns for one or more of the
Variable Sub-Accounts for various periods of time. When a Variable Sub-Account  
has been in operation for 1, 5 and 10 years, respectively, we will provide the  
total return for these periods. We may also disclose total returns for other    
periods of time. Total returns represent the average annual compounded rates of 
return that would equate the initial amount invested to the redemption value of 
that investment on the last day of each of the periods.                         

We calculate total returns using Variable Sub-Account Unit Values that we       
calculate on each Valuation Period. We base Variable Sub-Account Unit Values on 
the performance of the Sub-Account's underlying portfolio, reduced by the       
mortality and expense risk charge, the administrative expense charge, and the   
Annuity Account Fee. The Annuity Account Fee is reflected by dividing the total 
amount of such charges collected during the year that are attributable to the   
Variable Account by the total average net assets of all the Variable            
Sub-Accounts. We deduct the resulting percentage from the return in calculating 
the ending redeemable value. These figures do not reflect any premium taxes,    
charges or credits for market value adjustments. Total return calculations      
reflect the effect of withdrawal charges that may apply to a particular period. 
We will then calculate the total return according to the following formula:     

P(l + T)(to the power of n) = ERV               

Where:                                          

     P = A hypothetical initial Premium Payment of $1,000.

T = Average annual total return.                

n = Number of years in the period.              

              ERV = Ending redeemable value of a hypothetical $1,000 payment
             made at the beginning of the one, five or ten-year period, at
          the end of the one, five or ten-year period (or fractional
portion thereof).                               

 Non-Standard Variable Sub-Account Total Returns

We may disclose average annual total returns in a non-standard format in        
conjunction with the standard format described above. The non-standard format   
will be identical to the standard format except that we assume that the         
withdrawal charge percentage is 0%.                                             

We may also disclose cumulative total returns in conjunction with the standard  
format described above. We calculate the cumulative returns by using the        
following formula and assuming that the withdrawal charge percentage is 0%.     

CTR = (ERV/P) - 1                                                               

Where:

CTR = The cumulative total return net of variable sub-account recurring charges 
for the period.                                                                 

          ERV = The ending redeemable value of the hypothetical investment
           made at the beginning of the one, five or ten-year period, at the
        end of the one, five or ten-year period (or fractional portion
thereof).                                             

P = A hypothetical initial payment of $10,000         

           Non-standard performance data will only be advertised if standard
performance data is also disclosed.                   

Adjusted Historical Portfolio Performance                                       

We may also disclose yield and total return for the Fund's Portfolios, including
for periods before the date that the Variable Account began operations. For     
periods prior to the date the Variable Account commenced operations, adjusted   
historical portfolio performance information will be calculated based on the    
performance of the Portfolios and the assumption that the Variable Sub-Accounts 
were in existence for the same periods as those of the Portfolios, with some or 
all of the charges equal to those currently assessed against the Variable       
Sub-Accounts.                                                                   

 Legal Matters

Mark A. Parsons, Chief Counsel, Retirement and Investment Services Division,    
CIGNA Corporation, has passed upon all matters of Connecticut law pertaining to 
the Contracts. This includes the Contracts' validity and our right to issue the 
Contracts under Connecticut Insurance Law and any other applicable state        
insurance or securities laws.                                                   
 Legal Proceedings

Various CIGNA entities are defendants in several proposed class action lawsuits 
brought in federal court against the managed care industry by physicians and    
members of health plans. The lawsuits allege violations under one or more of the
Employment Retirement Income Security Act ("ERISA"), the Racketeer Influenced   
and Corrupt Organizations Act ("RICO") and various state laws. They challenge,  
in general terms, the mechanisms used by managed care companies in connection   
with the delivery of or payment for health care services. The complaints seek   
injunctive relief, unspecified damages (subject, in the case of RICO, to        
trebling) and attorneys' fees.                                                  

These federal cases against the Company are Shane v. Humana, Inc., et al. (CIGNA
subsidiaries added as defendants in August 2000), Mangieri v. CIGNA Corporation 
(filed December 7, 1999 in the United States District Court for the Northern    
District of Alabama), and Pickney v. CIGNA Corporation and CIGNA Health         
Corporation (filed November 22, 1999, in the United States District Court for   
the Southern District of Mississippi). Plaintiffs in the Shane and Mangieri     
cases are physicians, and in the Pickney case, a health plan subscriber. These  
cases were transferred to the United States District Court for the Southern     
District of Florida, along with other cases against other managed care companies
and similar cases subsequently filed against the Company in other federal       
courts, for consolidated pretrial proceedings. On September 26, 2002, the United
States District Court for the Southern District of Florida denied class action  
certification to the health plan subscriber plaintiffs in the consolidated      
Pickney case, and certified a class of physician plaintiffs in the consolidated 
Shane and Mangieri cases. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit has
granted the defendant's request for review of the decision to certify the       
physician class. The plaintiff's request for reconsideration of the denial of   
class status to the subscriber class was denied by the district court, and the  
plaintiffs did not appeal.                                                      

The Company was also a defendant in similar state court cases. On March 29,
2001, a trial judge in Madison County, Illinois certified a class of providers  
in Kaiser and Corrigan v. CIGNA Corporation, et al., a case alleging breach of  
contract and seeking increased reimbursements. An Amended Complaint in Kaiser   
included federal claims under ERISA and RICO, and the case was removed to       
federal court in Illinois, where a settlement agreement between the parties was 
filed on November 26, 2002. If approved, the agreement will encompass most of   
the claims brought on behalf of health care providers asserted in other state   
and federal jurisdictions, including the Shane and Mangieri cases. On February
21, 2003 the Judicial Panel for Multidistrict Litigation ordered the Illinois   
case to be transferred to the Florida federal court, which will decide whether  
the settlement should be approved. In connection with the Kaiser matter, CIGNA  
recognized an after-tax charge of $50 million ($77 million pre-tax) in the      
fourth quarter of 2002. As this matter has not been resolved, adjustments to    
this amount in future periods are possible.                                     

The Department of Justice and Office of Inspector General of the Department of  
Health and Human Services investigated a subsidiary of CIGNA, Lovelace Health   
Systems, Inc. ("Lovelace") regarding Medicare cost reporting practices for the  
years 1990 through 1999. Medicare cost reports form the basis for reimbursements
to Lovelace by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services for Medicare      
covered services that Lovelace provides to eligible individuals. In 2002, CIGNA 
increased reserves for this matter by $9 million after-tax ($14 million         
pre-tax). This matter was resolved on December 4, 2002 by a settlement agreement
between the parties. The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of     
Pennsylvania is investigating compliance with federal laws in connection with   
pharmaceutical companies' marketing practices and their impact on prices paid by
the government to pharmaceutical companies for products under federal health    
programs. As part of this investigation, CIGNA is responding to subpoenas       
concerning contractual relationships between pharmaceutical companies and       
CIGNA's health care operations.                                                 

On October 25, 2002, the Securities and Exchange Commission notified CIGNA that 
it has opened an informal inquiry into matters relating to CIGNA. Several       
purported class action lawsuits have been filed against CIGNA and certain of its
officers by individuals who seek to represent a class of purchasers of CIGNA    
securities from May 2, 2001 to October 24, 2002. The complaints allege, among   
other things, that the defendants violated SEC Rule 10b-5 by misleading CIGNA   
shareholders with respect to the company's performance during the class period. 
Another purported class action lawsuit has been filed against CIGNA and certain 
officers by an individual who seeks to represent a class of participants in the 
CIGNA 401(k) Plan who allegedly suffered losses on investments in CIGNA stock   
from May 2, 2001 to the present. The complaint asserts, among other things, that
the same actions alleged in the shareholder suits violated ERISA. The complaints
have been filed in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of 
Pennsylvania by the following individual plaintiffs on the dates indicated:     
Edward Kaminski (October 25, 2002); Jeffrey Lubin (October 29, 2002); Jean      
Mullin (October 29, 2002); Janis Dolan (October 31, 2002); Harvard Kolm         
(November 1, 2002); Joseph G. Blandford (December 6, 2002); Jeremy Schiff       
(December 13, 2002); and Donna Huntsman (February 4, 2003, the ERISA suit).     
Plaintiffs seek compensatory damages and attorneys' fees and, in the ERISA suit,
injunctive relief.                                                              

On November 7, 2002, a purported shareholder derivative complaint nominally on  
behalf of CIGNA was filed in the United States District Court for the Eastern   
District of Pennsylvania by Evelyn Hobbs. The complaint alleges breaches of     
fiduciary duty by CIGNA's directors, including, among other things, their       
"failure to monitor, investigate and oversee Cigna's management information     
system" and seeks compensatory and punitive damages. A similar complaint, filed 
on November 19, 2002 in the New Castle County (Delaware) Chancery Court by Jack 
Scott has been dismissed by the plaintiff and refiled in the United States      
District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania so it can be            
consolidated with the Hobbs case and the shareholder cases.                     

On December 18, 2001, Janice Amara filed a purported class action lawsuit in the
United States District Court for the District of Connecticut against CIGNA      
Corporation and the CIGNA Pension Plan on behalf of herself and other similarly 
situated participants in the CIGNA Pension Plan who earned certain Plan benefits
prior to 1998. The plaintiffs allege, among other things, that the Plan violated
ERISA by impermissibly conditioning certain post-1997 benefit accruals on the   
amount of pre-1998 benefit accruals, and that these conditions are not          
adequately disclosed to plan participants. The plaintiffs were granted class    
certification on December 20, 2002, and seek equitable relief.                  

CIGNA is routinely involved in numerous lawsuits and other legal matters        
arising, for the most part, in the ordinary course of the business of           
administering and insuring employee benefit programs. An increasing number of   
claims are being made for substantial non-economic, extra-contractual or        
punitive damages. The outcome of litigation and other legal matters is always   
uncertain, and outcomes that are not justified by the evidence can occur. CIGNA 
believes that it has valid defenses to the legal matters pending against it and 
is defending itself vigorously. Nevertheless, it is possible that resolution of 
one or more of the legal matters currently pending or threatened could result in
losses material to CIGNA's consolidated results of operations, liquidity or     
financial condition.

Separate Account


The separate account provides the variable investment options and along with the general account provides the foundation of a variable annuity.  The investment fund options (often dozens of mutual funds) are referred to as subaccounts.  In contrast to the general account, the separate account is not guaranteed by the insurance company.  The returns of the subaccounts are variable rather than fixed, so the contract holder rather than the insurance company assumes market risk.  The separate account is “separate” from the general assets of the insurance company, so there is no credit risk in the event that the insurer becomes insolvent.

Variable Annuities

Last Updated 6/23/17
Issue: A variable annuity is an annuity contract that  allows the policy owner to allocate contributions into various subaccounts of a separate account based upon the risk appetite of the annuitant. The contributions  can   be invested in stocks, bonds or other investments. Income payments in   the  annuitization phase can be fixed or fluctuate with the investment   performance  of the underlying subaccounts of the separate account. In   contrast to fixed  annuities, policyholders assume all of the investment   risk with variable  annuities because they are separate account   products that are valued at market  every day. Additionally, variable   annuities are registered as securities with  the Securities and Exchange   Commission (SEC).
Overview: Insurers began   marketing variable deferred  annuities in the late 1970's in response to   rising interest rates and equity  markets. Unlike the fixed deferred   annuities insurers mostly sold up until this  time, variable annuities   offered investors the ability to hedge against this  rising inflation.   Because variable annuities are backed by assets held in an  insurer's   separate accounts, their income benefits fluctuate with the  investment   performance of the underlying separate account investments.  Originally,   variable annuities underlying investment funds primarily consisted  of   corporate common stock, but as time went on, insurers expanded their   fund  offerings to include bonds, indices, mutual funds, and other   securities. This  enabled policyholders to move funds between various   subaccounts to achieve a  certain investment strategy. 
To boost sales, insurers  began offering variable annuity   products with guarantees about a decade ago.  Since then, there have   been a plethora of guarantees introduced to the market,  with most   insurers now offering various minimum guarantees. These guarantees  can   ensure the policyholder receives minimum death benefits, guaranteed   living  benefits, accumulation benefits, minimum credited interest   rates, and income  benefit or withdrawal benefit amounts. Variable   annuities with guarantees  provide an important differentiation to other   alternative investments such as  mutual funds, which is their biggest   competitor.
Sales of both group and  individual variable annuities rose   in the 1980s. Demand for annuities in  general increased significantly   after the Tax Reform Act of 1986 reduced the  tax advantages of   qualified retirement plans. Individual variable annuities  became   particularly popular. A CIPR Study on the State of the Life Insurance Industry notes that by the mid-1980s, growth in individual  annuities had   resulted in insurers' overall product mix becoming almost evenly    distributed between annuity considerations and traditional insurance   products.  By the end of the century, annuity products, led by variable   annuity sales, had  become so popular their sales volumes outpaced those   of traditional life  insurance. The result would be an historic shift   in life insurers' overall  product mix toward annuities.
However, low interest  rates and equity market volatility   of the past decade have placed pressure on  the returns for variable   annuity products. It has also hurt insurers' ability  to support   variable annuities, many of which were issued with minimum  guarantees.   Insurers have responded by reducing their guarantees and crediting    rates to accommodate the new environment. Despite these economic   pressures,  variable annuities continue to be in demand, particularly as   aging consumers  seek savings vehicles designed to help them manage   their long-term needs. As  such, sales of variable annuities will remain   an important source of revenue  for insurers in the future. 
Status: State insurance   regulators monitor the solvency of insurance   companies offering   annuities and have strict rules in place, some of   which are derived   from NAIC model laws and regulations. The NAIC   encourages states to   adopt model laws and regulations designed to inform   and protect   annuity consumers. The NAIC Annuity Disclosure Model   Regulation   establishes standards for the disclosure of certain   information about   annuity contracts to protect consumers and foster   consumer education.   The NAIC Suitability in Annuity Transactions Model   Regulation sets   forth standards and procedures for recommendations to   consumers that   result in a transaction involving annuity products to   ensure the   insurance needs and financial objectives of consumers are     appropriately met at the time of the transaction.
The NAIC Life Actuarial (A) Task Force is charged with identifying, investigating and developing solutions to actuarial problems in the life insurance industry. For 2017, the Task Force is charged with reviewing and recommending changes to Actuarial Guideline XLIII (AG43). The NAIC Life Insurance Illustration Issues (A) Working Group will continue in 2017 to explore how the narrative summary required by Section 7B of the Life Insurance Illustrations Model Regulation (#582) can be enhanced to promote consumer readability and understandability, including how they are designed, formatted and accessed by consumers. This working group will also evaluate the policy summary required by Section 5A (2) of the Life Insurance Disclosure Model Regulation (#580) for possible revision.

The purpose of the Expense Table is to assist the Contractholder in             
understanding the costs and expenses that a contractholder will bear directly or
indirectly. See the section entitled "Deductions and Expenses" for further      
specific information regarding expenses. For the purposes of the Examples,      
assume reinvestment of all dividends and distributions. The Examples should not 
be considered a representation of past or future expenses. Actual expenses may  
be greater or less than those shown.                                            

*The Fund annual expenses do not flow through directly to the contractholder;   
amounts credited are net of these expenses.

The Group Variable Annuities for Retirement Plans are designed for use in       
connection with retirement annuity plans adopted by a Participant's employer.   
The minimum annual payment for each Participant is $120 and the maximum annual  
payment is as provided in the Plan. A sales charge is deducted from each payment
made on behalf of a Participant and an administration charge is deducted        
annually on December 1 from a Participant's Accumulation Account.               

The following is a synopsis of certain features of the Contract, together with a
cross-reference to the page in this Prospectus where the purchaser may find a   
more complete description:                                                      

.  Expense Table, page 4.                                                     

.  The objective of the Contract, which may or may not be realized, is to     
accumulate Accumulation Units sufficient to provide the Annuitant with a  
  Variable Annuity which will furnish relatively level Annuity Payments during
periods when the economy is relatively stable and to provide increased    
Annuity Payments during inflationary and growth periods. See "General
Description of The Group Variable Annuity Contract," page 11.             

.  The Contract provides that, in the event of death of the Annuitant before  
Annuity Payments begin, CG Life will pay death proceeds to a named        
beneficiary. See "Death Benefits," page 14.                               

 .  The Contract provides that a Participant may surrender (redeem) his value in
the Contract in whole or in part for cash before the annuity commencement 
date (unless restricted by the retirement Plan) subject to a sales charge.
  In no event will this sales charge exceed 15%. See "Redemptions" page 16 and
"Sales Charge," page 9.                                                   

.  An additional income tax may be assessed under the Internal Revenue Code in
the event of certain early withdrawals. See "Federal Tax Status," page 17.

.  The Contract provides that the annuity rates and Contract charges generally
may not be changed adversely to a Contractholder for the duration of the  
Contract. See "Changes in the Contract," page 12.                         

.  The Contract provides for transfer of Contract values among other group    
annuity contracts issued by CG Life. See "Redemptions" page 16.           

.  The Contract includes a limited right of cancellation. See "Redemptions"   
page 16.                                                                  

The objective of the Contract, which may or may not be realized, is to          
accumulate Accumulation Units sufficient to provide the Annuitant with a        
Variable Annuity which will furnish relatively level Annuity Payments during    
periods when the economy is relatively stable and to provide increased Annuity  
Payments during inflationary and growth periods. CG Life seeks to accomplish    
this objective by investing net payments made under the Contract in shares of   
the Fund. There is no assurance that this objective will be attained.           
Historically, the value of a diversified portfolio of common stocks held for an 
extended period of time has tended to rise during periods of inflation. There   
has, however, been no exact correlation, and for some periods the values of     
securities have declined while the cost-of-living was rising. The values under  
the Contract, both before and after the commencement of Annuity Payments, will  
increase or decrease to reflect the current value of such equity securities.    
Thus the investment risk under a Contract is borne by the Contractholder and    
Participant.                                                                    

All net payments received on behalf of a Participant under a Contract are       
credited to VAA-II, a Separate Account established by CG Life under the laws of 
the State of Connecticut and registered on June 3, 1968 as a unit investment    
trust under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended ("1940 Act"). Such   
registration does not involve supervision of the investments or investment      
policies of VAA-II. Amounts credited to VAA-II are used to purchase shares of   
the Fund at the net asset value of such shares. The Fund is treated as a        
diversified, open-end investment company under the 1940 Act. The principal      
objective of the Fund is long-term growth of capital and it is intended that the
assets of the Fund will consist principally of a portfolio of common stocks. The
Fund will seek to fulfill this objective by attempting to replicate the         
composition and total return, reduced by Fund expenses, of the Standard & Poor's
500 Composite Stock Price Index. The value of the investments held in the Fund  
will fluctuate daily and is subject to market risk - i.e., the possibility that 
common stock prices will decline over short or even extended periods. The U.S.  
stock market tends to be cyclical, with periods when stock prices generally rise
and periods when prices generally decline. Additional information concerning the
Fund, including information as to expenses paid by the Fund, is given in the    
Fund prospectus which accompanies and should be read with this prospectus.      

THIS PROSPECTUS AND THE PROSPECTUS OF THE FUND SHOULD BE RETAINED FOR FUTURE    
REFERENCE.                                                                      

                                                                               5

CIGNA VARIABLE PRODUCTS S&P 500 INDEX FUND        
THE INSURANCE COMPANY                                                           
CG Life is a stock life insurance company specially chartered by the State of   
Connecticut on June 22, 1865. It is licensed to write life insurance, annuities,

Puerto Rico, Taiwan and certain Canadian provinces. Its Home Office is located  
at 900 Cottage Grove Road, Bloomfield, Connecticut and its mailing address is

of retirement plan accounts invested in CG Variable Annuity Account II is       
conducted by CIGNA's Annuity Service Center, P.O. Box 13146, Kansas City, MO,
64199-3146.                                                                     

CG Life is a wholly owned subsidiary of Connecticut General Corporation ("CGC");
CGC is a wholly owned subsidiary of CIGNA Holdings, Inc. which in turn is a     
wholly owned subsidiary of CIGNA Corporation, an insurance and financial        
services holding company organized to effect the combination of CGC and INA     
Corporation,(Insurance Company of North America), which became effective March  
30, 1982.                                                                       

CG VARIABLE ANNUITY ACCOUNT II("VAA-II")                                        
VAA-II was established on March 12, 1968 pursuant to resolutions of the Board of
Directors of CG Life. Under Connecticut insurance law the income, gains or      
losses of VAA-II are credited to or charged against the assets of VAA-II without
regard to the other income, gains or losses of CG Life. These assets are held   
with relation to the Contract and such other contracts as may be issued by CG   
Life and designated by it as participating in VAA-II. Although the assets       
maintained in VAA-II will not be charged with any liabilities arising out of any
other business conducted by CG Life, all obligations arising under the Contract,
including the promise to make Annuity Payments, are general corporate           
obligations of CG Life. Accordingly, all of CG Life's assets are available to   
meet its obligations and expenses under the contracts participating in VAA-II.  

Any and all distributions made by the Fund with respect to shares held by VAA-II
will be reinvested in additional shares, at net asset value. Deductions and     
redemptions from VAA-II will, in effect, be made by redeeming Fund Shares at    
their then net asset value. The Fund Shares held in VAA-II are in the custody of
State Street Bank and Trust Company, Boston, Massachusetts, which is acting as  
custodian pursuant to an Agreement of Custodianship (see "The Custodian").      

THE FUND 
The Fund is a separate series of shares of CIGNA Variable Products Group (the   
"Trust"), a Massachusetts business trust established by a Master Trust Agreement
dated February 4, 1988 and registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, 
as amended, as a diversified, open-end management investment company. The Fund  
operates as a diversified, open-end management investment company and is treated
as a regulated investment management company for Federal income tax purposes.   
Its sole purpose is to serve as the funding vehicle for the investment of monies
paid by holders of variable annuities issued by CG Life. CIGNA Corporation is   
the sponsor of the Trust.                                                       

Shares are offered only to Eligible Purchasers (see "Eligible Purchasers" CIGNA 
Variable Products S&P 500 Index Fund Prospectus). Shares of the Fund are sold to
VAA-II at net asset value without the imposition of a sales load, sales charge  
or selling commission.                                                          

The prospectus of the Fund, which accompanies this Prospectus, contains a more  
complete description of its investment objectives. In considering the purchase  
of the Contract offered in this prospectus, you should read the Fund's          
prospectus carefully. Additional copies of the prospectus of the Fund may be

VOTING RIGHTS 
The Custodian of VAA-II shall vote Fund Shares held in VAA-II at regular and    
special meetings of shareholders of the Fund, but will follow voting            
instructions received from persons having the voting interest in such Fund      
Shares as determined by the Contract.                                           

The number of Fund Shares as to which a person has the voting interest will be  
determined as of a date to be chosen by the Trust which will be not more than   
ninety days prior to the meeting of the Fund shareholders, and voting           
instructions will be solicited by written communication at least ten days prior 
to such meeting.                                                                

During the accumulation period, the Participant is the person having the voting 
interest in the Fund Shares attributable to his Accumulation Account. The number
of Fund Shares held in VAA-II which are attributable to each Accumulation       
Account is determined by dividing the Accumulation Account value by the net     
asset value of one Fund Share.                                                  

During the annuity period, the person then entitled to Annuity Payments has the 
voting interest in the Fund Shares attributable to such Variable Annuity. The   
number of Fund Shares held in VAA-II which are attributable to each Variable    
Annuity is determined by dividing the reserve for such Variable Annuity by the  
net asset value of one Fund Share. The reserves for the Variable Annuity used to
determine the Fund Shares will decrease over the period of time that the annuity
is paid.                                                                        

Fund Shares held in VAA-II as to which no timely instructions are received will 
be voted in proportion to the instructions which are received under the Contract
and such other contracts, whether group or individual, providing benefits on a  
variable basis as may be designated by CG Life as participating in VAA-II.      

All Fund proxy material will be mailed to the last known address of each person 
having voting interest in Fund Shares together with an appropriate form which   
may be used to give voting instructions to the Custodian. The Custodian of the  
Fund is State Street Bank and Trust Company, P.0. Box 2351, Boston,             
Massachusetts 02107.                                                            

If CG Life determines pursuant to applicable law that Fund Shares held in VAA-II
need not be voted pursuant to instructions received from persons otherwise      
having the voting interest as provided above, then CG Life may vote Fund Shares 
held in VAA-II in its own right. However, until the applicable law is changed,  
the voting rights will remain as described in this Prospectus.                  

DEDUCTIONS AND EXPENSES 

A. Contract Charges:                                                            
The following deductions are made under the Contract:                           

Administrative Expense:  Administrative and recordkeeping expenses      
 applicable to the Contract include such items as salaries, rent, postage,
telephone, office equipment and legal and audit fees and expenses of the
 Separate Account. As compensation for these expenses, CG Life deducts and
 retains for its account an expense charge from the Contract value on each
December 1, and on the date an Accumulation Account is canceled in order
to effect an annuity, or as a result of a complete redemption, or in the
  event of all transfers except transfers to the Participant's account in an
  associated fixed-dollar contract which is not described in this Prospectus
(see "Redemptions"). The charge is effected by canceling the number of  
Accumulation Units equal in value to the charge.                        

The amount of this expense charge is set forth in each Contract and is  
based upon CG Life's appraisal of the cost involved in administering the
 Contract. If the Participant is enrolled under an associated fixed-dollar
contract as well as the Contract, the combined expense charge under both
contracts will not exceed $20 annually and will be equitably allocated  
between the two contracts in a manner determined by CG Life. If the     
 Participant is enrolled only under a Contract the expense charge will not
  exceed $20 annually and will normally be somewhat lower. If during any 12-
  month period immediately preceding a December 1 no payments have been made
   on behalf of a Participant and no redemption or transfer payments have been
made, the expense charge on such December 1 will in no event exceed $5  

8                                                                               

P-->485BPOS10th�Page�of�73TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�10th
annually. No expense charge will be made on the date an Accumulation    
Account is canceled if such cancellation occurs on or prior to the first
Valuation Date which follows a December 1 or occurs as a result of a    
transfer to the Participant's account in an associated contract (see    
"Redemptions"). Similarly, no expense charge will be made on the first  
December 1 following the date payments are first made on behalf of a    
 Participant if the aggregate amount of such payments under a Contract and
the associated contract is less than $100.                              

CG Life may not make any unilateral change in the Contract prior to the 
 fifth anniversary of the effective date thereof, except any change may be
   made that is required in order to make the Contract conform with any law or
 regulation issued by any governmental agency to which CG Life is subject.
After such fifth anniversary, CG Life may change the sales charge, the  
expense charge and the mortality charge, and the annuity purchase rates.
Since the charge is designed only to reimburse CG Life for its actual   
   administration expense, CG Life does not expect to recover from this charge
or any modification thereof any amount above its accumulated expenses in
administering this Contract. Any such charges will not adversely affect 
  Accumulation Units or Annuity Units credited. Commencing in 1991, payments
 to CG Life are made through the General Account. In prior years, payments
were made through VAA-II.                                               

.  Premium Taxes:  At the time any payment is subject to premium taxes, the   
amount thereof will be deducted from the Accumulation Account. Premium  
taxes (which presently range from 1.00% to 3.00%) are charged by various
jurisdictions but in many jurisdictions no premium tax is currently     
charged with respect to annuities such as those effected under the      
Contract.                                                               

.  Sales Charge:  From each payment made on behalf of a Participant, CG Life  
will deduct a sales charge to cover servicing costs. The amount of this 
  charge will be determined in accordance with the following schedule. In no
event will this sales charge exceed 15%.                                

                           Percentage of Aggregate Payment

During the first year an employer's Plan is in effect, an employer may make, in

*Assuming the payment to be the minimum shown in each bracket in the column     
entitled "Amount of Payment."                                                   

This table assumes no applicable state premium taxes and also assumes no change 
in the sales or administration charge. CG Life reserves the right after the     
first five years to raise the charges with respect to future payments, in which 
event the figures shown above would not be applicable.                          

CG life assumes the risk that the sales charge may be insufficient to cover the 
actual servicing costs associated with the Contract.                            

.  Mortality and Expense Deduction: While Annuity Payments will reflect the   
investment performance of the Fund, they will not be affected by adverse
mortality experience or by any excess in the actual sales and           
administration expenses over the expense deductions provided for in the 
  Contract. CG Life (i) assumes the risk that Annuity Payments will continue
for a longer period than anticipated because the Annuitant lives longer 
than expected, and (ii) assumes the risk that the sales charge and      
administration charge may be insufficient to cover the actual costs of  
these items.                                                            

For assuming these mortality risks and expense charges CG Life, in      
determining the Accumulation Unit Value and Annuity Unit Value, makes a 
  deduction at the end of each Valuation Period from the then current market
 value of each Participant and Annuitant. The amount of this deduction for
 each Valuation Period is the rate for the number of calendar days in such
  period which is equivalent to an annual rate of 0.25% (0.20% for mortality
risks and 0.05% for expense charge) under a Contract having 50 or more  
Participants on whose behalf payments are being made, or which is       
  equivalent to an annual rate of 0.50% (0.40% for mortality risks and 0.10%
for expense charge) under a Contract having less than 50 Participants on
whose behalf payments are being made.                                   

If, under a Contract having an effective mortality and expense charge of
0.25% annually, the number of Participants for whom payments are being  
made falls below 50 for a period of 24 consecutive months commencing on 
December 1, the effective rate of such charge may be increased to 0.50% 
annually at the expiration of such period. If on any December 1 under a 
Contract having an effective annual mortality and expense charge of     
annually 0.50% the number of Participants for whom payments are made is 
50 or more, such charge will be reduced to 0.25% on such December 1.    

Any such change in the mortality and expense charge under the Contract, 
will not apply in determining Annuity Unit Values applicable to Variable
Annuities effected prior to the date of such change. After the fifth    
 anniversary of the effective date of the Contract, CG Life may change the
mortality and expense charges (see "Changes in the Contract").          

The Contract is nonparticipating and does not share in the surplus of CG
   Life. However, the Contract provides for experience rating, under which the
actual costs each year are compared with the sales charges and expense  
charges made during the year. If such costs exceed actual costs, CG Life
   may allocate all or a portion of the excess as an experience rating credit,
but is not obligated to do so. Application of any credit will be made   
 within the Contract year immediately following the period with respect to
 which the credit was declared in one of three ways: (a) by a reduction in
either the sales charge or the annual administration charge, or both, or
 (b) by the crediting, without deduction for the sales charge, of a number
  of additional Accumulation Units or Annuity Units, as applicable, equal in
  value to the amount of the credit less any applicable premium taxes or (c)
as a credit to be applied against future payments to be made by the     
employer.

B. Expenses and Related Information:                                            
The Contract will be sold primarily by persons who are licensed insurance agents
of or brokers for CG Life authorized by applicable law to sell life and other   
forms of personal insurance and who will be similarly authorized to sell        
variable annuities. In addition, these persons will, for the most part, be      
registered representatives of CIGNA Financial Advisors, Inc., ("CFA"), Hartford,
Connecticut, which is a broker-dealer registered under the Securities Exchange  
Act of 1934 and a member of the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc.
CFA is organized under the laws of Connecticut and is a wholly owned subsidiary

In connection with the distribution of the Contracts, CG Life pays servicing    
fees to certain broker/dealers who agree to provide ongoing Contractholder      
administrative services. The charges for this service are assessed under the    
Contract and are included in the sales charge.                                  

The expenses of the Contract consist of the mortality and expense deduction     
described under "Contract Charges," above. As a percentage of average net       
assets, this expense is a maximum of .9% on an annual basis.                    

The prospectus of the Fund describes the expenses and fees which are            
paid out of the assets of the portfolio used to fund the Contract. For a        
discussion of such expenses and fees, please refer to the Fund's prospectus.    

GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF THE GROUP VARIABLE ANNUITY CONTRACT 

Description of Contract Rights:  The Contract will normally be issued to an     
employer or an organization representing employers or Participants. Such entity 
is the Contractholder. CG Life will also issue a certificate to each Participant
at the time his first Annuity Payment becomes payable, or earlier, if required  
by applicable law. The certificate will describe the benefits to which the      
Participant is entitled under the Contract. The Contract provides certain rights
during the Accumulation Period, the Annuity Period and upon death of the        
Participant or Annuitant:                                                       

a. Accumulation Period:  During the Accumulation Period, the Participant has  
the right to:                                                           

.  change the beneficiary for death proceeds;                         
.  redeem all or part of his Accumulation Account;                    
.  change the annuity payout option;                                  
.  change the death benefit payout option;                            
 .  transfer Contract values to/from an associated fixed-dollar contract
issued by CG Life;                                              
.  instruct CG Life as to voting of Fund Shares;                      
.  change the date Annuity Payments commence;                         
.  change the payee to receive Annuity Payments.                      

b. Annuity Period:  During the Annuity Period, the Annuitant has the right to:

 .  change the payee to receive Annuity Payments, during the lifetime of
Annuitant;                                                      
  .  change the beneficiary under any annuity payout option which provides
   for a death benefit upon death of the Annuitant: change may be made
only during the lifetime of the Annuitant;                      
.  instruct CG Life as to voting of Fund Shares.                      

c. Death Benefits -- Accumulation Period:                                     

  In the event death benefit proceeds become payable during the Accumulation
Period, the beneficiary designated by the Participant is entitled to    
payment of such proceeds. If no designated beneficiary survives the     
  Participant or no other designation is provided, the surviving spouse will
be the beneficiary, if living; otherwise death benefit proceeds will be 
paid in equal shares to the surviving children of the Participant; or in
the event there are no such children to the executor or administrator of
the estate.                                                             

                                                                              11

P-->485BPOS13th�Page�of�73TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�13th
  If no annuity payout option has been selected by the Participant for death
benefit proceeds, and if CG Life has not previously made a lump sum     
   payment, the beneficiary may choose an annuity payout option for receipt of
such proceeds.                                                          

d. Death Benefits - Annuity Period:                                           
If the Annuitant dies while receiving Annuity Payments, the remaining   
 payments, if any, will be payable to the designated beneficiary. However,
 if Annuity Payments are being paid to the beneficiary as a death benefit,
and such beneficiary dies, the beneficiary's estate shall be entitled to
receive payment of any remaining proceeds.                              

Limitation on Contract Rights:  The Contract is issued pursuant to a non-tax    
qualified retirement plan or trust. Such plan or trust may limit the exercise by
Participants in the plan or trust of certain rights granted by the Contract. For
example, although the Contract permits redemption of all or part of their value 
prior to the time Annuity Payments begin, the Plan or trust may not permit the  
Participant to exercise such right. Also, the Contract provides for minimum     
annual payments on behalf of Participants and payments may not exceed amounts as
provided in the Plan. The provisions of the Plan or trust instrument should be  
referred to in connection with the Contract.                                    

Transfers Between Group Variable Annuity Contracts: The Participant or a        
beneficiary for whom an Accumulation Account is maintained may elect to         
transfer all or a portion of his Contract value to an associated fixed-dollar   
contract issued by CG Life. The frequency of such transfers may be limited by   
the terms of the retirement Plan.                                               

No transfer between contracts is permitted: (1) if prohibited by state law, or  
(2) if prohibited by the Plan.                                                  

The number of Accumulation Units credited in the newly elected associated fixed-
dollar contract will be equal to the dollar value of the amount transferred     
divided by the current value of one Accumulation Unit in such newly elected     
contract.                                                                       

Participants and beneficiaries who contemplate making a transfer should first   
carefully consider their annuity objectives and the investment objectives of    
Fund Shares. Frequent transfers may be inconsistent with the long-term          
objectives of the Contracts.                                                    

Changes in the Contract:  The terms of the Contract may be changed from time to 
time by agreement between CG Life and the Contractholder. Any such change will  
not, however, adversely affect Accumulation Units or Annuity Units credited to a
Participant prior to any such change unless the Participant consents thereto.   

CG Life may not make any unilateral change in the Contract prior to the fifth   
anniversary of the effective date thereof, except any change may be made that is
required in order to make the Contract conform with any law or regulation issued
by any governmental agency to which CG Life is subject. After such fifth        
anniversary, CG Life may change the sales charge, the annual administration     
charge, the mortality and expense charge, and the annuity purchase rates. Since 
the administration charge is designed only to reimburse CG Life for its actual  
administration expenses, CG Life does not expect to recover from this charge or 
any modification thereof any amount above its accumulated expenses in           
administering this Contract. Any such changes will not adversely affect         
Accumulation Units or Annuity Units credited before the effective date of such  
changes. Such changes shall become effective 9O days after notice thereof has   
been given to the Contractholder. Notice of such changes shall also be given to 
each Participant.                                                               

Substituted Securities; Change in Operations:  If shares of the Fund should not 
be available or, if in the judgment of CG Life, investment in shares of the Fund
is no longer appropriate in view of the purposes of VAA-II, shares of another   
registered, open-end investment company may be substituted for Fund Shares held 
in VAA-II or net payments received after a date specified by CG Life may be     
applied to the purchase of shares of another registered, open-end investment    
company in lieu of Fund Shares. In either event, approval Of the Securities and 
Exchange Commission as well as approval by the vote of a majority of the votes  
to be cast by persons having a voting interest in VAA-II shall be obtained.     

CG Life may also sell other forms of variable annuity contracts from time to    
time, such as flexible payment individual contracts.                            

CG Life reserves the right to amend the Contract to meet the requirements of the
1940 Act, or other applicable federal or state laws or regulations.             

12                                                                              

P-->485BPOS14th�Page�of�73TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�14th
Contractholder Inquiries: The Contractholder of a Contract should direct all    
inquiries to: CIGNA, c/o Annuity Service Center, P.O. Box 13146, Kansas City,   
MO 64199-3146.                                                                  

Reports:  CG Life will send to each Participant and to each beneficiary for whom
an Accumulation Account is maintained at least once during each year after the  
first year a statement showing the number of Accumulation Units credited to such
Participant or beneficiary and the Accumulation Unit value. In addition, each   
person having voting rights in VAA-II (see "Voting Rights") will receive such   
reports or prospectuses covering VAA-II and the Fund as may be required by the  
1940 Act.                                                                       

THE ANNUITY PERIOD 

Annuity Payments: The level of Annuity Payments is based on (i) the table       
specified in the Contract which reflect the adjusted age of the Annuitant, (ii) 
the type of annuity payout option selected and (iii) the investment performance 
of the underlying Fund Shares. The amount of Annuity Payments, will not be      
affected by adverse mortality experience or any increase in the expenses of CG  
Life in excess of the charges made under the Contract. If CG Life is required to
withhold certain amounts from Annuity Payments, in compliance with Federal or   
State law relating to collection of income taxes at the source of payment, the  
amount so required will be deducted from each payment.                          

Annuity Commencement Date:  Annuity Payments will begin on the first day of the 
calendar month selected by the Participant. The selection of an annuity         
commencement date may be affected by the terms of the Plan or trust under which 
a Contract is issued. If no notice has been received by CG Life at its Annuity  
Service Center by the Annuity Payment Date preceding the 75th birthday of a     
Participant, a Variable Life Annuity with Monthly Payments Certain for 120 and  
180 Months will be effected for such Participant on the following Annuity       
Payment Date.                                                                   

Annuity Payout Options:  The Participant may elect to have Annuity Payments made
under any one of the annuity payout options described below. In addition, the   
payout options may be selected for payment of the death proceeds during the     
Accumulation Period or upon the death of the Annuitant.  A change of option is  
permitted if made at least 30 days before the Annuity payments are to commence. 
In the absence of an election, Annuity Payments will be made in accordance with 
Option 1 below. Annuity Payments will be paid monthly except that (i) if the    
value of the Participant's account available for the purchase of a retirement   
annuity is at least $3,500, CG Life may pay, in lieu of a Variable Annuity, an  
amount in cash equal to the Accumulation Account Value less the expense charge; 
(ii) if after the Annuity Payments have commenced, the amount of the monthly    
payments should fall below $10.00, CG Life reserves the right to change the     
frequency of payments to intervals that will result in payments of at least     
$10.00.                                                                         

Once Annuity Payments have commenced, the Annuitant cannot surrender his        
Variable Annuity for a cash payment.                                            

Option I - Variable Life Annuity With Monthly Payments Certain for 120 or 180   
Months: A Variable Annuity which provides monthly payments to the Annuitant     
during his lifetime, and further provides that if, at the death of the          
Annuitant, monthly payments have been made for less than the period certain,    
which may be 120 or 180 months as elected by the Annuitant Annuity Payments will
be continued during the remainder of such period to the designated beneficiary. 
However, if the Participant is married and his beneficiary is not his spouse,   
his spouse must consent to the beneficiary designation in a written statement   
which is notarized by a Notary Public.                                          

Option 2 - Contingent Annuitant Variable Annuity:  A Variable Annuity which     
provides monthly payments to the Annuitant during his lifetime and further      
provides that upon his death the monthly payment which would have been payable  
to him had he survived will be paid in the same amount (or 66-2/3% or 50%       
thereof, if so elected by the Annuitant) and paid to any person designated by   
him as his contingent annuitant during the latter's further lifetime. If the    
contingent annuitant dies before the Annuitant, no more benefits will be paid.  
For contingent annuitants other than the spouse of the Annuitant, this option   
shall be available only if a valid waiver by Participant and consent of spouse  
has been obtained by the Contractholder.                                        

Other forms of variable annuities, not in conflict with this prospectus or the  
Contract, in addition to those described herein may be effected with the consent
of CG Life. However, any form of Variable Annuity is limited by the terms of the
Plan and the applicable provisions of the Code.                                 

                                                                              13

Determination of Monthly Annuity Payments: A description of the method for      
determining the first and subsequent Annuity Payments is included in the        
Statement of Additional Information. Each Contract contains tables indicating   
the dollar amount of the first monthly Annuity Payment which can be purchased   
with each $1,000 of value accumulated under the Contract. These tables include  
an "assumed investment return," which is the annual rate of return, expressed as
a percentage, that the Contract assumes assets invested in the underlying Fund  
will achieve each year. This assumed investment return is the measuring point   
for subsequent Annuity Payments. If the actual net investment rate (on an annual
basis) equals the assumed investment return and remains constant the Annuity    
Payments will remain constant. If the actual net investment rate exceeds the    
assumed investment return, the Annuity Payments will increase at a rate equal to
the amount of such excess. Conversely, if the actual rate is less than the      
assumed investment return, Annuity Payments will decrease.                      

The selection of the assumed investment return is made by the Contractholder    
from a range made available by CG Life, and is used to determine the purchase   
rates for all annuities effected under the Contract. Assumed investment returns 
of from 3% to 5% are normally available.                                        

The assumed investment return may be changed, by amendment of the Contract, with
respect to annuities effected on or after the date of change.                   

DEATH BENEFITS 

Accumulation Period:  If the Participant dies during the accumulation period,   
the designated beneficiary may, unless otherwise provided by the deceased       
Participant or deceased beneficiary, elect any one, or a combination of the     
options described below. Any such election by a beneficiary will be effective on
the later of the date received or the date due proof of death of the deceased   
Participant or the deceased beneficiary is received by CG Life at its Annuity   
Service Center.                                                                 

Option A - to receive a cash payment equal in amount to the Accumulation Account
value for the Valuation Period during which the election becomes effective, less
the annual administrative charge.                                               

Option B - to have the Accumulation Account value applied to effect a Variable  
Annuity for the beneficiary subject to the following: the Accumulation Account  
value, or portion thereof which is to be applied to effect an annuity must be at
least $3,500, the beneficiary must be a natural person; the Annuity Payments may
not extend over a period exceeding the life expectancy of the beneficiary and   
the initial Annuity Payment must amount to at least $10.00.                     

Option C - to have the Accumulation Account value transferred to an associated  
fixed-dollar contract.  The purpose of the transfer should be for effecting an  
annuity under the associated contract subject to the provisions discussed under 
Option B above.                                                                 

The amount of death benefit proceeds payable to a beneficiary will be reduced by
any applicable state premium taxes and by any amounts required to be withheld   
for Federal or State income taxes.                                              

If the Participant's death occurs before age 65, the death payment provided will
in no event be less than the aggregate of the payments (prior to any deductions 
therefrom) made on behalf of the Participant, reduced by any redemptions or     
transfers.                                                                      

An election by the beneficiary of any of the above described options must be    
made within the period ending on the later of the first anniversary of the death
of such Participant or deceased beneficiary or the date which is three months   
after receipt by CG Life of due proof of such death. If an election has not been
made by the expiration of such period, CG Life will make the cash payment       
described in Option A, effective on the date such period expires. In no event,  
however, if an Annuitant dies before the annuity starting date, may his entire  
remaining interest be distributed later than five years after his death unless  
(i) such distribution commences to a designated beneficiary no later than one   
year following toe Annuitant's death and is payable over the life or life       
expectancy of the beneficiary or (ii) the designated beneficiary is the         
surviving spouse and is treated as the Annuitant for distribution purposes.     

If an Annuitant dies on or after the date his Annuity Payments commence, no     
payments will be payable except as a lump sum or as may be provided under the   
form of annuity effected unless (i) the distribution commences to a designated  
beneficiary no later than one year following the Annuitant's death and is       
payable over the life or life expectancy of the beneficiary or (ii) the         
designated beneficiary is the surviving spouse and is treated as the Annuitant  
for distribution purposes. The Annuitant may elect that any Annuity Payments to 
which the beneficiary becomes entitled will be commuted and paid in             

14                                                                              

P-->485BPOS16th�Page�of�73TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�16th
one sum: or in the absence of such election and unless otherwise provided by the
Annuitant, a beneficiary who becomes entitled to Annuity Payments may elect that
the remainder of such payments be commuted and paid in one sum. Any such        
commutation will be equal to the value, in a single sum, of the remaining       
Annuity Payments, discounted from their respective due dates to the date or     
determination of the single sum at a rate equal to the assumed investment       
return, compounded annually, assuming that the Annuity Unit Value applicable to 
the payments on the date of determination will remain unchanged thereafter.     

PURCHASES AND CONTRACT VALUES 

How to Purchase a Contract:                                                     
The Contract will be sold primarily by persons who are insurance agents of or   
brokers for CG Life authorized by applicable law to sell life and other forms of
personal insurance and who will be similarly authorized to sell variable        
annuities. In addition, these persons are for the most part registered          
representatives of CIGNA Financial Advisors, Inc., ("CFA"), Hartford,           
Connecticut, a broker-dealer registered under the Securities Exchange Act of    
1934 and a member of the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. CFA is
organized under the laws of Connecticut and is a wholly owned subsidiary of     
Connecticut General Corporation, which is wholly owned by CIGNA Holdings, Inc.  
which in turn is a wholly owned subsidiary of CIGNA Corporation. The Contracts  
may also he sold through other broker-dealers registered under the Securities   
Exchange Act of 1934 whose representatives are authorized by applicable law to  
sell variable annuity contracts.                                                

A Contract may be purchased by delivering a completed application, and such     
other forms as CGI Life requires, to the soliciting agent who will forward such 
forms to CG Life.                                                               

If the application is complete and correct upon receipt by CG Life, and if all  
other required information have also been received by CG Life at its Annuity    
Service Center, the Contract will be issued and delivered to the Contractholder 
within six weeks of receipt of all the correct forms.                           

Purchase Payment:                                                               
The minimum initial Purchase Payment is $10,000 for a Contractholder and $240   
for each Participant with a minimum requirement of ten Participants.            

After a Contract is issued, any Contractholder may make purchase payments by    
remitting checks directly to CG Life at its Annuity Service Center. Each        
Participant is required to make a minimum subsequent payment of $240 annually.  

CG Life reserves the right to reject any Purchase Payment if it is less than the
minimum amount or not in proper order.                                          

Pre-authorized checks allow CG Life to draw checks on a routine basis, usually  
monthly, from a bank account previously established by the Participant. No      
credit for a Purchase Payment will be given should a check be dishonored for any
reason by the bank selected. Neither CG Life nor CFA assume any liability for   
wrongful dishonor by the bank selected; however, they may agree to indemnify a  
bank for certain liabilities associated with the checking procedure.            

A salary deduction mode authorizes a Participant's employer to take deductions  
of a set amount from the Participant's salary and remit such amounts to CG Life 
as Purchase Payments for a Contract. CG Life assumes no liability for any       
amounts so deducted until received in full at its Annuity Service Center.       

Application of Net Purchase Payments:                                           
CG Life will reduce a Purchase Payment by a sales charge and any applicable     
Premium Tax to determine the net Purchase Payment. Upon the purchase of a       
Contract, the amount of the net Purchase Payment credited to a Contract will    
reflect the net asset value of the underlying class of Fund Shares next computed
within the next two business days following CG Life's receipt of the Purchase   
Payment. However, if any of the required material is incomplete, incorrect or if
the Purchase Payment has not been made, then a delay in Contract issuance or    
crediting of a subsequent Purchase Payment may be encountered.                  

                                                                              15

Crediting Accumulation Units:                                                   
Accumulation Units represent the value of the Participant's Contract            
attributable to the Division. The number of Accumulation Units to be credited to
the Participant's account within a Division is determined by dividing the net   
Purchase Payment allocated to that Division by the Accumulation Unit value of   
the applicable Division as of the Valuation Date next computed following CG     
Life's determination to credit a Net Purchase Payment to the Contract. The      
number of Accumulation Units will not change because of a subsequent change in  
the value of the unit, but the dollar value of an Accumulation Unit will vary to
reflect the investment experience of the class of Fund Shares underlying the    
Division.                                                                       

Value of an Accumulation Unit:                                                  
The value of an Accumulation Unit was established at $1 as of the date the Fund 
Shares were first purchased. The value of Accumulation Units subsequently is    
determined by multiplying the value of an Accumulation Unit for the immediately 
preceding Valuation Date by a net investment factor for the Valuation Period    
ending on such date.                                                            

A net investment factor for a Valuation Period is the sum of 1.0000000 plus the 
net investment rate for VAA-II. The net investment rate for VAA-II is equal to  
the gross investment rate for the valuation period expressed in decimal form to 
seven places, less a deduction of 0.0000327 for each day in the valuation period
(.9% annually - the fee charged by CG Life for undertaking the mortality and    
expense risks). The applicable gross investment rate is equal to (1) the        
investment income for the Valuation Period, plus capital gains and minus        
capital losses for the period, whether realized or unrealized on the asset,     
divided by (ii) the value of such assets at the beginning of the Valuation      
Period. The gross investment rate may be positive or negative.                  

REDEMPTIONS 

Procedures for Redemption:                                                      
Any cash payment to be made from the Contract in accordance with the following  
paragraphs will be made within seven days after the date the request for such   
payment becomes effective, except as CG Life may be permitted to defer such     
payment under the provisions of the 1940 Act. Deferment is currently permissible
only (1) for any period (a) during which the New York Stock Exchange is closed  
other than customary weekend and holiday closings or (b) during which trading on
the New York Stock Exchange is restricted; (2) for any period during which an   
emergency exists as a result of which (a) disposal of securities held in the    
Fund is not reasonably practicable; or (b) it not reasonably practicable to     
determine the value of the Fund's net assets; or (3) for such other periods as  
the Commission may by order permit for the protection of security holders. A    
request for payment becomes effective when received in writing by CG Life at    
its Annuity Service Center.                                                     

The right of any Participant to elect a cash payment will be determined in      
accordance with the terms of the Plan and the Retirement Equity Act. If the     
Participant becomes eligible for a cash payment under the Plan, CG Life will,   
upon receipt of such election, reduce the Accumulation Account by the number of 
Accumulation Units calculated by dividing the amount of the requested cash      
payment by the Accumulation Unit Value for the Valuation Period in which the    
election becomes effective. Normally, the circumstances under which such an     
election may be made will be restricted by the Plan to separation from service  
with the employer or break-in-service rules under the Plan, if applicable.      

If upon termination of employment or at the time a request for a cash payment   
becomes effective, the Accumulation Account value, less any redemptions, and the
value of the Participant's account under any associated contract does not exceed
$500 after such cash payment if any, the Accumulation Account will be canceled  
and an amount equal to the Accumulation Account value will be paid after being  
reduced by the annual administration charge. Such payment will be in lieu of all
other rights and benefits under the Contract.                                   

If a Participant's Accumulation Account is canceled as a result of a            
redemption, no further payments may be made to that account without the consent 
of CG Life unless an account is being maintained for the Participant under an   
associated contract.                                                            

A Participant may not elect to redeem his value in the Contract once an annuity 
has been effected, unless specifically provided for under the annuity payout    
option selected by the Participant.                                             

16

Transfer Payments to the Group Variable Annuity Contract                        
If a Participant is covered under an associated fixed-dollar contract, transfer 
payments may be made from any such other contract to the Participant's          
accumulation account under the Contract.                                        

Transfer payments from the associated fixed-dollar contract may be subject to   
further restrictions set forth in the associated contract. Amounts transferred  
will be credited to the Participant's Accumulation Account without charge.      

Transfer Payments from the Group Variable Annuity Contract                      
If an associated fixed-dollar contract has been issued by CG Life, the          
Participant may request that CG Life cancel all or part of the Accumulated      
Account under the Contract and transfer all or part of the value thereof,       
computed as of the date such request becomes effective, without a deduction for 
the administration charge, to his account in the associated contract. The Plan  
may limit the frequency of such transfers.                                      

AMOUNTS WITHDRAWN BY THE PARTICIPANT PRIOR TO THE ANNUITY COMMENCEMENT DATE MAY 
BE SUBJECT TO AN ADDITIONAL INCOME TAX AND IMMEDIATE TAXATION OF ANY INVESTMENT 
GAIN.                                                                           

Right to Cancel:                                                                

The Contractholder may cancel the Contract by delivering or mailing a written   
notice (or sending a telegram) to CG Life at its Annuity Service Center and by  
returning the Contract before midnight of the 10th day after the date of        
receipt. CG Life will return all amounts due to the Contractholder within 7 days
after receipt of notice of cancellation and the returned contract. The          
Contractholder bears the investment risk with respect to amounts allocated to   
the Separate Account, for the period from the date the Purchase Payment was     
credited to the Contract to the date the returned Contract is received by CG    
Life. Cancellation shall entitle the Contractholder to an amount equal to (a)   
the difference between the amount of the Purchase Payment, including any        
contract fees and other charges, and the amount allocated to the Separate       
Account, plus (b) the value of the Accumulation Account of the Contractholder on
the date the returned Contract is received by CG Life.                          

FEDERAL TAX STATUS 

General                                                                         

CG Life is taxed as a life insurance company under the Code. The operations of  
VAA-II are part of the total operations of CG Life and are not taxed separately,
although the operations of VAA-II are treated separately for accounting and     
financial statement purposes and must be considered separately in computing CG  
Life's tax liability.                                                           

Investment gains of the Fund credited to VAA-II are not taxable to a            
Contractholder or a Participant, whoever is applicable, until received in the   
form of a cash redemption from an Accumulation Account or in the form of Annuity
Payments. Cash redemptions will generally be taxed as ordinary income in the    
year received, and may be subject to an additional tax under certain            
circumstances. Annuity Payments are taxed as ordinary income in accordance with 
Section 72 of the Code. This section also provides that, to the extent of the   
Participant's non-deductible investment in the Contract (if any), a portion of  
each payment is excluded from gross income as a result of the investment in the 
Contract. As a general rule, however, a Participant who receives Annuity        
Payments at the time of retirement may be taxed at a lower rate due to reduced  
income and a larger exemption.                                                  

The Contract has been designed so as to qualify as a "variable annuity contract"
for Federal income tax purposes. Thus, the Contract permits the Participant to  
defer Federal income taxation on increases in the value of a Contract, until    
such time that amounts are withdrawn from the Contract, received in the form of 
Annuity Payments or paid as a death benefit.                                    

Under the current provisions of the Code, variable annuity contracts - other    
than contracts issued under retirement plans which qualify for Federal tax      
benefits under sections 401(a), 403(a), 403(b), 408 or 457 of the Code, or under
government retirement plans (whether or not so qualified) - will not be treated 
as annuity contracts for Federal income tax purposes for any period for which   
the investments of the segregated asset account on which the Contract is based  
are not adequately diversified. This "adequately diversified" requirement may be
met if the underlying investments satisfy either a statutory safe harbor test or
diversification requirements set forth in regulations issued by the Secretary of
the Treasury.                                                                   

The Secretary of the Treasury has issued regulations pertaining to such         
diversification requirements. CG Life believes that the current structure of the
Separate Account satisfies the requirements of the regulations, and it intends  
that the Separate Account, as well as the underlying Fund, will operate so as to
continue to meet such requirements.                                             

                                                                              17

Non-Tax Qualified Contracts:                                                    
A Non-Tax Qualified Contract is a Contract which is purchased by an individual  
for his own purposes but not pursuant to any tax qualified retirement plans. A  
Non-Tax Qualified Contract may also be a Contract issued to a retirement plan or
plan of deferred compensation which is a non-tax qualified plan. The tax status 
of the Annuitant or participant is determined by provisions of such plan and/or 
provisions of the Code applicable to the Contract.                              

Under the provisions of the Tax Reform Act of 1986, a Non-Tax Qualified Contract
which is held by a person who is not a natural person (e.g. a corporation or a  
trust is not a natural person), is not treated as an annuity contract for       
Federal income tax purposes, and the income on the Contract received or accrued 
by the Contractholder during the taxable year will be treated as ordinary       
income. Certain exceptions apply to Non-Tax Qualified Contracts held by an      
employer on the termination of a plan described in section 401(a) or 403(a) of  
the Code or purchased as immediate annuities (as defined in the Code). THUS,    
OWNERSHIP OF A NON-TAX QUALIFIED CONTRACT BY NON-NATURAL PERSONS WHO DO NOT     
QUALIFY FOR THE STATUTORY EXCEPTIONS RESULTS IN DENIAL OF TAX DEFERRAL ON       
INCREASES IN THE VALUE OF THE CONTRACT.                                         

Taxation of payments under annuity contracts is governed by Code Section 72.    
Under the current provisions of the Code, amounts received under a Non-Tax      
Qualified Contract made upon the death of the Annuitant, or as non-periodic     
payments after the annuity commencement date, are generally first attributable  
to any investment gains credited to the Contract over the taxpayer's basis (if  
any) in the Contract. Such amounts will be treated as income subject to federal 
income taxation. An additional 10% tax on such amounts subject to income tax    
will be imposed if the withdrawal is made prior to age 59-1/2. However, this    
penalty tax will not be imposed irrespective of age if the amount received is   
one of a series of substantially equal periodic payments (not less frequently   
than annually) made for the life or life expectancy of the payee. The           
requirement that the amount be paid out as one of a series of "substantially    
equal" periodic payments is met when the number of units withdrawn to make each 
distribution is substantially the same. Also, the additional tax will not be    
imposed if the withdrawal follows the death of the Annuitant, or is attributable
to the "total disability" (as defined in the Code) of the Annuitant. Where the  
Contractholder is an individual who is other than the Annuitant, the Code       
provides that the penalty tax is applicable to the taxable portion of payments  
required to be made under the Contract following the death of the Annuitant.    

If the Contractholder transfers (assigns) the Contract to another individual as 
a gift, the Code provides that the Contractholder will incur taxable income at  
the time of the transfer. The amount of such taxable income is equal to the     
excess, if any, of the cash surrender value of the Contract over the            
Contractholder's cost basis at the time of the gift. An exception is provided   
for certain transfers between spouses.                                          

Annuity Payments made after the annuity commencement date are generally taxed to
the recipient only as received. A part of the payment received is a return of   
investment in the Contract, if any, and is non-taxable; a portion is a return of
income and is subject to ordinary income tax. An "exclusion ratio" is used to   
determine the non-taxable and taxable portion of each payment. Such exclusion   
ratio continues until such time that the taxpayer recovers his basis in the     
Contract. Thereafter, all payments received are treated as taxable income.      

Taxation of the Separate Account:                                               
Under the current provisions of the Internal Revenue Code, CG Life pays no taxes
on the investment income and capital gains of the assets of the Separate Account
where used to determine the value of Contract. Accordingly, CG Life currently   
makes no adjustments for Federal income taxes (or benefits) in connection with  
VAA-II. CG Life retains the right to make adjustments for Federal income taxes  
to Separate Account assets should future changes in the Code so warrant.        

Tax Withholding and Reporting:                                                  
CG Life may be required to withhold certain amounts from both periodic and non- 
periodic payments under the Contract in accordance with Federal tax law relating
to the collection of Federal income tax at the source of payment. A payor of    
periodic Annuity Payments may be required to withhold amounts as if the payment 
were a payment of wages from an employer to an employee.                        

18                                                                              

P-->485BPOS20th�Page�of�73TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�20th
Similarly, a payor of certain payments may be required to withhold amounts      
unless an individual recipient elects against tax withholding in a manner       
prescribed by the U. S. Treasury Department. The withholding requirements will  
not apply to the portion of a payment which is reasonably believed to be not    
includable in gross income of the recipient for Federal tax purposes.           

CG Life will transmit a written explanation of the rollover options and related 
rules, in a form and containing such information as the Secretary of the        
Treasury prescribes.                                                            

In addition to tax withholding, CG Life is required to report information on    
distributions under the Contract. Distributions include partial and full        
surrenders as well as Annuity Payments. Information is reported on forms        
pursuant to Internal Revenue Service regulations.                               

State income or estate tax considerations may also be involved in the purchase  
of a Contract or the exercise of elections under the Contract and are not       
discussed in this Prospectus. For complete information on particular Federal and
state tax considerations, a qualified tax advisor should be consulted.          

State Regulation:                                                               
CG Life is subject to the laws of the State of Connecticut governing insurance  
companies and to regulation by the Connecticut Commissioner of Insurance. An    
annual statement in a prescribed form must be filed with that Commissioner on or
before March 1 in each year and filed in other states and jurisdictions,        
covering the operations of CG Life for the preceding year and its financial     
condition on December 31st of such year. Its books and assets are subject to    
review or examination by the Commissioner or his agents at all times, and a full
examination of its operations is conducted periodically by state insurance      
examiners. Connecticut law also prescribes permissible investments, but does not
involve supervision of the investment management or policy of CG Life.          

In addition, CG Life is subject to the insurance laws and regulations of the    
other states and jurisdictions in which it is licensed to operate. Generally the
insurance departments of these states and jurisdictions apply the laws of the   
state of domicile in reviewing and approving the provisions of the Contract.    

Tax Legislation:                                                                
The description of federal income tax law provided in the Prospectus            
incorporates provisions of the tax law as in effect on the date of the          
Prospectus.                                                                     

General:                                                                        
Because of the complexity of the law and the fact that tax results will vary    
according to the factual status of the individual involved, tax advice may be   
needed by a person contemplating purchase or a Contract or the exercise of      
rights under a Contract. The above comments concerning Federal income tax       
consequences are not an exhaustive discussion of all tax questions that might   
arise. In addition, state income or estate tax considerations may also be       
involved in the purchase of a Contract or the exercise of rights under a        
Contract, and are not discussed in this Prospectus. For complete information on 
particular Federal and state tax considerations, a qualified tax advisor should 
be consulted.                                                                   

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
There are no legal material proceedings pending to which VAA-II is a party or   
which would materially or adversely affect VAA-II.                              

                                                                              19

The financial statements of CG Life which are part of this Statement of         
Additional Information are to be considered only to the extent that they bear   
upon the ability of CG Life to meet its obligations under the Contract, which   
include death benefits and its assumption of the mortality and expense charges. 

CG Life is a wholly owned subsidiary of Connecticut General Corporation ("CGC").
CGC is a wholly owned subsidiary of CIGNA Holdings, Inc. which, in turn, is a   
wholly owned subsidiary of CIGNA Corporation, an insurance and financial        
services holding company organized to effect the combination of CGC and INA

sale of these shares. Sanford Bernstein also reported sole voting power as to   
3,078,935, and sole dispositive power as to 67,405, of these shares.

Safekeeping of Assets:                                                          
---------------------                                                           
All assets of the Separate Account are held in custody for safekeeping by the

physically segregated and held separate and apart from assets of other

"Fund"), if issued, may be left on deposit with the shareholder servicing agent 
of the Fund.  The Separate Account will maintain a record of all purchases and  
redemptions for shares of the Fund by the Separate Account.  Additional         
protection for the assets of the Separate Account is afforded by the Insurance  
Company's fidelity bond, presently in the amount of $50 million, covering all   
officers and employees of the Insurance Company.

The Custodian:                                                                  
-------------                                                                   

CG Life executed an agreement as of April 30, 1975 with State Street Bank and   
Trust Company ("State Street Bank"), pursuant to which Fund shares and other    
assets credited to VAA-II will be held in the custody of State Street Bank.     
State Street Bank is a Massachusetts trust company having its principal place of
business at Boston, Massachusetts 02107.                                        

The Agreement of Custodianship provides that State Street Bank will purchase    
Fund shares at their net asset value with net payments received from CG Life.   
Purchases will be made by the Custodian at the net asset value of Fund shares   
determined as of the end of the valuation period in which the payments are      
received by CG Life.  State Street Bank will reinvest all cash distributions    
of the Fund and effect redemptions of Fund shares in accordance with            
instructions from persons having voting rights in respect of Fund shares (see   
"Voting Rights").  In addition, State Street Bank will be responsible for       
maintaining appropriate records with respect to all transactions in Fund shares 
relative to VAA-II.                                                             

The agreement requires State Street Bank to have at all times an aggregate      
capital, surplus, and undivided profits of not less than $2,000,000 and         
prohibits resignation by State Street Bank until (a) VAA-II has been completely 
liquidated and the proceeds of such liquidation properly distributed or (b) a   
successor custodian bank having the qualifications enumerated above shall have  
agreed to serve as custodian.  Subject to these conditions the Agreement of     
Custodianship may be terminated by either party upon 30 days of written notice. 
For its service as custodian, State Street Bank will be paid a fee to be agreed 
upon from time to time by State Street Bank and CG Life.  The fee shall be paid 
by CG Life and in no event may State Street Bank charge or collect against or   
from the property held by it pursuant to the Agreement of Custodianship any of  
its fees or expenses without the prior written consent of CG Life.  In addition,
CG Life has agreed to indemnify State Street Bank for any liability arising in  
connection with its services as custodian so long as such liability is not      
attributable to the negligence or bad faith of State Street Bank.

UNDERWRITERS          

(a) The principal underwriter of the Contract is CIGNA Financial Advisors, Inc. 
(F/K/A CIGNA Securities, Inc.) Hartford, CT, a broker-dealer registered 
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and a member of the National  
Association of Securities Dealers, Inc.                                 

(b) The Contract is offered on a continuing basis.                              

(c) The following table sets forth the aggregate amount of administrative       
  charges paid to CG Life, for each of the calendar years 1993 to 1996, with
  respect to VAA-II, Group Variable Annuities for Retirement Plans. Payments
were made through VAA-II.

ANNUITY PAYMENTS          

Annuity Payments - General:                                                     
--------------------------                                                      

As described in the Prospectus, Annuity Payments will be determined on the basis
of (i) the table specified in the Contract which reflects the adjusted age of   
the Annuitant, (ii) the type of annuity payout option selected, and (iii) the   
investing performance of the underlying Fund Shares.  The amount of Annuity     
Payments will not be adversely affected by adverse mortality experience or any  
increase in the expenses of CG Life in excess of the charges specified in the   
Contract.  If CG Life is required to withhold certain amounts from annuity      
payments in compliance with Federal or State Law relating to collection of      
income taxes at the source of payment, the amount so required will be deducted  
from each payment.                                                              

Determination of Monthly Annuity Payments:                                      
-----------------------------------------                                       

The Contract contains tables indicating the dollar amount of the first monthly  
Annuity Payment which can be purchased with each $1,000 of value accumulated    
under the Contract.  These tables include an "assumed investment return," which 
is the annual rate of return, expressed as a percentage, that the Contract      
assumes assets invested in the underlying Fund will achieve each year.  The     
assumed investment return is the measuring point for subsequent Annuity         
Payments.  If the actual net investment rate (on an annual basis) equals the    
assumed investment return and remains constant, the Annuity Payments will remain
constant.  If the actual net investment rate exceeds the assumed investment     
return, the Annuity Payments will increase at a rate equal to the amount of such
excess.  Conversely, if the actual rate is less than the assumed investment     
return, Annuity payments will decrease.

P-->485BPOS28th�Page�of�73TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�28th
The selection of the assumed investment return is made by the Contractholder    
from a range made available by CG Life, and is used to determine the purchase   
rates for all annuities effected under the Contract.  Assumed investment returns
of from 3% to 5% are normally available.                                        

The assumed investment return may be changed, by amendment of the Contract, with
respect to annuities effected on or after the date of change.                   

To determine the amount of the first monthly Variable Annuity payment, the      
amount available to effect the Variable Annuity is multiplied by the appropriate
annuity purchase rate from the table specified in the Contract.                 

Each monthly Variable Annuity payment thereafter is determined by multiplying   
the amount of Annuity Units attributable to the Annuitant by the value of an    
Annuity Unit for the Valuation Date immediately preceding the payment date.

In our opinion, the accompanying statement of assets and liabilities and the    
related statements of operations and of changes in net assets and the selected  
per unit data and ratio present fairly, in all material respects, the financial 
position of CG Variable Annuity Account II (the "Account") of Connecticut       
General Life Insurance Company at December 31, 1996, the results of its         
operations and the changes in its net assets and the selected per unit data and 
ratio for each of the periods indicated, in conformity with generally accepted  
accounting principles. These financial statements and selected per unit data and
ratio (hereafter referred to as "financial statements") are the responsibility  
of the Account's management; our responsibility is to express an opinion on     
these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits of these
financial statements in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards   
which require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance 
about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An    
audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and  
disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles    
used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall   
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a          
reasonable basis for the opinion expressed above.

CG VARIABLE ANNUITY ACCOUNT II                                                  

Notes to                                                                        
Financial Statements                                                            

The Account is registered as a Unit Investment Trust under the Investment       
Company Act of 1940, as amended.  The operations of the Account are part of the 
operations of Connecticut General Life Insurance Company (CG Life). These       
financial statements have been prepared in conformity with generally accepted   
accounting principles, and reflect management's estimates and assumptions, such 
as those regarding fair market value and reserve assumptions, that affect       
recorded amounts. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Significant 
estimates are discussed throughout the Notes to Financial Statements.           

1.  The following is a summary of significant accounting policies consistently  
applied in the preparation of the Account's financial statements:               

 A. The investment in CIGNA Variable Products S&P 500 Index Fund (Fund known
   as the Companion Fund prior to January 2, 1996) shares is valued at the
   closing net asset value per share as determined by the Fund on December
31, 1996. The Fund was organized by CG Life in 1968.                

B. The amount of the reserve for contracts in the distribution period is  
  determined by actuarial assumptions which meet statutory requirements.
Gains or losses resulting from actual mortality experience, the full
      responsibility for which is assumed by CG Life, are offset by transfers to
or from CG Life.                                                    

C. Investment transactions are accounted for on the trade date (date the  
order to buy or sell is executed), and income is recorded on the ex-
     dividend date. Cost of investments sold is determined on the basis of the
last-in, first-out method.                                          

D. The operations of the Account are included in, and taxed as part of, CG
Life's tax return, which is taxed as a life insurance company. Under
     Internal Revenue Code Section 817 there is no taxable income attributable
to the Account.                                                     

2. Under the terms of the annuity contracts, the Individual participant can     
elect either a fixed or variable annuity benefit at retirement. The Group       
participant can elect either a fixed or variable annuity benefit during the     
accumulation phase and at retirement. The assets providing for the variable     
annuity benefit will be invested in the Fund, and the fixed annuity contract    
will be purchased from the Account's sponsor, CG Life. There were no transfers  
from accumulation period to distribution period during 1996 or 1995.            

3. The cost of investments represents the accumulated cost of Fund shares       
purchased by the Account at net asset value with net participant contributions  
received and from reinvestment of all distributions made by the Fund.           

4. Participant contributions are net of premium taxes (if any) and sales load of
$401 and $424 for the years ended December 31, 1996 and 1995, respectively.     
These amounts are deducted from participant contributions and paid to CG Life in
accordance with the contract. Mortality and expense risk charges, which         
generally range from 0.25% to 0.50%, depending on contract size, are also paid  
to CG Life.                                                                     

5. Withdrawal of funds on terminated contracts is net of administrative charges 
of $517 and $568 for the years ended December 31, 1996 and 1995, respectively.  
These amounts are paid to CG Life in accordance with the contract.              

6. Contracts are sold primarily by persons who are insurance agents of or       
brokers for CG Life authorized by applicable law to sell life and other forms of
personal insurance and who are similarly authorized to sell variable annuities. 
These persons are for the most part registered representatives of CIGNA         
Financial Advisors, Inc.

8. DIVERSIFICATION REQUIREMENTS                                                 
Under the provisions of Section 817(h) of the Internal Revenue Code (Code), a   
variable annuity contract, other than a contract issued in connection with      
certain types of employee benefit plans, will not be treated as an annuity      
contract for federal tax purposes for any period for which the investments of   
the segregated asset account on which the contract is based are not adequately  
diversified. The Code provides that the "adequately diversified" requirement may
be met if the underlying investments satisfy either a statutory safe harbor test
or diversification requirements, as set forth in regulations issued by the      
Secretary of Treasury.                                                          

The Secretary of Treasury has issued regulations under Section 817(h) of the    
Code. CG Life believes that the Account satisfies the current requirements of   
the regulations, and it intends that the Account will continue to meet such     
requirements.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS 
February 11, 1997                                                               

The Board of Directors and Shareholder of                                       
Connecticut General Life Insurance Company                                      

In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and the related    
consolidated statements of income and retained earnings and of cash flows       
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Connecticut 
General Life Insurance Company and its subsidiaries at December 31, 1996 and    
1995, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the  
three years in the period ended December 31, 1996, in conformity with generally 
accepted accounting principles.  These financial statements are the             
responsibility of the Company's management; our responsibility is to express an 
opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.  We conducted our    
audits of these statements in accordance with generally accepted auditing       
standards which require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable 
assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material           
misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the          
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and    
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.  We believe that our   
audits provide a reasonable basis for the opinion expressed above.

CONNECTICUT GENERAL LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
NOTE 1 - DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS                                                
Connecticut General Life Insurance Company and its subsidiaries (the Company)
provide insurance and related financial services throughout the United States   
and in many locations worldwide.  Principal products and services include group 
life and health insurance, individual life insurance and annuity products, and  
retirement and investment products and services.  The Company is a wholly-owned 
subsidiary of Connecticut General Corporation, which is an indirect wholly-owned
subsidiary of CIGNA Corporation (CIGNA).                                        

NOTE 2 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES                             

A) BASIS OF PRESENTATION:  The consolidated financial statements include the
accounts of the Company and all significant subsidiaries.  These consolidated   
financial statements have been prepared in conformity with generally accepted   
accounting principles, and reflect management's estimates and assumptions, such 
as those regarding medical costs and interest rates, that affect the recorded   
amounts.  Significant estimates used in determining insurance and contractholder
liabilities, related reinsurance recoverables, and valuation allowances for     
investment assets are discussed throughout the Notes to Financial Statements.   
Certain reclassifications have been made to prior years' amounts to conform with
the 1996 presentation.                                                          

B) RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS:  In 1996, the Company implemented      
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 121, "Accounting for the 
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of."   
SFAS No. 121 requires write-down to fair value when long-lived assets to be held
and used are impaired.  Long-lived assets to be disposed of, including real     
estate held for sale, must be carried at the lower of cost or fair value less   
costs to sell.  Depreciation of assets to be disposed of is prohibited. The     
effect of implementing SFAS No. 121 was not material to the Company.            

In 1993, the Company implemented SFAS No. 115, "Accounting  for Certain     
Investments in Debt and Equity Securities," which required that debt and equity 
securities be classified into different categories and carried at fair value if 
they are  not classified as held-to-maturity.  During the fourth quarter of     
1995, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued a guide to         
implementation of SFAS No. 115, which permitted a one-time opportunity to       
reclassify securities subject to SFAS No. 115.  Consequently, the Company       
reclassified all held-to-maturity securities to available-for-sale as of        
December 31, 1995.  The non-cash reclassification of these securities, which had
an aggregate amortized cost of $9.2 billion and fair value of $10.1 billion,    
resulted in an increase of approximately $396 million, net of policyholder-     
related amounts and deferred income taxes, in net unrealized appreciation       
included in Shareholder's Equity as of December 31, 1995.                       

  In 1993, the FASB issued SFAS No. 114, "Accounting by Creditors for Impairment
of a Loan," which provides guidance on the accounting and disclosure for        
impaired loans.  In 1994, the FASB issued SFAS No. 118, "Accounting by Creditors
for Impairment of a Loan - Income Recognition and Disclosures," which eliminates
the income recognition requirements of SFAS No. 114.  The Company adopted SFAS  
Nos. 114 and 118 in the first quarter of 1995, which resulted in a $6 million   
increase in net income.                                                         

C) FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS:  In the normal course of business, the Company    
enters into transactions involving various types of financial instruments,      
including investments such as fixed maturities and equity securities and off-   
balance-sheet financial instruments such as investment and loan commitments and 
financial guarantees.  These instruments are subject to risk of loss due to     
interest rate and market fluctuations and most have credit risk.  The Company   
evaluates and monitors each financial instrument individually and, where        
appropriate, uses certain derivative instruments or obtains collateral or other 
forms of security to minimize risk of loss.                                     

Financial instruments that are subject to fair value disclosure requirements
(insurance contracts, real estate, goodwill and taxes are excluded) are carried 
in the financial statements at amounts that approximate fair value, except for  
Mortgage Loans and Contractholder Deposit Funds (non-insurance products).  For  
these financial instruments, the fair value was not materially different from   
the carrying amount as of December 31, 1996 and 1995.  Fair values of off-      
balance sheet financial instruments as of December 31, 1996 and 1995 were not   
material.                                                                       

-5- 

P-->485BPOS41st�Page�of�73TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�41st
Fair values for financial instruments are estimates that, in many cases, may
differ significantly from the amounts that could be realized upon immediate     
liquidation.  In cases where market prices are not available, estimates of fair 
value are based on discounted cash flow analyses which utilize current interest 
rates for similar financial instruments with comparable terms and credit        
quality.  The fair value of liabilities for contractholder deposit funds was    
estimated using the amount payable on demand, and for those not payable on      
demand, discounted cash flow analyses.                                          

D) INVESTMENTS:  Investments in fixed maturities, which are classified as   
available-for-sale,  include bonds, asset-backed securities, including          
collateralized mortgage obligations (CMOs), and redeemable preferred stocks.    
Fixed maturities are carried at fair value, with unrealized appreciation or     
depreciation included in Shareholder's Equity. Fixed maturities are considered  
impaired and written down to fair value when a decline in value is considered to
be other than temporary.                                                        

Mortgage loans are carried principally at unpaid principal balances, net of 
valuation reserves.  Mortgage loans are considered impaired when it is probable 
that the Company will not collect all amounts according to the contractual terms
of the loan agreement.  If impaired, a valuation reserve is utilized to record  
any change in the fair value of the underlying collateral below the carrying    
value of the mortgage loan.                                                     

Fixed maturities and mortgage loans that are delinquent or restructured to  
modify basic financial terms, typically to reduce the interest rate and, in     
certain cases, extend the term, are placed on non-accrual status.  Net          
investment income on such investments is recognized only when payment is        
received.                                                                       

Real estate investments are either held for the production of income or held
for sale. Real estate investments held for the production of income are carried 
at depreciated cost less any write-downs to fair value.   Depreciation is       
generally calculated using the straight-line method based on the estimated      
useful lives of these assets.                                                   

Real estate investments held for sale are generally those which are acquired
through the foreclosure of mortgage loans.  The Company's policy is to          
rehabilitate, re-lease and sell foreclosed properties, which generally takes two
to four years.  At the time of foreclosure, properties are valued at fair value 
less estimated costs to sell and reclassified from mortgage loans to real estate
held for sale.  Subsequent to foreclosure, these investments are carried at the 
lower of cost or current fair value less estimated costs to sell.  Adjustments  
to the carrying value as a result of changes in fair value subsequent to        
foreclosure are recorded as valuation reserves, and reported in realized        
investment gains and losses. The Company considers several methods in           
determining fair value for real estate, with emphasis placed on the use of      
discounted cash flow analyses and, in some cases, the use of third-party        
appraisals.  Effective with the implementation of SFAS No. 121, real estate held
for sale is no longer depreciated.                                              

Equity securities, which include common and non-redeemable preferred stocks,
are carried at fair value, with unrealized appreciation or depreciation included
in Shareholder's Equity.  Short-term investments are carried at fair value,     
which approximates cost.  Equity securities and short-term investments are      
classified as available for sale.                                               

Policy loans are generally carried at unpaid principal balances.            

Realized investment gains and losses result from sales, investment asset    
write-downs and changes in valuation reserves.  Realized investment gains and   
losses do not include amounts attributable to experience-rated pension          
policyholders' contracts and participating life policies (policyholder share).  
Realized investment gains and losses are based upon specific identification of  
the investment assets.                                                          

Unrealized investment gains and losses for investments carried at fair value
are included in Shareholder's Equity net of  policyholder-related amounts and   
deferred income taxes.                                                          

See Note 3(F) for a discussion of the Company's accounting policies for     
derivative financial instruments.                                               

 E) CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS: Short-term investments with a maturity of three
months or less at the time of purchase are reported as cash equivalents.        

F) REINSURANCE RECOVERABLES:  Reinsurance recoverables are estimates of     
amounts to be received from reinsurers, including amounts under reinsurance     
agreements with affiliated companies.  Allowances are established for amounts   
estimated to be uncollectible.                                                  

G) DEFERRED POLICY ACQUISITION COSTS:  Acquisition costs consist of         
commissions, premium taxes and other costs, which vary with, and are primarily  
related to, the production of revenues.  Acquisition costs for universal life   
products and contractholder deposit funds are deferred and amortized in         
proportion to total estimated gross profits over the expected lives of the      
contracts.  Acquisition costs for annuity and other individual life insurance   
products are deferred and amortized, generally in proportion to the ratio of    
annual revenue to the estimated total revenues over the contract periods.       

-6- 

P-->485BPOS42nd�Page�of�73TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�42nd
Deferred policy acquisition costs are reviewed to determine if they are     
recoverable from future income, including investment income.  If such costs are 
estimated to be unrecoverable, they are expensed.  If such costs are estimated  
to be unrecoverable or are accelerated as a result of treating unrealized       
investment gains and losses as though they had been realized, a deferred        
acquisition cost valuation allowance may be established or adjusted, with a     
comparable offset in net unrealized appreciation (depreciation).                

H) PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT:  Property and equipment are carried at cost less 
accumulated depreciation.  When applicable, cost includes interest and real     
estate taxes incurred during construction and other construction-related costs. 
Depreciation is calculated principally on the straight-line method based on the 
estimated useful lives of the assets. Accumulated depreciation was $427 million 
and $387 million at December 31, 1996 and 1995, respectively.                   

I) OTHER ASSETS:  Other Assets consists of various insurance-related assets,
principally ceded unearned premiums, reinsurance deposits and other amounts due 
from affiliated companies.                                                      

J) GOODWILL:  Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of businesses      
acquired over the fair value of their net assets. Goodwill is amortized on      
systematic bases over periods, not exceeding 40 years, that correspond with the 
benefits estimated to be derived from the acquisitions.  The Company evaluates  
the carrying amount of goodwill by analyzing historical and estimated future    
income and undiscounted estimated cash flows of the related businesses.         
Goodwill is written down when impaired.  Amortization periods are revised if it 
is estimated that the remaining period of benefit of the goodwill has changed.  
Accumulated amortization was $99 million and $84 million at December 31, 1996   
and 1995, respectively.                                                         

  K) SEPARATE ACCOUNTS:  Separate account assets and liabilities are principally
carried at market value and represent policyholder funds maintained in accounts 
having specific investment objectives.  The investment income, gains and losses 
of these accounts generally accrue to the policyholders and, therefore, are not 
included in the Company's revenues and expenses.                                

L) CONTRACTHOLDER DEPOSIT FUNDS:   Liabilities for Contractholder Deposit   
Funds consist of deposits received from customers and investment earnings on    
their fund balances, less administrative charges and, for universal life fund   
balances, mortality charges.                                                    

M) FUTURE POLICY BENEFITS:  Future policy benefits are liabilities for life,
health and annuity products.  Such liabilities are established in amounts       
adequate to meet the estimated future obligations of policies in force.  These  
liabilities are computed using premium assumptions for group annuity policies   
and the net level premium method for individual life policies, and are based    
upon estimates as to future investment yield, mortality and withdrawals that    
include provisions for adverse deviation.  Future policy benefits for individual
life insurance and annuity policies are computed using interest rates ranging   
from 2% to 11%, generally graded down from 1 to 20 years. Mortality, morbidity, 
and withdrawal assumptions are based on either the Company's own experience or  
various actuarial tables.                                                       

 N) UNPAID CLAIMS AND CLAIM EXPENSES:  Liabilities for unpaid claims and claim
expenses are estimates of payments to be made on reported and incurred but not  
reported insurance claims.                                                      

O) UNEARNED PREMIUMS:  Premiums for group life, and accident and health     
insurance are reported as earned on a pro rata basis over the contract period.  
The unexpired portion of these premiums is recorded as Unearned Premiums.       

  P) OTHER LIABILITIES:  Other Liabilities consist principally of postretirement
and postemployment benefits and various insurance-related liabilities, including
amounts related to reinsurance contracts.  Also included in Other Liabilities   
are liabilities for guaranty fund assessments that can be reasonably estimated. 

Q) TRANSLATION OF FOREIGN CURRENCIES:  Foreign operations primarily utilize 
the local currencies as their functional currencies, and assets and liabilities 
are translated at the rates of exchange as of the balance sheet date.  The      
translation gain or loss on such functional currencies, net of applicable taxes,
is generally reflected in Shareholder's Equity. Revenues and expenses are       
translated at the average rates of exchange prevailing during the year.         

R) PREMIUM AND FEES, REVENUES AND RELATED EXPENSES:  Premiums for group life
and accident and health insurance are recognized as revenue on a pro-rata basis 
over their contract periods.  Benefits, losses and settlement expenses are      
recognized when incurred.                                                       

  Premiums for individual life insurance as well as individual and group annuity
products, excluding universal life and investment-related products, are         
recognized as revenue when due.  Benefits, losses and settlement expenses are   
matched with premiums.                                                          

Revenues for universal life products consist of net investment income and   
mortality, administration and surrender fees assessed against the fund balances 
during the period.  Net investment income represents investment income on       

-7- 

P-->485BPOS43rd�Page�of�73TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�43rd
assets supporting universal life products and is recognized as earned. Fees for 
mortality are recognized ratably over the policy year. Administration fees are  
recognized as services are provided, and surrender charges are recognized as    
earned. Benefit expenses for universal life products consist of benefit claims  
in excess of fund balances, which are recognized when claims are filed, and     
interest credited in accordance with contract provisions.                       

 Revenues for investment-related products consist of net investment income and
contract fees assessed against the fund balances during the period.   Net       
investment income represents investment income on assets supporting investment- 
related products and is recognized as earned.  Contract fees are based upon     
related administrative expenses and are assessed ratably over the contract year.
Benefit expenses for investment-related products primarily consist of interest  
credited in accordance with contract provisions.                                

S) PARTICIPATING BUSINESS:  Certain life insurance policies contain dividend
payment provisions that enable the policyholder to participate in a portion of  
the earnings of the Company's business.  The participating insurance in force   
accounted for approximately 7% of total insurance in force at December 31, 1996,
and 1995, and 5% at December 31, 1994.                                          

  T) INCOME TAXES: The Company and its domestic subsidiaries are included in the
consolidated United States federal income tax return filed by CIGNA. In         
accordance with a tax sharing agreement with CIGNA, the provision for federal   
income tax is computed as if the Company were filing a separate federal income  
tax return, except that benefits arising from tax credits and net operating and 
capital losses are allocated to those subsidiaries producing such attributes to 
the extent they are utilized in CIGNA's consolidated federal income tax         
provision.                                                                      

Deferred income taxes are generally recognized when assets and liabilities  
have different values for financial statement and tax reporting purposes. See   
Note 6 for additional information.                                              

NOTE 3 - INVESTMENTS                                                            

  A) FIXED MATURITIES: Fixed maturities are net of cumulative write-downs of $95
million and $103 million, including policyholder share, as of December 31, 1996 
and 1995, respectively.                                                         

The amortized cost and fair value by contractual maturity periods for fixed 
maturities, including policyholder share, as of December 31, 1996 were as       
follows:                                                                        

                                                                [Download Table]

============================================================

  Actual maturities could differ from contractual maturities because issuers may
have the right to call or prepay obligations with or without call or prepayment 
penalties. Also, the Company may extend maturities in some cases.

Gross unrealized appreciation (depreciation) for fixed maturities, including
policyholder share, by type of issuer was as follows:

  Asset-backed securities include investments in CMOs as of December 31, 1996 of
$2.2 billion carried at fair value (amortized cost, $2.1 billion), compared with
$2.1 billion carried at fair value (amortized cost, $2.0 billion) as of December
31, 1995.  Certain of these securities are backed by Aaa/AAA-rated government   
agencies.  All other CMO securities have high quality ratings through use of    
credit enhancements provided by subordinated securities or mortgage insurance   
from Aaa/AAA-rated insurance companies.  CMO holdings are concentrated in       
securities with limited prepayment, extension and default risk, such as planned 
amortization class bonds.  The Company's investments in interest-only and       
principal-only CMOs, which are subject to interest rate risk due to accelerated 
prepayments, represented approximately 0.1% and 1.9% of total CMO investments at
December 31, 1996 and 1995, respectively.                                       

At December 31, 1996, contractual fixed maturity investment commitments were
$93 million.  The majority of investment commitments are for the purchase of    
investment grade fixed maturities, bearing interest at a fixed market rate, and 
require no collateral.  These commitments are diversified by issuer and maturity
date, and it is estimated that approximately 75% will be disbursed in 1997.     

B) MORTGAGE LOANS AND REAL ESTATE: The Company's mortgage loans and real    
estate investments are diversified by property type and location and, for       
mortgage loans, by borrower. Mortgage loans are collateralized by the related   
properties and generally approximate 75% of the property's value at the time the
original loan is made.

At December 31, 1996, scheduled mortgage loan maturities were as follows:   
1997 - $.9 billion; 1998 - $.7 billion; 1999 - $1.3 billion; 2000 - $1.5        
billion; 2001 - $1.2 billion; and $4.7 billion thereafter.  Actual maturities   
could differ from contractual maturities because borrowers may have the right to
prepay obligations with or without prepayment penalties; the maturity date may  
be extended; and loans may be refinanced.  During 1996 and 1995, the Company    
refinanced at current market rates approximately $477 million and $379 million, 
respectively, of its mortgage loans relating to borrowers that were unable to   
obtain alternative financing.                                                   

At December 31, 1996, contractual commitments to extend credit under        
commercial mortgage loan agreements amounted to approximately $397 million, all 
of which were at a fixed market rate of interest.  These commitments expire     
within six months, and are diversified by property type and geographic region.  

  At December 31, 1996, the Company's impaired mortgage loans were $814 million,
including $442 million before valuation reserves totaling $94 million, and $372 
million which had no valuation reserves.  At December 31, 1995, the Company's   
impaired mortgage loans were $838 million, including $447 million before        
valuation reserves totaling $82 million, and $391 million which had no valuation
reserves.

During 1996 and 1995, impaired mortgage loans, before valuation reserves,   
averaged approximately $852 million and $935 million, respectively.  Interest   
income recorded and cash received on these loans was approximately $73 million  
and $71 million in 1996 and 1995, respectively.

Net income for 1996 included $19 million and $1 million for net investment  
income and write-downs upon foreclosures, respectively, for real estate held for
sale.

 F) DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS:  The Company's investment strategy is to
manage the characteristics of investment assets, such as liquidity, currency,   
yield and duration, to reflect the underlying characteristics of the related    
insurance and contractholder liabilities, which vary among the Company's        
principal product lines.  In connection with this investment strategy, the      
Company's use of derivative instruments, including interest rate and currency   
swaps, purchased options and futures contracts, is limited to hedging           
applications to minimize market risk.                                           

 Hedge accounting treatment requires a probability of high correlation between
the changes in the market value or cash flows of the derivatives and the hedged 
assets or liabilities.  Under hedge accounting, the changes in market value or  
cash flows of the derivatives and the hedged assets or liabilities are          
recognized in net income in the same period. If the Company's use of derivatives
does not qualify for hedge accounting treatment, the derivative is recorded at  
fair value and changes in its fair value are recognized in net income without   
considering changes in the hedged asset or liability.                           

  The Company routinely monitors, by individual counterparty, exposure to credit
risk associated with swap and option contracts and diversifies the portfolio    
among approved dealers of high credit quality.  Futures contracts are exchange- 
traded and, therefore, credit risk is limited since the exchange assumes the    
obligations.  The Company manages legal risks by following industry standardized
documentation procedures and by monitoring legal developments.                  

  Underlying contract, notional or principal amounts associated with derivatives
at December 31 were as follows:                                                 

                                                                [Download Table]

Interest rate swaps    $ 335  $ 508

Purchased options        632      -
Futures                   45     22
-----------------------------------

Under interest rate swaps, the Company agrees with other parties to         
periodically exchange the difference between variable rate and fixed rate asset 
cash flows to provide stable returns for related liabilities.   The Company uses
currency swaps (primarily Canadian dollars, pounds sterling and  Swiss francs)  
to match the currency of investments to that of the associated liabilities.     
Under currency swaps, the parties exchange principal and interest amounts in two
relevant currencies using agreed-upon exchange amounts.                         

The net interest cash flows from interest rate and currency swaps are       
recognized currently as an adjustment to net investment income, and the fair    
value of these swaps is reported as an adjustment to the related investments.   

Using purchased options to reduce the effect of changes in interest rates or
equity indexes on liabilities, the Company pays an up-front fee to receive cash 
flows from third parties when interest rates or equity indexes vary from        
specified levels.  Purchased  options that qualify for hedge accounting are     
recorded consistent with the related liabilities, at amortized cost plus        
adjustments based on current equity indexes, and income is reported as an       
adjustment to benefit expense.  Purchased options are reported in other assets, 
and fees paid are amortized to benefit expense over their contractual periods.  
Purchased options with underlying notional amounts of $112 million at December
31, 1996 that are designated as hedges, but do not qualify for hedge accounting,
are reported in other long-term investments at fair value with changes in fair  
value recognized as realized investment gains and losses.                       

Interest rate futures are used to temporarily hedge against the changes in  
market values of bonds and mortgage loans to be purchased or sold.  Under       
futures contracts, changes in the contract values are settled in cash daily with
the exchange on which the instrument is traded.  These changes in contract      
values are deferred and recorded as adjustments                                 

-12-

to the carrying value of the related bond or mortgage loan. Deferred gains and  
losses are amortized into net investment income over the life of the investments
purchased or are recognized in full as realized investment gains and losses if  
investments are sold. Gains and losses on futures contracts deferred in         
anticipation of investment purchases were immaterial at December 31, 1996 and   
1995.                                                                           

  The effects of interest rate and currency swaps, purchased options and futures
on the components of net income for 1996, 1995 and 1994 were not material.      

As of December 31, 1996 and 1995, the Company's variable interest rate      
investments consisted of approximately $1.3 billion and $1.4 billion of fixed   
maturities, respectively.  As of December 31, 1996 and 1995, the Company's fixed
interest rate investments consisted of $19.5 billion and $20.6 billion,         
respectively, of fixed maturities, and $10.2 billion and $10.0 billion,

Net investment income attributable to policyholder contracts, which is      
included in the Company's revenues and is primarily offset by amounts included  
in Benefits, Losses and Settlement Expenses, was approximately $1.8 billion for 
1996 and 1995, and $1.5 billion for 1994 .  Net investment income for separate  
accounts, which is not reflected in the Company's revenues, was $1.1 billion,   
$885 million and $693 million for 1996, 1995 and 1994, respectively.            

As of December 31, 1996, fixed maturities and mortgage loans on non-accrual 
status, including policyholder share, were $160 million and $360 million,       
including restructured investments of $88 million and $304 million,             
respectively. As of December 31, 1995, fixed maturities and mortgage loans on   
non-accrual status, including policyholder share, were $149 million and $523    
million, including restructured investments of $105 million and $447 million,   
respectively. If interest on these investments had been recognized in accordance
with their original terms, net income would have been increased by $15 million, 
$18 million and $14 million in 1996, 1995 and 1994, respectively.

Prior to the SFAS No. 115 reclassification described in Note 2(B), $171

policyholder share, were transferred to the available-for-sale category in 1995 
with no material effect on Shareholder's Equity.                                

NOTE 5 - SHAREHOLDER'S EQUITY AND DIVIDEND RESTRICTIONS                         

  The Connecticut Insurance Department (the Department) recognizes as net income
and surplus (shareholder's equity) those amounts determined in conformity with  
statutory accounting practices prescribed or permitted by the Department, which 
differ in certain respects from generally accepted accounting principles.  As of
December 31, 1996, there were no permitted accounting practices utilized by the 
Company that were materially different from those prescribed by the Department. 

Capital stock of the Company at December 31, 1996 and 1995 consisted of     
5,978,322 shares of common stock authorized, issued and outstanding (par value  
$5.00).                                                                         

The Company's statutory net income was $611 million, $390 million and $428  
million for 1996, 1995 and 1994, respectively.  Statutory surplus was $2.1      
billion at December 31, 1996 and 1995.  The Connecticut Insurance Holding       
Company Act limits the amount of annual dividends or other distributions        
available to shareholders of Connecticut insurance companies without the        
Department's prior approval.  During 1996, the Company paid a total of $600     
million in dividends to its Parent, of which $200 million received prior        
approval from the Department in accordance with requirements.  Under current    
law, the maximum dividend distribution that may be made by the Company          

-14-

P-->485BPOS50th�Page�of�73TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�50th
during 1997 without prior approval is $629 million. The amount of restricted net
assets as of December 31, 1996 was approximately $3.5 billion.                  

NOTE 6 - INCOME TAXES                                                           
The Company's net deferred tax asset of $639 million and $403 million as of 
December 31, 1996 and 1995, respectively, reflects management's belief that the 
Company's taxable income in future years will be sufficient to realize the net  
deferred tax asset based on the Company's earnings history and its future       
expectations.  In determining the adequacy of future taxable income, management 
considered the future reversal of its existing taxable temporary differences and
available tax planning strategies that could be implemented, if necessary.      

In accordance with the Life Insurance Company Income Tax Act of 1959, a     
portion of the Company's statutory income was not subject to current income     
taxation but was accumulated in an account designated Policyholders' Surplus    
Account.  Under the Tax Reform Act of 1984, no further additions may be made to 
the Policyholders' Surplus Account for tax years ending after December 31, 1983.
The balance in the account of approximately $450 million at December 31, 1996   
would result in a tax liability of $158 million only if distributed to the      
shareholder or if the account balance exceeded a prescribed maximum.   No income
taxes have been provided on this amount because, in management's opinion, the   
likelihood that these conditions will be met is remote.                         

CIGNA's federal income tax returns are routinely audited by the Internal    
Revenue Service (IRS), and provisions are made in CIGNA's financial statements  
in anticipation of the results of these audits.                                 

 In management's opinion, adequate tax liabilities have been established for all
years.                                                                          

  The tax effect of temporary differences which give rise to deferred income tax
assets and liabilities as of December 31 were as follows:

NOTE 7 - PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT AND POSTEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS PLANS     

A) PENSION PLANS:  The Company provides retirement benefits to eligible     
employees and agents.  These benefits are provided through a plan sponsored by  
CIGNA covering most domestic employees (the Plan) and by several separate       
pension plans for various subsidiaries, agents and foreign employees.           

The Plan is a non-contributory, defined benefit, trusteed plan available to 
eligible domestic employees.  Benefits are based on employees' years of service 
and compensation during the highest three or, if service commenced after        
December 31, 1988, five consecutive years of employment, offset by a portion of 
the Social Security benefit for which they are eligible.  CIGNA funds at least  
the minimum amount required by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of   
1974.  Allocated pension cost for the Company was $26 million, $23 million and  
$31 million in 1996, 1995 and 1994, respectively.                               

The Plan, and several separate pension plans for various subsidiaries and   
agents, had deposits with the Company totalling approximately $2.2 billion and  
$2.0 billion at December 31, 1996 and 1995, respectively.                       

B) OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS PLANS:  In addition to providing pension   
benefits, the Company provides certain health care and life insurance benefits  
to retired employees, spouses and other eligible dependents through various     
plans sponsored by CIGNA.  A substantial portion of the Company's employees may 
become eligible for these benefits upon retirement.  CIGNA's contributions for  
health care benefits depend upon a retiree's date of retirement, age, years of  
service and other cost-sharing features, such as deductibles and coinsurance.   
Under the terms of the benefit plans, benefit provisions and cost-sharing       
features can be adjusted.  In general, retiree health care benefits are not     
funded by CIGNA, but are paid as covered expenses are incurred.  Retiree life   
insurance benefits are paid from plan assets or as covered expenses are         
incurred.                                                                       

In 1996, CIGNA amended its health care plan for certain current and future  
retirees effective January 1, 1997, whereby health benefits will be provided    
primarily through CIGNA's managed care networks in exchange for a fixed         
reimbursement amount per retiree from Medicare.  The effect of the plan         
amendment was to reduce CIGNA's other postretirement benefit liability by $110  
million.  The reduction of the liability is being amortized into income over the
average remaining employee service period, approximately 17 years, through a    
reduction of the expense for postretirement benefits other than pensions        
allocated to the Company.                                                       

An employer's postretirement benefit liability is primarily measured by     
determining the present value of the projected future costs of health benefits  
based on an estimate of health care cost trend rates.  Expense for              
postretirement benefits other than pensions allocated to the Company totalled   
$16 million for 1996, $20 million for 1995 and $28 million for 1994.  The other 
postretirement benefit liability included in Accounts Payable, Accrued Expenses 
and Other Liabilities as of December 31, 1996 and 1995 was $424 million and $427
million, including net intercompany payables of $40 million and $28 million,    
respectively, for services provided by affiliates' employees.                   

C) OTHER POSTEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS:  The Company provides certain salary      
continuation (severance and disability), health care and life insurance benefits
to inactive and former employees, spouses and other eligible dependents through 
various employee benefit plans sponsored by CIGNA.                              

Although severance benefits accumulate with additional service, the Company 
recognizes severance expense when severance is probable and the costs can be    
reasonably estimated.  Postemployment benefits other than severance generally do
not vest or accumulate; therefore, the estimated cost of benefits is accrued    
when determined to be probable and estimable, generally upon disability or      
termination.  See Note 10 for additional information regarding severance accrued
as part of cost reduction initiatives.                                          

D) CAPITAL ACCUMULATION PLANS: CIGNA sponsors various capital accumulation  
plans in which employee contributions on a pre-tax basis (401(k)) are           
supplemented by CIGNA matching contributions.  Contributions are invested, at   
the election of the employee, in one or more of the following investments:      
CIGNA common stock fund, several non-CIGNA stock and bond portfolios and a      
fixed-income fund.  The  Company's allocated expense for such plans totaled $16 
million for 1996 and $14 million for each of 1995 and 1994.                     

NOTE 8 - REINSURANCE                                                            

In the normal course of business, the Company enters into agreements,       
primarily relating to short-duration contracts, to assume and cede reinsurance  
with other insurance companies.  Reinsurance is ceded primarily to limit losses 
from large exposures and to permit recovery of a portion of direct losses,      
although ceded reinsurance does not relieve the originating insurer of          
liability.  The Company evaluates the financial condition of its reinsurers and 

-16-

P-->485BPOS52nd�Page�of�73TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�52nd
monitors concentrations of credit risk arising from similar geographic regions, 
activities, or economic characteristic of its reinsurers.                       

Failure of reinsurers to indemnify the Company, as a result of reinsurer    
insolvencies and disputes, could result in losses.  As of December 31, 1996 and 
1995 there were no allowances for uncollectible amounts.  While future charges  
for unrecoverable reinsurance may materially affect results of operations in    
future periods, such amounts are not expected to have a material adverse effect 
on the Company's liquidity or financial condition.                              

 The effects of reinsurance on net earned premiums and fees for the year ended
December 31 were as follows:

The effects of reinsurance on written premiums and fees for short-duration  
contracts were not materially different from the amounts shown in the above     
table.  Benefits, losses and settlement expenses for 1996, 1995 and 1994 were   
net of reinsurance recoveries of $359 million, $442 million and $415 million,   
respectively.

Rental expenses for operating leases, principally with respect to buildings,
amounted to $68 million, $60 million and $62 million in 1996, 1995 and 1994,    
respectively.

During 1995, the Company recorded a $13 million pre-tax charge, included in 
Other Operating Expenses, for cost reduction initiatives in the Employee Life   
and Health Benefits segment.  The charge consisted primarily of severance-      
related expenses representing costs associated with nonvoluntary employee       
terminations covering approximately 1,100 employees.  The cash outlays          
associated with the restructuring initiatives began in the third quarter of 1995
and will continue through 1997, with $6 million paid in 1996.  As of December
31, 1996, $7 million of severance was paid to 625 terminated employees.  The    
Company has funded, and will continue to fund, these costs through liquid       
assets, and such funding has not and will not have a material adverse effect on 
its liquidity.                                                                  

NOTE 11 - CONTINGENCIES                                                         

A) FINANCIAL GUARANTEES:  The Company is contingently liable for financial  
guarantees provided in the ordinary course of business on the repayment of      
principal and interest on certain industrial revenue bonds.  The contractual    
amounts of financial guarantees reflect the Company's maximum exposure to credit
loss in the event of nonperformance.  To limit the Company's exposure in the    
event of default of any guaranteed obligation, various programs are in place to 
ascertain the creditworthiness of guaranteed parties and to monitor this status 
on a periodic basis.                                                            

  The industrial revenue bonds guaranteed directly by the Company have remaining
maturities of up to 19 years. The guarantees provide for payment of debt service
only as it becomes due; consequently, an event of default would not cause an    
acceleration of scheduled principal and interest payments.  The principal amount
of the bonds guaranteed by the Company at December 31, 1996 and 1995 was $234   
million and $266 million, respectively.  Revenues in connection with industrial 
revenue bond guarantees are derived principally from equity participations in   
the related projects and are included in Net Investment Income as earned.  Loss 
reserves for financial guarantees are established when a default has occurred or
when the Company believes that a loss has been incurred.  During 1994, losses   
for industrial revenue bonds were $1 million.  There were no such losses in 1996
and 1995.                                                                       

The Company also guarantees a minimum level of benefits for certain separate
account contracts and, in the event that separate account assets are            
insufficient to fund minimum policy benefits, the Company is obligated to fund  
the                                                                             

-18-

P-->485BPOS54th�Page�of�73TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�54th
difference.  As of December 31, 1996 and 1995, the amount of minimum benefit    
guarantees for separate account contracts was $4.9 billion and $5.1 billion,    
respectively.  Reserves in addition to the separate account liabilities are     
established when the Company believes a payment will be required under one of   
these guarantees.  No such reserves were required as of December 31, 1996 and   
1995.  Guarantee fees are part of the overall management fee charged to separate
accounts and are recognized in income as earned.                                

Although the ultimate outcome of any loss contingencies arising from the    
Company's financial guarantees may adversely affect results of operations in    
future periods, they are not expected to have a material adverse effect on the  
Company's liquidity or financial condition.                                     

  B) REGULATORY AND INDUSTRY DEVELOPMENTS:  The Company's businesses are subject
to a changing social, economic, legal, legislative and regulatory environment   
that could affect them.  Some of the changes include initiatives to: change     
certain federal corporate tax laws; restrict insurance pricing and the          
application of underwriting standards; reform health care; and expand           
regulation.  Some of the more significant issues are discussed below.           

 In August 1996, Congress passed legislation that phases out over a three-year
period the tax deductibility of policy loan interest for most leveraged         
corporate-owned life insurance (COLI) products.  For 1996, 31% of revenues and  
29% of operating income for the Individual Financial Services segment were from 
leveraged COLI products that are affected by this legislation.  The effect of   
the legislation on this segment's income is not expected to be material through 
1998. Beginning in 1999, the effect of the legislation is uncertain; however, it
could have a material adverse effect on the segment's income.  The Company does 
not expect this legislation to have a material effect on its consolidated       
results of operations, liquidity or financial condition.                        

The Company expects proposals for federal and state legislation seeking some
health care insurance reforms.  Due to uncertainties associated with the timing 
and content of any health care legislation, the effect on the Company's future  
results of operations, liquidity or financial condition cannot be reasonably    
estimated at this time.                                                         

The National Association of Insurance Commissioners is currently developing 
standardized statutory accounting principles, which are scheduled to take effect
in 1999.  The effect on the Company's statutory net income, surplus and         
liquidity cannot be reasonably estimated at this time.                          

In recent years, the number of insurance companies that are impaired or     
insolvent has increased.  This is expected to result in an increase in mandatory
assessments by state guaranty funds of, or voluntary payments by, solvent       
insurance companies to cover losses to policyholders of insolvent or            
rehabilitated companies.  Mandatory assessments, which are subject to statutory 
limits, can be partially recovered through a reduction in future premium taxes  
in some states.  The Company recorded pre-tax charges of $53.9 million, $37.0   
million and $27.9 million for 1996, 1995 and 1994, respectively, for guaranty   
fund assessments that can be reasonably estimated before giving effect to future
premium tax recoveries.  Although future assessments and payments may adversely 
affect results of operations in future periods, such amounts are not expected to
have a material adverse effect on the  Company's liquidity or financial         
condition.                                                                      

The eventual effect on the Company of the changing environment in which it  
operates remains uncertain.                                                     

C) LITIGATION:  The Company is routinely engaged in litigation incidental to
its business.  While the outcome of all litigation involving the Company,       
including insurance-related litigation, cannot be determined, litigation is not 
expected to result in losses that differ from recorded reserves by amounts that 
would be material to results of operations, liquidity or financial condition.   

NOTE 12 - RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS                                            
The Company has assumed the settlement annuity and group pension business   
written by Life Insurance Company of North America (LINA), an affiliate.        
Reserves held by the Company with respect to this business were $1.7 billion at 
December 31, 1996 and 1995.                                                     

The Company cedes long-term disability business to LINA.  Reinsurance       
recoverables from LINA at December 31, 1996 and 1995 were $917 million and $973 
million, respectively.                                                          

The Company had lines of credit available from affiliates totaling $600     
million at both December 31, 1996 and 1995.  All borrowings are payable upon    
demand with interest rates equivalent to CIGNA's average monthly short-term     
borrowing rate plus 1/4 of 1%.  Interest expense was $1 million for 1996, 1995  
and 1994.  As of December 31, 1996 and 1995, there were no borrowings           
outstanding under such lines.

The Company extended lines of credit to affiliates totalling $600 million at
December 31, 1996 and 1995.  All loans are payable upon demand with interest    
rates equivalent to CIGNA's average monthly short-term borrowing rate. There    
were no amounts outstanding as of December 31, 1996 or 1995.                    

The Company, together with other CIGNA subsidiaries, has entered into a     
pooling arrangement known as the CIGNA Corporate Liquidity Account (the Account)
for the purpose of maximizing earnings on funds available for short-term        
investments.  Withdrawals from the Account, up to the total amount of the       
participant's investment in the Account, are allowed on a demand basis.  As of  
December 31, 1996 and 1995, the Company had a balance in the Account of $80     
million and $212 million, respectively.                                         

  CIGNA allocates to the Company its share of operating expenses incurred at the
corporate level.  The Company also allocates a portion of its operating expenses
to affiliated companies on whose behalf it performs certain administrative      
services.

What is a 'Separate Account'
A separate account is a privately managed investment account opened through a brokerage or financial advisor that uses pooled money to buy individual assets. 2. In the context of variable annuities, these are payments made to an insurance company for the purpose of investing in securities. These securities are kept separate from the insurer's general investments. 

BREAKING DOWN 'Separate Account'
1. This differs from a mutual fund because the investor directly owns the securities instead of owning a share in a pool of securities. Most separate accounts require a minimum investment of $100,000 or more.

Variable Annuities: What You Should Know

                            April 18, 2011
                       


Variable annuities have become a part of the retirement and investment plans of many Americans. Before you buy a variable annuity, you should know some of the basics – and be prepared to ask your insurance agent, broker, financial planner, or other financial professional lots of questions about whether a variable annuity is right for you.
This is a general description of variable annuities – what they are, how they work, and the charges you will pay. Before buying any variable annuity, however, you should find out about the particular annuity you are considering. Request a prospectus from the insurance company or from your financial professional, and read it carefully. The prospectus contains important information about the annuity contract, including fees and charges, investment options, death benefits, and annuity payout options. You should compare the benefits and costs of the annuity to other variable annuities and to other types of investments, such as mutual funds.

What Is a Variable Annuity? 
A variable annuity is a contract between you and an insurance company, under which the insurer agrees to make periodic payments to you, beginning either immediately or at some future date. You purchase a variable annuity contract by making either a single purchase payment or a series of purchase payments.
A variable annuity offers a range of investment options. The value of your investment as a variable annuity owner will vary depending on the performance of the investment options you choose. The investment options for a variable annuity are typically mutual funds that invest in stocks, bonds, money market instruments, or some combination of the three.
Although variable annuities are typically invested in mutual funds, variable annuities differ from mutual funds in several important ways:
First, variable annuities let you receive periodic payments for the rest of your life (or the life of your spouse or any other person you designate). This feature offers protection against the possibility that, after you retire, you will outlive your assets.
Second, variable annuities have a death benefit. If you die before the insurer has started making payments to you, your beneficiary is guaranteed to receive a specified amount – typically at least the amount of your purchase payments. Your beneficiary will get a benefit from this feature if, at the time of your death, your account value is less than the guaranteed amount.
Third, variable annuities are tax-deferred. That means you pay no taxes on the income and investment gains from your annuity until you withdraw your money. You may also transfer your money from one investment option to another within a variable annuity without paying tax at the time of the transfer. When you take your money out of a variable annuity, however, you will be taxed on the earnings at ordinary income tax rates rather than lower capital gains rates. In general, the benefits of tax deferral will outweigh the costs of a variable annuity only if you hold it as a long-term investment to meet retirement and other long-range goals.




Caution!
Other investment vehicles, such as IRAs and employer-sponsored 401(k) plans, also may provide you with tax-deferred growth and other tax advantages. For most investors, it will be advantageous to make the maximum allowable contributions to IRAs and 401(k) plans before investing in a variable annuity.
In addition, if you are investing in a variable annuity through a tax-advantaged retirement plan (such as a 401(k) plan or IRA), you will get no additional tax advantage from the variable annuity. Under these circumstances, consider buying a variable annuity only if it makes sense because of the annuity's other features, such as lifetime income payments and death benefit protection. The tax rules that apply to variable annuities can be complicated – before investing, you may want to consult a tax adviser about the tax consequences to you of investing in a variable annuity.





Remember:  Variable annuities are designed to be long-term investments, to meet retirement and other long-range goals. Variable annuities are not suitable for meeting short-term goals because substantial taxes and insurance company charges may apply if you withdraw your money early. Variable annuities also involve investment risks, just as mutual funds do.

How Variable Annuities Work 
A variable annuity has two phases: an accumulation phase and a payout phase.
During the accumulation phase, you make purchase payments, which you can allocate to a number of investment options. For example, you could designate 40% of your purchase payments to a bond fund, 40% to a U.S. stock fund, and 20% to an international stock fund. The money you have allocated to each mutual fund investment option will increase or decrease over time, depending on the fund's performance. In addition, variable annuities often allow you to allocate part of your purchase payments to a fixed account. A fixed account, unlike a mutual fund, pays a fixed rate of interest. The insurance company may reset this interest rate periodically, but it will usually provide a guaranteed minimum (e.g., 3% per year).

Example:  You purchase a variable annuity with an initial purchase payment of $10,000. You allocate 50% of that purchase payment ($5,000) to a bond fund, and 50% ($5,000) to a stock fund. Over the following year, the stock fund has a 10% return, and the bond fund has a 5% return. At the end of the year, your account has a value of $10,750 ($5,500 in the stock fund and $5,250 in the bond fund), minus fees and charges (discussed below).

Your most important source of information about a variable annuity's investment options is the prospectus. Request the prospectuses for the mutual fund investment options. Read them carefully before you allocate your purchase payments among the investment options offered. You should consider a variety of factors with respect to each fund option, including the fund's investment objectives and policies, management fees and other expenses that the fund charges, the risks and volatility of the fund, and whether the fund contributes to the diversification of your overall investment portfolio. The SEC's online publication, Mutual Fund Investing: Look at More Than a Fund's Past Performance, provides information about these factors. Another SEC online publication, Mutual Funds and ETFs – A Guide for Investors, provides general information about the types of mutual funds and the expenses they charge.
During the accumulation phase, you can typically transfer your money from one investment option to another without paying tax on your investment income and gains, although you may be charged by the insurance company for transfers. However, if you withdraw money from your account during the early years of the accumulation phase, you may have to pay "surrender charges," which are discussed below. In addition, you may have to pay a 10% federal tax penalty if you withdraw money before the age of 59½.
At the beginning of the payout phase, you may receive your purchase payments plus investment income and gains (if any) as a lump-sum payment, or you may choose to receive them as a stream of payments at regular intervals (generally monthly).
If you choose to receive a stream of payments, you may have a number of choices of how long the payments will last. Under most annuity contracts, you can choose to have your annuity payments last for a period that you set (such as 20 years) or for an indefinite period (such as your lifetime or the lifetime of you and your spouse or other beneficiary). During the payout phase, your annuity contract may permit you to choose between receiving payments that are fixed in amount or payments that vary based on the performance of mutual fund investment options.
The amount of each periodic payment will depend, in part, on the time period that you select for receiving payments. Be aware that some annuities do not allow you to withdraw money from your account once you have started receiving regular annuity payments.
In addition, some annuity contracts are structured as immediate annuities, which means that there is no accumulation phase and you will start receiving annuity payments right after you purchase the annuity.
 
The Death Benefit and Other Features 
A common feature of variable annuities is the death benefit. If you die, a person you select as a beneficiary (such as your spouse or child) will receive the greater of: (i) all the money in your account, or (ii) some guaranteed minimum (such as all purchase payments minus prior withdrawals).

Example: You own a variable annuity that offers a death benefit equal to the greater of account value or total purchase payments minus withdrawals. You have made purchase payments totaling $50,000. In addition, you have withdrawn $5,000 from your account. Because of these withdrawals and investment losses, your account value is currently $40,000. If you die, your designated beneficiary will receive $45,000 (the $50,000 in purchase payments you put in minus $5,000 in withdrawals).

Some variable annuities allow you to choose a  "stepped-up" death benefit. Under this feature, your guaranteed minimum death benefit may be based on a greater amount than purchase payments minus withdrawals. For example, the guaranteed minimum might be your account value as of a specified date, which may be greater than purchase payments minus withdrawals if the underlying investment options have performed well. The purpose of a stepped-up death benefit is to "lock in" your investment performance and prevent a later decline in the value of your account from eroding the amount that you expect to leave to your heirs. This feature carries a charge, however, which will reduce your account value.
Variable annuities sometimes offer other optional features, which also have extra charges. One common feature, the  guaranteed minimum income benefit, guarantees a particular minimum level of annuity payments, even if you do not have enough money in your account (perhaps because of investment losses) to support that level of payments.  Other features may include long-term care insurance, which pays for home health care or nursing home care if you become seriously ill.
You may want to consider the financial strength of the insurance company that sponsors any variable annuity you are considering buying. This can affect the company's ability to pay any benefits that are greater than the value of your account in mutual fund investment options, such as a death benefit, guaranteed minimum income benefit, long-term care benefit, or amounts you have allocated to a fixed account investment option.




Caution!
You will pay for each benefit provided by your variable annuity. Be sure you understand the charges. Carefully consider whether you need the benefit. If you do, consider whether you can buy the benefit more cheaply as part of the variable annuity or separately (e.g., through a long-term care insurance policy).




Variable Annuity Charges 
You will pay several charges when you invest in a variable annuity. Be sure you understand all the charges before you invest. These charges will reduce the value of your account and the return on your investment. Often, they will include the following:


Surrender charges – If you withdraw money from a variable annuity within a certain period after a purchase payment (typically within six to eight years, but sometimes as long as ten years), the insurance company usually will assess a "surrender" charge, which is a type of sales charge. This charge is used to pay your financial professional a commission for selling the variable annuity to you. Generally, the surrender charge is a percentage of the amount withdrawn, and declines gradually over a period of several years, known as the "surrender period." For example, a 7% charge might apply in the first year after a purchase payment, 6% in the second year, 5% in the third year, and so on until the eighth year, when the surrender charge no longer applies. Often, contracts will allow you to withdraw part of your account value each year – 10% or 15% of your account value, for example – without paying a surrender charge.

Example: You purchase a variable annuity contract with a $10,000 purchase payment. The contract has a schedule of surrender charges, beginning with a 7% charge in the first year, and declining by 1% each year. In addition, you are allowed to withdraw 10% of your contract value each year free of surrender charges. In the first year, you decide to withdraw $5,000, or one-half of your contract value of $10,000 (assuming that your contract value has not increased or decreased because of investment performance). In this case, you could withdraw $1,000 (10% of contract value) free of surrender charges, but you would pay a surrender charge of 7%, or $280, on the other $4,000 withdrawn.



Mortality and expense risk charge – This charge is equal to a certain percentage of your account value, typically in the range of 1.25% per year. This charge compensates the insurance company for insurance risks it assumes under the annuity contract. Profit from the mortality and expense risk charge is sometimes used to pay the insurer's costs of selling the variable annuity, such as a commission paid to your financial professional for selling the variable annuity to you.

Example: Your variable annuity has a mortality and expense risk charge at an annual rate of 1.25% of account value. Your average account value during the year is $20,000, so you will pay $250 in mortality and expense risk charges that year.



Administrative fees – The insurer may deduct charges to cover record-keeping and other administrative expenses. This may be charged as a flat account maintenance fee (perhaps $25 or $30 per year) or as a percentage of your account value (typically in the range of 0.15% per year).

Example: Your variable annuity charges administrative fees at an annual rate of 0.15% of account value. Your average account value during the year is $50,000. You will pay $75 in administrative fees.



Underlying Fund Expenses – You will also indirectly pay the fees and expenses imposed by the mutual funds that are the underlying investment options for your variable annuity.


Fees and Charges for Other Features – Special features offered by some variable annuities, such as a stepped-up death benefit, a guaranteed minimum income benefit, or long-term care insurance, often carry additional fees and charges.


Other charges, such as initial sales loads, or fees for transferring part of your account from one investment option to another, may also apply. You should ask your financial professional to explain to you all charges that may apply. You can also find a description of the charges in the prospectus for any variable annuity that you are considering.
Tax-Free “1035” Exchanges 
Section 1035 of the U.S. tax code allows you to exchange an existing variable annuity contract for a new annuity contract without paying any tax on the income and investment gains in your current variable annuity account. These tax-free exchanges, known as 1035 exchanges, can be useful if another annuity has features that you prefer, such as a larger death benefit, different annuity payout options, or a wider selection of investment choices.
You may, however, be required to pay surrender charges on the old annuity if you are still in the surrender charge period. In addition, a new surrender charge period generally begins when you exchange into the new annuity. This means that, for a significant number of years (as many as 10 years), you typically will have to pay a surrender charge (which can be as high as 9% of your purchase payments) if you withdraw funds from the new annuity. Further, the new annuity may have higher annual fees and charges than the old annuity, which will reduce your returns.




Caution!
If you are thinking about a 1035 exchange, you should compare both annuities carefully. Unless you plan to hold the new annuity for a significant amount of time, you may be better off keeping the old annuity because the new annuity typically will impose a new surrender charge period. Also, if you decide to do a 1035 exchange, you should talk to your financial professional or tax adviser to make sure the exchange will be tax-free. If you surrender the old annuity for cash and then buy a new annuity, you will have to pay tax on the surrender.




Bonus Credits 
Some insurance companies are now offering variable annuity contracts with "bonus credit" features. These contracts promise to add a bonus to your contract value based on a specified percentage (typically ranging from 1% to 5%) of purchase payments.

Example:  You purchase a variable annuity contract that offers a bonus credit of 3% on each purchase payment. You make a purchase payment of $20,000. The insurance company issuing the contract adds a bonus of $600 to your account.





Caution!
Variable annuities with bonus credits may carry a downside, however – higher expenses that can outweigh the benefit of the bonus credit offered.




Frequently, insurers will charge you for bonus credits in one or more of the following ways:


Higher surrender charges  – Surrender charges may be higher for a variable annuity that pays you a bonus credit than for a similar contract with no bonus credit.


Longer surrender periods – Your purchase payments may be subject to surrender charges for a longer period than they would be under a similar contract with no bonus credit.


Higher mortality and expense risk charges and other charges – Higher annual mortality and expense risk charges may be deducted for a variable annuity that pays you a bonus credit. Although the difference may seem small, over time it can add up. In addition, some contracts may impose a separate fee specifically to pay for the bonus credit.


Before purchasing a variable annuity with a bonus credit, ask yourself – and the financial professional who is trying to sell you the contract – whether the bonus is worth more to you than any increased charges you will pay for the bonus. This may depend on a variety of factors, including the amount of the bonus credit and the increased charges, how long you hold your annuity contract, and the return on the underlying investments. You also need to consider the other features of the annuity to determine whether it is a good investment for you.

Example:  You make purchase payments of $10,000 in Annuity A and $10,000 in Annuity B. Annuity A offers a bonus credit of 4% on your purchase payment, and deducts annual charges totaling 1.75%. Annuity B has no bonus credit and deducts annual charges totaling 1.25%. Let's assume that both annuities have an annual rate of return, prior to expenses, of 10%. By the tenth year, your account value in Annuity A will have grown to $22,978. But your account value in Annuity B will have grown more, to $23,136, because Annuity B deducts lower annual charges, even though it does not offer a bonus.

You should also note that a bonus may only apply to your initial premium payment, or to premium payments you make within the first year of the annuity contract. Further, under some annuity contracts the insurer will take back all bonus payments made to you within the prior year or some other specified period if you make a withdrawal, if a death benefit is paid to your beneficiaries upon your death, or in other circumstances.




Caution!
If you already own a variable annuity and are thinking of exchanging it for a different annuity with a bonus feature, you should be careful. Even if the surrender period on your current annuity contract has expired, a new surrender period generally will begin when you exchange that contract for a new one. This means that, by exchanging your contract, you will forfeit your ability to withdraw money from your account without incurring substantial surrender charges. And as described above, the schedule of surrender charges and other fees may be higher on the variable annuity with the bonus credit than they were on the annuity that you exchanged.





Example:  You currently hold a variable annuity with an account value of $20,000, which is no longer subject to surrender charges. You exchange that annuity for a new variable annuity, which pays a 4% bonus credit and has a surrender charge period of eight years, with surrender charges beginning at 9% of purchase payments in the first year. Your account value in this new variable annuity is now $20,800. During the first year you hold the new annuity, you decide to withdraw all of your account value because of an emergency situation. Assuming that your account value has not increased or decreased because of investment performance, you will receive $20,800 minus 9% of your $20,000 purchase payment, or $19,000. This is $1,000 less than you would have received if you had stayed in the original variable annuity, where you were no longer subject to surrender charges.

In short:   Take a hard look at bonus credits. In some cases, the "bonus" may not be in your best interest.
Ask Questions Before You Invest 
Financial professionals who sell variable annuities have a duty to advise you as to whether the product they are trying to sell is suitable to your particular investment needs. Don't be afraid to ask them questions. And write down their answers, so there won't be any confusion later as to what was said.
Variable annuity contracts typically have a "free look" period of ten or more days, during which you can terminate the contract without paying any surrender charges and get back your purchase payments (which may be adjusted to reflect charges and the performance of your investment). You can continue to ask questions in this period to make sure you understand your variable annuity before the "free look" period ends.
Before you decide to buy a variable annuity, consider the following questions:
 

Will you use the variable annuity primarily to save for retirement or a similar long-term goal?
	 

Are you investing in the variable annuity through a retirement plan or IRA (which would mean that you are not receiving any additional tax-deferral benefit from the variable annuity)?
	 

Are you willing to take the risk that your account value may decrease if the underlying mutual fund investment options perform badly?
	 

Do you understand the features of the variable annuity?
	 

Do you understand all of the fees and expenses that the variable annuity charges?
	 

Do you intend to remain in the variable annuity long enough to avoid paying any surrender charges if you have to withdraw money?
	 

If a variable annuity offers a bonus credit, will the bonus outweigh any higher fees and charges that the product may charge?
	 

Are there features of the variable annuity, such as long-term care insurance, that you could purchase more cheaply separately?
	 

Have you consulted with a tax adviser and considered all the tax consequences of purchasing an annuity, including the effect of annuity payments on your tax status in retirement?
	 

If you are exchanging one annuity for another one, do the benefits of the exchange outweigh the costs, such as any surrender charges you will have to pay if you withdraw your money before the end of the surrender charge period for the new annuity?


Remember:   Before purchasing a variable annuity, you owe it to yourself to learn as much as possible about how they work, the benefits they provide, and the charges you will pay.

GLOSSARY OF ANNUITY PRODUCT TERMS   Click here to Download the PDF A  A-Share Variable Annuities Annuity contracts in which sales charges are incurred at time of investment or premium payment. A-share contracts typically have no surrender charges. Accumulation Phase The period in an annuity contract prior to annuitization when annuity owners can add money and accumulate tax-deferred assets.  Accumulation Unit Value (AUV) A variable annuity subaccount price per share during the accumulation phase. An AUV is the net asset value after income and capital gains have been included and subaccount management expenses have been subtracted.  Annual Contract Fee An annual fee paid to the insurance company for administering the contract. The fee is often waived for contracts with high account values. Annuitant The person, frequently the contract owner, to whom an annuity is payable and whose life expectancy is used to calculate the income payment.  Annuitization The conversion of the annuity accumulation value to a fixed or variable income stream for the life of the annuitant(s) or for a specified period. Annuity A periodic income payable for the lifetime of one or more persons, or for a specified period. A contract in which an insurance company agrees to pay an income for life or for a specified number of years.  Annuity Commencement Date The date income payments begin, also known as the annuity start date. Annuity Contract A legal agreement between the contract owner and the insurance company. Annuity Owner The person or entity that has the rights to the contract, including withdrawals, surrender, change of beneficiary, or other specified terms.  Annuity Income Payments or Payouts A series of payments made over a specific period of time with the duration guaranteed by the life insurance company at the beginning of the period. Annuity Start Date The beginning date of the series of annuity payments. Annuity Purchase Rate The cost of an annuity based on insurance company tables, which take into account various factors such as age and gender. Annuity Unit Annuity units (variable) are the units in the separate account after the maturity date that is used to determine the amount of the annuity payment. The amount of the payment is the number of annuity units times the annuity unit value. Annuity Unit Value The number of annuity units in an account remains constant during the annuitant’s lifetime. Each annuity unit value changes each payment period based on the following factors:   The investment performance of the account The assumed investment returns (AIR) Contract expenses during the period  Application A form supplied by a life insurance company on the basis of information received from the applicant. The form is signed by the applicant and is part of the insurance or annuity contract.  Asset Allocation In a variable annuity, distribution of assets across multiple classes, e.g., stocks, bonds, and cash, in order to meet an individual’s financial goals. The objective of asset allocation is to reduce investment risk. Asset Allocation Programs A system of assigning variable annuity purchase payments to subaccounts based on a contract owner’s financial goals and risk tolerance. Portfolio rebalancing programs redistribute the amount of money allocated to each subaccount when the target percentages move out of alignment over time as the value of some subaccounts changes faster than others. Asset-Based Expenses Variable annuity expenses, such as investment management fees and annual insurance charges, that are based on the value of the assets held in the insurance company’s separate account. Assumed Investment Return (AIR) Variable annuity payments increase or decrease based on the net performance (returns after fees and expenses) of the underlying investments in relation to a benchmark assumed investment return. If the total investment return minus expenses exceeds the AIR, the payment increases. If the return minus expenses is less than the AIR, the payment decreases. If the return minus expenses equals the AIR, payments remain the same.    B  B-Share Variable Annuities Variable annuity contracts characterized by deferred sales charges, which typically range from 5% to 7% in the first year, and subsequently decline to zero after five to seven years. B-shares are the most common form of annuity contracts sold. Bailout Provision If a fixed annuity’s interest rate falls below a rate specified in the annuity contract, this feature assures the free withdrawal of all funds from an annuity account. Beneficiary A person, persons, or trust designated under the contract to receive any payments due in the event of the death of the owner or the annuitant. Bonus Rate Extra interest accumulated in the first year of a deferred annuity that is added to the sum upon which interest is calculated in later years, also called a first-year bonus rate. Bonus Share (X-Share) Variable Annuities A bonus amount, typically defined in the prospectus as a percentage of purchase payments, is allocated to the annuity accumulation value early in the contract period. This type of annuity typically has higher expenses to pay for the cost of the bonus. Breakpoint Pricing A system whereby the cost of up-front sales charges decreases depending on the cumulative amount of purchase payments made.    C  C-Share Variable Annuities Variable annuity contracts with no up-front or contingent deferred sales charges, which offer full liquidity to contract holders at any time Cash Refund Annuity An annuity settlement payment, which provides that upon the death of the annuitant before payments totaling the purchase price have been made, the excess will be paid in one sum to designated beneficiaries. Cash Surrender Value The amount that can be withdrawn from the contract after the deduction of any surrender charge. It is equal to the contract value (the sum of premiums and earnings minus contract charges and withdrawals) minus the surrender charge.  Cash Value (Surrender Value) The amount available to the owner when a policy is surrendered. During the early policy years, in some contracts, the cash value equals the account value less a “surrender charge.” Charitable Annuity (Gift Annuity) A charitable gift annuity is a contract between a donor and a foundation, under which the foundation guarantees payment of an annuity.  Commutation A process provided under some annuities that allows annuity payments to be terminated and the remaining value to be withdrawn from the contract.  Contingent Annuitant In the case of the death of an annuitant prior to the beginning of annuity payments, the person who is designated to receive the payments in the original annuitant’s stead. Contingent Beneficiary A person or persons named to receive contract benefits if the primary beneficiary is deceased.  Contingent Deferred Sales Charge Costs imposed on the withdrawal of proceeds or liquidation of a variable annuity, which typically range from 5% to 7% in the first year, and subsequently decline to zero.  Contract Date The date an annuity contract becomes effective.  Contract Owner The purchaser of an annuity contract, and holder of all rights pertaining to the contract.  Cost Basis The initial payment/premium(s) paid to a non-qualified annuity is known as the cost basis in the contract. Since it was previously taxed, cost basis is not taxed upon withdrawal.    D  Death Benefits The payment the investor’s estate or beneficiaries receive if the contract holder dies prior to the annuity starting date. Types of death benefits: Greater of account value or premiums less withdrawals; rising floor, in which the insurance company guarantees a minimum return on premium deposits; ratchet, a benefit equal to the greater of (a) the contract value, (b) premiums less withdrawals, or (c) the contract value on a specified prior date.  Deferred Annuity The annuity contract during the time period prior to annuitization. The contract owner determines the point at which accumulated principal and earnings are converted into a stream of income. Defined Benefit Plan An employer-administered pension plan that qualifies for special tax treatment under the Internal Revenue Code. With a deferred benefit plan, the retired employee receives lifetime payments based on salary, years of service, and age at retirement. The employer bears the investment risk. The plan provides lifetime income through a group or individual annuity contract. Defined Contribution Plan An employer-administered retirement plan in which the contribution, rather than the benefit, is defined. Under a 401(k) type of defined contribution plan, the employee is allowed to channel part of his/her income into the plan on a pre-tax basis. A percentage of employee contributions may be matched by the employer but the employee bears the investment risk. The final benefit consists solely of assets (including investment returns) that have accumulated in these individual accounts. Depending on the type of defined contribution plan, contributions may be made either by the company, the participant, or both. In some DC plans, distribution options in the form of life annuities are available. Distribution A payout made from a retirement plan or annuity contract. See also Lump-Sum Distribution and Annuity. Dollar Cost Averaging A program for investing a fixed amount of money at set intervals with the goal of purchasing more shares at low values and fewer shares at high values. Variable annuity dollar cost averaging programs involve allocating a certain amount to one investment subaccount, such as a money market fund, and then having portions of that payment periodically transferred to other subaccounts. Dollar cost averaging does not guarantee a profit or prevent a loss in declining markets.    E  Early Withdrawal Penalty A 10% penalty tax for withdrawal of assets from a qualified retirement plan prior to age 59 ½. This 10% penalty tax is in addition to regular federal and (if applicable) state tax. Exceptions to the penalty, such as death and disability, may apply. Effective Annual Yield In a fixed deferred annuity, the annualized return based on the daily compounding and crediting of the annuity’s interest. Effective Interest Rate The actual annual interest rate that accrues, including the effects of compounding. Enhanced Death Benefit A death benefit that goes beyond the guaranteed minimum death benefit by periodically locking in investment gains or paying a minimum stated interest rate on purchase payments. Enhanced Earnings Benefit A feature of some variable annuity contracts that provides beneficiaries with an additional death benefit amount, usually equal to a percentage of earnings.   ERISA A federal law requiring plan sponsors to design and administer their plans in accordance with the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA). Among its statutes, ERISA calls for proper plan reporting and disclosure to participants. Non-qualified annuities are not covered by ERISA. Excess Interest Interest credited to a fixed annuity contract beyond the minimum guaranteed by the insurance company.   Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) An investment fund traded on stock exchanges, much like stocks. An ETF holds assets such as stocks, commodities, or bonds, and trades close to its net asset value over the course of the trading day.  Exclusion Ratio The formula that determines which portion of an annuity payment is considered taxable and which is a tax-free return of principal. For variable annuities, this formula is similar, however, due to the fluctuating nature of variable payouts, this is recalculated annually and is reported as an exclusion amount. Expense Ratio The percentage of a fund’s assets used to pay its annual expenses.    F  Fiduciary A person who has undertaken to act for and on behalf of another in a relationship of trust and confidence. Fiduciaries are required under ERISA to make decisions based solely on the best interests of plan participants.  Fixed Account An investment option in the issuing insurance company’s general account that is offered in some variable annuity contracts. A minimum rate of interest is guaranteed, usually for a period of one year.  Fixed Annuitization A series of guaranteed income payments of a specified amount payable for the life of the annuitant(s) or a specified number of years.  Fixed Annuity A contract providing a specified rate of interest paid on the amount invested during the accumulation phase and a specified payment amount during the annuitization phase. The issuing company assumes the investment risk.  Fixed Indexed Annuity An annuity on which credited interest is based upon the performance of an equity market index, such as the S&P 500. The principal investment is protected from losses in the equity market, while gains add to the annuity’s returns.  Fixed Period Annuity Payout option for a specified number of years instead of for a lifetime.  Flexible Premium Annuity Contracts purchased with a series of payments over a period of time. The owner is usually allowed to change the amount or frequency of payments, subject to minimum annual amounts.  Free-Look Period A specified number of days (e.g., 10 days) during which an annuity contract owner may revoke the purchase of the contract.  Front-End Load A percent of premium fee insurance companies charge at contract inception and each subsequent premium payment to cover the costs of establishing new accounts. Referred to as A- share pricing.    G  General Account The assets and liabilities of the insurance company not allocated to separate accounts. Guarantee Period The period during which the level of interest credited under a fixed annuity is guaranteed.  Guaranteed Interest Rate The minimum rate of interest the insurance company agrees to pay each year on a fixed annuity.  Guaranteed Investment Contracts (GICs) Group contracts with an insurance company at a fixed rate of interest. Guaranteed Lifetime Withdrawal Benefit (GLWB) An annuity option that provides a specified percentage of a guaranteed benefit base that can be withdrawn each year for the life of the contract holder, regardless of market performance or the actual account balance. Guaranteed Minimum Accumulation Benefit (GMAB) A guarantee that ensures that the contract value of a variable annuity will be, at least, equal to a stated minimum amount after a specified number of years. Guaranteed Minimum Death Benefit (GMDB) The basic death benefit offered under variable annuity contracts, which specifies that if the owner, or in some contracts the annuitant, dies before annuity income payments begin, the beneficiary will receive a payment equal to (a) the greater of the contract value or (b) purchase payments less withdrawals.  Guaranteed Minimum Income Benefit (GMIB) An annuity option guaranteeing that the owner may annuitize the contract at a stated future date, based on the greater of (a) the actual account value or (b) an amount equal to premiums credited with a defined interest rate or the maximum anniversary value of the account prior to annuitization. Guaranteed Minimum Living Benefit (GMLB) A benefit that protects against investment risks by guaranteeing the level of account values or annuity payments.  There are three types—guaranteed minimum income benefits, guaranteed minimum accumulation benefits, and guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefits. Guaranteed Minimum Withdrawal Benefit (GMWB) A guarantee that promises a certain percentage (usually 5% to 7%) of a guaranteed benefit base (often paid premiums) can be withdrawn annually until the base is completely recovered, regardless of market performance or the actual account balance.    I  I-Share Variable Annuity Also known as fee-based variable annuities in which an investor pays one fee to have the portfolio managed by an investment advisor.  I-shares do not offer a sales commission to the advisor.  However, the advisor assesses fees for the services, including the I-share contract, which is agreed upon by the client. Immediate Annuity An annuity purchased with a single premium on which income payments begin within one year of the contract date. With fixed immediate annuities, the payment is based on a specified interest rate. With variable immediate annuities, payments are based on the value of the underlying investments. Payments are made for the life of the annuitant(s), for a specified period, or both (e.g., 10 years certain and life). Income Floor Guarantee Annuity feature that guarantees payments will never be less than a given percentage of the original payment, such as 80%, regardless of the performance of the underlying investments. Income or Payout Options Methods by which a contract owner can receive income from an annuity. These include a lump-sum payment, systematic withdrawals, living benefits, and annuitization. Indexed Annuity (See Fixed Indexed Annuity.) Individual Retirement Account (IRA) IRC Sec 408(a) defines an IRA as an Individual Retirement Account. Sec 408(b) defines an IRA as an Individual Retirement Annuity. With either definition, an IRA is a tax-advantaged personal savings plan that allows an individual to set aside money for retirement. All or part of the participant’s contributions may be tax deductible, depending on the type of IRA chosen and the investor’s personal financial circumstances. Distributions from most employer-sponsored retirement plans may be eligible to be rolled into an IRA to continue tax-deferred growth until the funds are needed. Generally, distributions are required to begin at age 70 ½.  Initial Interest Rate The rate of interest set by the insurance company each policy year based on the prevailing market rates.

L-share variable annuities typically have higher mortality and expense (M&E) charges than B-share annuities. Levelized Annuity Payments Payments under a variable annuity contract that remain the same for a period of time, such as 12 months, and then change to reflect investment performance. Once changed, the payments remain the same for the next 12 months. Life Annuity Annuity payments that are guaranteed to continue for the life of the annuitant.  Life Expectancy The average duration of the life remaining to a number of persons of a given age (cohort), according to a selected mortality table. Lifetime Income Income payments that continue throughout a person’s life, irrespective of the duration.  Living Benefits The term applied to a series of annuity options that protect against investment risk by guaranteeing either withdrawal payments, account values, or annuity payments.

Mortality and Expense Risk Charge (M&E) A fee charged in variable annuities for insurance guarantees, including the death benefit, the guaranteed lifetime income options, and the guarantee that contract charges will not increase. Mortality Table A table showing the incidence of death at specified ages that is used to determine average life expectancy.     N  Net Asset Value (NAV) The market value of all securities owned by a mutual fund, minus its total liabilities, divided by the number of shares issued. Net Sales or Net Flows Total variable annuity sales minus surrenders, withdrawals, inter- and intra-company exchanges, and benefit payments. Non-Qualified Annuity An annuity in which purchase payments are made with after-tax dollars. Earnings accumulate on a tax-deferred basis until withdrawn.    O  O-Share Variable Annuities Annuity contracts which do not impose up-front sales charges, while, typically, possessing surrender charge periods similar to B-shares. Mortality and expense charges are assessed, and progressively decline throughout the surrender period.     P  Partial Withdrawal The withdrawal of an amount less than the total contract value of an annuity.

Premature Distribution or Withdrawal (Premature Distribution Penalty) Withdrawals made from deferred annuities and certain other tax-favored plans may be subject to an additional 10% federal income tax if the withdrawal is made before the contract owner reaches age 59 1/2. Certain exemptions apply. The contract owner should seek legal and tax advice before making withdrawals prior to age 59 1/2.  Premium Bonus A premium bonus is an additional amount credited to the accumulation account of an annuity policy under certain conditions.  Premiums The amounts of money paid into an annuity contract. Also known as purchase payments.  Premium Taxes Some states charge a tax on the contributions made to an annuity, typically upon annuitization. The issuing company generally charges the annuity contract for any premium tax and other taxes based on premium it pays to the state. Primary Beneficiary The person or entity named as first in line to receive proceeds or benefits from a contract following the death of the contract holder or, in some contracts, the death of the annuitant.  Private Annuity A private annuity is an arrangement in which the client transfers property to an individual or entity in return for a promise of fixed periodic payments for the rest of the client’s life. In private annuities, the person or entity assuming the payment obligation is not in the business of selling annuities. Proceeds The net amount of money payable by the company at the death of the insured or at the maturity of a contract.    Q  Qualified Annuities Qualified annuities are annuities purchased for funding an IRA, 403(b) tax-deferred annuity, or other type of tax-benefited retirement arrangements. An IRA or qualified retirement plan provides tax deferral. An annuity contract should be used to fund an IRA or qualified retirement plan to benefit from annuity features including lifetime income, living benefits, and the guaranteed minimum death benefit.     R  Ratchet Guaranteed Minimum Death Benefit A type of enhanced death benefit that is equal to the greater of (a) the contract value, (b) premium payments less prior withdrawals, or (c) the contract value on a specified prior date. Refund Annuity A contract that provides a lump sum at the death of the annuitant, which when added to total annuity payments equals the purchase price.

Risk Pooling The spreading (in the case of annuities) of longevity risk among a large group of individuals, some of whom die sooner than expected, some of whom will live longer than expected. Rollover The action of moving plan assets from one qualified plan to another or to an IRA within sixty days of distributions, while retaining the tax benefits of a qualified plan.    S  Savings Period or Phase The period in which the owner of a deferred annuity makes payments and accumulates assets.   Section 1035 Exchange or 1035 exchange A tax-free exchange of:  An existing life insurance policy for a new life insurance policy, or  An existing life insurance policy for a new annuity policy, or  An existing annuity policy for a new annuity policy.  A requirement in a 1035 exchange is that the owner is not in constructive receipt of the surrendered contract value. In cases in which the old and new carriers are different companies, this is accomplished by the owner assigning the contract to the new carrier, which takes delivery of the surrender proceeds, which are then applied to the new contract.  Separate Account The insurance company’s investment portfolio that supports variable life and annuity contracts. It is an element of added protection to the investor that variable annuity assets are held in a separate account protected from the claims of insurance company creditors. Service Provider A company that provides any type of service to the plan, including managing assets, recordkeeping, providing plan education, and plan administration. Simplified Employee-Pension Plan (SEP) A defined contribution plan in which employers make contributions to individual employee accounts (similar to IRAs). Single Premium Annuity An annuity contract that is purchased with a single payment. All immediate annuities and some deferred non-qualified annuities are in this category. Split Annuities A split annuity is the combination of a single premium deferred annuity and a single premium immediate annuity. The immediate annuity pays a sum each month over a specified period. The deferred annuity accumulates on a fixed interest basis. The objective is that when the immediate annuity is depleted, the deferred annuity has reestablished the starting principal. Standalone Lifetime Benefit (SALB) A living benefit product that provides protection similar to that provided by the GLWB, while adding flexibility with the various types of assets that can be protected. Stepped-Up Death Benefit A death benefit that is increased periodically to protect investment gains. Straight Life Annuity An annuity income option that pays during the lifetime of the annuitant(s) and ceases at the death of the last surviving annuitant.  Subaccount The investment funds offered in variable annuity contracts are often called subaccounts.

Systematic Withdrawal Plan A distribution method that allows a variable annuity contract owner to periodically receive a specified amount as a partial withdrawal from the annuity contract value prior to the annuity starting date. Unlike lifetime annuity payments, systematic withdrawals continue until the contract value is exhausted. Systematic withdrawals are taxable to the extent they represent investment gain in the contract.    T  Tax-Qualified Retirement Plan A retirement plan, such as an IRA, 401(k), or 403(b), that meets specific requirements of the Internal Revenue Code as well as stipulations in various laws, such as the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 (EGTRRA), and the Pension Protection Act of 2006 (PPA). In some cases, funding of such plans is through fixed or variable annuities. Tax-Sheltered Annuities A type of retirement plan for employees of tax-exempt organizations or schools, which are covered under Section 403(b) of the IRC. Tax-sheltered annuities are funded by pre-tax contributions made through salary reduction agreements. Employers may also make direct contributions on behalf of employees.

Each investment subaccount has a separate unit value.  The unit value increases with positive investment performance in the subaccount and decreases with negative investment performance and with asset management and insurance charges.      V  Variable Annuitization A stream of income payments that vary based on the investment performance of underlying subaccounts.  Variable Annuity An insurance company contract into which the buyer makes a lump-sum payment or series of payments. In return, the insurer agrees to make periodic payments beginning immediately or at some future date. Purchase payments are directed to a range of investment options, which may be mutual funds, or directly into the separate account of the insurance company that manages the portfolios. The value of the account during accumulation, and the income payments after annuitization vary, depending on the performance of the investment options chosen.  Variable Annuity Payment Floor A guaranteed minimum amount for each annuity payment. Variable Annuity Unit Value A measurement of the performance of the underlying funds in a variable annuity, similar to the share value of a stock. Each investment subaccount has a separate unit value. The unit value increases with positive investment performance in the subaccount, and decreases with negative investment performance and with asset management and insurance charges.  Variable Investment Options The investment choices available to a variable annuity contract owner.  These choices typically include stock, bond, and money market funds.    W   Withdrawal Fee An administrative fee charged on withdrawals. Wrap-fee A comprehensive charge levied by an investment manager or investment advisor to a client for providing a bundle of services, such as investment advice, investment research and brokerage services.

X  X-Share (Bonus) Variable Annuities X-share variable annuity contracts credit an additional amount or bonus to the contract value, which is calculated as a percentage of purchase payments added to the contract at, or subsequent to, contract issue. Contract charges may be higher in X-share products.

Participation and Protection: With No Annual Fees




When planning for retirement, you can’t risk everything and you can’t protect everything.
But there is a way to have some of both.










A Shield Annuity from Brighthouse Financial can help you use a portion of your assets to take advantage of market
            growth with a level of downside protection that other options may not provide. Shield is designed to provide
            some protection in an unpredictable endeavor — investing.





Protect your retirement assets
A Brighthouse Shield Annuity is designed to provide a level of protection that, when markets inevitably turn volatile,
            ensures your losses are limited.



Participate in growth opportunities
With a Shield Annuity, balance is built-in. This means that even with the protection you enjoy, you can still take
            advantage of growth opportunities in the market up to a certain percentage.



Pay no annual fees
Unlike many financial products, you pay no annual fees with a Shield Annuity.

Annuities




Building a brighter future begins with knowing what you’ll have in retirement. Annuities can help you grow and protect what you’ve saved. They provide guaranteed¹ income for you and your loved ones regardless of market performance. And because one size doesn’t fit all, Brighthouse Financial annuities are flexible enough to meet your unique saving and investing goals.

1 Guarantees are subject to the financial strength and claims-paying ability of the issuing insurance company.
2 Shield annuities do not invest directly in any index.
3 Product guarantees are subject to the financial strength and claims-paying ability of the issuing insurance company and are solely the responsibility of the issuing insurance company. Annuities and life insurance are issued by Brighthouse Life Insurance Company, Charlotte, NC 28277 and in New York, only by Brighthouse Life Insurance Company of NY, New York, NY 10017 and not by MetLife.
If you're buying an annuity to fund a qualified retirement plan or IRA, you should do so for the annuity's features and benefits other than tax deferral. That's because tax deferral is not an additional benefit of the annuity. References throughout this material to tax advantage, such as tax deferral and tax-free transfers, are subject to this consideration. In addition, non-qualified annuity contracts owned by corporations do not receive tax deferral on earnings. 

Prospectuses for variable annuities issued by a Brighthouse Financial insurance company, and for the investment portfolios offered thereunder, are available from Brighthouse Financial. The contract prospectus contains information about the contract's features, risks, charges and expenses. The investment objectives, risks and policies of the investment options, as well as other information about the investment options, are described in their respective prospectuses. Please read the prospectuses and consider this information carefully before investing. There is no guarantee that any of the variable investment options in a variable annuity product will meet their stated goals or objectives. The account value is subject to market fluctuations and investment risk so that, when withdrawn, it may be worth more or less than its original value even when an optional protection benefit rider is elected. Product availability and features may vary by state. Please refer to the contract prospectus for more complete details regarding the living and death benefits.

Annuities are long-term investments designed for retirement purposes. Brighthouse Financial annuities have limitations, exclusions, charges, termination provisions and terms for keeping them in force. All contract guarantees, including optional living and death benefit riders and annuity payout rates, are backed by the claims-paying ability and financial strength of issuing insurance company. They are not backed by the broker/dealer from which an annuity is purchased, by the insurance agency where an annuity is purchased, or any affiliates to those entities, and none makes any representations or guarantees regarding the claims-paying ability and financial strength of the issuing insurance company. Similarity, the issuing insurance company and the underwriter do not back the financial strength of the broker/dealer or its affiliates. Please contact your financial professional for complete details. 

Withdrawals of taxable amounts are subject to ordinary income tax and if made before age 59½, may be subject to a 10% federal income tax penalty. Some broker/dealers and financial professionals may refer to the 10% federal income tax penalty as an "additional tax" or "additional income tax" or use the terms interchangeably when discussing withdrawals taken prior to age 59½. Distributions of taxable amounts from a non-qualified annuity may also be subject to the 3.8% Unearned Income Medicare Contribution Tax on Net Investment Income if your modified adjusted gross income exceeds the applicable threshold amount. Withdrawals will reduce the living and death benefits and account value. Withdrawals may be subject to withdrawal charges. 

Any discussion of taxes is for general informational purposes only, does not purport to be complete or cover every situation, and should not be construed as legal, tax, or accounting advice. You should confer with your qualified legal, tax, and accounting advisors as appropriate.

Brighthouse Financial, an operating segment of MetLife, Inc. (NYSE: MET), announced on March 6, 2017 that it is now offering its suite of life insurance and annuity products under the Brighthouse Financial brand. 
*Data as of March 31, 2017. Total assets includes certain adjustments for transactions associated with the separation from MetLife, Inc.

Ratings as of May 2017. Operating entities collectively rated include Brighthouse Life Insurance Company (BLIC), NELICO, and Brighthouse Life Insurance Company of NY (BLNY); note, Moody’s and Fitch do not rate BLNY.
A.M. Best’s Financial Strength Rating is an independent opinion of an insurer’s financial strength and ability to meet its ongoing insurance policy and contract obligations. A Financial Strength Rating is not assigned to specific insurance policies or contracts and does not address any other risk, including, but not limited to, an insurer’s claims-payment policies or procedures; the ability of the insurer to dispute or deny claims payment on grounds of misrepresentation or fraud; or any specific liability contractually borne by the policy or contract holder. A Financial Strength Rating is not a recommendation to purchase, hold, or terminate any insurance policy, contract or any other financial obligation issued by an insurer, nor does it address the suitability of any particular policy or contract, for a specific purpose or purchaser. Ratings explanations can be found at www.ambest.com.
Fitch’s Insurer Financial Strength Rating provides an assessment of the financial strength of an insurance organization. The Insurer Financial Strength Rating is assigned to the insurance company’s policyholder obligations, including assumed reinsurance obligations and contract holder obligations, such as guaranteed investment contracts. Ratings explanations can be found at www.fitchratings.com.
Moody’s Insurance Financial Strength Rating is an opinion of the ability of an insurance company to pay punctually senior policyholder claims and obligations and also reflect the expected financial loss suffered in the event of default. Specific obligations are considered unrated unless they are individually rated because the standing of a particular insurance obligation would depend on an assessment of its relative standing under those laws governing both the obligation and the insurance company. Ratings explanations can be found at www.moodys.com.
S&P Global Insurer Financial Strength Rating is a forward-looking opinion about the financial security characteristics of an insurance organization with respect to its ability to pay under its insurance policies and contracts in accordance with their terms. This opinion is not specific to any particular policy or contract, nor does it address the suitability of a particular policy or contract for a specific purpose or purchaser. Ratings explanations can be found at www.standardandpoors.com.
