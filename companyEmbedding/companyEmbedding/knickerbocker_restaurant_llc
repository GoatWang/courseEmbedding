AN OASISIN THE HEART OF TIMES SQUARE


The Knickerbocker is a haven of refined elegance, created by John Jacob Astor in 1906 and now reimagined into a sophisticated urban sanctuary mere blocks from Fifth Avenue, MoMA, Rockefeller Center and Central Park.


Here is where famed Italian tenor Enrico Caruso and renowned American playwright George M. Cohan made their homes, and where names like Rockefeller and Fitzgerald gathered in what was once known as the 42nd Street Country Club.

Relax in style
Filled with fabled legends, The Knickerbocker once played host to legendary political bigwigs, actresses, oil tycoons and sports figures—and it’s rumored the martini was invented here in the hotel. While historic details like the hotel’s gorgeous Beaux-Arts facade remain unchanged, a soothing new luxury aesthetic is offered within.

The stunning transformation of this treasured Manhattan monument invites discerning travelers to discover 330 luxe guestrooms and suites boasting incredible views and bespoke furnishings.
An air of posh authenticity embraces New York City’s premier luxury lifestyle hotel with cuisine by Charlie Palmer, style by Ted Gibson and a robust fitness program curated by New York Knicks star Larry Johnson.

Chicago hotels Guide 	Nicknamed the Second City, in reality, Chicago is second to none. Known as much for its blues — and blues brothers — as it is for its famous gangsters and deep-dish pizza, Chicago is also a mecca of art, theater, dining, and other culture. 	Chicago hotels offer visitors a bit of everything. Accommodations run the gamut from bargain hotels to luxury hotels in Chicago's downtown. Guests spend the day taking in the city's many sights and tours and head to a ballgame at historic Wrigley Field, one of the best in the U.S., or they enjoy one of the many world-class museums and take in some of the first-rate theater in the evening, topping it off with a nightcap and a view of the town at the Hancock tower's Signature Lounge. Navy Pier is a great place for families to keep busy between getting some rest at one of the top Chicago hotels. 	Chicago Quick Picks and Tips 	Conventions 	Chicago has several locations that attract trade shows from around the country. The Merchandise Mart is one of the more popular venues and is the yearly host of the National Prom Market, the USA's largest business-services trade event. 	Dining 	Food in Chicago: plentiful, diverse, and tasty of, course. Chicago is known for its Italian and Polish food. Lou Malnati's, which has several Chicago locations, is famous for its Chicago-style deep-dish pizza. 	Major Point of Interest 	Chicago visitors won't want to miss the Art Institute of Chicago and its impressive collection of Asian, modern and American art and much, much more. 	Shopping 	Any shopper booking a room in one of the many Chicago hotels shouldn't forget the Magnificent Mile. This section of Michigan Avenue is filled with history, shopping opportunities, and other entertainment to make your trip more than worthwhile. 	Sports 	Chicago has two major-league baseball teams, the Cubs and White Sox, and given the fierce loyalty of each team's fans, it's a good thing their respective parks are located so far apart. NFL fans have the Chicago Bears, while hockey fans root for the Blackhawks, and basketball fans cheer for the Bulls. 	Chicago Neighborhoods 	Chicago is divided into over 70 different neighborhoods, each with its own distinct feel and flavor. The Downtown Loop, or city center, is the commercial and financial district, and many of the city's cultural institutions are located here as well, including the Magnificent Mile, a shopper's paradise, and Grant Park, where guests can choose to stay at the luxury Talbott Hotel. Travelers seeking one of the less expensive Chicago hotels opt for the Days Inn on the North Side, located right in the middle of the most dense population center of the city and near Lincoln Park. 	The South Side is Chicago's largest area and includes many parks and public beaches. Also located here are Jackson Park, site of the 1893 Columbian Exposition, the Museum of Science and Industry (the last remaining building from the Exposition), and U.S. Cellular Field, home of the Chicago White Sox. The West Side is known for its ethnic enclaves and is home to the NBA's Chicago Bulls and the NHL's Chicago Blackhawks. Overall, visitors should try to find Chicago hotels they can use for a base of operations because this vast city and all its sites can't be explored in one day — or even a week.

Very nice hotel. Good food, good prices. Well located. Valet parking was very expensive.

















Room shown during booking was not the same during the checked in. I was assigned smaller room and amenities are not accepted has to asked 2x for coffee packet in 2 separate days. no refrigerator for use no coffee table to plug in machine, phone hand set does not work. computer does not work  customer service sucks! restaurant staff are rude and did not serve what is in the menu that was ordered during easter brunch pillows are old and over used. overall 2 star not even closed to becoming 3 star just room fridge are used by hotel not by guest. amenities are unacceptable for 3 star. 

















Great hotel !! Close to everything .... no hassle checking in early. Will be back. 

















My room was small, but couldn't have been better for my needs as a single person. The Art Institute of Chicago was no more than a 20 minute walk, and along the way I passed the Water Tower Place, Millennium Park, and half a dozen amazing restaurants (the steak I had from The Drake was hands down the best I've ever had). I lost my keycard early in my stay and expected to have to pay for the lost card when getting a replacement, and was pleasantly surprised to learn that I wouldn't be charged anything at all. My only complaints are minor, and I'd definitely stay again even if those didn't improve.

















Decided to stay over nite at the last minute. Everyone at the hotel seemed delighted that we were there. Comfy room, fun bar in the lobby. Great location a block off Michigan avenue. Will become our Go-To hotel in Chicago

















The staff was friendly and very helpful. A great value and close to great restaurants and shopping!

















This hotel is close to the magnificent mile and great restaurants. The hotel bar is awesome . The hotel restaurant is a little pricey for breakfast but the service and food were great. 

















leftovers in fridge from previous occupants, so with that in mind how do you know to charge for items missing in wetbar
hotel needed to be updated 10 years ago. the paint and previous work done on hotel was of low quality and it showed
carpet was peeling up from baseboards, carpet had stains, sink leaked underneath cabinet onto towels, glass doors were weak mold in shower curtains were old and dingy 

















We loved being so close to shopping, and the hotel itself was beautiful. All staff was very friendly, room was comfy. Great stay!

















Hotel guest experience was as excellent as a previous stay. Great location for vacationing in the city. The knowledgeable and friendly staff, the excellent amenities, live music in lobby all contribute to an excellent guest experience. 

















Nice clean room at a great price.  Bathroom was wonderful.  Bar and breakfast were very nice!

















Very small room with very small window.  At check-in, front desk person ignored me standing there for several minutes while he finished some paperwork. He never even looked at me to say "I'll be with you in a minute."  When he finally did acknowledge me, he was kind of rude.  I felt like I was just a nuisance to him.  Not the way to greet a guest. 

















You have to look at the age of the building and enjoy it's charm.  One of the three elevators was out of order but never slowed us down.  The neighborhood is beautiful and the lake is right there.  Convenient to get everywhere!

I will stay there again!!

















I think it was recently renovated.  Use to have very large, old, well kept rooms. New rooms are "New York" small but nicely redone. We got the room when prices were down so it was a really good deal considering the location.  Only stayed one night so did not try out the restaurant or explore the hotel which has a very long, distinguished history.  Queen Elizabeth once stayed here. Rooms are smaller than Westin or Hilton that are around the corner.

















good location, old building, all the elevators were not working most of the time.  cost to park in the building is over $60 a night!!!  room was pretty small, but cost for downtown was affordable.

















Great location. Close to bus lines, etc. Small but clean room. 


















This hotel has always been one of my favorites in Chicago.  The staff is really nice, check-in is efficient and the location is great.  The rooms are really nice and in good condition.

















Late week stay in the city for two nights was just what was ordered.

















I highly recommend this property.  Location grear!  Staff friendly and accommodating.

















It's a great location minutes to magnificent mile and Lakeshore Dr.   Updated with overnight parking garage across the street.  Would stay here again.

Thank you very for the high review. Happy to hear you had an enjoyable experience. One down fall of Chicago are the high prices for parking. Hopefully that doesn't deter you from coming back to the Knickerbocker and the great city of Chicago. Thank you again.
