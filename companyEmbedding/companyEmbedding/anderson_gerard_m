Striking at the Heels - The Reptile Plaintiff's Approach
Mar 3, 2016  |   
Reasonable Medical Expenses
Mar 3, 2016  |   

Yesterday the President’s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology (“PCAST“) released a final Report finding that many of the forensic science techniques used to prosecute criminal cases do not meet scientific standards.  Specifically, the Report raised issues with the use of tool-mark analysis (ballistics), bite mark, hair, footwear and other evidence used in criminal cases all over the country.  This is yet another critical look at the state of forensic science and the way it is used to convict people at a staggering rate.
The Report said:




PCAST concluded that there are two important gaps: (1) the need for clarity about the scientific standards for the validity and reliability of forensic methods and (2) the need to evaluate specific forensic methods to determine whether they have been scientifically established to be valid and reliable. Our study aimed to help close these gaps for a number of forensic “feature-comparison” methods—specifically, methods for comparing DNA samples, bitemarks, latent fingerprints, firearm marks, footwear, and hair.

Despite the Report’s recommendations, the Attorney General stated that the Department of Justice will not adopt the recommendations in relation to the admissibility of forensic science as evidence at trial.  This comes only a few days after DOJ issued a Memorandum addressing certain changes in their policy towards forensic evidence and releasing a code of professional conduct for forensic analysts.

The ongoing struggle of the validity of forensic science in the courtroom and ways to improve the reliability of the science is ongoing.  This is an incredibly important topic in terms of criminal defense because of the likelihood that a jury will believe “scientific” evidence over other potentially more reliable evidence because they are told that it is, in fact, science.  If you have been charged with a crime and the evidence includes any kind of forensic evidence it is important to contact an attorney that is familiar with the challenges of forensic evidence.

Biography[edit]
Anderson was born on March 7, 1989 in Subic, Zambales, Philippines. His father is an American instructor in the Subic Naval Base who travels back and forth between the United States and Zambales while his mother is a Filipina businesswoman from General Santos City, Philippines. He also has a younger brother (Kenneth Anderson) and two older sisters from his mother's first marriage. When he was three years old, he and his family moved from General Santos City to San Antonio, Texas, and then to Springfield, Missouri, when he was six. Finally, at 14 years of age, his family moved back to General Santos City.
Anderson is multilingual, demonstrating oral fluency in both English and Tagalog through his work; he also has some proficiency in Cebuano. He finished his elementary studies in San Antonio, Texas, and his high school degree in General Santos City, Philippines.
Acting career[edit]




Anderson in 2006


Anderson was discovered by Joross Gamboa when Gamboa performed in Anderson's hometown. Gamboa introduced him to his manager, Jhun Reyes, who brought him to ABS-CBN for the first season of Pinoy Big Brother: Teen Edition. Anderson and the other housemates entered the Big Brother house on April 23, 2006. After 42 days, he was named Teen Third Big Placer on the show.
Six months later, Anderson and screen partner/then-girlfriend, actress Kim Chiu, appeared together on several ABS-CBN shows (including Love Spell and Aalog-Alog) and in the film First Day High. In 2007 Anderson and Chiu starred in their first primetime TV series, Sana Maulit Muli; in September of that year they appeared in their first feature film, I've Fallen For You, produced by Star Cinema. That year, he was the Best New Male TV Personality (for Sana Maulit Muli) at the 21st PMPC Star Awards and the 38th Guillermo Mendoza Memorial Scholarship Foundation Box Office Awards (with Chiu). In May 2008 Anderson and Chiu were cast in My Girl, an adaptation of the South Korean TV series.
In 2009, Anderson starred in the primetime drama series Tayong Dalawa, winning the Best Drama Actor award at the NSUU TV Awards; Anderson and Chiu were the Most Popular Loveteam for the third consecutive year at the Guillermo Mendoza Memorial Scholarship Foundation Box Office Awards. In August of that year, he appeared in Agimat: Ang Mga Alamat ni Ramon Revilla:Tiagong Akyat.
The following year, Anderson started with Kim Chiu in the film Paano Na Kaya. He was cast in the ABS-CBN primetime drama Kung Tayo'y Magkakalayo, and appeared in Your Song Presents: Isla with his Pinoy Big Brother Unlimited former housemates. Anderson and Chiu teamed up again in October 2011 for the film Till My Heartaches End. That month, it was reported that the couple had ended their romantic relationship.
In 2011 Anderson first worked with Sarah Geronimo in a film collaboration with Star Cinema and Viva Films entitled Catch Me, I'm in Love (shown on March 23, 2011), and in October he returned in the primetime series Budoy (his first primetime television series without Chiu). He starred with Jessy Mendiola; Chiu had an adjacent time slot with her drama, My Binondo Girl with Xian Lim. In November 2011 Anderson made another film with Geronimo, Won't Last A Day Without You. He reunited in a movie with Chiu titled 24/7 in Love, Star Magic's ensemble film in view of the agency's 20th year anniversary.[2] He is starring as Miguel Dizon in the 2013 teleserye, Bukas Na Lang Kita Mamahalin alongside Dawn Zulueta and Kapamilya Leading Lady The Jewel of Drama Cristine Reyes.

Biography[edit]
Anderson was born on March 7, 1989 in Subic, Zambales, Philippines. His father is an American instructor in the Subic Naval Base who travels back and forth between the United States and Zambales while his mother is a Filipina businesswoman from General Santos City, Philippines. He also has a younger brother (Kenneth Anderson) and two older sisters from his mother's first marriage. When he was three years old, he and his family moved from General Santos City to San Antonio, Texas, and then to Springfield, Missouri, when he was six. Finally, at 14 years of age, his family moved back to General Santos City.
Anderson is multilingual, demonstrating oral fluency in both English and Tagalog through his work; he also has some proficiency in Cebuano. He finished his elementary studies in San Antonio, Texas, and his high school degree in General Santos City, Philippines.
Acting career[edit]




Anderson in 2006


Anderson was discovered by Joross Gamboa when Gamboa performed in Anderson's hometown. Gamboa introduced him to his manager, Jhun Reyes, who brought him to ABS-CBN for the first season of Pinoy Big Brother: Teen Edition. Anderson and the other housemates entered the Big Brother house on April 23, 2006. After 42 days, he was named Teen Third Big Placer on the show.
Six months later, Anderson and screen partner/then-girlfriend, actress Kim Chiu, appeared together on several ABS-CBN shows (including Love Spell and Aalog-Alog) and in the film First Day High. In 2007 Anderson and Chiu starred in their first primetime TV series, Sana Maulit Muli; in September of that year they appeared in their first feature film, I've Fallen For You, produced by Star Cinema. That year, he was the Best New Male TV Personality (for Sana Maulit Muli) at the 21st PMPC Star Awards and the 38th Guillermo Mendoza Memorial Scholarship Foundation Box Office Awards (with Chiu). In May 2008 Anderson and Chiu were cast in My Girl, an adaptation of the South Korean TV series.
In 2009, Anderson starred in the primetime drama series Tayong Dalawa, winning the Best Drama Actor award at the NSUU TV Awards; Anderson and Chiu were the Most Popular Loveteam for the third consecutive year at the Guillermo Mendoza Memorial Scholarship Foundation Box Office Awards. In August of that year, he appeared in Agimat: Ang Mga Alamat ni Ramon Revilla:Tiagong Akyat.
The following year, Anderson started with Kim Chiu in the film Paano Na Kaya. He was cast in the ABS-CBN primetime drama Kung Tayo'y Magkakalayo, and appeared in Your Song Presents: Isla with his Pinoy Big Brother Unlimited former housemates. Anderson and Chiu teamed up again in October 2011 for the film Till My Heartaches End. That month, it was reported that the couple had ended their romantic relationship.
In 2011 Anderson first worked with Sarah Geronimo in a film collaboration with Star Cinema and Viva Films entitled Catch Me, I'm in Love (shown on March 23, 2011), and in October he returned in the primetime series Budoy (his first primetime television series without Chiu). He starred with Jessy Mendiola; Chiu had an adjacent time slot with her drama, My Binondo Girl with Xian Lim. In November 2011 Anderson made another film with Geronimo, Won't Last A Day Without You. He reunited in a movie with Chiu titled 24/7 in Love, Star Magic's ensemble film in view of the agency's 20th year anniversary.[2] He is starring as Miguel Dizon in the 2013 teleserye, Bukas Na Lang Kita Mamahalin alongside Dawn Zulueta and Kapamilya Leading Lady The Jewel of Drama Cristine Reyes.

Biography[edit]
Anderson was born on March 7, 1989 in Subic, Zambales, Philippines. His father is an American instructor in the Subic Naval Base who travels back and forth between the United States and Zambales while his mother is a Filipina businesswoman from General Santos City, Philippines. He also has a younger brother (Kenneth Anderson) and two older sisters from his mother's first marriage. When he was three years old, he and his family moved from General Santos City to San Antonio, Texas, and then to Springfield, Missouri, when he was six. Finally, at 14 years of age, his family moved back to General Santos City.
Anderson is multilingual, demonstrating oral fluency in both English and Tagalog through his work; he also has some proficiency in Cebuano. He finished his elementary studies in San Antonio, Texas, and his high school degree in General Santos City, Philippines.
Acting career[edit]




Anderson in 2006


Anderson was discovered by Joross Gamboa when Gamboa performed in Anderson's hometown. Gamboa introduced him to his manager, Jhun Reyes, who brought him to ABS-CBN for the first season of Pinoy Big Brother: Teen Edition. Anderson and the other housemates entered the Big Brother house on April 23, 2006. After 42 days, he was named Teen Third Big Placer on the show.
Six months later, Anderson and screen partner/then-girlfriend, actress Kim Chiu, appeared together on several ABS-CBN shows (including Love Spell and Aalog-Alog) and in the film First Day High. In 2007 Anderson and Chiu starred in their first primetime TV series, Sana Maulit Muli; in September of that year they appeared in their first feature film, I've Fallen For You, produced by Star Cinema. That year, he was the Best New Male TV Personality (for Sana Maulit Muli) at the 21st PMPC Star Awards and the 38th Guillermo Mendoza Memorial Scholarship Foundation Box Office Awards (with Chiu). In May 2008 Anderson and Chiu were cast in My Girl, an adaptation of the South Korean TV series.
In 2009, Anderson starred in the primetime drama series Tayong Dalawa, winning the Best Drama Actor award at the NSUU TV Awards; Anderson and Chiu were the Most Popular Loveteam for the third consecutive year at the Guillermo Mendoza Memorial Scholarship Foundation Box Office Awards. In August of that year, he appeared in Agimat: Ang Mga Alamat ni Ramon Revilla:Tiagong Akyat.
The following year, Anderson started with Kim Chiu in the film Paano Na Kaya. He was cast in the ABS-CBN primetime drama Kung Tayo'y Magkakalayo, and appeared in Your Song Presents: Isla with his Pinoy Big Brother Unlimited former housemates. Anderson and Chiu teamed up again in October 2011 for the film Till My Heartaches End. That month, it was reported that the couple had ended their romantic relationship.
In 2011 Anderson first worked with Sarah Geronimo in a film collaboration with Star Cinema and Viva Films entitled Catch Me, I'm in Love (shown on March 23, 2011), and in October he returned in the primetime series Budoy (his first primetime television series without Chiu). He starred with Jessy Mendiola; Chiu had an adjacent time slot with her drama, My Binondo Girl with Xian Lim. In November 2011 Anderson made another film with Geronimo, Won't Last A Day Without You. He reunited in a movie with Chiu titled 24/7 in Love, Star Magic's ensemble film in view of the agency's 20th year anniversary.[2] He is starring as Miguel Dizon in the 2013 teleserye, Bukas Na Lang Kita Mamahalin alongside Dawn Zulueta and Kapamilya Leading Lady The Jewel of Drama Cristine Reyes.

Biography[edit]
Anderson was born on March 7, 1989 in Subic, Zambales, Philippines. His father is an American instructor in the Subic Naval Base who travels back and forth between the United States and Zambales while his mother is a Filipina businesswoman from General Santos City, Philippines. He also has a younger brother (Kenneth Anderson) and two older sisters from his mother's first marriage. When he was three years old, he and his family moved from General Santos City to San Antonio, Texas, and then to Springfield, Missouri, when he was six. Finally, at 14 years of age, his family moved back to General Santos City.
Anderson is multilingual, demonstrating oral fluency in both English and Tagalog through his work; he also has some proficiency in Cebuano. He finished his elementary studies in San Antonio, Texas, and his high school degree in General Santos City, Philippines.
Acting career[edit]




Anderson in 2006


Anderson was discovered by Joross Gamboa when Gamboa performed in Anderson's hometown. Gamboa introduced him to his manager, Jhun Reyes, who brought him to ABS-CBN for the first season of Pinoy Big Brother: Teen Edition. Anderson and the other housemates entered the Big Brother house on April 23, 2006. After 42 days, he was named Teen Third Big Placer on the show.
Six months later, Anderson and screen partner/then-girlfriend, actress Kim Chiu, appeared together on several ABS-CBN shows (including Love Spell and Aalog-Alog) and in the film First Day High. In 2007 Anderson and Chiu starred in their first primetime TV series, Sana Maulit Muli; in September of that year they appeared in their first feature film, I've Fallen For You, produced by Star Cinema. That year, he was the Best New Male TV Personality (for Sana Maulit Muli) at the 21st PMPC Star Awards and the 38th Guillermo Mendoza Memorial Scholarship Foundation Box Office Awards (with Chiu). In May 2008 Anderson and Chiu were cast in My Girl, an adaptation of the South Korean TV series.
In 2009, Anderson starred in the primetime drama series Tayong Dalawa, winning the Best Drama Actor award at the NSUU TV Awards; Anderson and Chiu were the Most Popular Loveteam for the third consecutive year at the Guillermo Mendoza Memorial Scholarship Foundation Box Office Awards. In August of that year, he appeared in Agimat: Ang Mga Alamat ni Ramon Revilla:Tiagong Akyat.
The following year, Anderson started with Kim Chiu in the film Paano Na Kaya. He was cast in the ABS-CBN primetime drama Kung Tayo'y Magkakalayo, and appeared in Your Song Presents: Isla with his Pinoy Big Brother Unlimited former housemates. Anderson and Chiu teamed up again in October 2011 for the film Till My Heartaches End. That month, it was reported that the couple had ended their romantic relationship.
In 2011 Anderson first worked with Sarah Geronimo in a film collaboration with Star Cinema and Viva Films entitled Catch Me, I'm in Love (shown on March 23, 2011), and in October he returned in the primetime series Budoy (his first primetime television series without Chiu). He starred with Jessy Mendiola; Chiu had an adjacent time slot with her drama, My Binondo Girl with Xian Lim. In November 2011 Anderson made another film with Geronimo, Won't Last A Day Without You. He reunited in a movie with Chiu titled 24/7 in Love, Star Magic's ensemble film in view of the agency's 20th year anniversary.[2] He is starring as Miguel Dizon in the 2013 teleserye, Bukas Na Lang Kita Mamahalin alongside Dawn Zulueta and Kapamilya Leading Lady The Jewel of Drama Cristine Reyes.

Biography[edit]
Anderson was born on March 7, 1989 in Subic, Zambales, Philippines. His father is an American instructor in the Subic Naval Base who travels back and forth between the United States and Zambales while his mother is a Filipina businesswoman from General Santos City, Philippines. He also has a younger brother (Kenneth Anderson) and two older sisters from his mother's first marriage. When he was three years old, he and his family moved from General Santos City to San Antonio, Texas, and then to Springfield, Missouri, when he was six. Finally, at 14 years of age, his family moved back to General Santos City.
Anderson is multilingual, demonstrating oral fluency in both English and Tagalog through his work; he also has some proficiency in Cebuano. He finished his elementary studies in San Antonio, Texas, and his high school degree in General Santos City, Philippines.
Acting career[edit]




Anderson in 2006


Anderson was discovered by Joross Gamboa when Gamboa performed in Anderson's hometown. Gamboa introduced him to his manager, Jhun Reyes, who brought him to ABS-CBN for the first season of Pinoy Big Brother: Teen Edition. Anderson and the other housemates entered the Big Brother house on April 23, 2006. After 42 days, he was named Teen Third Big Placer on the show.
Six months later, Anderson and screen partner/then-girlfriend, actress Kim Chiu, appeared together on several ABS-CBN shows (including Love Spell and Aalog-Alog) and in the film First Day High. In 2007 Anderson and Chiu starred in their first primetime TV series, Sana Maulit Muli; in September of that year they appeared in their first feature film, I've Fallen For You, produced by Star Cinema. That year, he was the Best New Male TV Personality (for Sana Maulit Muli) at the 21st PMPC Star Awards and the 38th Guillermo Mendoza Memorial Scholarship Foundation Box Office Awards (with Chiu). In May 2008 Anderson and Chiu were cast in My Girl, an adaptation of the South Korean TV series.
In 2009, Anderson starred in the primetime drama series Tayong Dalawa, winning the Best Drama Actor award at the NSUU TV Awards; Anderson and Chiu were the Most Popular Loveteam for the third consecutive year at the Guillermo Mendoza Memorial Scholarship Foundation Box Office Awards. In August of that year, he appeared in Agimat: Ang Mga Alamat ni Ramon Revilla:Tiagong Akyat.
The following year, Anderson started with Kim Chiu in the film Paano Na Kaya. He was cast in the ABS-CBN primetime drama Kung Tayo'y Magkakalayo, and appeared in Your Song Presents: Isla with his Pinoy Big Brother Unlimited former housemates. Anderson and Chiu teamed up again in October 2011 for the film Till My Heartaches End. That month, it was reported that the couple had ended their romantic relationship.
In 2011 Anderson first worked with Sarah Geronimo in a film collaboration with Star Cinema and Viva Films entitled Catch Me, I'm in Love (shown on March 23, 2011), and in October he returned in the primetime series Budoy (his first primetime television series without Chiu). He starred with Jessy Mendiola; Chiu had an adjacent time slot with her drama, My Binondo Girl with Xian Lim. In November 2011 Anderson made another film with Geronimo, Won't Last A Day Without You. He reunited in a movie with Chiu titled 24/7 in Love, Star Magic's ensemble film in view of the agency's 20th year anniversary.[2] He is starring as Miguel Dizon in the 2013 teleserye, Bukas Na Lang Kita Mamahalin alongside Dawn Zulueta and Kapamilya Leading Lady The Jewel of Drama Cristine Reyes.

Biography[edit]
Anderson was born on March 7, 1989 in Subic, Zambales, Philippines. His father is an American instructor in the Subic Naval Base who travels back and forth between the United States and Zambales while his mother is a Filipina businesswoman from General Santos City, Philippines. He also has a younger brother (Kenneth Anderson) and two older sisters from his mother's first marriage. When he was three years old, he and his family moved from General Santos City to San Antonio, Texas, and then to Springfield, Missouri, when he was six. Finally, at 14 years of age, his family moved back to General Santos City.
Anderson is multilingual, demonstrating oral fluency in both English and Tagalog through his work; he also has some proficiency in Cebuano. He finished his elementary studies in San Antonio, Texas, and his high school degree in General Santos City, Philippines.
Acting career[edit]

Anderson was discovered by Joross Gamboa when Gamboa performed in Anderson's hometown. Gamboa introduced him to his manager, Jhun Reyes, who brought him to ABS-CBN for the first season of Pinoy Big Brother: Teen Edition. Anderson and the other housemates entered the Big Brother house on April 23, 2006. After 42 days, he was named Teen Third Big Placer on the show.
Six months later, Anderson and screen partner/then-girlfriend, actress Kim Chiu, appeared together on several ABS-CBN shows (including Love Spell and Aalog-Alog) and in the film First Day High. In 2007 Anderson and Chiu starred in their first primetime TV series, Sana Maulit Muli; in September of that year they appeared in their first feature film, I've Fallen For You, produced by Star Cinema. That year, he was the Best New Male TV Personality (for Sana Maulit Muli) at the 21st PMPC Star Awards and the 38th Guillermo Mendoza Memorial Scholarship Foundation Box Office Awards (with Chiu). In May 2008 Anderson and Chiu were cast in My Girl, an adaptation of the South Korean TV series.
In 2009, Anderson starred in the primetime drama series Tayong Dalawa, winning the Best Drama Actor award at the NSUU TV Awards; Anderson and Chiu were the Most Popular Loveteam for the third consecutive year at the Guillermo Mendoza Memorial Scholarship Foundation Box Office Awards. In August of that year, he appeared in Agimat: Ang Mga Alamat ni Ramon Revilla:Tiagong Akyat.
The following year, Anderson started with Kim Chiu in the film Paano Na Kaya. He was cast in the ABS-CBN primetime drama Kung Tayo'y Magkakalayo, and appeared in Your Song Presents: Isla with his Pinoy Big Brother Unlimited former housemates. Anderson and Chiu teamed up again in October 2011 for the film Till My Heartaches End. That month, it was reported that the couple had ended their romantic relationship.
In 2011 Anderson first worked with Sarah Geronimo in a film collaboration with Star Cinema and Viva Films entitled Catch Me, I'm in Love (shown on March 23, 2011), and in October he returned in the primetime series Budoy (his first primetime television series without Chiu). He starred with Jessy Mendiola; Chiu had an adjacent time slot with her drama, My Binondo Girl with Xian Lim. In November 2011 Anderson made another film with Geronimo, Won't Last A Day Without You. He reunited in a movie with Chiu titled 24/7 in Love, Star Magic's ensemble film in view of the agency's 20th year anniversary.[2] He is starring as Miguel Dizon in the 2013 teleserye, Bukas Na Lang Kita Mamahalin alongside Dawn Zulueta and Kapamilya Leading Lady The Jewel of Drama Cristine Reyes.
