Simlatus CEO Discusses 2017 Projected Revenues With Virtual Reality Product






 GRASS VALLEY, CA--(Marketwired - Mar 7, 2017) -  Simlatus Corporation (OTC PINK: SIML) -- announces today the release of its CEO Podcast interview with Uptick Newswire's host Everett Jolly. The broadcast industry is a changing organism of technology, and Simlatus has left its footprints with the industry's major studios like CBS, FOX, NBC, ABC, ESPN and DirecTV over the past 18 years.

To learn more about SyncPal please click the link below:
http://simlatus.com/product/syncpal/
The company's Chief Executive Officer discussed the 2017 roll-out for another innovative commercial broadcast product referred to as SyncPal. Gary Tilden stated, "The SyncPal has a target of 10,000 studios in the USA alone. These studios have embedded audio/video sync problems once in a while, and our SyncPal is a solution. The potential revenue is approximately $30M, and to date we see little competition. More important is that we already have positive relationships with these studios, and they will be responsive to our cost effective solution to improve the quality of their program." 
Everett Jolly with Uptick Newswire had asked Mr. Tilden why the stock was so undervalued. Mr. Tilden replied, "With our experienced management and leadership, we will launch these products in 2017, and in turn, it will enhance 15 of our older products because we will allow them to be updated with UHD digital technology and internet access via an immersive application. In the past nine months ending December-2016, we have secured $5,000,000 in funding to complete and bring to market our newest products, while decreasing our total liabilities by $5.4M; all while keeping our shareholders informed along the way. We have reduced total operating expenditures by over $1M. We have strong tangible assets, and this will drive us into the New York Stock Exchange in the next 24 months."
Towards the end of the podcast Interview, Mr. Everett Jolly asked the CEO if this proprietary technology would be an acquisition play with a larger company. Mr. Tilden stated the following: "It will be up to our shareholders to decide to allow a larger company to acquire Simlatus, but it's always a nice decision to have on your plate. Our IBS system will have a commercial application, and a consumer application. If we are going to go through the expense in developing this product for commercial users, we want to allow consumers access to an app that will allow them to build their own studio and provide their own private programming using their smart-phone camera and video recording. It will be fun, and Simlatus anticipates a $1B revenue stream through this product."
ABOUT SIMLATUS: www.simlatus.com

 Virtual and Augmented Reality Will Reshape Your World


The Augmented and Virtual Reality industry is extremely lucrative with a very high potential offering many platforms, applications that are still unexplored. In order to be ahead of the curve, the companies in this industry invest on deploying the R&D team that is dedicated on both business and technical innovations.
Initial market research and strategy will be directed to AV Integrators and 2 Step Distributors












By 2020, an estimated 50 Billion objects will be connected to the internet


The Census Bureau predicts there will be 7.6 Billion people alive


That means for every person, 6.6 objects will be connected to the internet


We are in a world that’s constantly changing all around us


It is impossible to prognosticate just how large the nascent AR/VR market could become because of the countless potential applications.


VR and AR are emerging technologies – but investment in the sector is hot, with AR and VR startups raising $658 million in equity financing last year.






Hot Off The Press:  SIML will launch SyncPal™ in 2017 with a potential target of $30M in sales, while commencing design of new products in the dynamic Augmented/Virtual Reality (AVR) markets


What is SyncPal?



SIML has designed and is ready to manufacture SyncPal while prepping for 2017 delivery.
SIML’s product is a result of a phenomenon that can occur in television broadcasting called “out of lip-sync.” This happens when the sound of the announcer’s voice reaches your ears before the movement of his lips reaches your eyes. This can be corrected by adjusting the delay of the sound until the voice and lip movement are “in sync.”
In High-Definition broadcasting, a majority of times the audio signal is embedded (or buried) into the video signal for transmission between the originating source and the TV station. Multiple signal processing of the video portion of the combined signals can cause this video delay.
SIML’s SyncPal has been specifically designed to allow the broadcaster to make this video-to-audio adjustment.

“The Board has continued to develop the Group’s strategy with its focus on our core Broadcast and Augmented/Virtual Reality markets particularly given the context of the fast pace of change in technology and market needs. In April 2016 we announced an addition to our existing 55 products, the intent to add the new SyncPal™ to our major shareholders showcasing our key brands and growth strategy through: allocating resources to the fast growing broadcast markets and a focus on sharing opportunities; increasing resources, brand presence and sales with support from the National Association of Broadcasting (NAB); and continuing to make strategic changes which make financial sense.”
~Chairman Robert Stillwaugh


Here is the best part – SIML can sell SyncPal directly to their own Customers


SIML estimates there are over 10,000 TV Broadcast Stations in the USA alone, according to the FCC’s 2013 census.
SIML’s SyncPal is priced to move at a cost of $3,299.
SIML has more than 50 proprietary products that they own and manufacture, which are sold through a distribution network, and accessible from their website www.simlatus.com









SIML is targeting 30% of their major customers who already own some of their products, such as CBS, NBC, ABC, FOX, ESPN and DirecTV.

The interview can be downloaded at https://upticknewswire.com/ceo-gary-tilden-talks-long-term-value-of-simlatus-corpSimlatus Corporation designs, manufactures and sells commercial audio and video broadcast equipment worldwide, and has prestigious customers such as CBS, NBC, ABC, FOX, ESPN and DIRECTV. Our customers are asking for a product that they can operate from their smart-phone, and one that offers them the ability for quality control during a live broadcast feed. Keep in mind that we have some of the most talented engineers and immersive technology experts as part of our design team.Simlatus went public to raise capital for our newer products, the SyncPal and the Immersive Broadcast System. Our company has experienced a technology shift in the past 3 years, and our customers are still using our products that have been sold to them over the past 18 years. Although the industry is growing both economically and demographically, our value is in the strong customer relations we have established.We currently sell 55 commercial products that are purchased in small quantities by all of our customers, and we need to maintain the old product line as our responsibility to them so they can support their public broadcast needs.SyncPal provides the studio the means to correct any audio or video sync problems via a smart-phone. The technology is very complicated, and we made it simple, fast and convenient for the studio to correct the movement of the person's mouth with the sound so they are in sync. In short, our product corrects a problem worldwide that occurs every day in the public broadcast industry.In previous interviews I mentioned that all great companies have experienced hurdles in their lifetime. They are all successful today because they have great products that their customers want. Our customers want the SyncPal, and SyncPal is the first generation of immersive commercial products we will begin to sell. Our SyncPal will be ready for manufacturing next month, and our new marketing team is already establishing pre-orders. As crazy as it sounds, there are 10,000 studios that need the product. Many of the studios have multiple locations. We hope to hit a $30M revenue stream, while our goal is to move the public company to the New York Stock Exchange."For more information visit: http://simlatus.com/product/syncpal/ABOUT SIMLATUS: www.simlatus.comSimlatus Corporation designs, manufactures and sells commercial audio and video broadcast equipment worldwide.
