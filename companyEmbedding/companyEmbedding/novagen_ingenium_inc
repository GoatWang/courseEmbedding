Description



        		Overview
				
				

        Coexpression of multiple target genes in E. coli is advantageous for studying protein complexes. Coexpression often achieves optimal yield, solubility, and activity and may protect individual subunits from degradation. The Duet vectors are T7 promoter expression vectors, each designed to coexpress two target proteins in E. coli. The Duet vectorscarry compatible replicons and antibiotic resistance markers and may be used together in appropriate host strains to coexpress up to eight proteins. Certain combinations of Duet vectors and pET or pETcoco™ vectors are also compatible for coexpression. The capability of Duet vectors to be cotransformed, propagated, and induced for robust target proteincoexpression makes them ideal for the analysis of protein complexes. The Duet vectors are designed with compatible replicons and drug resistance genes for effective propagation and maintenance of four plasmids in a single cell.    pETDuet-1 is designed for the coexpression of two target genes. The vector encodes two multiple cloning sites (MCS), each of which is preceded by a T7 promoter, lac operator and ribosome binding site (rbs). The vector also carries the pBR322-derived  ColE1 replicon, lacI gene and ampicillin resistance gene. This vector can be transformed into the same cell with pACYCDuet™-1, pCDFDuet™-1, and pRSFDuet™-1 or pCOLADuet™-1 in the appropriate host strain for the coexpression of up to eight target genes. Genes inserted into MCS-1 can be sequenced using the pETUpstream Primer and DuetDOWN1 Primer. Genes inserted into MCS-2 can be sequenced using the DuetUP2 Primer and T7 Terminator Primer.  Commercial use of this Product requires a commercial license from EMD Millipore Corporation.  Commercial use shall include but not be limited to (1) use of the Product or its components in manufacturing; (2) use of the Product or its components to provide a service, information, or data to others in exchange for consideration; (3) use of the Product or its components (or any derivatives thereof) for therapeutic, diagnostic or prophylactic purposes (including as part of a device, chip, assay or other product); or (4) resale of the Product or its components, whether or not such Product or its components are resold for use in research.  Nothing contained herein shall be deemed to represent or warrant that additional third party rights are not required for use of this Product.

(OTC-Markets: NOVZ) today announces the closing of the Sale and Purchase Agreement to acquire Syndicated Transport and Trucking Pty Ltd (Syndicated Transport) on 6 July 2017.     Syndicated Transport is an Australian transport operator that supplies transport and warehousing services to the building industry utilizing 12 vehicles, 4 warehouses and a staff of 18. Syndicated Transport's primary brand, K Bees Transport is aggressively expanding operations and services and has recently opened a new warehouse in Lismore, NSW. One of K Bees ' most popular services is a "first to building site" early morning pallet delivery service. Products are loaded after orders are received overnight and in the early morning hours, then building products are delivered as trade workers arrive at building sites ready for work. The service continues all day as builder's product needs change. "This a milestone achievement for Novagen as the company builds out the transport and trucking division ," said Micheal Nugent, CEO. "While our core focus is the development of the AmerYcan™ Engine in the precision engineering division, our transport and trucking division is poised to be a strong profit center. Further, we currently have 4 pending contracts for the acquisition of targeted trucking operations to join the Syndicated Transport portfolio. It is our intention to set the base transport and trucking operations and then revisit the Letter of Intent signed with Wadleys Interstate Transport Pty Ltd in May of 2015.

Description



        		Overview
				
				

        Coexpression of multiple target genes in E. coli is advantageous for studying protein complexes. Coexpression often achieves optimal yield, solubility, and activity and may protect individual subunits from degradation. The Duet vectors are T7 promoter expression vectors, each designed to coexpress two target proteins in E. coli. The Duet vectorscarry compatible replicons and antibiotic resistance markers and may be used together in appropriate host strains to coexpress up to eight proteins. Certain combinations of Duet vectors and pET or pETcoco™ vectors are also compatible for coexpression. The capability of Duet vectors to be cotransformed, propagated, and induced for robust target proteincoexpression makes them ideal for the analysis of protein complexes. The Duet vectors are designed with compatible replicons and drug resistance genes for effective propagation and maintenance of four plasmids in a single cell.    pETDuet-1 is designed for the coexpression of two target genes. The vector encodes two multiple cloning sites (MCS), each of which is preceded by a T7 promoter, lac operator and ribosome binding site (rbs). The vector also carries the pBR322-derived  ColE1 replicon, lacI gene and ampicillin resistance gene. This vector can be transformed into the same cell with pACYCDuet™-1, pCDFDuet™-1, and pRSFDuet™-1 or pCOLADuet™-1 in the appropriate host strain for the coexpression of up to eight target genes. Genes inserted into MCS-1 can be sequenced using the pETUpstream Primer and DuetDOWN1 Primer. Genes inserted into MCS-2 can be sequenced using the DuetUP2 Primer and T7 Terminator Primer.  Commercial use of this Product requires a commercial license from EMD Millipore Corporation.  Commercial use shall include but not be limited to (1) use of the Product or its components in manufacturing; (2) use of the Product or its components to provide a service, information, or data to others in exchange for consideration; (3) use of the Product or its components (or any derivatives thereof) for therapeutic, diagnostic or prophylactic purposes (including as part of a device, chip, assay or other product); or (4) resale of the Product or its components, whether or not such Product or its components are resold for use in research.  Nothing contained herein shall be deemed to represent or warrant that additional third party rights are not required for use of this Product.
