When an agreement is made without adjudication during an impending lawsuit, a settlement agreement lays out the terms of agreement between the parties. The parties (''Plaintiff'') and (''Defendant'') will come to an agreement on how they will cease the actions of the lawsuit.Settlement agreements enable opposing parties to bypass a lengthy court process by agreeing to specific terms and conditions which may include relief to plaintiff, method of payment (if any), attorney fees and other incurred costs.These agreements almost always contain confidentiality agreements, wherein the plaintiff of the lawsuit agrees to not disclose any details concerning the nature of the settlement to the press or other individuals.  A settlement agreement may be used in a divorce case or civil lawsuit.

he may immediately commence to serve as a director of the Company,
with a term of appointment lasting through the date of the 2013
Annual Meeting.  Immediately upon Mr. Schneider
commencing his service as a director of the Company, the Company
will take all steps necessary to appoint Mr. Schneider for the
entirety of his term as a member of both (i) the Board's Nominating
and Corporate Governance Committee and Compensation Committee, and
(ii) the boards of directors of each of the Bank and
Diversified.

 

(d)           The
Company, Mr. Schneider and all members of the Stilwell Group
(including Joseph Stilwell in his individual capacity) shall enter
into a Non-Disclosure Agreement, substantially in the form attached
as Exhibit A hereto, which shall remain in force through
Mr. Schneider's tenure on the Board.

 





1.2  



Nomination
of Mr. Schneider as a Director Candidate for


the 2013
Annual Meeting






 








(a)           The
Company agrees that, consistent with the customary timing of its
annual meetings, the 2013 Annual Meeting will not be held prior to
May 1, 2013.  The Company and its Board shall nominate
and support Mr. Schneider for election as a director at the 2013
Annual Meeting for a three (3) year term, including but not limited
to preparing, filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission
and disseminating to the Company's shareholders proxy soliciting
materials in substantially the same form and using substantially
the same solicitation efforts in support of Mr. Schneider's
candidacy as the Company uses for its other director candidates to
be nominated at the 2013 Annual Meeting.  The Company's
proxy holders shall vote in favor of Mr. Schneider's election all
proxies received in response to these solicitation efforts that
direct the proxy holders to cast votes in favor of Mr. Schneider's
election as a director at the 2013 Annual Meeting.

 

(b)           The
Company and Board shall also appoint Mr. Schneider, upon his
election and for the entirety of his three-year elected term as a
Board director, as a member of (i) the Board's Nominating and
Corporate Governance Committee and Compensation Committee and (ii)
the boards of the Bank and Diversified; moreover, in the event that
Mr. Schneider dies or becomes incapacitated or is unable or
unwilling to serve as a director (or ceases to represent the
Stilwell Group as an attorney) during the period of time he is to
serve as a director under Sections 1.1 and 1.2 hereof, the Company
and the Stilwell Group shall take all reasonable actions to
immediately replace Mr. Schneider for the periods he would have
served on the Board under Sections 1.1 and 1.2 with another
individual designated by the Stilwell Group and approved by the
Company, which approval shall only be withheld in good faith,
subject to such regulatory approvals as may be required at that
time.

Victor
Karpiak






 

Mr. Karpiak agrees to resign as Chairman of the
Board immediately after Mr. Schneider joins the
Board.  Following his resignation as Chairman, Mr.
Karpiak will remain a member of the Board until September 1, 2013,
at which time Mr. Karpiak shall resign as a member of the Board and
thereupon cease all service on the Board.  No later than
the Annual Meeting of Shareholders of the Company in 2014, Mr.
Karpiak shall resign as a member of the Bank and Diversified
boards, and shall thereafter cease all service on the Bank and
Diversified boards.  To the extent the Transition
Agreement is inconsistent with this Agreement, the Transition
Agreement will be amended to make the two agreements
consistent.  Except as set forth in this Section 1.3, all
terms of the Transition Agreement shall remain in full force and
effect and may not be altered except as set forth in the Transition
Agreement.

 

1.4           
Stilwell Group
 
Provided that the Effective Date occurs and the
Company complies with its obligations under Section 1.2 of this
Agreement to nominate Mr. Schneider and support Mr. Schneider's
nomination at the 2013 Annual Meeting and that he is elected as a
director, the Stilwell Group and Mr. Schneider agree and covenant
that in connection with the 2013, 2014 and 2015 Annual Meetings of
the Company they shall not:

 







(a)     
  




provide a
notice to the Company that they intend to nominate, or nominate,
any person for election as director; or






 







(b)     
  




directly or
indirectly solicit proxies or participate in the solicitation of
proxies for any person to be elected to the Board that has not been
nominated by the Company's Board; or






 







(c)     
  




join with or
assist any person or entity, directly or indirectly, in opposing,
or make any statement in opposition to, any director nomination
submitted by the Company's Board to a vote of the Company's
shareholders.






 

The Stilwell
Group and each of its members, and Mr. Schneider, further agree and
covenant that at the 2013, 2014 and 2015 Annual Meetings of the
Company, they will vote all Common Stock that they own, either as
registered shareholders or beneficially, in support of director
candidates nominated by the Company.

 

Nothing in this Section 1.4 shall in any way
prevent the Stilwell Group from soliciting proxies or consents, or
participating in any such solicitations, with respect to any matter
other than the election of directors at the 2013, 2014 and 2015
Annual Meetings, or restrict the Stilwell Group's ability to vote
its shares, either in person or by proxy, on any matters other than
the election of directors at the 2013, 2014 and 2015 Annual
Meetings.

ARTICLE 2 — RESOLUTION OF
LITIGATION
 






2.1



Joint
Motions for Stay and Dismissal and for Dismissal with Prejudice of
Mr. Riley






 

(a)           No
later than three court days following the execution of this
Agreement by all parties, counsel for the parties shall cause to be
filed in the Litigation a joint motion to stay the Litigation, and
all proceedings or deadlines therein, until the Effective Date
(defined in Article 5 below) has or has not
occurred.  The parties further agree that during the
pendency of the stay they will not take any other action that would
be barred if the releases set forth in Article 4 had already been
in effect.

 

(b)           Immediately
upon occurrence of the Effective Date, the parties shall file a
stipulated joint dismissal with prejudice of the Litigation, in the
form attached hereto as Exhibit B.

 

(c)           The
joint motion to stay referred to in this Section 2.1 shall not
apply to the claims against defendant Raymond J.
Riley.  Subject to the Court's approval, all claims
against Mr. Riley shall be dismissed with prejudice pursuant to a
Stipulation and Order for Dismissal of Defendant Raymond J. Riley
With Prejudice ("Riley Stipulation") that counsel for the parties
shall file at the same time that they file the joint motion to stay
the Litigation.  The Riley Stipulation shall be in the
form set forth in Exhibit C.  The Company and Mr. Karpiak
shall not assert in the Litigation that the dismissal of
Mr. Riley pursuant to the Riley Stipulation in any way has any
effect on either the claims against them or the relief available
against them in the Litigation.

 

  2.2         
Demand Withdrawal

 

Upon the execution of this Agreement by all
parties, the Stilwell Group shall be deemed to have consented to
the Board staying its consideration of the Demand until after the
Effective Date has or has not occurred.  Upon the
Effective Date, the Demand shall be deemed withdrawn and of no
further force or effect.  If the Effective Date does not
occur, then the Board shall treat the Demand as if the time for
responding to it was tolled during the stay of the
Litigation.  Under no circumstances shall the Stilwell
Group or Mr. Schneider contend that the Board should have acted on
the Demand during the stay of the Litigation.

 


ARTICLE 3 —
PAYMENT
3.1         
Proxy expense reimbursement
 
No later than five business days after the
Effective Date, the Stilwell Group

expenses that it incurred up through and including May 24, 2012 in
connection with the 2012 Annual Meeting and the 2012 contest for
election of directors and that it either has paid or is obligated
to pay (that is, if any incurred expenses have been forgiven, then
they do not qualify for reimbursement); and (ii) identify in
writing an entity to which the Company shall make a payment in
partial reimbursement of such documented expenses (together, the
"Reimbursement Expense Information").  Reimbursement
Expense Information shall be

be used for any purpose other than the reimbursement of proxy
expenses pursuant to this Section 3.1.  Nothing herein

showing that said expenses were reasonable or
necessary.  No later than 10 (ten) business days
following the later of the Effective Date or receipt of the
Reimbursement Expense Information, the Company shall pay or cause
to be paid to the entity identified by the Stilwell Group all
expenses documented in the Reimbursement Expense Information up to
the amount of two hundred thousand dollars ($200,000.00) (the
"Reimbursement Payment").  The Reimbursement Payment
shall be made in a manner (check or wire transfer) to be agreed by
the Company and the Stilwell Group.

Effect of

The releasing persons acknowledge that they may

4.1 and 4.2 of this Agreement shall extend to claims that the
releasing persons do not know or suspect to exist in their favor at

that are similar, comparable or equivalent to California Civil Code
Section 1542, which provides:
 




 


A general
release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know
or suspect to exist in his or her favor at the time of executing
the release, which if known by him or her must have materially
affected his or her settlement with the debtor.
