Welcome to International Tower Hill Mines




International  Tower Hill Mines Ltd. (TSX: ITH; NYSE MKT: THM) is an advanced exploration  stage company focused on the development of its 100% interest in the Livengood  Gold Project located 70 miles northwest of Fairbanks, Alaska.
The  Company on September 8, 2016 announced the results of a Pre-Feasibility Study  (the “PFS”) on an optimized configuration for its Livengood Gold Project (the  “Project”) located near Fairbanks, Alaska.   The engineering optimization studies incorporated in the PFS evaluated  several scenarios, ultimately selecting a project that will process 52,600 tons  per day and produce 6.8 million ounces of gold over 23 years.  This improved configuration has reduced the  capital costs (“CAPEX”) by 34% or $950 million to $1.84 billion and the process  operating cost (“process OPEX”) by 28% or $2.97 per ton to $7.48 per ton.  All-in sustaining costs (AISC) are $976 per  ounce  and All-in Costs (AIC) are $1,247  per ounce.  All as compared to the  100,000 tons per day project evaluated in the September 2013 Feasibility  Study.  All dollar figures are stated in  US Dollars.   
Pre-Feasibility Study Overview 
  The Project configuration evaluated in the PFS remains a conventional,  owner-operated surface mine that will utilize large-scale mining equipment in a  blast/load/haul operation.  Mill feed would be processed in a 52,600 tons  per day comminution circuit consisting of primary and secondary crushing, wet  grinding in a single semi-autogenous (SAG) mill and single ball mill followed by  a gravity gold circuit and a conventional carbon in leach (CIL) circuit.

Economic Impact

Mining Industry Economic Impact:  Growing  Force in Alaska’s Economy
McDowell Group "Economic Impact of Alaska's Mining  Industry" - January 2017 for the Alaska Miners Association 
Mining  is a growing force in Alaska’s economy, providing jobs for thousands of  Alaskans and millions of dollars of personal income throughout Alaska. Alaska’s  mining industry includes exploration, mine development, and mineral production. Alaska’s mines produce  coal, gold, lead, silver, zinc, as well as construction materials, such as  sand, gravel, and rock.
In  2016, Alaska’s mining industry provided:

4,350 direct mining jobs in Alaska.
8,600 total direct and indirect jobs attributed to Alaska mining industry.
$675 million in total direct and indirect payroll.
$111 million in payments to Alaska Native corporations.
$81 million in state government-related revenues through rents, royalties, fees, and taxes.
Mostly year-round jobs for residents of more than 50 communities throughout Alaska, half of which are found in rural Alaska where few other jobs are available.
Some of Alaska’s highest paying jobs with an estimated average annual wage of $108,000, over twice the state average for all sectors of the economy.
$23 million in local government revenue through property taxes and payments in lieu of taxes.

Each  year AMA commissions the McDowell Group to research the economic impact of  Mining in Alaska. Continued investments by the mining industry ensure Alaska’s  continued economic growth. http://alaskaminers.org/economic-impact/ 
Livengood Gold Project - Positive  Economic Impacts

The Livengood Gold Project is an economic opportunity for interior Alaska through local jobs, contracts and purchasing. Based on the Company's October 2016 Pre- Feasibility Study, the long life mine is estimated to create:
+800 direct construction jobs for 2 years
+350 direct operational jobs for 23 years
$1.8 Billion Construction Capital -  2.7 Billion Capital over life of Project
Taxes and Royalties paid to the State of Alaska and the State Mental health Trust that will support needed services for Alaskans
Significant local contracting and purchasing opportunities
Investments in education, training and community non-profit organizations
Mining industry jobs typically are stable year round and include benefit plans, such as, health, life, retirement, etc., which add to the overall economic impact as well as the desirability of employment in that sector.

	Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements





	This press release contains forward-looking statements and
	forward-looking information (collectively, forward-looking statements) within
	the meaning of applicable Canadian and US securities legislation.



	All statements, other than statements of historical fact, included
	herein including, without limitation, statements regarding the anticipated
	content, commencement and cost of exploration programs, anticipated exploration
	program results, the discovery and delineation of mineral
	deposits/resources/reserves, the potential for the expansion of the estimated
	resources at Livengood, the potential for a production decision to be made in
	respect of the Livengood Project, the potential for any production at the
	Livengood project, business and financing plans and business trends, are
	forward-looking statements. Although the Company believes that such statements
	are reasonable, it can give no assurance that such expectations will prove to be
	correct. Forward-looking statements are typically identified by words such as:
	believe, expect, anticipate, intend, estimate, postulate and similar
	expressions, or are those, which, by their nature, refer to future events. The

P/E Ratio (TTM) The Price to Earnings (P/E) ratio, a key valuation measure, is calculated by dividing the stock's most recent closing price by the sum of the diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the trailing 12 month period.  Earnings Per Share (TTM) A company's net income for the trailing twelve month period expressed as a dollar amount per fully diluted shares outstanding. Market Capitalization Reflects the total market value of a company. Market Cap is calculated by multiplying the number of shares outstanding by the stock's price. For companies with multiple common share classes, market capitalization includes both classes. Shares Outstanding Number of shares that are currently held by investors, including restricted shares owned by the company's officers and insiders as well as those held by the public. Public Float The number of shares in the hands of public investors and available to trade. To calculate, start with total shares outstanding and subtract the number of restricted shares. Restricted stock typically is that issued to company insiders with limits on when it may be traded. Dividend Yield A company's dividend expressed as a percentage of its current stock price.

Money Flow Uptick/Downtick Ratio Money flow measures the relative buying and selling pressure on a stock, based on the value of trades made on an "uptick" in price and the value of trades made on a "downtick" in price. The up/down ratio is calculated by dividing the value of uptick trades by the value of downtick trades. Net money flow is the value of uptick trades minus the value of downtick trades. Our calculations are based on comprehensive, delayed quotes.      Stock Money Flow    Uptick/Downtick Trade Ratio  0 4    3.86      Net Money Flow ($)  12,644    Money flow gives a snapshot of relative buying and selling pressure in a stock.

Welcome to International Tower Hill Mines




International  Tower Hill Mines Ltd. (TSX: ITH; NYSE MKT: THM) is an advanced exploration  stage company focused on the development of its 100% interest in the Livengood  Gold Project located 70 miles northwest of Fairbanks, Alaska.
The  Company on September 8, 2016 announced the results of a Pre-Feasibility Study  (the “PFS”) on an optimized configuration for its Livengood Gold Project (the  “Project”) located near Fairbanks, Alaska.   The engineering optimization studies incorporated in the PFS evaluated  several scenarios, ultimately selecting a project that will process 52,600 tons  per day and produce 6.8 million ounces of gold over 23 years.  This improved configuration has reduced the  capital costs (“CAPEX”) by 34% or $950 million to $1.84 billion and the process  operating cost (“process OPEX”) by 28% or $2.97 per ton to $7.48 per ton.  All-in sustaining costs (AISC) are $976 per  ounce  and All-in Costs (AIC) are $1,247  per ounce.  All as compared to the  100,000 tons per day project evaluated in the September 2013 Feasibility  Study.  All dollar figures are stated in  US Dollars.   
Pre-Feasibility Study Overview 
  The Project configuration evaluated in the PFS remains a conventional,  owner-operated surface mine that will utilize large-scale mining equipment in a  blast/load/haul operation.  Mill feed would be processed in a 52,600 tons  per day comminution circuit consisting of primary and secondary crushing, wet  grinding in a single semi-autogenous (SAG) mill and single ball mill followed by  a gravity gold circuit and a conventional carbon in leach (CIL) circuit.
