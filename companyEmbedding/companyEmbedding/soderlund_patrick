release all sorts of games for every platform, so we’ll go wherever the 
gamers go. I think Nintendo Switch will put Nintendo at the forefront of
 the game industry once again. Their approach is quite different from 
anything they’ve done in the past – they’ve listened to EA, Activision, 
and other companies since the beginning of the Switch’s development, so 
we’ve been involved throughout the whole process. They teamed up with us
 because they wanted to guarantee the console would be successful. Doing
 business with Nintendo is very important for us… We’d like to bring 
more and more games over for everyone.” said EA’s Executive vice president Patrick Soderlund

youtubeA Remastered Mass Effect Trilogy Could Soon Be In Development A remastered Mass Effect Trilogy could soon be a reality! In contrast to their past views, Patrick Soderlund, the vice president of EA revealed in a recent Game Informer interview that the company is actively looking into creating remastered versions of their games. The high demand from fans and the first installment’s success as an Xbox One backwards compatible title could lead to a remastering of the Mass Effect trilogy. Here’s all the info!Find me on YouTube:https://www.youtube.com/c/biofanofficialFollow for more Mass Effect coverage:http://biofanblog.tumblr.com/

anonymous asked:I understand your positive view of DLC and the for-profit models. It would be insane to argue that the people who make the games we love don't deserve to be paid for making them. I'm interested to have you go deeper into the financials of DLC/IAP/freemium content when, as an outsider, it seems like it doesn't add up. When I read things like Clash of Clans makes $5mil a day or CoD setting another record, I want to feel the billion dollars is being reinvested into the game and not 30 Ferraris.The first thing to note is that the sales figures are always, always divided up into chunks. There are always people who are standing by to take their cut from the revenue, and there are a lot of other costs associated with the game that need to be paid for up front. One thing is for sure - DLC is designed to be much more efficient than any initial development, which is why it’s so lucrative and publishers are pushing harder on it. Let’s take FIFA as an example, since I’m actually more familiar with AAA development than the social/mobile arena. EA makes a lot of money from FIFA’s Ultimate Team mode/minigame - to the tune of approximately $200 million in revenue for FIFA 2013. That’s a lot of packs being bought! So let’s begin breaking this down.25-30% of every sale goes to Microsoft, Nintendo, Apple, Google, and/or even a different division of EAThis includes all money via retail, digital copies, and so on. Even for PC titles, if it’s distributed in some way (like EA does with Origin), that money has to be counted as Origin’s revenue, as a cost to FIFA. This sort of accounting is necessary in order to track Origin’s overall continued performance and its justify its continued existence. FIFA’s developers don’t get any of this cut, despite EA being the ultimate owner of both products. Remember, EA’s executives need to allocate and approve budgets for studios and projects, so it’s important that they can calculate (roughly) what the monetary value of the service or product is.In exchange for the 25-30% of each sale (plus some flat fee for “free” things), the developers are given a few things in return. The platform provides curation, online distribution, and handling of all financial transactions to a regular and engaged playerbase that numbers in the millions. You, as a player, also get the benefit of the certification process - any DLC you obtain will be guaranteed to work with your hardware to a minimum level of competence.Some undisclosed percentage is paid to FIFA (the organization) for the licenseI believe the number is around 15-20%, though I am not certain. DLC revenue is NOT considered separate from the original product for accountingThis includes things like development costs and marketing costs when it comes to accounting. Everything is calculated in terms of the original project’s Profits and Losses, which makes some amount of sense - the systems, tools, and skills/training developed for the game are used for the continued development of the DLC, and so the revenue from the DLC should also be considered to help offset that initial cost. A significant chunk of the revenue goes to pay for the development and marketing costs. You might not realize this, but marketing costs a lot. Some games, like Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2, actually spent four times ($200 million) as much on marketing as they did on the actual game’s development ($50 million). Most of the time you’re looking at about a 1:1 ratio of dev costs to marketing, with development costs on a AAA game usually in the $60 million ballpark.So what do they spend whatever’s left over on?The main thing you’re looking at is different labels, since they earn profits and losses individually. This means that revenue is distributed on a label-by-label basis. FIFA is part of the “EA Studios” label, which is actually headed up by Patrick Soderlund, and that includes all of Bioware, EA Sports, DICE, Visceral, and so on. The revenues earned by FIFA 2013 Ultimate Team went to pay for the continued development of games that are in development by that label, like the new Mirror’s Edge game, Bioware’s new IP, Star Wars Battlefront 3, and a bunch of other unannounced games and/or canceled games (e.g. Dawngate, Shadow Realms). But that isn’t all it went to pay for. It also gets paid out as bonuses for the employees (the team, the leadership, and so on), and stock buybacks to share those profits with the shareholders, as well as reinvesting in themselves. In good years, we get more games green lit and funded, as well as better bonuses for employees and profit sharing for shareholders. In lean years, even big revenues from a few projects are barely enough to cover the development costs of the scant projects still in development. Remember, most games take at least two to three years to come out, and many are killed before even being announced.So let’s recap: ~40-50% of that $200 million revenue is cut from the take immediately, going to Sony, Microsoft, Origin, FIFA, and so on. ~30-50% of what’s left gets taken to pay back marketing and development costs. What remains is profit, which is used for:Paying out bonuses to employeesPaying out dividends or profits to shareholdersFunding projects/games (announced and unannounced) that are in various stages of developmentThis isn’t to say that some people don’t make enough to buy a bunch of ferraris. Usually this occurs at the executive level, since the executives tend to be the ones who get the largest portion of the compensation and rewards for making the decisions that affect the largest amount of the finances, and these sorts of bonuses and compensation can be in the millions. However, even if they were in the double digit millions on an annual basis, a publisher like EA, that’s a very small number. According to their Fiscal 2015 report, EA earned ~$4.3 billion in total revenue of which was $806 million in net income (revenue - cost). Part of that ($95M) went into a stock repurchase, some of it is going towards bonuses, and most of it will go to fund new projects.Further Reading:How do games make a profit?

EA Studios boss also had doubts about Battlefield 1 and trench warfare

Patrick Soderlund headlines





Could we ever see another Dead Space game? "Absolutely" says Soderlund

EA's Peter Moore grabs $3,453,140 in post-financials stock dump


				Peter Moore and Patrick Soderlund are among the top executives at EA who have sold their stake at the firm, according to Securities & Exchange forms filed during the past week following the earnings call of Q4 FY2014.			








Battlefield 4 launch instability will be learned from, vows EA

Battlefield's cloud servers could allow for real-time weather effects


				Battlefield 4 has a lot of dynamic weather effect, but what about real-time weather based on the skies above your location? It’s entirely possible, DICE CEO Patrick Soderlund has suggested.			








PS4 & Xbox One generation to last 5-6 years, says EA's Soderlund


				PlayStation 4 is out tomorrow across the UK and Europe, hot on the heels of Xbox One. It’s a crazy time, but EA’s executive vice-president of EA Studios Patrick Soderlund reckons that we’ll be doing the next-gen dance all over again by 2018-19. He feels it’ll be a shorter cycle.			








EA aiming to be "remembered and respected for the games" it makes


				EA Studios executive vice president Patrick Söderlund wants the publisher to be remembered for its games – and not for being voted the worst company in America for two years running, for example.			








EA isn't giving up until Battlefield "is number one," says Soderlund


				Patrick Soderlund, EVP of EA’s games label, has said the firm isn’t going to give up until Battlefield bests Call of Duty as the number one shooter.			








EA takes risks, has 6-8 new IP in the works, claims Soderlund


				EA Games head Patrick Soderlund has stated that the company has between six and eight new IP in the works, following claims that it’s not making enough original titles.			








Frostbite Go engine to make "real" games possible in the mobile sector, says EA


				Frostbite Go will debut in DICE’s Commander Mode in Battlefield 4 later this year, but EA Games Label EVP Patrick Soderlund has teased bigger plans to disrupt the mobile sector with the tech down the line.			








EA wants its development teams to implement second screen gaming in all projects going forward 


				Second screen gaming is becoming more important to EA as the way media is consumed changes, and if games label head Patrick Soderlund has any say, he’s going to make sure his development teams implement it as “a meaningful extension” to games.			








Mirror's Edge reboot wouldn't have been possible on current platforms, says Söderlund


				Mirror’s Edge is a “true next-gen idea” which would not have been possible on current platforms, according to EA Games vice president Patrick Söderlund, who said bringing it to next-gen “felt right.”			








Mirror's Edge reboot announce took so long due to working out "stunning" next-gen concept


				Mirror’s Edge got a reboot announcement at E3 last month after years of fans asking what DICE was planning to do with the IP. EA Game’s executive vice president Patrick Söderlund has shed new light on the matter in an interview.			








Battlefield 4: DICE bringing signature multiplayer elements to campaign


				Battlefield 4 developer DICE is looking to address the disparity between the series’ campaign and multiplayer modes, by bringing key elements of online play into the single-player component. The studio has shed light on what this means in a new interview.			








Star Wars: Battlefront and DICE is "match made in heaven", says Soderlund


				Star Wars: Battlefront is being revived by DICE and the pairing has made a lot of people happy, especially EA’s Patrick Söderlund, who has shed light on how the Battlefield studio came to work on one of the most regularly requested returns to gaming in years.			








Visceral "working on something very exciting," Dead Space franchise "isn't cancelled"


				EA games label EVP Patrick Söderlund has said the Dead Space franchise hasn’t be cancelled, as a March report stated, but then again Visceral Games isn’t working on Dead Space 4 at the moment either.			








Star Wars: Battlefront is not Battlefront 3


				The DICE-developed Star Wars game isn’t a sequel to previous games in the series – it’s something new.			








Medal of Honor dev Danger Close "doesn't exist any more"


				Medal of Honor developer Danger Close has been disbanded, EA has confirmed, with DICE LA taking its place and serving a support role for the main Swedish studio.			








Titanfall PlayStation release possible, says dev, but execs demur


				Respawn Entertainment wants “to make everybody happy”, and hasn’t ruled out the possibility of bringing Titanfall to PlayStation platforms. EA, on the other hand, is diplomatically cagey on the subject.			








Battlefield 3 "looked a little bit too much" to Call of Duty


				Battlefield 3 was good, but it might have been better if DICE hadn’t been so conscious of Call of Duty, studio boss Patrick Soderlund has admitted
