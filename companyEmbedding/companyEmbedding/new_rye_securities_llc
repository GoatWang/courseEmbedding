What business type is right for you?
When you're starting a new business, you want to determine the business structure that's right for you. What's the difference between a limited liability company (LLC) and a corporation (Inc.)? And how is a C corporation different from an S corporation? Use these charts to help decide what business type is best for your needs.








LLC vs. Corporation






Limited Liability Company (LLC)Shields personal assets from business liabilityRequires separation of business and personal financesundefinedAllowable in all 50 states and the District of ColumbiaundefinedHighly flexible management structureundefinedFlexible tax reporting optionsundefinedPreferred by outside investorsundefinedPreferred for IPOundefinedRecognized outside of the United StatesStart my LLCCorporation (Inc)Shields personal assets from business liabilityRequires separation of business and personal financesundefinedAllowable in all 50 states and the District of ColumbiaundefinedHighly flexible management structureundefinedFlexible tax reporting optionsundefinedPreferred by outside investorsundefinedPreferred for IPOundefinedRecognized outside of the United StatesStart my Corporation







What is an S corporation?
After you create a corporation or LLC, you also have the opportunity to decide how you'd like your business to be taxed.Single owner LLCs can be taxed either as a sole proprietorship or a corporation.  LLCs with more than one owner can be taxed either as a partnership or a corporation.  Income from LLCs treated as sole proprietorships or partnerships is reported directly on the owner’s individual tax returns.New corporations, as well as LLCs considering corporate taxation can choose between filing taxes as a C corporation ("C corp") or an S corporation ("S corp"). An S corp is considered a "pass-through entity," which means the business itself isn't taxed. Instead, income is reported on the owners' personal tax returns. Businesses taxed as C corporations are not pass through entities.  Income is taxed at the corporate level, and, if dividends are distributed, at the individual level as well.We can help you understand your options so you choose what's best for your business. Talk to one of our network of attorneys today.








C-corp or S-corp 






Here's a comparison of some key characteristics of businesses that choose to be treated as C corps and S corps.C DesignationOwners pay personal income tax on profitsBusiness must pay corporate income taxundefinedAll business income/loss is passed through to owners each year.undefinedNo more than 100 shareholdersundefinedShareholders must be U.S. citizens or resident aliensS DesignationOwners pay personal income tax on profitsBusiness must pay corporate income taxundefinedAll business income/loss is passed through to owners each year.undefinedNo more than 100 shareholdersundefinedShareholders must be U.S. citizens or resident aliensYou don't have to decide about S corp status right away. You have 75 days after the formation of your business to file with the IRS. If you're still not sure what to do, you may want to consult with one of our attorneys or tax specialists.





Step-by-Step Guide on Starting Your Business













Easy as 1-2-3




1. Select the business structure that's right for you and fill out a simple questionnaire.





2. We'll assemble your documents and file them directly with your state.





3. You'll receive your completed paperwork by mail.








Ask away. We have answers.



Common questions

Can I start a business without creating a corporation or LLC?
You don't need a corporation or LLC to go into business. Many business owners are in partnerships or are sole proprietors. But both a corporation and LLC canshield you from liability and may offer tax advantages.


What are the main differences between an LLC and a sole proprietorship?
You don't need to file any paperwork with your state to create a sole proprietorship (though you may still need business permits and licenses to operate lawfully). But an LLC protects you from personal liability  - a sole proprietorship doesn't.Also, LLCs provide more flexibility as you grow your business.


What are the main differences between an LLC and an S corporation?
An LLC has more flexibility and fewer corporate formalities than an S corporation. S corporations are required to have annual meetings of shareholders and directors, while meetings of LLC member and/or managers are not required..  Also,  LLCs can provide for a flexible management structure by members or managers, while corporations require management by a Board of Directors.Learn more.


Do I need a name or DBA for my business?
You only need a DBA ("doing business as") if you are operating a sole proprietorship or partnership and you want to use a fictitious name for the business. You don't need a DBA for an LLC or a corporation unless you are using a name other than your LLC or corporate name while doing business.Learn more.


Do I need any other licenses or permits to start my business? 
Some cities, counties, and states require businesses to obtain licenses and permits to operate lawfully. We can help you figure out what you need. Learn More.

Compare Business Structures – LLC vs. Corporation, S Corporation and C Corporation 

		 You’ve decided to start a business, but you’re not sure where to begin. You don’t know if you should form an LLC or corporation, and need guidance to help you choose the right business structure. Each business structure has its advantages and disadvantages that are important to understand because choosing the wrong business entity could result in legal and tax implications down the road. The information above will allow you to compare LLC vs. corporation, and learn the difference between an S corporation and C corporation. LLCs and corporations both offer personal liability protection, but the most significant difference between LLC and corporation is that corporations are preferred by outside investors. When comparing LLC vs S corp, there are a few important differences to be aware of which are outlined above. Once you determine which business structure you need, you can start a business with LegalZoom in just three easy steps. The process begins by filling out a simple questionnaire. We’ll assemble your documents and file them directly with your state, and you’ll receive your completed paperwork by mail. If you need help deciding which business structure is right for you, a LegalZoom legal plan attorney can explain how each business entity works and help you decide.

In addition to certain guarantees provided by law, LegalZoom guarantees your satisfaction with our services and support. Because our company was created by experienced attorneys, we strive to be the best legal document service on the web. If you are not satisfied with our services, please contact us immediately and we will correct the situation, provide a refund or offer credit that can be used for future LegalZoom orders.
LegalZoom Satisfaction Guarantee Details:

If you're not satisfied, simply call us toll-free at (800) 773-0888 during our normal business hours. All requests made under this guarantee must be made within 60 days of purchase. We will process your request within 5 business days after we've received all of the documents and materials sent to you. Unfortunately, we can't refund or credit any money paid to government entities, such as filing fees or taxes, or to other third parties with a role in processing your order. We also cannot refund any money paid by you directly to third parties, such as payments made by you directly to attorneys affiliated with our legal plans or attorney-assisted products.
If you want to exchange the product you ordered for a different one, you must request this exchange and complete your replacement order within 60 days of purchase. The purchase price of the original item, less any money paid to government entities, such as filing fees or taxes, or to other third parties with a role in processing your order, will be credited to your LegalZoom account. Any payments made directly by you to attorneys affiliated with our legal plans or attorney-assisted products are not eligible for exchange or credit. Any price difference between the original order and the replacement order or, if a replacement order is not completed within 60 days of purchase, the full original purchase price (in each case less any money paid to government entities or other third parties) will be credited to the original form of payment. If you paid for your original order by check, LegalZoom will mail a check for the applicable amount to your billing address.
Please note that we cannot guarantee the results or outcome of your particular procedure. For instance, the government may reject a trademark application for legal reasons beyond the scope of LegalZoom's service. In some cases, a government backlog can lead to long delays before your process is complete. Similarly, LegalZoom does not guarantee the results or outcomes of the services rendered by our legal plan attorneys or attorney-assisted products. Problems like these are beyond our control and are not covered by this guarantee.
Since we're dedicating time and effort to your legal document preparation, our guarantee only covers satisfaction issues caused by LegalZoom - not changes to your situation or your state of mind.

Knowledge Center&rtrif;Limited Liability Company&rtrif;FAQ 









Limited Liability Company FAQ
Find FAQs related to starting an LLC.
















What is a limited liability company (LLC)?


    
A limited liability company, or LLC, is a business entity created under state laws which has the characteristics of both a corporation and a partnership. Like a corporation, the owners of an LLC are not personally liable for business debts. Like a sole proprietorship or partnership, an LLC has operating flexibility and is a pass-through entity for tax purposes. This means the LLC's profits are passed through and taxable to the owners of the LLC. 




 





What legal documents do I need to form an LLC?


    
To create an LLC, Articles of Organization must be filed with the Secretary of State or appropriate state agency. Next, the LLC members should enter into an operating agreement, which sets forth the rights of the members and the rules for running the company. An LLC may also need to apply for a tax identification number with the IRS. LegalZoom can prepare all of the required documents for you. 

  


 





Can my LLC have an unlimited lifespan?

Yes. Recent changes to the IRS code have promoted changes in state laws permitting LLCs to be created with an unlimited life.


 





What is the difference between a "member" and a "manager" of an LLC?


    
A member is an owner of the LLC and is similar to a stockholder of a corporation. A manager is a person chosen by the members to manage the LLC and is similar to a director of a corporation. A manager can also be a member. 
  


 





Does an LLC have to hold meetings?


    
The answer is usually no, unless the LLC's operating agreement requires meetings. LegalZoom's operating agreements make meetings optional. This is one of the key advantages of an LLC - fewer formalities. This means less paperwork and less chance that the members will accidentally violate the law and thereby lose their liability protection. 


  


 





How much will it cost to form and operate an LLC?

Each state charges an annual fee to maintain an LLC. In many states, you must also submit an annual report or statement of information, which is a one-page form sent by the state. Some states also have state taxes. The annual fees for three popular states—California, Nevada and Delaware—are as follows (prices shown are as of 2015):

California: A $20 reporting fee and a statement of information are required 90 days after formation and then every two years. An annual $800 LLC tax is due by the 15th day of the fourth month after LLC formation and every year thereafter. If the LLC's income exceeds $250,000, it will owe an additional LLC tax based on the income amount.


Nevada: A $150 fee and the Initial List of Managers or Managing Members, as well as a $200 fee and a Business Licence Application, are due within 30 days of formation. There is no state income tax.


Delaware: There is an annual LLC tax of $300 due each June 1st, beginning the year following formation. There is no state income tax.


New York: Every LLC must publish notice of its formation in two newspapers in the county in which it was created. In some areas, the fees for this publication can run up to $2,000. The company must then submit a certificate of this publication to the state, together with a $50 filing fee. For LLCs that choose to be treated as a partnership, there are annual taxes that are based on total income (from a minimum of $25 to a maximum of $4,500).


Every other state: Contact a local accountant.

 
LegalZoom can help you save time when you form an LLC. Answer a few questions in our online questionnaire, we’ll check your answers for consistency and completeness, and file the required documentation with your state. Once your LLC is formed, we send you a final package with all of your documents. We also can help you get in touch with independent attorneys to answer questions about your business.


 





What are the main differences between an LLC and an S corporation?


Although an S corporation shares many of the same tax characteristics as an LLC, an LLC has more flexibility and fewer restrictions than an S corporation. An S corporation cannot have more than 100 stockholders, cannot issue more than one class of shares, and is subject to more formalities than an LLC. However, owners of an LLC are required to pay Social Security and Medicare taxes on profits. Corporate stockholders are not required to pay these taxes on profits over and above the stockholders' salaries.



 





Do I need an attorney to form an LLC?


    
No, you do not need an attorney to form an LLC. You can prepare the legal paperwork and file it yourself, or use a professional business formation service, such as LegalZoom. If you choose to form your LLC through LegalZoom, you will only need to answer a few simple questions online.  We will take care of all of your paperwork, file the necessary documents with the state and even send you an LLC kit with seals and certificates. 



 





How many people are needed to form an LLC?


    
In all states, only one person is needed to form an LLC. Recent changes to the IRS code have promoted reforms in state laws, permitting one-member LLCs.

Expanding Investor Choice. Financing Private Businesses
New regulations permit open communications about private companies that are raising capital, replacing old laws that prohibited private companies from disclosing offerings to all but a select few.
New Rye Securities, LLC (member FINRA and SIPC) is dedicated to empowering accredited investors with a transparent process allowing all eligible investors to learn of formerly private offerings and empowering them to participate in the investments they choose. 
If you are with a company interested in raising capital with New Rye Securities
inquire here




About Us
New Rye Securities, LLC (member FINRA and SIPC) is a broker dealer dedicated to connecting accredited investors with companies seeking capital, using tools available under the recently implemented "general solicitation" provisions of the JOBS Act. New Rye's mission is to find investment-worthy opportunities and make them available to eligible investors. 
Prior to the JOBS Act, companies seeking capital were required to register their investment offerings or qualify for an exemption from registration. Since registration proved too costly for smaller companies, most sought a Regulation D exemption that allowed capital raising but prohibited general solicitation to investors, limiting outreach to companies’ prior contacts. As a result, most eligible investors remained unaware of these “private” opportunities. The JOBS Act created a new form of exemption under Regulation D that enables companies to alert all potential investors to their offerings, while restricting investment solely to verified accredited investors. As a result companies can now reach out to the 8.7 million accredited U.S. households and still qualify for registration exemption (using Rule 506(c) of Regulation D). 
New Rye’s marketing approach is two-fold: (1) capitalize on the new flexibility to create broad awareness of investment opportunities using the internet, social media, and other available communication tools, and (2) in parallel, use traditional outreach to our contacts to find investors. 
In addition to its activities in private placements, New Rye is licensed to provide Mergers and Acquisition advisory services. 
John Callaghan, NRS’s CEO, has been an institutional portfolio manager and an analyst, investing in public and private companies in the health care, technology, consumer, energy, and services businesses, in addition to playing operating roles in small startup companies. He has an A.B. in Economics from Harvard College and an M.B.A. from Harvard Business School. 

Michael Kraus, Chief Compliance Officer

Michael, a seasoned Financial and Operations Executive, Chief Compliance Officer, is founder and President of Sunhill Associates, LLC with over twenty years of progressive business leadership experience. He has led and managed multiple functions including Finance, Operations, IT and Human Resources. He is experienced in developing strategic plans, managing P&L’s, integrating acquisitions and implementing and managing Sarbanes Oxley and SAS 70 Type II controls.

He has an extensive background in Finance and Operations and has held Finance and Operations leadership positions across a variety of industries including Financial Services, Manufacturing, Retail, Publishing, Events/ Conferences and Consulting. Examples of positions he has held include Vice President, Finance and Operations for EquiSearch Services Inc, A ChoicePoint Company; Board Director and CFO for EquiSearch Securities, member NASD/FINRA and SIPC; Interim General Manager for EquiSearch Services, A ChoicePoint Company; Senior Director, Business Unit Finance for Gartner Inc. and Senior Financial Analyst for Remington Products, Inc. Michael holds the following FINRA licenses: Series 7, 63, 24, 27, 79 and 99. 

Jeffrey Heller, FINOP

Jeffrey Heller serves as New Rye Securities' Financial and Operational Principal (FINOP). Mr. Heller worked as a Senior Accountant for Arthur Young & Co (now Ernst & Young) 1980-1983. Today he is a Partner/Sole Practitioner CPA at his own firm, which has been operating since 1988. He is an accountant and FINOP for several clients, including Broker Dealers registered with the FINRA. Mr. Heller graduated from Rutgers College with a B.A. in Economics.

For Investors
New Rye Securities is dedicated to expanding options for investors, while providing transparency to a process long shrouded in secrecy.
In the past, private placements were private, and limited to a select few. Even investors lucky enough to see some offerings were presented with a tiny fraction of what was available. But now, with new regulatory developments, New Rye can alert all eligible investors to private offerings.
Investors can access managements, offering documents, and investor discussions to select their investments.
Just as online brokerage empowered millions of investors in the public market, New Rye allows investors to take control of their investment decision in an asset class previously denied to all but an inner circle of investors.
It is important to note that investing in private companies may involve significant risk. Companies may present risks specific to their industry, operating strategy, or stage of development. Since the securities are private, you may not be able to sell your securities. Because of these and other risks, you should recognize the potential to lose some or all of your investment and you should invest no more than you can afford to lose. Be sure to review company documents so you understand the risks before you invest.

terms of use
Effective Date:December 18, 2013 
please read this agreement carefully. it sets forth the legally bidnding terms and conditions for your use of the site and services

Overview
It’s important that you read this entire Terms of Use (“Terms”); but, here are some of the more significant terms that we want to bring to your attention:

The security laws applicable to private company finance are complicated and occasionally ambiguous. In general, they are designed to protect unsophisticated people from making ill-advised investments. These Terms are designed to minimize the risk for NRS if any unsophisticated/unaccredited individuals try to become investors in NRS investment offerings, and to protect NRS in the event that anyone claims he, she or it was damaged by relying on information found on the Site.

Each time you use the Site, these Terms and any applicable Additional Terms (defined below) then posted apply so you should check back each time you return for any updates.
You may only use the Content (defined below) on the Site in connection with your permitted activities on the Site and not in an offline environment or in connection with another site or service. 
Except as set forth in the Privacy Policy that applies to the Site, you and NRS do not have a confidential, fiduciary, or any other special relationship by virtue of your use of the Site or your communications to NRS through or related to the Site.
 You consent to our Privacy Policy and our practices detailed in it.
Many types of disputes that may arise in connection with your access to and use of the Site are subject to mandatory arbitration – which includes your waiver of a right to a jury trial and to class action relief.

FEEDBACK YOU SUBMIT

General.

NRS may allow you to do this through contact us, email, and other communications functionality.  Subject to the rights and license you grant in these Terms, you retain whatever legally cognizable right, title, and interest that you have in your User-Generated Content and you remain ultimately responsible for it.
Non-Confidentiality of Your User-Generated Content.  Except as otherwise described in the Site’s posted Privacy Policy or any Additional Terms, you agree that: (a) your User-Generated Content will be treated as non-confidential – regardless of whether you mark them “confidential,” “proprietary,” or the like – and will not be returned; and (b) NRS does not assume any obligation of any kind to you or any third party with respect to your User-Generated Content.  Upon NRS’ request, you will furnish us with any documentation necessary to substantiate the rights to such content and to verify your compliance with these Terms or any Additional Terms.  You acknowledge that the Internet and mobile communications may be subject to breaches of security and that you are aware that submissions of User-Generated Content may not be secure, and you will consider this before submitting any User-Generated Content and do so at your own risk.  In your communications with NRS, please keep in mind that we do not seek any unsolicited ideas or materials for products or services, or even suggested improvements to products or services, including, without limitation, ideas, concepts, inventions, or designs for websites, recipes, products or otherwise (collectively, “Unsolicited Ideas and Materials”).  Any Unsolicited Ideas and Materials you post on or send to us via the Site are deemed User-Generated Content and licensed to us as set forth below.  In addition, NRS retains all of the rights held by members of the general public with regard to your Unsolicited Ideas and Materials.

License to NRS of Your User-Generated Content.  Except as otherwise described in any applicable Additional Terms, which specifically govern the submission of your User-Generated Content), you hereby grant to NRS, and you agree to grant to NRS, the non-exclusive, unrestricted, unconditional, unlimited, worldwide, irrevocable, perpetual, and cost-free right and license to use, copy, record, distribute, reproduce, disclose, sell, re-sell, sublicense (through multiple levels), display, publicly perform, transmit, publish, broadcast, translate, make derivative works of, and otherwise use and exploit in any manner whatsoever, all or any portion of your User-Generated Content (and derivative works thereof), for any purpose whatsoever in all formats, on or through any means or medium now known or hereafter developed, and with any technology or devices now known or hereafter developed, and to advertise, market, and promote the same.  Without limitation, the granted rights include the right to: (a) configure, host, index, cache, archive, store, digitize, compress, optimize, modify, reformat, edit, adapt, publish in searchable format, and remove such User-Generated Content and combine same with other materials, and (b) use any ideas, concepts, know-how, or techniques contained in any User-Generated Content for any purposes whatsoever, including developing, producing, and marketing products and/or services.  In order to further effect the rights and license that you grant to NRS to your User-Generated Content, you also hereby grant to NRS, and agree to grant to NRS, the unconditional, perpetual, irrevocable right to use and exploit your name, persona, and likeness in connection with any User-Generated Content, without any obligation or remuneration to you.  Except as prohibited by law, you hereby waive, and you agree to waive, any moral rights (including attribution and integrity) that you may have in any User-Generated Content, even if it is altered or changed in a manner not agreeable to you.  To the extent not waivable, you irrevocably agree not to exercise such rights (if any) in a manner that interferes with any exercise of the granted rights.  You understand that you will not receive any fees, sums, consideration, or remuneration for any of the rights granted in this Section 6(C).



Wireless

Wireless Features.  The Site may offer certain features and services that are available to you via your wireless Device.  These features and services may include the ability to access the Site’s features and upload content to the Site, receive messages from the Site, and download applications to your wireless Device (collectively, “Wireless Features”).  Standard messaging, data, and other fees may be charged by your carrier to participate in Wireless Features.  Fees and charges may appear on your wireless bill or be deducted from your pre-paid balance.  Your carrier may prohibit or restrict certain Wireless Features and certain Wireless Features may be incompatible with your carrier or wireless Device.  You should check with your carrier to find out what plans are available and how much they cost.  Contact your carrier with questions regarding these issues.
Terms of Wireless Features.  You agree that as to the Wireless Features for which you are registered, we may send communications to your wireless Device regarding us or other parties.  Further, we may collect information related to your use of the Wireless Features.  If you have registered via the Site for Wireless Features, then you agree to notify NRS of any changes to your wireless contact information (including phone number) and update your accounts on the Site to reflect the changes.




Dispute Resolution
Certain portions of this Section 8 are deemed to be a “written agreement to arbitrate” pursuant to the Federal Arbitration Act.  You and NRS agree that we intend that this Section 8 satisfies the “writing” requirement of the Federal Arbitration Act.  This Section  8 can only be amended by mutual agreement.

First - Try to Resolve Disputes and Excluded Disputes.  If any controversy, allegation, or claim arises out of or relates to the Site, the Content, your User-Generated Content, these Terms, or any Additional Terms, whether heretofore or hereafter arising (collectively, “Dispute”), or to any of NRS’ actual or alleged intellectual property rights (an “Excluded Dispute”, which includes those actions set forth in Section 8(D)), then you and we agree to send a written notice to the other providing a reasonable description of the Dispute or Excluded Dispute, along with a proposed resolution of it.  Our notice to you will be sent to you based on the most recent contact information that you provide us.  But if no such information exists or if such information is not current, then we have no obligation under this Section 8(A).  Your notice to us must be sent to: [New Rye Securities, LLC, 411 Theodore Fremd Ave., Suite 150, Rye, NY 10580 (Attn: Legal)] [Note: Please confirm address is correct.].  For a period of sixty (60) days from the date of receipt of notice from the other party, NRS and you will engage in a dialogue in order to attempt to resolve the Dispute or Excluded Dispute, though nothing will require either you or NRS to resolve the Dispute or Excluded Dispute on terms with respect to which you and NRS, in each of our sole discretion, are not comfortable.
Forums for Alternative Dispute Resolution.


Arbitration.  If we cannot resolve a Dispute as set forth in Section 8(A) within sixty (60) days of receipt of the notice, then either you or we may submit the Dispute to formal arbitration in accordance with this Section 8(B).  If we cannot resolve an Excluded Dispute as set forth in Section 8(A) within sixty (60) days of receipt of the notice, then either you or we may submit the Excluded Dispute to formal arbitration only if you and NRS consent, in a writing signed by you and an Officer or legal representative of NRS, to have that Excluded Dispute subject to arbitration.  In such a case (and only in such a case), that Excluded Dispute will be deemed a “Dispute” for the remainder of this Section 8(B).

Upon expiration of the applicable sixty (60)-day period and to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, a Dispute will be resolved solely by binding arbitration in accordance with the then-current Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”).  If the Dispute has a claimed value of not more than $250,000, then the arbitration will be heard and determined by a single neutral arbitrator who is a retired judge or a lawyer with not less than fifteen (15) years’ experience as a practicing member of the bar in the substantive practice area related to the Dispute, who will administer the proceedings in accordance with the AAA’s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes.  If the Dispute has a claimed value of more than $250,000, or if NRS elects in its sole discretion to bear the costs of arbitration in excess of those that would occur for a proceeding before a single neutral arbitrator, then the arbitration will be heard and determined by a three-member panel, with one member to be selected by each party and the third (who will be chair of the panel) selected by the two party-appointed members or by the AAA in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules.  The arbitrator or arbitration panel, as the case may be, will apply applicable law and the provisions of these Terms and any Additional Terms, will determine any Dispute according to the applicable law and facts based upon the record and no other basis, and will issue a reasoned award.  If you and NRS do not both consent to the arbitration of an Excluded Dispute as set forth in the immediately preceding paragraph of this Section 8(B)(i), then this paragraph and the remainder of this Section 8(B) will not apply to the Excluded Dispute.
If a party properly submits the Dispute to the AAA for formal arbitration and the AAA is unwilling or unable to set a hearing date within sixty (60) days of the filing of a “demand for arbitration,” then either party can elect to have the arbitration administered by the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services Inc. (“JAMS”) using JAMS’ streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures, or by any other arbitration administration service that you and an officer or legal representative of NRS consent to in writing.  The substantive practice area requirements for the arbitrator and the $250,000 threshold for a the number of arbitrators assigned to the Dispute set forth in the paragraph above for the AAA arbitration will also apply to any such arbitration under JAMS or another arbitration service.  You can obtain AAA and JAMS procedures, rules, and fee information as follows:


														AAA: 800.778.7879
														http://www.adr.org


														JAMS: 949.224.1810
														http://www.jamsadr.com 



Nature, Limitations, and Location of Alternative Dispute Resolution.  In arbitration, as with a court, the arbitrator must honor the terms of these Terms (and any Additional Terms) and can award the prevailing party damages and other relief (including attorneys’ fees).  However, WITH ARBITRATION: (A) THERE IS NO JUDGE OR JURY, (B) THE ARBITRATION PROCEEDINGS AND ARBITRATION OUTCOME ARE SUBJECT TO CERTAIN CONFIDENTIALITY RULES, AND (C) JUDICIAL REVIEW OF THE ARBITRATION OUTCOME IS LIMITED.  All parties to the arbitration will have the right, at their own expense, to be represented by an attorney or other advocate of their choosing.  If an in-person arbitration hearing is required, then it will be conducted in the “metropolitan statistical area” (as defined by the U.S. Census Bureau) where you are a resident at the time the Dispute is submitted to arbitration.  You and we will pay the administrative and arbitrator’s fees and other costs in accordance with the applicable arbitration rules; but if applicable arbitration rules or laws require NRS to pay a greater portion or all of such fees and costs in order for this Section 8 to be enforceable, then NRS will have the right to elect to pay the fees and costs and proceed to arbitration, or decline to do so and have the matter resolved through the courts.  Discovery will be permitted pursuant to the applicable arbitration rules.  The arbitrator’s decision must consist of a written statement stating the disposition of each claim of the Dispute, and must provide a statement of the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and any award (if any) is based.  Judgment on the arbitration decision and award (if any) may be entered in or by any court that has jurisdiction over the parties pursuant to Section 9 of the Federal Arbitration Act.
											


Limited Time to File Claims. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IF YOU OR WE WANT TO ASSERT A DISPUTE (BUT NOT AN EXCLUDED DISPUTE) AGAINST THE OTHER, THEN YOU OR WE MUST COMMENCE IT (BY DELIVERY OF WRITTEN NOTICE AS SET FORTH IN SECTION 8(A)) WITHIN ONE (1) YEAR AFTER THE DISPUTE ARISES -- OR IT WILL BE FOREVER BARRED.
Injunctive Relief. The foregoing provisions of this Section 8 will not apply to any legal action taken by NRS to seek an injunction or other equitable relief in connection with, any loss, cost, or damage (or any potential loss, cost, or damage) relating to the Site, any Content, your User-Generated Content and/or NRS’ intellectual property rights (including such NRS may claim that may be in dispute), NRS’ operations, and/or NRS’ products or services.
Small Claims Matters Are Excluded from Arbitration Requirement.  Notwith-standing the foregoing, either of us may bring qualifying claim of Disputes (but not Excluded Disputes) in small claims court, subject to Section 8(G).
No Class Action Matters.  Disputes will be arbitrated only on an individual basis and will not be consolidated with any other arbitration or other proceedings that involve any claim or controversy of any other party.  But if, for any reason, any court with competent jurisdiction or any arbitrator selected pursuant to Section 8(B)(i) holds that this restriction is unconscionable or unenforceable, then our agreement in Section 8(B) to arbitrate will not apply and the Dispute must be brought exclusively in court pursuant to Section 8(G).
Federal and State Courts in Westchester County.  Except to the extent that arbitration is required in Section 8(B), and except as to the enforcement of any arbitration decision or award, any action or proceeding relating to any Dispute or Excluded Dispute may only be instituted in state or federal court in Westchester County, New York.  Accordingly, you and NRS consent to the exclusive personal jurisdiction and venue of such courts for such matters.



DISCLAIMERS
YOUR ACCESS TO AND USE OF THE SITE IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK.
THE SITE, INCLUDING THE CONTENT, IS PROVIDED ON AN “AS IS”, “AS AVAILABLE”, AND “WITH ALL FAULTS” BASIS.  Therefore, to the fullest extent permissible by law, NRS and its subsidiaries and each of their respective employees, directors, members, managers, shareholders, agents, vendors, licensors, licensees, contractors, customers, successors, and assigns (collectively, “NRS Parties”) hereby disclaim and make no representations, warranties, endorsements, or promises, express or implied, as to:

the Site (including the Content and the User-Generated Content);
the functions, features, or any other elements on, or made accessible through, the Site;
any products, services, or instructions offered or referenced at or linked through the Site;
security associated with the transmission of your User-Generated Content transmitted to NRS or via the Site;
whether the Site or the servers that make the Site available are free from any harmful components (including viruses, Trojan horses, and other technologies that could adversely impact your Device);
whether the information (including any instructions) on the Site is accurate, complete, correct, adequate, useful, timely, or reliable;
whether any defects to or errors on the Site will be repaired or corrected;
whether your access to the Site will be uninterrupted;
whether the Site will be available at any particular time or location; and
whether your use of the Site is lawful in any particular jurisdiction.

EXCEPT FOR ANY SPECIFIC WARRANTIES PROVIDED HEREIN OR IN ADDITIONAL TERMS PROVIDED BY A NRS PARTY, NRS PARTIES HEREBY FURTHER DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT OR MISAPPROPRIATION OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS OF THIRD PARTIES, TITLE, CUSTOM, TRADE, QUIET ENJOYMENT, SYSTEM INTEGRATION, AND FREEDOM FROM COMPUTER VIRUS.
Some jurisdictions limit or do not allow the disclaimer of implied or other warranties so the above disclaimers may not apply to the extent such jurisdictions’ laws are applicable.


LIMITATIONS OF OUR LIABILITY
UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES WILL ANY NRS PARTIES BE RESPONSIBLE OR LIABLE FOR ANY LOSS OR DAMAGES OF ANY KIND, including personal injury or death or for any direct, indirect, economic, exemplary, special, punitive, incidental, or consequential losses or damages of any kind that are directly or indirectly related to:

the Site (including the Content and the User-Generated Content);
your use of or inability to use the Site, or the performance of the Site;
any action taken in connection with an investigation by NRS Parties or law enforcement authorities regarding your access to or use of the Site;
any action taken in connection with copyright or other intellectual property owners or other rights owners;
any errors or omissions in the Site’s technical operation; or
any damage to any user’s computer, hardware, software, modem, or other equipment or technology, including damage from any security breach or from any virus, bugs, tampering, fraud, error, omission, interruption, defect, delay in operation or transmission, computer line, or network failure or any other technical or  other malfunction, including losses or damages in the form of lost profits, loss of goodwill, loss of data, work stoppage, accuracy of results, or equipment failure  or malfunction.

The foregoing limitations of liability will apply even if any of the foregoing events or circumstances were foreseeable and even if NRS Parties were advised of or should have known of the possibility of such losses or damages, regardless of whether you bring an action based in contract, negligence, strict liability, or tort (including whether caused, in whole or in part, by negligence, acts of god, telecommunications failure, or destruction of the Site).
LIMITATION OF OUR LIABILITY FOR INVESTMENT DECISIONS:  Neither the information nor any opinion expressed on the Site constitutes an offer by NRS to buy or sell any securities or financial instruments or provide any investment advice or related service.  The information provided on the Site by us or our users about investment opportunities may not be available to or suitable for you.  Not all strategies are appropriate at all times.  The opinions expressed on the Site by us or our users do not constitute investment advice. Independent advice should be sought in all cases before investing in an opportunity offered on or through the Site.  The value and income of any of the investing opportunities mentioned on the Site by us or users can fall as well as rise and an investor may get back less than he or she invested.  Past performance is not necessarily a guide to future performance.  The investment opportunities mentioned on the Site may often have tax consequences; therefore, it is important to bear in mind that we do not provide tax advice.  The levels and bases of taxation can change.  Investors’ tax affairs are their own responsibility and investors should consult their own attorneys or other tax advisors in order to understand the tax consequences of any investments mentioned on the Site.  NRS AND ITS CONTENT LICENSORS DO NOT WARRANT THE ACCURACY, COMPLETENESS OR TIMELINESS, OR OTHERWISE ENDORSE, THESE VIEWS, OPINIONS OR RECOMMENDATIONS.  THE NRS PARTIES SHALL NOT BE LIABLE TO YOU OR ANYONE ELSE FOR ANY LOSS OR INJURY RESULTING DIRECTLY FROM THE USE OF THIS SITE, CAUSED, IN WHOLE OR PART, BY OUR NEGLIGENCE OR CONTINGENCIES BEYOND OUR CONTROL IN PROCURING, COMPILING, INTERPRETING, REPORTING OR DELIVERING THIS SITE AND ANY CONTENT THROUGH THIS SITE.  IN NO EVENT WILL THE NRS PARTIES BE LIABLE TO YOU OR ANYONE ELSE FOR ANY DECISION MADE OR ACTION TAKEN (E.G., A BAD INVESTMENT) BY YOU IN RELIANCE ON SUCH CONTENT OR THIS SITE.
Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages of the sort that are described above, so the above limitation or exclusion may not apply to you.
EXCEPT AS MAY BE PROVIDED IN ANY ADDITIONAL TERMS, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL NRS PARTIES’ TOTAL LIABILITY TO YOU, FOR ALL POSSIBLE DAMAGES, LOSSES, AND CAUSES OF ACTION IN CONNECTION WITH YOUR ACCESS TO AND USE OF THE SITE AND YOUR RIGHTS UNDER THESE TERMS, EXCEED AN AMOUNT EQUAL TO THE AMOUNT YOU HAVE PAID NRS IN CONNECTION WITH THE TRANSACTION(S) THAT UNDERLIE THE CLAIM(S); PROVIDED, HOWEVER, THIS PROVISION WILL NOT APPLY IF A COURT OR TRIBUNAL WITH APPLICABLE JURISDICTION FINDS SUCH TO BE UNCONSCIONABLE.  FOR PURPOSES OF CLARITY, THE PRIOR SENTENCE DOES NOT EXPAND OR LIMIT ANY EXPRESS, WRITTEN PRODUCT WARRANTY THAT IS PROVIDED BY NRS OR A MANUFACTURER OF A PHYSICAL PRODUCT.


Waiver of Injunctive or Other Equitable Relief
IF YOU CLAIM THAT YOU HAVE INCURRED ANY LOSS, DAMAGES, OR INJURIES IN CONNECTION WITH YOUR USE OF THE SITE, THEN THE LOSSES, DAMAGES, AND INJURIES WILL NOT BE IRREPARABLE OR SUFFICIENT TO ENTITLE YOU TO AN INJUNCTION OR TO OTHER EQUITABLE RELIEF OF ANY KIND.  THIS MEANS THAT, IN CONNECTION WITH YOUR CLAIM, YOU AGREE THAT YOU WILL NOT SEEK, AND THAT YOU WILL NOT BE PERMITTED TO OBTAIN, ANY COURT OR OTHER ACTION THAT MAY INTERFERE WITH OR PREVENT THE DEVELOPMENT OR EXPLOITATION OF ANY WEBSITE, APPLICATION, CONTENT, USER-GENERATED CONTENT, PRODUCT, SERVICE, OR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY OWNED, LICENSED, USED OR CONTROLLED BY NRS (INCLUDING YOUR LICENSED USER-GENERATED CONTENT) OR A LICENSOR OF NRS.


General Provisions

Updates to Terms.  These Terms (of if applicable Additional Terms), in the form posted at the time of your use of the applicable services to which it applies, shall govern such use (including transactions entered during such use).  AS OUR SITE EVOLVES, THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS UNDER WHICH WE OFFER THE SITE MAY PROSPECTIVELY BE MODIFIED (“UPDATED TERMS”) AND WE MAY CEASE OFFERING THE SITE UNDER THE TERMS OR ADDITIONAL TERMS FOR WHICH THEY WERE PREVIOUSLY OFFERED.  ACCORDINGLY, EACH TIME YOU SIGN IN TO OR OTHERWISE USE THE SITE YOU ARE ENTERING INTO A NEW AGREEMENT WITH US ON THE THEN APPLICABLE TERMS AND CONDITIONS AND YOU AGREE THAT WE MAY NOTIFY YOU OF OTHER TERMS BY POSTING THEM ON THE SITE (OR IN ANY OTHER REASONABLE MANNER OF NOTICE WHICH WE ELECT), AND THAT YOUR USE OF THE SITE AFTER SUCH NOTICE CONSTITUTES YOUR GOING FORWARD AGREEMENT TO THE OTHER TERMS FOR YOUR NEW USE AND TRANSACTIONS.  Therefore, you should review the posted terms of service and any applicable Additional Terms each time you use the Site (at least prior to each transaction or submission).  Updated Terms will be effective as to new use and transactions as of the time that we post them, or such later date as may be specified in them or in other notice to you.  However, terms of service (and any applicable Additional Terms) that applied when you previously used the site will continue to apply to such prior use (i.e., changes and additions are prospective only) unless mutually agreed.  In the event any notice to you of new, revised or additional terms is determined by a tribunal to be insufficient, the prior agreement shall continue until sufficient notice to establish a new agreement occurs.  You should frequently check the home page, and the email you associated with your account for notices, all of which you agree are reasonable manners of providing you notice.  You can reject any new, revised or Additional Terms by discontinuing use of the Site and related services.
NRS’ Consent or Approval.  As to any provision in these Terms or any Additional Terms that grants NRS a right of consent or approval, or permits NRS to exercise a right in its “sole discretion,” NRS may exercise that right, in its sole and absolute discretion.  No NRS consent or approval may be deemed to have been granted by NRS without being in writing and signed by an officer of NRS.
Applicable Law.  These Terms and any Additional Terms will be governed by and construed in accordance with, and any Dispute and Excluded Dispute will be resolved in accordance with, the laws of the state of New York, without regard to its conflicts of law provisions.
Indemnity.  You agree to, and you hereby, defend, indemnify, and hold NRS Parties harmless from and against any and all claims, damages, losses, costs, investigations, liabilities, judgments, fines, penalties, settlements, interest, and expenses (including attorneys’ fees) that directly or indirectly arise from or are related to any claim, suit, action, demand, or proceeding made or brought against any NRS Party, or on account of the investigation, defense, or settlement thereof, arising out of or in connection with, whether occurring heretofore or hereafter: (i) your User-Generated Content; (ii) your use of the Site and your activities in connection with the Site; (iii) your breach or alleged breach of these Terms or any Additional Terms; (iv) your violation or alleged violation of any laws, rules, regulations, codes, statutes, ordinances, or orders of any governmental or quasi-governmental authorities in connection with your use of the Site or your activities in connection with the Site; (v) information or material transmitted through your Device, even if not submitted by you, that infringes, violates, or misappropriates any copyright, trademark, trade secret, trade dress, patent, publicity, privacy, or other right of any person or entity; (vi) any misrepresentation made by you; and (vii) NRS Parties’ use of the information that you submit to us (including your User-Generated Content) (all of the foregoing, “Claims and Losses”).  You will cooperate as fully required by NRS Parties in the defense of any Claim and Losses.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, NRS Parties retain the exclusive right to settle, compromise, and pay any and all Claims and Losses.  NRS Parties reserve the right to assume the exclusive defense and control of any Claims and Losses.  You will not settle any Claims and Losses without, in each instance, the prior written consent of an officer of a NRS Party.
Operation of Site; Availability of Products and Services; International Issues. NRS controls and operates the Site from its U.S.-based offices in the U.S.A., and NRS makes no representation that the Site is appropriate or available for use beyond the U.S.A.  If you use the Site from other locations, you are doing so on your own initiative and are responsible for compliance with applicable local laws regarding your online conduct and acceptable content, if and to the extent local laws apply.  The Site may describe products and services that are available only in the U.S.A., and are not available worldwide.  We reserve the right to limit the availability of the Site and/or the provision of any content, program, product, service, or other feature described or available on the Site to any person, entity, geographic area, or jurisdiction, at any time and in our sole discretion, and to limit the quantities of any content, program, product, service, or other feature that we provide.  You agree that the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods does not apply to these Terms or to any sale of goods carried out as a result of your use of the Site.
Export Controls.  Software related to or made available by the Site may be subject to export controls of the U.S.A.  No software from the Site may be downloaded, exported, or re-exported: (i) into (or to a national or resident of) any country or other jurisdiction to which the U.S.A. has embargoed goods, software, technology or services (which, as of the effective date of these Terms, includes Cuba, North Korea, Iran, Sudan, and Syria), or (ii) to anyone on the U.S. Treasury Department’s list of Specially Designated Nationals or the U.S. Commerce Department’s Table of Deny Orders, or (iii) to anyone on the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Bureau of Industry and Security Entities List as published in the Export Administration Regulations (including entities engaged in weapons of mass destruction proliferation in various countries and persons and entities that are suspected of diverting U.S. origin items to embargoed countries or terrorist end-uses).  You are responsible for complying with all trade regulations and laws both foreign and domestic.  Except as authorized by law, you agree and warrant not to export or re-export the software to any county, or to any person, entity, or end-user subject to U.S. export controls or sanctions, including, without limitation, as set forth in subsections (i) – (iii) above.
Severability; Interpretation.  If any provision of these Terms, or any Additional Terms, is for any reason deemed invalid, unlawful, void, or unenforceable by a court or arbitrator of competent jurisdiction, then that provision will be deemed severable from these Terms or the Additional Terms, and the invalidity of the provision will not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of these Terms or the Additional Terms (which will remain in full force and effect).  To the extent permitted by applicable law, you agree to waive, and you hereby waive, any applicable statutory and common law that may permit a contract to be construed against its drafter.  Wherever the word “including” is used in these Terms or any Additional Terms, the word will be deemed to mean “including, without limitation”.
Communications.  When you communicate with us electronically, such as via email and text message, you consent to receive communications from us electronically.  We will try to promptly respond to all inquiries but are not obligated to do so.  You agree that all agreements, notices, disclosures, and other communications that we provide to you electronically satisfy any legal requirement that such communications be in writing.
Investigations; Cooperation with Law Enforcement; Termination; Survival.  NRS reserves the right, without any limitation, to: (i) investigate any suspected breaches of its Site security or its information technology or other systems or networks, (ii) investigate any suspected breaches of these Terms and any Additional Terms, (iii) investigate any information obtained by NRS in connection with reviewing law enforcement databases or complying with criminal laws, (iv) involve and cooperate with law enforcement authorities in investigating any of the foregoing matters, (v) prosecute violators of these Terms and any Additional Terms, and (vi) discontinue the Site, in whole or in part, or, except as may be expressly set forth in any Additional Terms, suspend or terminate your access to it, in whole or in part, including any user accounts or registrations, at any time, without notice, for any reason and without any obligation to you or any third party.  Any suspension or termination will not affect your obligations to NRS under these Terms or any Additional Terms.  Upon suspension or termination of your access to the Site, or upon notice from NRS, all rights granted to you under these Terms or any Additional Terms will cease immediately, and you agree that you will immediately discontinue use of the Site.  The provisions of these Terms and any Additional Terms, which by their nature should survive your suspension or termination will survive, including the rights and licenses you grant to NRS in these Terms, as well as the indemnities, releases, disclaimers, and limitations on liability and the provisions regarding jurisdiction, choice of law, no class action, and mandatory arbitration.
Assignment.  NRS may assign its rights and obligations under these Terms and any Additional Terms, in whole or in part, to any party at any time without any notice.  These Terms and any Additional Terms may not be assigned by you, and you may not delegate your duties under them, without the prior written consent of an officer of NRS.
No Waiver.  Except as expressly set forth in these Terms or any Additional Terms, (i) no failure or delay by you or NRS in exercising any of rights, powers, or remedies under will operate as a waiver of that or any other right, power, or remedy, and (ii) no waiver or modification of any term of these Terms or any Additional Terms will be effective unless in writing and signed by the party against whom the waiver or modification is sought to be enforced.
Connectivity.  You are responsible for obtaining and maintaining all Devices and other equipment and software, and all internet service provider, mobile service, and other services needed for your access to and use of the Site and you will be responsible for all charges related to them.

What business type is right for you?
When you're starting a new business, you want to determine the business structure that's right for you. What's the difference between a limited liability company (LLC) and a corporation (Inc.)? And how is a C corporation different from an S corporation? Use these charts to help decide what business type is best for your needs.








LLC vs. Corporation






Limited Liability Company (LLC)Shields personal assets from business liabilityRequires separation of business and personal financesundefinedAllowable in all 50 states and the District of ColumbiaundefinedHighly flexible management structureundefinedFlexible tax reporting optionsundefinedPreferred by outside investorsundefinedPreferred for IPOundefinedRecognized outside of the United StatesStart my LLCCorporation (Inc)Shields personal assets from business liabilityRequires separation of business and personal financesundefinedAllowable in all 50 states and the District of ColumbiaundefinedHighly flexible management structureundefinedFlexible tax reporting optionsundefinedPreferred by outside investorsundefinedPreferred for IPOundefinedRecognized outside of the United StatesStart my Corporation







What is an S corporation?
After you create a corporation or LLC, you also have the opportunity to decide how you'd like your business to be taxed.Single owner LLCs can be taxed either as a sole proprietorship or a corporation.  LLCs with more than one owner can be taxed either as a partnership or a corporation.  Income from LLCs treated as sole proprietorships or partnerships is reported directly on the owner’s individual tax returns.New corporations, as well as LLCs considering corporate taxation can choose between filing taxes as a C corporation ("C corp") or an S corporation ("S corp"). An S corp is considered a "pass-through entity," which means the business itself isn't taxed. Instead, income is reported on the owners' personal tax returns. Businesses taxed as C corporations are not pass through entities.  Income is taxed at the corporate level, and, if dividends are distributed, at the individual level as well.We can help you understand your options so you choose what's best for your business. Talk to one of our network of attorneys today.








C-corp or S-corp 






Here's a comparison of some key characteristics of businesses that choose to be treated as C corps and S corps.C DesignationOwners pay personal income tax on profitsBusiness must pay corporate income taxundefinedAll business income/loss is passed through to owners each year.undefinedNo more than 100 shareholdersundefinedShareholders must be U.S. citizens or resident aliensS DesignationOwners pay personal income tax on profitsBusiness must pay corporate income taxundefinedAll business income/loss is passed through to owners each year.undefinedNo more than 100 shareholdersundefinedShareholders must be U.S. citizens or resident aliensYou don't have to decide about S corp status right away. You have 75 days after the formation of your business to file with the IRS. If you're still not sure what to do, you may want to consult with one of our attorneys or tax specialists.





Step-by-Step Guide on Starting Your Business













Easy as 1-2-3




1. Select the business structure that's right for you and fill out a simple questionnaire.





2. We'll assemble your documents and file them directly with your state.





3. You'll receive your completed paperwork by mail.








Ask away. We have answers.



Common questions

Can I start a business without creating a corporation or LLC?
You don't need a corporation or LLC to go into business. Many business owners are in partnerships or are sole proprietors. But both a corporation and LLC canshield you from liability and may offer tax advantages.


What are the main differences between an LLC and a sole proprietorship?
You don't need to file any paperwork with your state to create a sole proprietorship (though you may still need business permits and licenses to operate lawfully). But an LLC protects you from personal liability  - a sole proprietorship doesn't.Also, LLCs provide more flexibility as you grow your business.


What are the main differences between an LLC and an S corporation?
An LLC has more flexibility and fewer corporate formalities than an S corporation. S corporations are required to have annual meetings of shareholders and directors, while meetings of LLC member and/or managers are not required..  Also,  LLCs can provide for a flexible management structure by members or managers, while corporations require management by a Board of Directors.Learn more.


Do I need a name or DBA for my business?
You only need a DBA ("doing business as") if you are operating a sole proprietorship or partnership and you want to use a fictitious name for the business. You don't need a DBA for an LLC or a corporation unless you are using a name other than your LLC or corporate name while doing business.Learn more.


Do I need any other licenses or permits to start my business? 
Some cities, counties, and states require businesses to obtain licenses and permits to operate lawfully. We can help you figure out what you need. Learn More.

Compare Business Structures – LLC vs. Corporation, S Corporation and C Corporation 

		 You’ve decided to start a business, but you’re not sure where to begin. You don’t know if you should form an LLC or corporation, and need guidance to help you choose the right business structure. Each business structure has its advantages and disadvantages that are important to understand because choosing the wrong business entity could result in legal and tax implications down the road. The information above will allow you to compare LLC vs. corporation, and learn the difference between an S corporation and C corporation. LLCs and corporations both offer personal liability protection, but the most significant difference between LLC and corporation is that corporations are preferred by outside investors. When comparing LLC vs S corp, there are a few important differences to be aware of which are outlined above. Once you determine which business structure you need, you can start a business with LegalZoom in just three easy steps. The process begins by filling out a simple questionnaire. We’ll assemble your documents and file them directly with your state, and you’ll receive your completed paperwork by mail. If you need help deciding which business structure is right for you, a LegalZoom legal plan attorney can explain how each business entity works and help you decide.
