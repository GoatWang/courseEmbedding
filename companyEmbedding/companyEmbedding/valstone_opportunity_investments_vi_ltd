ValStone Partners 
 
ValStone Partners, LLC ("ValStone Partners"), a registered investment advisor with the SEC, is a private equity investment firm with offices in Birmingham, Michigan and Baltimore, Maryland.  ValStone Partners coordinates the investment and management activities of a series of private equity funds.
ValStone Partners was formed in 1998 by Gerald C. Timmis III and Larry E. Jennings, Jr.  Between 1998 and 1999, ValStone Partners completed its first transactions, including a $100+ million portfolio of loans.  At that time, a major private institution identified ValStone Partners as a strategic partner and commenced a co-investment program that helped grow the firm’s investment and asset management program.
As of December 31, 2016, ValStone Partners has approximately $698 million of assets under management, which includes real estate owned and commitments, and has completed acquisitions with an aggregate stated value exceeding $1.2 billion since 1999.
 
ValStone Asset Management
The principals of ValStone Partners also formed ValStone Asset Management ("VAM") in 1999.  VAM is a fully integrated asset servicing platform that services and manages assets acquired by the ValStone Partners investment funds.  Since its formation, VAM has serviced, restructured or resolved approximately 4,000 commercial and industrial loans and bonds, with outstanding balances ranging from less than $100,000 to over $70 million.  VAM has offices in Birmingham, Michigan and Baltimore, Maryland.
