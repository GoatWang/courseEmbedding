History[edit]
J.G. Wentworth was founded in 1991 as a merchant bank specializing in transactions in the healthcare industry.[6][7] In 1992, the company began to purchase New Jersey's auto insurance deferrals from claimants who could not afford to wait 12 to 18 months for their settlements.[8]
Prior to 1999 there was no state regulation for structured settlements in the state of New York. Eliot Spitzer entered into a contract with J.G. Wentworth to help protect New Yorkers from selling their settlements at exorbitant rates. The agreement stipulated that J.G. Wentworth could receive a rate of no more than 25 percent of the annual discount rate of annuities it had purchased from a citizen of the state of New York.[9] At the time, a JGW executive told the New York Times that the firm sought the agreement because of the rate at which its business had grown in recent years.[10]
In May 2009, following the financial crisis, J.G. Wentworth's parent company, JGW Holdco LLC, entered Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. The company cited “liquidity problems amid a tightening credit market” as the catalyst for filing.[11] In June 2009, JGW Holdco LLC received $100 million in equity from primary stakeholder JLL Partners, which allowed the company and its subsidiaries to emerge from bankruptcy.[12]
In 2011, J.G. Wentworth and Peachtree Financial Solutions, which also purchased structured settlement, annuity, and lottery payments, formed a new holding company, JGWPT Holdings LLC. The two companies continued to operate independently after the transition.[13]
In October 2013, the firm filed for an initial public offering,[14][15] which was offered the subsequent month. The company was initially listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol JGWE.[16]
In 2015, J.G. Wentworth began expanding their financial offerings by purchasing WestStar Mortgage for $54 million in common shares and cash.[17] In the same year, the company also announced a partnership with Visa to offer a prepaid card to customers.[18]
In June 2016, J.G. Wentworth was delisted from the NYSE for failing to satisfy the continued listing rule.[19] Later that month, the company began trading on the OTC Markets Group under the symbol JGWE.[20]
Commercials and awards[edit]
The commercials that run on daytime television in the United States featuring "Mr. Wentworth" are how the company is best known.[citation needed] The company has had many commercial series with Mr. Wentworth; however, more recent series feature Wagnerian opera singers.[21] The tagline featured in the commercials is "It's my money and I need it now!" and "It's your money, use it when you need it!"
JGW has won several domestic and international awards for its television advertising, including a silver Davey award.[22] The "Wagnerian Opera" commercial won two International Summit Awards for Best Humor and Best TV between US$75k and US$100k.[23][24]
J.G. Wentworth Brands and Subsidiaries[edit]

History[edit]
J.G. Wentworth was founded in 1991 as a merchant bank specializing in transactions in the healthcare industry.[6][7] In 1992, the company began to purchase New Jersey's auto insurance deferrals from claimants who could not afford to wait 12 to 18 months for their settlements.[8]
Prior to 1999 there was no state regulation for structured settlements in the state of New York. Eliot Spitzer entered into a contract with J.G. Wentworth to help protect New Yorkers from selling their settlements at exorbitant rates. The agreement stipulated that J.G. Wentworth could receive a rate of no more than 25 percent of the annual discount rate of annuities it had purchased from a citizen of the state of New York.[9] At the time, a JGW executive told the New York Times that the firm sought the agreement because of the rate at which its business had grown in recent years.[10]
In May 2009, following the financial crisis, J.G. Wentworth's parent company, JGW Holdco LLC, entered Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. The company cited “liquidity problems amid a tightening credit market” as the catalyst for filing.[11] In June 2009, JGW Holdco LLC received $100 million in equity from primary stakeholder JLL Partners, which allowed the company and its subsidiaries to emerge from bankruptcy.[12]
In 2011, J.G. Wentworth and Peachtree Financial Solutions, which also purchased structured settlement, annuity, and lottery payments, formed a new holding company, JGWPT Holdings LLC. The two companies continued to operate independently after the transition.[13]
In October 2013, the firm filed for an initial public offering,[14][15] which was offered the subsequent month. The company was initially listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol JGWE.[16]
In 2015, J.G. Wentworth began expanding their financial offerings by purchasing WestStar Mortgage for $54 million in common shares and cash.[17] In the same year, the company also announced a partnership with Visa to offer a prepaid card to customers.[18]
In June 2016, J.G. Wentworth was delisted from the NYSE for failing to satisfy the continued listing rule.[19] Later that month, the company began trading on the OTC Markets Group under the symbol JGWE.[20]
Commercials and awards[edit]
The commercials that run on daytime television in the United States featuring "Mr. Wentworth" are how the company is best known.[citation needed] The company has had many commercial series with Mr. Wentworth; however, more recent series feature Wagnerian opera singers.[21] The tagline featured in the commercials is "It's my money and I need it now!" and "It's your money, use it when you need it!"
JGW has won several domestic and international awards for its television advertising, including a silver Davey award.[22] The "Wagnerian Opera" commercial won two International Summit Awards for Best Humor and Best TV between US$75k and US$100k.[23][24]
J.G. Wentworth Brands and Subsidiaries[edit]
J.G. Wentworth owns and operates under a number of brands. The main two brands owned by J.G. Wentworth are J.G. Wentworth and Peachtree.

A Home Should Fit Perfectly.
So Should Your Financing.



Buying a home is always a big decision, so is sorting through the crowd of mortgage lenders. A great mortgage lender should learn what you want in a home loan — and the life you want to have there. He or she should work with you every step of the way. 
At J.G. Wentworth, all of this and more is standard practice. See how below.


Buy a home with a loan based on your specific needs.
Whether you’re buying your first home, your next home, a vacation home or rental property, our loan officers help you carefully assess your needs. Then we help find the best loan program for you with our mortgage loan technology.


Refinance your home to give you more options.
See how refinancing your home can create plenty of benefits. You could:

Get cash from your home equity
Lower your payments
Consolidate debt
Refinance from an Adjustable Rate Loan to a Fixed Rate Loan


Home mortgage loan options and refinancing programs to help fit your situation.

Traditional fixed-rate mortgage loans

About J.G. Wentworth







J.G. Wentworth is the go-to resource for customers looking to access their future cash now.



J.G. Wentworth is the go-to resource for customers looking to access their future cash now. Since we bought our first structured settlement payment stream, we have helped thousands of customers sell more than $8 billion in future payments, making us the largest annuity and settlement payment purchaser in the country. We earned our leading position through our commitment to customer service, industry knowledge and experience, and the financial strength necessary to provide extremely competitive pricing.
After more than 20 years of experience purchasing future payment streams,we saw the need to provide a range of financial options beyond future payment purchasing.
That’s why, starting in 2014, we began the process of expanding our products to better assist our customers in accessing the funds they need, when they need them. Today, we are proud to offer the following:
Structured Settlement Payment Purchasing
J.G. Wentworth is the nation’s largest purchaser of structured settlement payments and annuities. We also purchase lottery winnings and other future payment streams. Learn more about J.G. Wentworth structured settlements purchasing.  
Personal Loans
We’ve helped thousands of people sell their future payments for cash now, but for millions of others, this isn’t an option. At J.G. Wentworth, we don’t think this should keep you from getting the money you need, which is why we have developed a relationship with a lending platform that can offer unsecured personal loans that could help you live the life you want. Learn more, read more about personal loans.
Prepaid Cards
Sometimes the best deals are online, but to take advantage of them you need a credit or debit card since you can’t pay in cash. Unfortunately, if you’re trying to recover from a less than perfect credit history, most banks won’t offer you a credit card. Additionally, traditional credit cards can carry prohibitive interest rates that may hold back individuals looking to get their personal finances back on track. To help fulfill the needs of millions of people, J.G Wentworth proudly presents prepaid    cards. Learn more about our prepaid cards.
Mortgage Loans
When we help customers sell their structured settlement or annuity payments, one of the most common reasons they give us for wanting the cash is to invest in a new home. This is why J.G. Wentworth now offers mortgage loans and home-refinancing options to our customers. Whether you’re looking to purchase your first home, buy a new house, or refinance to gain access to cash, J.G. Wentworth representatives can work with you to find a solution. Learn more about our mortgage loans.   
At J.G. Wentworth, we’re committed to getting you the money you need, when you need it. Regardless of whether you work with our industry-leading structured settlement payment purchasing team, or our new personal loan and mortgage loan representatives, you always receive the personalized service you deserve.

How do I know if I have a structured settlement?



A structured settlement is a periodic payment stream from an insurance company awarded from a legal settlement. These are often given after personal injury lawsuits, malpractice lawsuits or other events.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

History[edit]
J.G. Wentworth was founded in 1991 as a merchant bank specializing in transactions in the healthcare industry.[6][7] In 1992, the company began to purchase New Jersey's auto insurance deferrals from claimants who could not afford to wait 12 to 18 months for their settlements.[8]
Prior to 1999 there was no state regulation for structured settlements in the state of New York. Eliot Spitzer entered into a contract with J.G. Wentworth to help protect New Yorkers from selling their settlements at exorbitant rates. The agreement stipulated that J.G. Wentworth could receive a rate of no more than 25 percent of the annual discount rate of annuities it had purchased from a citizen of the state of New York.[9] At the time, a JGW executive told the New York Times that the firm sought the agreement because of the rate at which its business had grown in recent years.[10]
In May 2009, following the financial crisis, J.G. Wentworth's parent company, JGW Holdco LLC, entered Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. The company cited “liquidity problems amid a tightening credit market” as the catalyst for filing.[11] In June 2009, JGW Holdco LLC received $100 million in equity from primary stakeholder JLL Partners, which allowed the company and its subsidiaries to emerge from bankruptcy.[12]
In 2011, J.G. Wentworth and Peachtree Financial Solutions, which also purchased structured settlement, annuity, and lottery payments, formed a new holding company, JGWPT Holdings LLC. The two companies continued to operate independently after the transition.[13]
In October 2013, the firm filed for an initial public offering,[14][15] which was offered the subsequent month. The company was initially listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol JGWE.[16]
In 2015, J.G. Wentworth began expanding their financial offerings by purchasing WestStar Mortgage for $54 million in common shares and cash.[17] In the same year, the company also announced a partnership with Visa to offer a prepaid card to customers.[18]
In June 2016, J.G. Wentworth was delisted from the NYSE for failing to satisfy the continued listing rule.[19] Later that month, the company began trading on the OTC Markets Group under the symbol JGWE.[20]
Commercials and awards[edit]
The commercials that run on daytime television in the United States featuring "Mr. Wentworth" are how the company is best known.[citation needed] The company has had many commercial series with Mr. Wentworth; however, more recent series feature Wagnerian opera singers.[21] The tagline featured in the commercials is "It's my money and I need it now!" and "It's your money, use it when you need it!"
JGW has won several domestic and international awards for its television advertising, including a silver Davey award.[22] The "Wagnerian Opera" commercial won two International Summit Awards for Best Humor and Best TV between US$75k and US$100k.[23][24]
J.G. Wentworth Brands and Subsidiaries[edit]

About Our Company 



















About The J.G. Wentworth Company®
For more than 20 years, The J.G. Wentworth Company® has provided customers with affordable, flexible options to respond to life’s changing needs.
At the outset, we purchased future payments from structured settlements that resolved personal injury claims. Later that expanded to help people with funds from annuities. Along the way, we have continuously looked for new and pioneering ways to meet the unmet financial needs of our customers.
Today, The J.G. Wentworth Company® is a diversified consumer financial services leader focused on providing direct-to-consumer access to financing needs through a variety of solutions, including: mortgage lending and refinancing, access to personal and business loans, structured settlement payment purchasing, and prepaid cards.
Our seasoned management team has developed a category-leading marketing, operations, customer service and funding infrastructure that has allowed us to achieve efficiency and economies of scale necessary for stability and future growth.
Access to capital markets and securitization expertise is a significant competitive advantage for The J.G. Wentworth Company®. Approximately three times per year, our purchased payment streams are bundled and issued as Fixed-Rate Asset-Backed Notes, which are typically purchased by institutional investors. This core strength establishes a strong foundation for future growth through our relationships with financial institutions and ability to execute financing through committed warehouse lines.
Maintaining the highest levels of accountability, transparency, governance and adherence to applicable laws—is critical to our success. We’ve been a leader in the development of current regulatory framework around the purchasing of structured settlement payments. Our work on both federal and state regulation has provided more clarity and stability to the structured settlement payment transfer process, and we embrace this regulation.
Diversified transactions for our customers, a robust financial infrastructure, and leading by example in regulation, are hallmarks of our heritage at The J.G. Wentworth Company® and qualities we will carry forward as we continue our positive growth trajectory.
