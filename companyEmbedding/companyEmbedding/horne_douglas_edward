J DOUGLAS EDWARDS, the Greatest Sales Trainer Who Ever Lived
   
I was first exposed to J Douglas Edwards recordings by the best salesman I had ever met back about 1970. In the 60’s, 70’s and 80’s J Douglas Edwards was the most in-demand sales trainer in the country by Fortune 500 companies.Every great sales trainer available today refers to J Douglas Edwards as, “The Godfather of all Sales Trainers.” The current crop of top-tier sales trainers were all students of JDE. They teach, in their own words, what they understood Doug was saying. If you think the students are good, wait until you hear their teacher!.His six most popular recordings started off as LP’s, then cassettes, and are now available as CDs. If my house was on fire and I could only save one thing, if I believed I couldn't replace them, I would save my J Douglas Edwards CDs. I have earned an extra $1,000,000 in my lifetime using what I learned from this great man on these six CDs.My two favorite CDs are, “13 Effective Closes” and “10 Additional Closes” (known today as "Closes") Think about that for a minute. 23 different ways to get a commitment from a buyer! When you learn all 23 of his very effective closes and then, apply them in a selling situation, you won’t be a good salesman, or even a great salesman, you’ll be “totally lethal.”Doug says, "The reason we have so many people in sales today doing so poorly is, they know two closes but only use one.Once you learn and apply, “Cashing Objections”, you’ll actually look forward to hearing an objection because you will then, sell the buyer his own objection as the only reason for not buying. The buyer, believing he has you in a box you can’t get out of, agrees. Once you’ve confirmed it’s the only obstacle to the completion of the sale, you present the information that completely nullifies his/her confirmed, one and only, objection. Works every time.As Edwards points out in “The People Business”, regardless of what you sell, we’re all selling to people. We’re really in the people business and people buy based on their values. Explore for their values and use the buyer’s own value system to help you close the sale.“P’s & Q’s” is all about prospecting and qualifying. Like everything else, Doug Edwards teaches patterns of activity, like nesting”, that will keep your sales funnel full with qualified prospects.His last CD, “Questions are the Answer” teaches the person who is asking the questions is in charge of the situation. He has a unique way of demonstrating how your closing percentages will rise dramatically by asking the right questions. I won’t spoil the way he demonstrates his point but, I’ll guarantee, once you hear it, you’ll never forget the way he does it.My first set of JDE recordings were on cassette tapes. I played them constantly in my car as I made sales calls. After a while, I knew every word on every tape and I had internalized everything he said. When I was making a sales call, the words were in my voice but, it was J Douglas Edwards who actually made all those sales for me.Even today, I keep all six of his recordings on my iPod and listen as I drive.Many times, I have compared these six CDs to the equivalent of a college education in salesmanship. It costs $125 own this incredible set of six CDs however, it could cost you a million or more in lifetime earnings if you don’t. When you own these CDs you'll understand why today's top-tier sales trainers are as good as they are. In the history of sales trainers, J Douglas Edwards is still, “The Ultimate Master Teacher”.As a lifelong salesman, I really do know from personal experience how valuable these recordings can be. In 1988, I was invited to make sales calls at the White House. I sat in the decision maker's office making my presentation. It was my voice using Doug's words and I ended up, on 33 occasions, providing the President and Vice-President a special service they had never been offered before. Best sale of my life, thanks to what I learned from these CDs.Jim Vaughan, Editor and CEOwww.LearnFromTheGiants.comJacksonville, Florida
