			in Private Financing News 












Share with your friendsYour NameYour EmailRecipient EmailEnter a MessageI read this article and found it very interesting, thought it might be interesting for you. The article is called Neurovasc Technologies  $2.70 million  Financing. JIANLU MA  Released Nov 18  D Form and is was published by Octafinance.com at http://www.octafinance.com/neurovasc-technologies-2-70-million-financing-jianlu-ma-released-nov-18-d-form/286389/.CaptchaSubmit
Neurovasc Technologies Financing
Neurovasc Technologies, Inc., Corporation just filed form D for $2.70 million equity financing. This is a new filing. Neurovasc Technologies was able to finance itself with $1.45 million so far. That is 53.70 % of the fundraising offer. The total private offering amount was $2.70 million. The financing document was filed on 2015-11-18. The reason for the financing was: unspecified. The fundraising still has about $1.25 million more and is not closed yet. We have to wait more to see if the offering will be fully taken.
 Neurovasc Technologies is based in California. The filler’s business is Other Health Care. The SEC form was filed by JIANLU MA CEO. The company was incorporated in 2015. The filler’s address is: 23181 Verdugo Drive, Suite 106, Laguna Hills, Ca, California, 92653. Jianlu Ma is the related person in the form and it has address: 23181 Verdugo Drive, Suite 106, Laguna Hills, Ca, California, 92653. Link to Neurovasc Technologies Filing: 000165837215000001.
Analysis of Neurovasc Technologies Offering
On average, firms in the Other Health Care sector, sell 68.60 % of the total offering size. Neurovasc Technologies sold 53.70 % of the offering. The financing is still open. The average fundraising size for companies in the Other Health Care industry is $1.16 million. The total amount raised is 25.00 % bigger than the average for companies in the Other Health Care sector. The minimum investment for this financing was set at $0. If you know more about the reasons for the fundraising, please comment below.
What is Form D? What It Is Used For
Form D disclosures could be used to track and understand better your competitors. The information in Form D is usually highly confidential for ventures and startups and they don’t like revealing it. This is because it reveals amount raised or planned to be raised as well as reasons for the financing. This could help competitors. Entrepreneurs usually want to keep their financing a ‘secret’ so they can stay in stealth mode for longer.
Why Fundraising Reporting Is Good For Neurovasc Technologies Also
The Form D signed by JIANLU MA might help Neurovasc Technologies, Inc.’s sector. First, it helps potential customers feel more safe to deal with a firm that is well financed. The odds are higher that it will stay in the business. Second, this could attract other investors such as venture-capital firms, funds and angels. Third, positive PR effects could even bring leasing firms and venture lenders.
