                It's a natural. With ultra low levels of the proteins that cause latex skin irritation and other latex allergic reactions, Vytex® NRL can be second-skin thin or sturdy to protect working hands, 
                smooth as silk or textured, elastic and strong to meet the growing demand for latex-safe products. You'll now find the Vytex® NRL label on condoms with dozens of other products on the horizon.

Vytex Revolutionizing Natural Rubber Latex










Safe for Your Company, Your Customers, and Our Environment
We take our commitment to the evironment seriously. Vytex® based products are made in our zero compromise process which produces less waste and keeps people safe.
				
Learn More











What is Vytex?
Vytex with its green beginnings, is biodegradable and renewable unlike the petroleum-based synthetics in use today. Upgrading to Vytex can eliminate the need for added processing steps to lower protein levels, saving energy, water, supply, and material handling costs. Our environmentally friendly process also  improves performance characteristics due to the non-rubber impurity removal process. These benefits include color, stability, gel time, air retention, strength and durability.





Vytex is a revolutionary plant-based raw material sustainably harvested from the Hevea brasiliensis tree. It is then treated with a non-toxic multi-patented process to virtually eliminate all of the antigenic problem-causing proteins that can result in an allergic reaction to natural rubber latex without the use of harmful chemicals typically found in non-latex alternatives. 




This makes Vytex the cleanest rubber product on the market. Vytex can easily be used as a source material for end product applications wherever Natural Rubber Latex, synthetic latex blends, nitrile, and petroleum-based products are used. Vytex is free of petroleum, volatile organic compounds (VOCs), harsh chemical and filler agents.


Vytex is natural, renewable, stronger, and safer.

Vystar Corporation Key Developments

Vystar Corporation Receives Indonesia Patent Notice of Allowance for Deproteinization of Vytex Natural Rubber Latex
Jun 7 17
Vystar Corp. has received a notice of allowance from Indonesia for a patent regarding 'Natural Rubber Latex Having Reduced Allergenicity and Method of Making Same.' Vystar now holds 11 international and four domestic patents related to its latex deproteinization process which results in Vytex®, a natural rubber latex (NRL) virtually free of allergen-causing latex proteins, thereby reducing risk of developing or experiencing allergic reactions from direct contact. Vystar now has IP protection in Indonesia, Malaysia and India, which are three of the world’s top five producers of natural rubber, with Malaysia ranking first in latex glove production. The latex industry is estimated at approximately USD 1.3 billion. Latex allergies and powdered gloves have become a major concern in the healthcare industry, with some facilities banning latex gloves and the US recently banning powdered gloves. However, surgeons and medical professionals prefer latex over synthetic latex, vinyl and other materials due to its superior tactile sensitivity, puncture resistance, strength, durability and flexibility. This presents a tremendous market opportunity for Vytex medical gloves as they are virtually free of allergy-causing proteins while providing all the benefits of latex that healthcare workers want, and they don’t need powder to ease glove donning and removal. Additionally, Vytex is sustainably sourced and completely biodegradable, in sharp contrast to petrochemical based synthetic latex or petrochemical based disposable gloves. Plus, those who need to wear disposable gloves appreciate that Vytex is virtually odor-free, without the strong odor of traditional latex. The Vytex deproteinization process also removes the source of the latex odor, making Vytex more eco friendly than its competitors as there is no need for the excessive water rinses to remove odor during the manufacturing process or the need for artificial fragrance to mask the odor. Competitively priced against traditional latex, Vytex is a superior material for more than 40,000 applications that typically use latex or petrochemical based materials. Vytex can be used in medical gloves, catheters and devices; condoms; mattresses, toppers and pillows; cushions; balloons; adhesives; sports equipment, footwear; padding, apparel and threads.

Vystar Corporation and NHS Holdings, LLC Enters into Distribution Agreement
Oct 6 16
On September 30, 2016, Vystar Corporation and NHS Holdings, LLC entered into a Distribution Agreement with respect to the distribution of finished parts and components of home furnishing goods, and other products manufactured with the company's patented Vytex NRL process. The Agreement provides that NHS shall be the exclusive world-wide distributor for such home furnishing goods, and the non-exclusive world-wide distributor of products in other industries utilizing the Vytex NRL process. The company will be paid 7% of the cost of such products to NHS. NHS has the right to sublicense its rights under the Agreement. In such event, NHS will be obligated to pay one-third of all license royalties paid to it to the Company. The Agreement is perpetual unless NHS terminates the Agreement with thirty days' notice, or a party breaches the Agreement and does not cure the breach in 45 days from receipt of notice of such breach from the non-breaching party.

                It's a natural. With ultra low levels of the proteins that cause latex skin irritation and other latex allergic reactions, Vytex® NRL can be second-skin thin or sturdy to protect working hands, 
                smooth as silk or textured, elastic and strong to meet the growing demand for latex-safe products. You'll now find the Vytex® NRL label on condoms with dozens of other products on the horizon.
