Our Approach
The concepts and investment philosophy used by the principals of GoodHaven in managing your money are relatively simple to explain but much harder to execute. First and foremost, we try to behave in a business-like fashion and analyze securities from a business owner or lender point of view. This means always trying to determine a range of “intrinsic values” for the securities we identify as candidates for purchase.  
As Ben Graham (left), the “dean” of security analysis and one of Warren Buffett’s professors at Columbia University in New York once wrote, “Investment is most intelligent when it is most business-like.” We try to embed Graham’s concepts of intrinsic value and “margin of safety” into everything we do for our clients and shareholders.
We define intrinsic value is defined as the price that a security-holder would receive if a company were sold to a knowledgeable buyer or the proceeds that would be received upon liquidation or reorganization of the enterprise.
We define margin of safety is defined as the discount from intrinsic value at which a security may be purchased.

Value investing becomes a process whereby the portfolio manager is constantly trying to identify intrinsic values and maximize the associated margin of safety. We think of these concepts as trying to find dollar bills in the stock or bond markets and then buy them for less than a dollar – preferably far less. In any investment, a larger margin of safety implies a lower chance of significant loss and a greater potential profit.
Unlike many investors, GoodHaven cannot be put in a simple style box. We prefer companies that grow, but will sometimes buy one whose revenues are shrinking. We prefer to invest in common stocks, but will sometimes venture into other security types. And we prefer easily understandable businesses but sometimes buy those with more complicated financial statements. However the common theme in all our investments is that we are constantly trying to get much more than we give.
Hint: if you’re looking for a bargain, you want to spend your time looking where there is fear or disinterest, not where popularity or momentum rules supreme.

We are not stock market strategists, technical analysts, or fortune tellers. That does not mean we are immunized from considerations of external economic factors or volatility in markets or individual securities. But our primary concern with these issues is about the risks they present, not their predictive power. 
We don’t mind volatility, but detest large risk, which we define as the chance that we can permanently lose money. In our decades of experience, we have found almost nobody with an ability to predict the course of markets with short-term success over a long period of time. Our experience suggests that time is better spent trying to position ourselves to react to events instead of trying to predict them.  Accordingly, we may have a significant cash or equivalent position when valuations seem stretched and are likely to employ those reserves during times of significant stress in markets or individual securities.
Lastly, we believe that wide diversification is a hedge against ignorance. We manage accounts with prudent concentration, believing that it is better to own fewer securities about which your knowledge is substantial than a much longer list where your knowledge is cursory. Although it should be obvious to most investors, if you want to outperform an index over time, your portfolio can’t resemble the index.

How we Manage Money
Our Investment Vehicles: 

The GoodHaven Separate Account Program (GSAP) manages investment accounts in excess of $1 million for individuals, corporations, and other entities using focused investment research and a concentrated portfolio management approach.  
A normal portfolio will hold about 7-15 securities, and a single security may equal up to 25% of the account’s value (measured at the time of purchase), although we expect such deep concentration to be rare. However, a significant part of an account’s value is expected to consist of just a few securities, a strategy often described as "non-diversified."  To the extent we are unable to identify undervalued securities, cash or equivalents may comprise a significant portion of account holdings until such time that investments meeting our criteria reappear.  Patience is a virtue.

The GoodHaven Institutional Separate Account Program (ISAP) manages accounts in excess of $25 million for corporations, ERISA accounts, and other qualified institutional entities using focused investment research and a concentrated portfolio management approach, and will utilize additional investment and risk-management strategies beyond those employed by GSAP.  
 These may include somewhat greater diversification than a GSAP account, the ability to buy stressed or illiquid assets such as “junk bonds”, bank debt, and other securities, and the ability to partly or fully hedge portions of the portfolio. Notwithstanding the above, we expect the bulk of the portfolio to be invested in common stocks, although from time to time we may have cash reserves as described above.

GoodHaven Capital Management is the investment advisor to the GoodHaven Fund, a no-load mutual fund, with a $10,000  minimum investment for an individual and $2,500 minimum investment for a Retirement Account. The GoodHaven Fund is offered only by prospectus and additional information may be found by cutting and pasting the following link into a web browser:

Focused Research / Concentrated Portfolios / Risk-Averse Philosophy / Long-Term View

GoodHaven Capital Management is a registered investment advisor that manages investment portfolios for individuals, corporations, ERISA accounts, qualified institutions, and the GoodHaven Fund, a public, no-load mutual fund.* Co-managed by Larry Pitkowsky and Keith Trauner, we are value investors who invest for ourselves as we invest for our clients and shareholders.  
*The GoodHaven Fund is offered only by prospectus. Nothing herein is intended as an offer or solicitation to purchase or sell any security.


Focused Research.
Focused research is a process.  We try to understand the nature and value of a business, not just its price.  Our research starts at the bottom and we just keep digging deeper, talking to customers, suppliers, competitors and anyone else that can share insights into the intrinsic value of a company.


Concentrated Portfolios.
Concentrating portfolios means prudently having more of your money in your best ideas - the best combination of business fundamentals, management, and discounts to intrinsic value.  Why put more money into your fiftieth best idea if you can put more into your top five? 


Risk-Averse Philosophy. 
Figure out where an investment can kill you and then don't go there.  We never want to be carried off the field due to an imprudent or speculative investment.  This means understanding the difference between risk - the chance that you can permanently lose money, and volatility - which is the bouncing around of security prices.  We don't mind volatility, but we try hard to avoid permanent loss.  


Long-Term View.
The time-frame of the average investor is now milliseconds.  An explosion of media outlets and Internet resources ensure that the smallest price squiggles are the subject of breathless discussion.  In our view, a long-term investment outlook is both desirable and a competitive advantage.  In effect, we are not in the get rich quick business; we are in the get rich slow business by trying to compound our money over time at reasonable and competitive rates.  Albert Einstein, the great physicist and mathematician, was fond of saying that compound interest is the eighth wonder of the world.  (Click here for an illustration of compound growth.)
 
The “Our Approach” page of this website describes our general investment philosophy.  For more specific information about how we manage separate accounts, please navigate to the “Links” tab of our website and download our most recent Form ADV Brochure.

Before you invest in the GoodHaven Fund, please refer to the statutory prospectus or summary prospectus for important information about the investment company, including investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses. You may also obtain a hard copy of the prospectus by calling 1-855-OK-GOODX (1-855-654-6639). The prospectus should be read and considered carefully before you invest or send money.
The Fund is offered only to United States residents, and information on this site is intended only for such persons. Nothing on this web site should be considered a solicitation to buy or an offer to sell shares of the Fund in any jurisdiction where the offer or solicitation would be unlawful under the securities laws of such jurisdiction.
References to other mutual funds should not be interpreted as an offer of those securities.
Past performance does not guarantee future results.
Mutual fund investing involves risk. Principal loss is possible. The Fund is nondiversified, meaning it may concentrate its assets in fewer individual holdings than a diversified fund. Therefore, the Fund is more exposed to individual stock volatility than a diversified fund. The Fund invests in mid and smaller capitalization companies, which involve additional risks such as limited liquidity and greater volatility. The Fund may invest in foreign securities which involve greater volatility and political, economic and currency risks and differences in accounting methods. The Fund may invest in REIT's, which are subject to additional risks associated with direct ownership of real property including decline in value, economic conditions, operating expenses, and property taxes. Investments in debt securities typically decrease in value when interest rates rise. This risk is usually greater for longer-term debt securities. Investment in lower-rated, non-rated and distressed securities presents a greater risk of loss to principal and interest than higher-rated securities.
The GoodHaven Funds are distributed by Quasar Distributors, LLC

Before you invest in the GoodHaven Fund, please refer to the statutory prospectus or summary prospectus for important information about the investment company, including investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses. You may also obtain a hard copy of the prospectus by calling 1-855-OK-GOODX (1-855-654-6639). The prospectus should be read and considered carefully before you invest or send money.
The Fund is offered only to United States residents, and information on this site is intended only for such persons. Nothing on this web site should be considered a solicitation to buy or an offer to sell shares of the Fund in any jurisdiction where the offer or solicitation would be unlawful under the securities laws of such jurisdiction.
References to other mutual funds should not be interpreted as an offer of those securities.
Past performance does not guarantee future results.
Mutual fund investing involves risk. Principal loss is possible. The Fund is nondiversified, meaning it may concentrate its assets in fewer individual holdings than a diversified fund. Therefore, the Fund is more exposed to individual stock volatility than a diversified fund. The Fund invests in mid and smaller capitalization companies, which involve additional risks such as limited liquidity and greater volatility. The Fund may invest in foreign securities which involve greater volatility and political, economic and currency risks and differences in accounting methods. The Fund may invest in REIT's, which are subject to additional risks associated with direct ownership of real property including decline in value, economic conditions, operating expenses, and property taxes. Investments in debt securities typically decrease in value when interest rates rise. This risk is usually greater for longer-term debt securities. Investment in lower-rated, non-rated and distressed securities presents a greater risk of loss to principal and interest than higher-rated securities.

Concentrated Portfolio Management










Focused Investment Research










Long-Term Approach















 






















New!   2017 Semi-Annual Report Now Available            
 Interim Letter to Shareholders













The investment advisor to the GoodHaven Fund is GoodHaven Capital Management, LLC and the co-Portfolio Managers of the Fund are Larry Pitkowsky and Keith Trauner, experienced investors who both have significant personal assets in the Fund.




Stated simply, we are value investors focusing our efforts on making a few intelligent business decisions for our shareholders and ourselves in order to earn competitive long-term returns when compared to low risk alternatives and broad market indexes. We try to dig deep to understand the companies in which we invest and to make the results meaningful for shareholders by concentrating the Fund’s portfolio in our best ideas.

Focused Research




Focused research is a process. We try to understand the nature and value of a business, not just its price. Our research starts at the bottom and we just keep digging deeper, talking to customers, suppliers, competitors and anyone else that can share insights into the intrinsic value of a company.












 




Concentrated Portfolios




Concentrating portfolios means prudently having more of your money in your best ideas - the best combination of business fundamentals, management, and discounts to intrinsic value. Why put more money into your fiftieth best idea if you can put more into your top five?












 




Risk-Averse Philosophy




Figure out where an investment can kill you and then don't go there. We never want to be carried off the field due to an imprudent or speculative investment. This means understanding the difference between risk - the chance that you can permanently lose money, and volatility - which is the bouncing around of security prices. We don't mind volatility, but we try hard to avoid permanent loss.












 




Long-Term View




The time-frame of the average investor is now milliseconds. An explosion of media outlets and Internet resources ensure that the smallest price squiggles are the subject of breathless discussion. In our view, a long-term investment outlook is both desirable and a competitive advantage. In effect, we are not in the get rich quick business; we are in the get rich slow business by trying to compound our money over time at reasonable and competitive rates. Albert Einstein, the great physicist and mathematician, was fond of saying that compound interest is the eighth wonder of the world.

GoodHaven Capital Management Launches No-Load GoodHaven Fund






Business Wire




Apr 11, 2011 10:45 AM EDT













 


















































  GoodHaven Capital Management, LLC ("GoodHaven") is pleased to announce the launch of the GoodHaven Fund (“The Fund”), a no-load mutual fund with a focused portfolio management strategy and a flexible mandate allowing the managers to broadly seek value for their fellow shareholders. The Fund’s trading symbol is GOODX.  The Founders and Portfolio Managers of GoodHaven are Larry Pitkowsky and Keith Trauner, veteran analysts and portfolio managers previously associated with Fairholme Capital Management, LLC ("Fairholme"). "We created the GoodHaven Fund so that like-minded investors could benefit from our long-term value approach and the common sense investment principles we use to manage our own money," said Keith Trauner. "We believe in focused investment research, concentrated portfolio management and the concepts of intrinsic value and margin of safety," he added.  Larry Pitkowsky noted, "For us, identifying a difference between the market value of a security and its intrinsic value is what defines an investment opportunity. And with a flexible, go-anywhere mandate, we have the ability to focus the Fund’s portfolio where we see the greatest values.”  Over most of the last decade, Founders Pitkowsky and Trauner held research, portfolio management, and executive positions with Fairholme and that firm's affiliated Fairholme Fund. Keith has more than 30 years of research and portfolio management experience, and Larry more than 20 years. Larry and Keith are also strongly committed to maintaining a “level playing field” by investing a significant portion of their personal net worth alongside the Fund’s shareholders and the other clients of GoodHaven Capital Management. Larry noted, “By investing in Fund shares personally, it helps to align our interests directly with shareholders. We want to attract investors with a long-term horizon, who understand that investing is a “lumpy process”, and realize that volatility in markets can create significant investment opportunity. What we’re really looking forward to is a long-term partnership with our shareholders."

Goodhaven Unveils New Fund
April 11, 2011 (PLANSPONSOR.com) – GoodHaven Capital Management, LLC has unveiled the GoodHaven Fund, with a focused portfolio management strategy and a flexible mandate allowing the managers to broadly seek value. 
By PLANSPONSOR staff editors@plansponsor.com | April 11, 2011 






















  














A news release said the fund’s trading symbol is GOODX.  The founders and portfolio Managers of GoodHaven are Larry Pitkowsky and Keith Trauner. Over most of the last decade, Pitkowsky and Trauner held research, portfolio management, and executive positions with Fairholme and that firm's affiliated Fairholme Fund. Trauner has more than 30 years of research and portfolio management experience, and Pitkowsky more than 20 years.When choosing investments, GoodHaven’s managers primarily focus on free cash flow; a strong balance sheet; products or services that fill basic human needs or wants; owner/managers with demonstrated skill in capital allocation; participation in stressed industries; potential for long-term growth; and a demonstrated ability to increase prices. The fund may, from time to time, also have significant fixed-income investments or cash holdings. According to the company, the minimum initial investment is $10,000 for regular accounts and $2,500 for retirement, tax-deferred and UGMA/UTMA accounts. The fund’s toll free phone number is 1-855-OK-GOODX (1-855-654-6639).Pitkowsky joined Fairholme in 1999 and was a Portfolio Manager with the Fairholme Fund from 2002 until 2007 and a member of the firm's portfolio management team from 1999 until 2007. He also held various other positions, including CEO of FCM Services, an affiliate of Fairholme. Previously, Pitkowsky worked at Paine Webber as a VP of Investments and Portfolio Manager. He received his BS in Accounting from Rutgers University. Trauner joined Fairholme in 1999 and was a Portfolio Manager of the Fairholme Fund from 2006 to 2008. During his tenure at Fairholme, he also served as a Senior Analyst, Portfolio Manager, and Chief Financial Officer of the firm. Trauner was also an Officer and Director of Fairholme Funds, Inc., parent company of the Fairholme Fund. He received his BA in History from Middlebury College.
