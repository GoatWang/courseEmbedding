We are a marine fuel logistics company that physically supplies and markets refined marine fuel and lubricants to ships in port and at sea. As a physical supplier, we purchase marine fuel from refineries, major oil producers and other sources and resell and deliver these fuels using our bunkering tankers to a broad base of end users. We provide fueling services to virtually all types of ocean-going vessels and many types of coastal vessels, such as oil tankers, container ships, drybulk carriers, cruise ships and ferries. Our customers include a diverse group of ocean-going and coastal ship operators and marine fuel traders, brokers and other users.

We believe that we are one of a limited number of independent physical suppliers that owns and operates a fleet of bunkering tankers and conducts physical supply operations in multiple jurisdictions.

We provide a service to our customers that requires sophisticated logistical operations designed to meet their strict fuel quality and delivery scheduling needs.

Rigrodsky & Long, P.A. Files Securities Fraud Class Action Lawsuit On Behalf of Shareholders Of General Maritime Corporation | Business Wire
























































Rigrodsky & Long, P.A. Files Securities Fraud Class Action Lawsuit On 
      Behalf of Shareholders Of General Maritime Corporation






June 27, 2012 07:07 PM Eastern Daylight Time



WILMINGTON, Del.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Rigrodsky & Long, P.A. announces that it has filed a class action 
      lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Southern District of 
      New York on behalf of all persons or entities who purchased or otherwise 
      acquired the common stock of General Maritime Corporation (“General 
      Maritime” or the “Company”) (OTC BB: GMRRQ) 
      between May 10, 2010 and November 16, 2011, inclusive (the “Class 
      Period”) alleging violations of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the 
      “Complaint”). The case is entitled Phipps v. Tavlarios and Pribor, Case 
      No. 1:12-cv-04599-AJN (S.D.N.Y.).
    

      If you wish to view a copy of the Complaint, discuss this action, or 
      have any questions concerning this notice or your rights or interests, 
      please contact Peter Allocco of Rigrodsky & Long, P.A., 825 East Gate 
      Boulevard, Garden City, NY, 11530 at (888) 969-4242, by e-mail to info@rigrodskylong.com, 
      or at: http://www.rigrodskylong.com/news/general-maritime-corporation-gmrrq.
    

      General Maritime was, during the Class Period, a leading crude and 
      products tanker company serving principally within the Atlantic basin, 
      which includes ports in the Caribbean, South and Central America, the 
      United States, West Africa, the Mediterranean, Europe and the North Sea. 
      The Complaint alleges that defendant John P. Tavlarios, the Company’s 
      President and member of General Maritime’s Board of Directors during the 
      Class Period, and defendant Jeffrey D. Pribor, the Company’s Executive 
      Vice President and Chief Financial Officer during the Class Period, made 
      materially false and misleading statements, and omitted material 
      information, regarding General Maritime’s business and financial 
      results. Specifically, the Complaint alleges that the defendants made 
      statements that they believed General Maritime’s then-current cash 
      balances, operating cash flows and available borrowings were sufficient 
      to meet the Company’s liquidity needs for late 2011 and early 2012, when 
      there was no reasonable basis to believe to do so. When the truth about 
      the Company’s poor financial condition was partially disclosed, the 
      value of General Maritime stock declined significantly until, on 
      November 17, 2011, the Company announced that it had a voluntary 
      petition for relief under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy 
      Code, completely wiping out all equity in the Company.
    

      If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later 
      than August 27, 2012. A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting 
      on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation. In order 
      to be appointed lead plaintiff, the Court must determine that the class 
      member’s claim is typical of the claims of other class members, and that 
      the class member will adequately represent the class. Your ability to 
      share in any recovery is not, however, affected by the decision whether 
      or not to serve as a lead plaintiff. Any member of the proposed class 
      may move the court to serve as lead plaintiff through counsel of their 
      choice, or may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member.
    

      Rigrodsky & Long, P.A., with offices in Wilmington, Delaware and Garden 
      City, New York, regularly litigates securities class, derivative and 
      direct actions, shareholder rights litigation and corporate governance 
      litigation, including claims for breach of fiduciary duty and proxy 
      violations in the Delaware Court of Chancery and in state and federal 
      courts throughout the United States.
