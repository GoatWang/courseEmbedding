DWS Scudder launches two new funds that build on Deutsche Asset Management's global investment expertise




DWS Scudder, a division of Deutsche Asset Management, today announced the launch of two new open-end mutual funds - the DWS International Value Opportunities Fund and the DWS RREEF Global Real Estate Securities Fund.  Both funds are designed to benefit from the combined investment expertise of the global DWS and DWS Scudder network.
DWS International Value Opportunities Fund invests in large-cap international equities, focusing on value stocks with a stable record of profitability. The management team is led by Klaus Kaldemorgen, who serves as Global Head of Equities for Deutsche Asset Management. Kaldemorgen is a 24-year veteran of DWS in Germany and one of Europe's most respected mutual fund managers. He is responsible for all equity fund management at DWS Investments and is a member of the Executive Board of DWS.  Until now, Kaldemorgen's fund management expertise was only accessible through funds available in Europe.  DWS International Value Opportunities Fund combines extensive international management expertise with strict valuation measures to create a portfolio of 50 to 70 international value stocks for US investors.
DWS RREEF Global Real Estate Securities Fund invests in domestic and international equity securities of real estate investment trusts (REITs) and companies engaged in the real estate industry, with an emphasis on stocks with appreciation potential and a record of paying dividends.  The fund combines a top-down regional allocation process with an active bottom-up approach to selecting securities. The portfolio is managed by RREEF (RREEF America L.L.C.), one of the world's leading managers for both public and private real estate. Under the direction of Global Portfolio Manager John Robertson, DWS RREEF Global Real Estate Securities Fund is managed by four established regional investment teams with local expertise in the Americas, Europe, Australia and Asia.
"The addition of DWS International Value Opportunities Fund and DWS RREEF Global Real Estate Securities Fund to the DWS product line-up offers US investors the experience and global perspective of two of Deutsche Asset Management's most successful businesses - DWS and RREEF," said Axel Schwarzer, chief executive officer of DWS Scudder. "With Klaus Kaldemorgen and John Robertson at the helm of these two funds, we are delighted to provide US investors with the opportunity to tap into our global investment expertise and skills of these particular managers."
DWS Investments is the mutual fund arm of Deutsche Asset Management in Europe. In the US, the mutual fund business is branded DWS Scudder.  DWS is the largest mutual fund company in its home country, Germany, with EUR 116.9 billion assets under management (as of 5/31/06).  
The funds are subject to stock market risk. REIT investments can be affected by interest-rate moves, economic cycles, and tax and regulatory requirements. Additionally, investing in foreign securities presents certain unique risks not associated with domestic investments, such as currency fluctuation, political and economic changes and market risks. This may result in greater share price volatility. Please read the prospectus for specific details regarding the fund's risk profile.

Reducing risk with diversification

Key Points

Diversification vs. Asset Allocation
Putting Concepts to Work
Diversifying by Investment Type or Style
Points to Remember

Diversification is a basic concept that’s critical to building a portfolio able to withstand the test of time. It is the process of spreading your money among a variety of securities to reduce exposure to any one investment or asset class. The premise behind diversification is easy to grasp: When you diversify across a range of investments, you may reduce risk by creating the potential for better performers to compensate for poor performers.
Effective diversification involves more than simply owning a jumble of different investments. It means selecting a mix of securities that may not react the same to a given set of conditions — investments that carry a low "correlation" to one another. Correlation is a statistical measure of the degree to which two securities perform the same under particular market conditions. For instance, if you choose stocks of two companies that make the same product and serve the same market, chances are that they will move in tandem when conditions affecting their industry change. Owning both would be unlikely to lower risk in your portfolio. Alternatively, owning stocks of companies that operate in different segments of the economy may help improve your risk-adjusted return, although past performance is no guarantee of future results (see chart).
Diversifying by Industry1

As this chart demonstrates, combining stocks from different industries or sectors — financial services, telecommunications services, and health care in this case — may potentially result in a portfolio that has less risk than the individual industries or sectors. Of course, the portfolio may also have somewhat lower returns than some of the individual industries or sectors — a trade-off that long-term investors may be willing to make. 
Diversification vs. Asset Allocation
On its most basic level, diversification can be applied to asset classes — allocating your investments among the three fundamental asset classes: stocks, bonds, and cash. Your asset allocation is the percentage of money you decide to put into each asset class based on your goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon. Technically speaking, asset allocation may potentially reduce market risk; diversification potentially reduces company-specific risk. Together, they may help reduce portfolio volatility over time. Keep in mind that neither diversification nor asset allocation guarantees against investment losses.
Both asset allocation and diversification are particularly important when a market takes an unexpected downturn. In such a shift, some investments are inevitably affected more than others and the overall effect of a downturn on a diversified portfolio may potentially be mitigated. Consider the investor who invested 100% in information technology stocks from January 1, 2001, through December 31, 2002, as represented by the total returns of the S&P 500 Information Technology Index. He would have lost approximately 53% of his investment. If the same investor had diversified his holdings to encompass a broad representation of all stocks by investing, for instance, in an index fund that paralleled the S&P 500 Index, he would have lost about 31% over this period. If the same investor had further diversified his portfolio by allocating 20% to cash and 30% to long-term U.S. bonds and invested the remainder in the same index fund, he would have narrowed his losses to about 9%.1
Putting Concepts to Work
The first step in building a diversified portfolio is to determine your asset allocation. How you diversify your portfolio among stocks, bonds, and cash will depend upon your specific goals, your time horizon, and your risk tolerance. A financial advisor can help you determine an allocation that suits your specific needs. You’ll also want to revisit your asset allocation on an annual basis, making appropriate alterations depending upon your goals.
With your allocations determined, you’re ready to begin choosing investments for each asset class. Here, you have two basic options. The first is to research and assemble individual securities for your stock, bond, and cash allocations. Taking this route, however, can require a significant amount of research. In addition, you would need to commit adequate time to monitor and manage the individual securities.
Alternatively, you could diversify by selecting a mix of mutual funds or exchange-traded funds. Because they hold baskets of securities, such pooled funds provide instant diversification, although the degree of diversification varies depending upon each fund’s investment strategy. A fund that replicated a broad market benchmark such as the S&P 500 would provide greater diversification than a fund specializing in one sector of the economy, such as utilities or health care.
Diversifying by Investment Type or Style
Within the different asset classes, you can also diversify your holdings by investment type or style. For stocks, there are a number of different styles to choose from: growth vs. value, large-cap vs. small-cap, domestic vs. foreign, or by sector or industry group. These and other style groups are all represented by numerous mutual funds and may react differently to market circumstances.
For bonds, there are many different types to select from. You may choose to diversify by type (government, agency, municipal, corporate), maturity, credit quality, or specific bond features, keeping in mind that different bonds react differently to market interest rates and other factors.
However you choose to diversify your portfolio, remember that diversification works two ways. Although it can cushion the impact of a falling market, it can also dilute returns on the upside. Ultimately, you should balance your degree of diversification with your overall appetite for risk.

Risk Considerations
Investments in mutual funds involve risk. Stocks may decline in value. Bond investments are subject to interest-rate, credit, liquidity and market risks to varying degrees. Credit risk refers to the ability of an issuer to make timely payments of principal and interest. Investing in derivatives entails special risks relating to liquidity, leverage and credit that may reduce returns and/or increase volatility. Investing in foreign securities, particularly those of emerging markets, presents certain risks, such as currency fluctuations, political and economic changes, and market risks. There are additional risks associated with investing in commodities, high-yield bonds, aggressive growth stocks, non-diversified/concentrated funds and small- and mid-cap stocks which are more fully explained in the prospectuses. Please read the prospectus for more information.

7 Past performance is not indicative of future results. 8 There is no guarantee that RREEF Property Trust will pay distributions or achieve its stated objectives. 9 Some states have additional suitability requirements.

RREEF Property Trust 








For years, institutional investors have invested in real estate to help enhance diversification5, offset volatility, increase income and meet overall portfolio objectives. With RREEF Property Trust, retail investors now have access to a fully diversified core real estate strategy that blends:

High quality, income-producing office, industrial, retail and multifamily properties in primary and secondary markets across the U.S. (up to 80% allocation)
Common and preferred stock of exchange-traded REITs and other real estate companies (up to 35% allocation)
Loans backed principally by real estate (up to 15% allocation)
Cash and cash equivalents (up to 10% allocation)

 




 
5 Diversification does not assure a profit or protect against loss in a declining market. Properties pictured are owned by RREEF Property Trust.










 
A robust investment process 








RREEF Property Trust employs a disciplined, institutional investment process to real estate investing seeking to deliver attractive current income and meet our investment objectives. With an emphasis on proprietary research and market intelligence, this rigorous investment process is designed to capitalize on the ability to identify themes, monitor and anticipate trends impacting the real estate asset class and implement appropriate and timely tactical strategies.
There is no guarantee that RREEF Property Trust will pay distributions or achieve its started objectives.
