Read Bio







Founded in 1969 and based in Philadelphia, the experts at Mitchell Sinkler & Starr provide investment services to individuals and families, trusts and estates, as well as foundations and non-profit organizations.
Independent and employee-owned, our goal-based investment advice is tailored to the unique objectives of each client.  Our personalized approach provides our clients with realistic, long-term investing expectations and leads to long-term relationships.





Putting Our Clients’ Investment Needs First



Held to a Higher Standard
Mitchell Sinkler & Starr's experienced portfolio managers provide tailored investment advice for clients throughout the United States and several foreign countries.  In many cases, we manage accounts for multiple generations of extended families.  As an SEC-Registered Investment Advisor (RIA), we are held to the highest ethical and fiduciary standards.  We are paid for our services only by our clients and only invest on an account-by-account basis.  Each client's assets stand alone and are never commingled with other accounts.




Understanding Every Client
Mitchell Sinkler & Starr's portfolio managers build long-term relationships with their clients based on a foundation of trust, communication, service, and sound investment advice.  For most clients, investing and growing assets over time is not simply a matter of facts and figures.  Whether the goal is to pay for retirement or fund a grandchild's education, many non-financial issues – emotions, aspirations – become part of the conversation.  This collaborative planning is a key contributor to our clients' long-term success in reaching their goals.






“Several generations of clients have trusted us to help them achieve their long-term 
  investing goals”


An Integrated Investment Philosophy and Process
We are long-term investors.  However, our clients typically have more than one account invested with us and often have short-, intermediate-, and long-term investing goals and objectives.  Therefore, our process begins with understanding the specific needs of each client and each account.  Working collaboratively, we help define each account's goals, time horizon, income requirements, and risk tolerance.  The resultant diversified portfolios are then constructed primarily with an appropriate mix of high-quality individual stocks, bonds, and money market funds.

 Mitchell Sinkler & Starr's Investment Management Process
Personalized separate account management
For over 45 years, Mitchell Sinkler & Starr has provided clients with individualized, goal-based, separate account management.  We manage only on an account-by-account basis and do not offer investment 'products.'  Our clients' assets stand alone and are never commingled with other accounts.  The majority of our accounts are advisory, i.e., portfolio changes require client approval.  However, we also manage discretionary accounts–where the client grants us discretion to make portfolio changes based on a clear understanding of their goals, objectives, and constraints.  We offer custody services, and while most of our clients take advantage of this service, we also manage accounts that are custodied at over twenty other financial institutions.  We are paid for our services only by our clients and our advisory fees are low by industry standards.


"Clear goals and realistic expectations can lead to 
  long-term investment success."


Goal-based portfolio management
Mitchell Sinkler & Starr's management process begins, in every instance, with understanding the specific needs of each client and each account.  Working collaboratively, we define each account's goals, time horizon, income needs, and risk tolerance.  From this analysis we construct diversified portfolios with an appropriate mix of high-quality individual stocks, bonds, and money market funds.  Equities provide the potential for long-term growth of principal and most accounts will hold an appropriate mix of 'growth' and 'value' stocks.  Portfolios may also hold positions in low-cost exchange-traded funds (ETFs), often for additional international exposure.  Investments in individual fixed income securities are used to provide income and principal stability, while money market funds offer liquidity. We do not invest client assets in mutual funds.  


Outstanding service leads to long-term relationships
Mitchell Sinkler & Starr's experienced portfolio managers are more than just investment advisors; we become a trusted partner and valued resource, as well as a friend, on a journey that can last decades.  This is reflected in both the very low turnover of clients as well as employees.  Utilizing face-to-face meetings, phone calls, and email, we engage our clients as often as they like, in the ways that suit them best.  Often, our role as investment advisor and portfolio manager is just the beginning, as our advice can extend into basic financial planning.  We also regularly interact with our clients' accountants and lawyers.

What are analysts saying about Pfizer stock?

Here are some recent quotes from research analysts about Pfizer stock: 
1. According to Zacks Investment Research, "Pfizer has been working on strengthening its product portfolio as well as key pipeline milestones through acquisitions and licensing deals. New products like Ibrance and contribution from acquisitions are expected to drive revenues. Also, cost-savings and share buybacks should help Pfizer achieve its earnings guidance. Investor focus will remain on the stock as Pfizer has several key pipeline milestones in 2017. However, genericization of key drugs, lost alliance revenues, pricing pressure and rising competition remain potent headwinds. Mounting competition in the immuno-oncology market is also a significant concern. Meanwhile, Pfizer’s shares have underperformed the large-cap pharma industry this year so far. The company has a mixed record of earnings surprises in recent quarters. Estimates have remained stable ahead of its Q2 earnings release. " (7/14/2017)
2. BMO Capital Markets analysts commented, "We are highly confident the deal will close as the purchase agreement removes IP risk and development risks, and creates significant shareholder value. We believe there is minimal risk for the deal being blocked due to anti-trust considerations CTP-543 Phase IIa initiated with top-line results expected 1Q18. The phase IIa trial will enroll approximately 100 patients spread across 4 active arms of differing doses (4, 8, 12 and 16 mg BID) and a placebo comparator. The primary endpoint for the trial will be measured using the severity of alopecia tool (SALT) after patients undergo 24 weeks of dosing. An additional 28 weeks of dosing of CTP-543 is planned for all patients enrolled in the study. If successfully developed, we anticipate a significant pricing discount for CTP-543 relative to Jakafi – owned by Incyte (INCY, Non-Rated). The earlier delay to initiate the trial due to clinical supply delays, which lasted around 2 months, has been resolved." (4/27/2017)
3. UBS AG analysts commented, " The FDA approved Novartis' CDK4/6 agent, Kisqali (ribociclib), in first-line treatment for HR+/HER2- metastatic breast cancer in combo with any aromatase inhibitor. Recall that MONALEESA-2 was stopped early, and while interim data demonstrated a reduction in risk of disease progression or death by 44% over letrozole alone, the mPFS had not been reached at the time. For the first time, the label presented a mPFS of 25.3 mos for Kisqali + letrozole vs 16 mos for letrozole alone. The 9.3 mos improvement over letrozole is essentially comparable to 10.3 mos improvement (24.8 mos for Ibrance vs 14.5 mos for letrozole) for Pfizer's Ibrance. Given the strong interim data that were comparable to Ibrance, we believe the approval of Kisqali was largely expected. Our takeaway: Label looks a little worse than Ibrance. Overall, we think the label looks slightly worse, particularly on safety. On the positive, the label is broader, as the indication is for use of Kisqali in combo with anyaromatase inhibitors (vs Ibrance in combo with letrozole). However, as the vast majority of first-line use letrozole, the broader label shouldn't meaningfully impact Ibrance, in our view. We're not clear on how Kisqali got the broader label, but we think this could be encouraging for Ibrance, as the Ibrance label could also become as broad with the potential April approval of the confirmatory Phase 3 PALOMA-2 (Ibrance was approved under an accelerated pathway with Phase 2 PALOMA-1 data). On safety, the Kisqali label warns of QT prolongation and liver tox, which are not in the Ibrance label. We think the QT issue could put Kisqali at a disadvantage. Thoughts on the stock: Shouldn't impact the stock much, if anyIbrance has been on the market for ~2 years and has made significant headway to becoming a standard of therapy, and we do not believe there was anything in the Kisqali label that would meaningfully impact the significant lead that Pfizer has. In our CDK4/6 model, we assign a 5% share for Kisqali in 2017 that goes to 15%, 18%, and 20% in 2018-2020E." (3/14/2017)
4. Jefferies Group LLC analysts commented, "We wanted to highlight a key data catalyst in which a positive outcome can drive shares higher: PIIa data for XEN801 for mod-to-severe acne in the latter part of Q1 (JEF est: ~Mar). We continue to like the risk/reward going into the data, especially on the heels of Dermira’s positive PIIb data for DRM01, which operates on the same pathway but more upstream. Reiterating Buy and $13 PT. Highlighting Key PIIa Data Catalyst in Latter Part of Q1: We wanted to take the opportunity to highlight a key data catalyst in which a positive outcome can drive shares higher: topline PIIa data catalyst for XEN801 for moderate-to-severe acne in the latter part of Q1 (JEF estimate: ~Mar). We previously conducted a review on XEN801 in April ’16, which can be found here, and now that the data catalyst is drawing near, we wanted to take the chance to highlight it again. To recap, the PIIa trial is a randomized, double- blind, multicentre, vehicle-controlled trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of patients with moderate-to-severe acne. The trial will compare XEN801 topical gel (1%) and matching placebo gel for 12 weeks with a 4-week follow-up. XENE has randomized 165 patients (v. 150 that was planned at conception), and has 85% power (v. 80% previously) to detect a ~16% difference." (1/19/2017)

Analyst Ratings
Consensus Ratings for Pfizer (NYSE:PFE) (How are Consensus Ratings Calculated?) MarketBeat calculates consensus ratings using the most recent rating from each brokerage that has rated a stock within the last twelve months. Since brokers often use different ratings systems, each rating is normalized to a standardized rating score of 1 (sell), 2 (hold), 3 (buy) or 4 (strong buy). Consensus ratings scores are calculated using the mean average of the number of normalized sell, hold, buy and strong buy ratings. Each stock's consensus rating is derived from its calculated consensus ratings score (0-1.5 = Sell, 1.5-2.5 = Hold, 2.5-3.5 = Buy, >3.5 = Strong Buy). MarketBeat's consensus price targets are a mean average of the most recent available price targets set by each analyst that has set a price target for the stock in the last twelve months.MarketBeat will no longer include ratings and price target data in its consensus calculation if a broker drops coverage and MarketBeat has received a report that coverage was dropped. Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.Ratings Breakdown: 1 Sell Rating, 9 Hold Ratings, 9 Buy RatingsConsensus Rating:Hold (Score: 2.42)Consensus Price Target: $38.00 (13.50% upside)

CA Inc. (NASDAQ:CA) was downgraded by Zacks Investment Research from a “buy” rating to a “hold” rating in a report released on Monday. 
According to Zacks, “CA is a leading information technology (IT) management software company. We are optimistic about CA’s acquisition strategy, which has enhanced its IT management, software and services portfolio. Moreover, we believe that the diversity of its products and the increased efficiency offered by them will attract customers across sectors, lending stability to its business model. Additionally, CA’s “go to market” sales strategy integrates the commercial functions of sales, marketing, brand management, pricing and consumer insight, which helps it in lowering costs, thereby improving the bottom line. Nonetheless, intensifying competition from peers, an uncertain economic environment, currency headwinds and the weak IT spending forecast by Gartner are other concerns. Notably, shares of the company has underperformed the broader market over the last one year period.”
Several other equities analysts have also recently weighed in on CA. Citigroup Inc.  reissued a “neutral” rating and set a $34.00 price objective (up previously from $33.00) on shares of CA in a research report on Sunday, May 14th. DA Davidson  reissued a “neutral” rating and set a $12.00 price objective on shares of CA in a research report on Friday, May 19th. BidaskClub cut CA from a “hold” rating to a “sell” rating in a research report on Saturday, July 1st. Raymond James Financial, Inc.  reissued a “market perform” rating on shares of CA in a research report on Thursday, June 22nd. Finally, Sanford C. Bernstein  reissued an “underperform” rating and set a $28.00 price objective on shares of CA in a research report on Wednesday, June 28th. Four equities research analysts have rated the stock with a sell rating, eight have assigned  a hold rating and five have given a buy rating to the stock. CA currently has an average rating of “Hold” and an average price target of $35.10.




Shares of CA (NASDAQ CA) opened at 34.06 on Monday. The company’s 50 day moving average price is $33.34 and its 200 day moving average price is $32.43. The stock has a market capitalization of $14.23 billion, a P/E ratio of 18.41 and a beta of 0.87. CA has a one year low of $30.01 and a one year high of $36.54. 
CA (NASDAQ:CA) last released its quarterly earnings results on Thursday, May 11th. The technology company reported $0.54 earnings per share (EPS) for the quarter, topping the consensus estimate of $0.49 by $0.05. The company had revenue of $1.01 billion during the quarter, compared to the consensus estimate of $996.59 million. CA had a return on equity of 17.15% and a net margin of 19.20%.

				Philadelphia, PA 19102
                
215.665.1450















 45 Years of Personalized Investment Advice and Service

We are pleased to announce Heather Flick McMeekin joined Mitchell Sinkler & Starr as a
portfolio manager on January 26, 2015.
Read Bio







Founded in 1969 and based in Philadelphia, the experts at Mitchell Sinkler & Starr provide investment services to individuals and families, trusts and estates, as well as foundations and non-profit organizations.
Independent and employee-owned, our goal-based investment advice is tailored to the unique objectives of each client.  Our personalized approach provides our clients with realistic, long-term investing expectations and leads to long-term relationships.





Putting Our Clients’ Investment Needs First



Held to a Higher Standard
Mitchell Sinkler & Starr's experienced portfolio managers provide tailored investment advice for clients throughout the United States and several foreign countries.  In many cases, we manage accounts for multiple generations of extended families.  As an SEC-Registered Investment Advisor (RIA), we are held to the highest ethical and fiduciary standards.  We are paid for our services only by our clients and only invest on an account-by-account basis.  Each client's assets stand alone and are never commingled with other accounts.




Understanding Every Client
Mitchell Sinkler & Starr's portfolio managers build long-term relationships with their clients based on a foundation of trust, communication, service, and sound investment advice.  For most clients, investing and growing assets over time is not simply a matter of facts and figures.  Whether the goal is to pay for retirement or fund a grandchild's education, many non-financial issues – emotions, aspirations – become part of the conversation.  This collaborative planning is a key contributor to our clients' long-term success in reaching their goals.






“Several generations of clients have trusted us to help them achieve their long-term 
  investing goals”


An Integrated Investment Philosophy and Process
We are long-term investors.  However, our clients typically have more than one account invested with us and often have short-, intermediate-, and long-term investing goals and objectives.  Therefore, our process begins with understanding the specific needs of each client and each account.  Working collaboratively, we help define each account's goals, time horizon, income requirements, and risk tolerance.  The resultant diversified portfolios are then constructed primarily with an appropriate mix of high-quality individual stocks, bonds, and money market funds.
