	CAUTIONARY STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING
	INFORMATION



	 


	This report includes forward-looking statements
	that relate to future events or our future financial performance and involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors
	that may cause our actual results, levels of activity, performance or achievements to differ materially from any future results,
	levels of activity, performance or achievements expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements. Words such as, but not
	limited to, “believe,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “estimate,” “intend,”
	“plan,” “targets,” “likely,” “aim,” “will,” “would,” “could,”
	and similar expressions or phrases identify forward-looking statements. We have based these forward-looking statements largely
	on our current expectations and future events and financial trends that we believe may affect our financial condition, results
	of operation, business strategy and financial needs. Forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements about:


	  




	 



	·



	our lack of significant revenues and history of losses,








	 



	·



	our ability to continue as a going concern,








	 



	·



	our ability to raise additional working capital as necessary,








	 



	·



	our ability to satisfy our obligations as they become due,








	 



	·



	the failure to successfully commercialize our product or sustain market acceptance,








	 



	·



	the reliance on third party agreements and relationships for development of our business,








	 



	·



	the control exercised by our management,








	 



	·



	the impact of government regulation on our business,








	 



	·



	our ability to effectively compete,








	 



	·



	the possible inability to effectively protect our intellectual property,








	 



	·



	the lack of a public market for our securities and the impact of the penny stock rules on trading in our common stock should a public market ever be established.




	 




	You should read thoroughly this report and the
	documents that we refer to herein with the understanding that our actual future results may be materially different from and/or
	worse than what we expect. We qualify all of our forward-looking statements by these cautionary statements including those made
	in this report, in Part I. Item 1A. Risk Factors appearing in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015
	and our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Other sections of this report include additional factors which
	could adversely impact our business and financial performance. New risk factors emerge from time to time and it is not possible
	for our management to predict all risk factors, nor can we assess the impact of all factors on our business or the extent to which
	any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking
	statements. Except for our ongoing obligations to disclose material information under the Federal securities laws, we undertake
	no obligation to release publicly any revisions to any forward-looking statements, to report events or to report the occurrence
	of unanticipated events. These forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this report, and you should not rely on
	these statements without also considering the risks and uncertainties associated with these statements and our business.

	(FORMERLY ID GLOBAL SOLUTIONS CORPORATION)






	NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
	STATEMENTS



	 



	NOTE 1 – BASIS OF PRESENTATION




	 



	In the opinion of the Company, the accompanying
	unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with instructions for Form 10-Q, include all adjustments
	(consisting only of normal recurring accruals) which we considered as necessary for a fair presentation of the results for the
	periods presented. Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in the consolidated financial statements prepared
	in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America have been condensed or omitted. It
	is suggested that these condensed consolidated financial statements be read in conjunction with the Company's Annual Report on
	Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. The results of operations for the three months ended March 31, 2016 are not necessarily
	indicative of the results to be expected for future periods or the full year.


	 


	The condensed consolidated financial statements
	include the accounts of Ipsidy Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries MultiPay S.A.S., ID Global LATAM, IDGS S.A.S., ID Solutions,
	Inc., FIN Holdings, Inc., and Cards Plus Pty Ltd. (the "Company"). All significant intercompany balances and transactions
	have been eliminated in consolidation.



	 




	Net Income or Loss per Common Share





	 




	The Company computes net income or loss per
	share in accordance with FASB ASC 260, "Earnings per Share". ASC 260 requires presentation of both basic and diluted
	earnings per share (EPS) on the face of the statement of operations. Basic EPS is computed by dividing net income (loss) available
	to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted EPS gives effect
	to all dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period including stock options, using the treasury stock method,
	and convertible notes and stock warrants, using the if-converted method. In computing diluted EPS, the average stock price for
	the period is used in determining the number of shares assumed to be purchased from the exercise of stock options, warrants and
	conversion of convertible notes. Diluted EPS excludes all dilutive potential common shares if their effect is anti-dilutive. The
	following table illustrates the computation of basic and diluted EPS:

	Going concern



	 


	As of March 31, 2016, the Company has a working
	capital and accumulated deficit of approximately $14.4 million and $31.4 million respectively. For the three months ended March
	31, 2016, the Company earned revenue of approximately $321,000 and incurred an operating loss of approximately $4.3 million.


	 


	These condensed consolidated financial statements
	have been prepared on a going concern basis, which implies the Company will continue to meet its obligations and continue its operations
	for the next fiscal year. The continuation of the Company as a going concern is dependent upon financial support from the Company’s
	current shareholders, the ability of the Company to obtain additional equity financing to continue operations, the Company’s
	ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operations, successfully locating and negotiating with other business entities for
	potential acquisition and /or acquiring new clients to generate revenues and cash flows.


	 


	There is no assurance that the Company will
	ever be profitable. These condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future
	effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classifications of liabilities that may result should
	the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.


	 



	Inventories



	 


	Inventories of kiosks held by IDGS S.A.S
	are stated at the lower of cost (using the first-in, first-out method) or market. The kiosks provide electronic ticketing for transit
	systems. Inventory of plastic/ID cards, digital printing material, which are held by Card Plus Pty Ltd., are stated at the lower
	of cost (using the average method) or market. The plastic/ID cards and digital printing material are used to provide plastic loyalty,
	ID and other types of cards.


	 



	Income Taxes




	 



	The Company accounts for income taxes
	under Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 740
	“Income Taxes.” Under the asset and liability method of FASB ASC 740, deferred tax assets and liabilities are
	recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of
	existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using
	enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be
	recovered or settled. Under FASB ASC 740, the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is
	recognized in income in the period the enactment occurs. A valuation allowance is provided for certain deferred tax assets if
	it is more likely than not that the Company will not realize tax assets through future operations. For the quarter ending
	March 31, 2016, there is no provision for income tax as the Company had tax loss for United States and foreign activities.
	The Company’s gain on derivative liability during the quarter ended March 31, 2016, is not taxable.



	 




	NOTE 2

	–

	FIN HOLDINGS ACQUISITION



	 


	On February 8, 2016, the Company entered into
	a Share Exchange Agreement with Fin Holdings, Inc., a Florida corporation ("FIN"), and all of the FIN shareholders (the
	"FIN Shareholders"), pursuant to which the Company acquired 100% of the issued and outstanding shares of FIN (the "FIN
	Shares") and FIN's two wholly-owned subsidiaries, ID Solutions, Inc. and Cards Plus Pty Ltd. (collectively, the "Subsidiaries"),
	from the FIN Shareholders. In consideration for the FIN Shares, the Company issued and sold to the FIN Shareholders an aggregate
	of 22,500,000 shares of common stock of the Company (the "Purchase Shares") at a per share price of $0.40 or $9,000,000.
	The closing occurred on February 8, 2016.

	In accordance
	with ASC 805, “Business Combinations”, the Company accounted for the acquisition of FIN as a business combination of
	FIN using the acquisition method of accounting. The purchase price was allocated to specific identifiable tangible and intangible
	assets at their respective fair values at the date of acquisition.




	 




	The following
	table summarizes the total fair value of the consideration transferred as well as the fair values of the assets and liabilities
	assumed.

	Goodwill is calculated as the excess of the

	of the reporting hierarchy to Company management.


	 


	The condensed consolidated financial statements
	for the three months ended March 31, 2016 includes FIN’s results for the period from the date of acquisition to March 31,
	2016. FIN Holdings Revenue and net loss included in the consolidated results of operations for the three months ended March 31,
	2016, was approximately $273,000 and $71,000, respectively.



	 









	The following unaudited pro forma financial information gives effect

	presented as derivative liabilities at their fair values. See Note 8. The Company also incurred debt issuance costs of
	$124,500, which are presented as a discount against the note and amortized into interest expense over the term of the note.
	During the three months ended March 31, 2016, one note holder elected to convert a note of $20,000 and accrued interest of

	NOTE 8 –DERIVATIVE LIABLITY



	 


	Due to the potential adjustment in the conversion
	price associated with certain of the convertible debentures and the potential adjustment in the exercise price of certain of the
	warrants, the Company has determined that certain conversion features and warrants are derivative liabilities.


	 


	The fair values of the embedded conversion
	features and the warrants are estimated and recorded as derivative liabilities on the date of issuance, offset by a discount on
	the related convertible note payable up to the face amount of the note, with any excess fair value recorded as derivative expense
	on the date of issuance. The Company’s convertible debt is convertible into common stock at conversion rates that vary based
	on the trading prices of the Company’s common stock. Accordingly, the conversion feature is required to be presented at fair
	value on the dates of issuance, settlement, and at each reporting date. The Company also has warrants to purchase common stock
	outstanding that provide for adjustments to the exercise prices upon the future dilutive issuances. The Company utilizes Monte
	Carlo simulations and stochastic forecasting to estimate the fair value of the warrants and conversion options. The ranges of assumptions
	utilized in estimating the fair value of the warrants and conversion options during
	the three months ended March 31, 2016, are as follows:


	 






	Expected Volatility


	 


	74% to 87%




	Expected Term


	 


	0.3 to 5.0 Years




	Risk Free Rate


	 


	0.21% to 1.60%




	Dividend Rate


	 


	0.00%

	50% - 75%

	Other







	 




	In connection with the Company’s ability
	to secure third-party financing, the Company issued Network 1 Financial Securities, Inc. (“Network 1”), a registered
	broker-dealer, 190,000 shares of common stock of the Company in accordance with its agreement in the first quarter of 2016. A member
	of the Company’s Board of Directors previously maintained a partnership with a key principal of Network 1. In addition to
	the fee paid, the agreement calls for Network 1 to receive an 8% commission of the total amount of proceeds from any financing
	it secures for the Company.

	NOTE 12 – SUBSEQUENT EVENTS




	 



	On April 19, 2016, the Company entered
	into and closed on several Securities Purchase Agreements with accredited investors (the "April 2016 Accredited
	Investors") pursuant to which the Company borrowed an aggregate of $1,550,000 in consideration of Secured Convertible
	Debentures and common stock purchase warrants to acquire an aggregate of 6,200,000 shares of common stock exercisable for a
	period of five years at an exercise price of $0.25 subject to antidilution protection. However, the exercise price shall be
	adjusted to equal the conversion price or the per share purchase price of the Company's next offering in the minimum amount
	of $5,000,000 if such price is less than $0.25 (the "Adjustment Price") and the number of shares of common stock
	issuable upon exercise of the warrants shall be adjusted to equal the consideration paid by the April 2016 Accredited
	Investors by the Adjustment Price. The Company also issued 1,033,337 shares of common stock to the noteholders. The Secured
	Convertible Debentures bear interest of 12% and are payable on the six (6) month anniversary of the Secured Convertible
	Debentures (“October 2016”). The conversion price shall be adjusted to equal the Adjustment Price less a 20%
	discount if such Adjustment Price is less than $0.25 per share. The Secured Convertible Debentures are secured by 18,235,295
	issued and outstanding shares of common stock of the Company held by certain shareholders of the Company
	(the "Pledgors") pursuant to stock pledge agreements entered into between the April 2016 Accredited Investors and
	the Pledgors. Each of the April 2016 Accredited Investors have individually agreed to restrict their ability to convert
	the Secured Convertible Debentures or exercise their Common Stock Purchase Warrants and receive shares of common stock such
	that the number of shares of common stock held by them and their affiliates after such conversion or exercise does not
	exceed 4.99% of the then issued and outstanding shares of common stock. In connection with this private offering, the Company
	paid Network 1 Financial Securities, Inc., a registered broker-dealer, a cash fee of $124,000 and issued 1,240,000 shares
	of common stock of the Company (See Note 9). On August 10, 2016, the Company and the April 2016 Accredited Investors
	entered into a Letter Agreement whereby the conversion price of the Secured Convertible Debentures was reduced to $0.10
	in consideration of the removal of certain price protection features in such Secured Convertible Debentures. Further,
	the exercise price of such Common Stock Purchase Warrant was reduced to $0.10 per share and the number of shares upon
	exercise of the Common Stock Purchase Warrant was increased to 15,500,000. This note and accrued interest was converted into common stock of the Company on January 31, 2017
	(see below).


	 


	From August 10, 2016 through August 26,
	2016, the Company entered into and closed Subscription Agreements with several accredited investors (the "August 2016
	Accredited Investors") pursuant to which the August 2016 Accredited Investors purchased an aggregate of 25,000,000
	shares of the Company's common stock (the "2016 Subscription Shares") for an aggregate purchase price of
	$1,250,000. In order to reduce the dilution to the other shareholders as a result of this private offering, certain
	shareholders of the Company including the Chief Executive Officer, directors and others agreed to return to the Company
	10,000,000 shares of common stock in the aggregate for cancellation. In connection with this private offering, the Company
	paid Network 1 Financial Securities, Inc., a registered broker-dealer, a cash fee of $100,000 and issued 2,000,000 shares of
	common stock of the Company (See Note 9).


	 


	On August 10, 2016, the Company issued to several
	of its employees and consultants stock options (the "Plan Options") under its Equity Compensation Plan to acquire an
	aggregate of 17,000,000 shares of common stock of the Company exercisable at $0.05 per share. The Plan Options contain vesting
	periods over 12 quarters commencing on October 1, 2016 as well as various vesting milestones. The Plan Options are exercisable for
	a period of ten years. Further, the Company amended existing stock options to acquire 50,800,000 shares of common stock under its
	Equity Compensation Plan to extend the term from five years to 10 years.


	 


	On August 10, 2016, the Company
	entered into an amended agreement (the "Amendment") with Parity Labs, LLC ("Parity") to amend the
	compensation section of an existing Advisory Agreement previously entered into between the Company and Parity on November 16,
	2015 for the provision of strategic advisory services. Pursuant to an Amendment, the Company issued to Parity the option (the
	"Parity Option") to acquire 20,000,000 shares of common stock of the Company, exercisable at $0.05 per share for a
	period of ten years. The Parity Option vests as to 10,000,000 shares of common stock immediately and then in 12 equal
	tranches of 833,333 shares per month commencing on September 1, 2016. Parity’s option vested in full upon Mr. Beck
	becoming CEO of Ipsidy in January 2017. Mr. Beck is the manager of Parity Labs.


	 


	From December 1, 2016 through December 27,
	2016, the Company entered into and closed Securities Purchase Agreements with several accredited investors (the
	"December 2016 Accredited Investors") pursuant to which the December 2016 Accredited Investors invested an
	aggregate of $1,275,000 (the "Offering") into the Company in consideration of Promissory Notes (the
	"Notes") and an aggregate of 1,912,500 shares of common stock. The Notes were payable one year from the date of
	issuance and bear interest of 10% per annum for the initial six months of the term of the Notes and 15% per annum for the
	remaining six months of the term of the Notes. The Notes could be prepaid in whole or in part by the Company at any time
	without penalty; provided, that any partial payment of principal was to be accompanied by payment of accrued interest to the
	date of prepayment. Any payment made to the December 2016 Accredited Investors which is not a full payment of all principal
	and interest on all of the Notes was to be made pro rata to the December 2016 Accredited Investors based on the respective
	principal amounts of the Notes. The Notes were converted into shares of common stock January 31, 2017 as more
	full described below.

	On December 30, 2016, ID Global LATAM S.A.S.
	(“IDG LATAM”), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, entered into a Contract for the Provision of Cash Collection
	Services (the "Contract") with Recaudo Bogota S.A.S. ("RB"), a Colombian company, pursuant to which the Company
	agreed to supply, maintain and provide platform services for 740 unattended payment collection and fare ticketing kiosks, in consideration
	of approximately $30 million dollars (excluding VAT) payable over the ten year period of the Contract. Pursuant to the contract
	IDG LATAM is required to obtain a performance bond from a financial institution in the amount of $6 million dollars.  In addition,
	IDG LATAM will need to obtain financing for the cost of the equipment to be supplied but has not as of the date hereof entered
	into a definitive agreement for such financing nor has the required performance bond been obtained.  



	On January 31, 2017, the
	Company converted then outstanding debt and accrued interest amount of approximately $6.3 million dollars into approximately
	84.8 million shares of common stock, $.0001 par value per share (“Common Stock’), at a conversion price of $0.10
	per share unless such conversion price was less than $0.10 per share.  Additionally,
	the exercise price of approximately 11.7 million warrants to acquire shares of Common Stock were reduced to $0.10 per
	share and certain price protection and anti-dilution provisions were removed. See Notes 6 and 7 related to all of
	the Company’s convertible debt and outstanding warrants.


	  


	On January 31, 2017, the Company entered into
	and closed a Securities Purchase Agreement with an accredited investor pursuant to which the Company borrowed $3,000,000 in consideration
	of a Senior Unsecured Note and an aggregate of 4,500,000 shares of Common Stock.  The Senior Unsecured Note matures in January
	2019 and bears interest at a rate of 10%. In connection with this private offering, the Company paid Network 1 Financial Securities,
	Inc., a registered broker-dealer, a cash fee of $120,000 and issued 1,020,000 shares of common stock of the Company.


	 


	On January 31, 2017, the Company engaged Philip
	D. Beck as Chief Executive Officer, President and Chairman of the Board of Directors and Stuart P. Stoller as Chief Financial Officer.
	In addition, Andras Vago, David Jones and Charles Albanese resigned as directors of the Company and Mr. Albanese also resigned
	as Chief Financial Officer. Thomas Szoke resigned as Chief Executive Officer and was engaged as Chief Technology Officer. Douglas
	Solomon resigned as Chief Operating Officer and was engaged as

	Executive Director, Government
	Relations and Enterprise Security.




	 




	In
	connection with the engagement of Philip D. Beck and Stuart P. Stoller,

	the Company granted Mr. Beck and Mr.
	Stoller, stock options to acquire 15 million shares and 5 million shares of common stock of the Company, respectively, at an
	exercise price of $0.10 per share for a period of ten years. Further, upon the Company being legally entitled to do so, the
	Company has agreed to enter a Restricted Stock Purchase Agreements with Mr. Beck and Mr. Stoller to sell 15 million shares
	and 5 million shares of common stock, respectively, at a per share price of $0.0001, which shares of common stock vest upon
	achieving a performance threshold.


	 


	Effective February 1, 2017, the Company amended
	its certificate of incorporation to change its legal name to “Ipsidy Inc.” from ID Global Solutions Corporation. The
	name change was effected pursuant to Section 242 of the Delaware Corporation Law (the “DGCL”). Under the DGCL, the
	amendment to the Company’s certificate of incorporation to effect the name change did not require stockholder approval. The
	name change does not affect the rights of the Company’s security holders. There were no other changes to the Company’s
	incorporation in connection with the name change.


	 




	On March 22, 2017, Ipsidy Inc. (the
	“Company”) entered into Subscription Agreements with several accredited investors (the “March 2017
	Accredited Investors”) pursuant to which the March 2017 Accredited Investors agreed to purchase an aggregate of
	20,000,000 shares of the Company’s common stock for an aggregate purchase price of $4,000,000. The Company has received
	proceeds of $3,170,000 as of March 22, 2017. An individual March 2017 Accredited Investor has agreed to fund $830,000 by
	April 30, 2017. In connection with this private offering, the Company paid Network 1 Financial Securities, Inc.
	(Network”), a registered broker-dealer, a cash fee of $240,000 and agreed to issue Network 1,000,000 shares of common
	stock of the Company upon increasing its authorized shares of common stock.









	 







	ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL
	CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS



	 


	Ipsidy Inc., together with its subsidiaries
	(the “Company”, “we” or “our”), is a provider of secure, biometric identification, identity
	management and electronic transaction processing services. Founded to pioneer innovative digital identification solutions, the
	Company is focused on addressing the growing need for highly secure and convenient methods for identity management during a variety
	of electronic transactions. The Company provides its biometric identification services to government and public sector organizations,
	seeking to verify and manage identities for a variety of security purposes, including issuing identity cards and exercise of rights
	such as voting in elections. With the acquisition of MultiPay S.A., or MultiPay, the Company acquired a transaction processing
	platform that offers secure multifunctional payment gateway services to merchants and financial institutions. With the development
	of the OnePay

	TM

	electronic payment solution the Company believes it will be able to combine its core technologies and
	use its platform to power a solution that will provide cost effective and secure means of financial inclusion for the un-banked
	and under banked population around the globe.


	 






	 



	18



	 







	 




	 


	With the acquisition of FIN, the Company acquired
	a proven cutting-edge biometric fingerprint software technology and algorithms, as well as Cards Plus Pty, a South African company
	which provides unique secure credit products and solutions to government customers in Africa. The acquisition enhances the Company’s
	Transaction Security and Financial Inclusion platforms with highly accurate, fully integrated biometric fingerprint verification
	and backend matching capabilities in addition to Cards Plus portfolio of physical card and card personalization solutions which
	allow for delivery to its customers a complete solution for identity programs and financial payment systems.


	 


	The Company is continuing to develop secure
	biometric identity management and electronic transaction solutions for international and domestic government, enterprise, and consumer
	markets. The Company’s products focus on two distinct yet complementary requirements, for which the Company believes there
	is significant market demand. One is the broad requirement for identity, access and transaction verification and associated identity
	management needs. The other is for providing cost effective and secure methods of conversion of cash and paper to electronic payments
	for the un-banked and under banked population, to enable them to participate in the digital economy there by facilitating financial
	inclusion. The Company has invested in developing, patenting and acquiring both hardware and software platforms, which are intended
	to address these specific market requirements.  


	 


	Management believes that one of the advantages
	of the Company’s platform approach is the ability to leverage the platform to support a variety of vertical markets in both
	the identity management and payment processing sectors and could be easily adapted to new markets requiring low cost, secure, and
	configurable solutions.  These vertical markets include but are not limited to border security, public safety, enterprise
	security, payment transactions and banking. The Company’s recent launch of unattended kiosks providing electronic ticketing
	for public transportation in Colombia, is a further example of the innovative solutions that the Company can offer. In addition,
	if the OnePay, closed loop, electronic payment service is successfully launched, the Company believes that it can be a cost effective
	solution for providing the un-banked access to secure electronic payment solutions. In this way the Company believes that the various
	technologies that the Company is developing and has acquired can be combined into a single offering, which at its core can facilitate
	the processing of electronic transactions, be they payments, votes, or identity verification.


	 


	The Company has solutions
	for fingerprint based identity management and electronic transaction processing in the market today. However, it is still in the
	process of integrating the technologies, which it has developed with those acquired via MultiPay and transactions completed in
	the last year and expanding these solutions to be able to better service our target markets. In order to achieve this integration
	and development, the Company needs to raise substantial additional capital. 


	 


	The Company was incorporated in the State of
	Delaware on September 21, 2011, and our common stock is traded on the OTC Markets under the trading symbol “IDGS”.
	Our corporate headquarters is located at 780 Long Beach Boulevard, Long Beach, New York 11561 and our main phone number is (407)
	951-8640.


	 



	Going concern



	 


	For the quarter ended March 31, 2016 the Company
	has revenue of approximately $321,000 and accumulated losses of approximately $31.4 million.


	 


	The reports of our independent registered public
	accounting firms on our consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 contained an explanatory
	paragraph regarding our ability to continue as a going concern based upon our net losses.


	 


	These consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a
	going concern basis, which implies the Company will continue to meet its obligations and continue its operations for the next fiscal
	year. The continuation of the Company as a going concern is dependent upon financial support from the Company’s current shareholders,
	the ability of the Company to obtain additional equity financing to continue operations, the Company’s ability to generate
	sufficient cash flows from operations, successfully locating and negotiating with other business entities for potential acquisition
	and /or acquiring new clients to generate revenues and cash flows.


	 


	There is no assurance that the Company will ever be profitable.
	These consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability
	and classification of assets or the amounts and classifications of liabilities that may result should the Company be unable to
	continue as a going concern.

	Three Month Period Ended March 31, 2016
	and 2015




	 




	Revenues, net



	 


	During the three months ended March 31, 2016,
	the Company had approximately $321,000 of revenue of which Cards Plus was $197,000, ID Solutions was $76,000, and the Colombian
	Operations was $48,000. The Company did not have revenue in the first quarter of 2015 as it had not yet acquired MultiPay and
	FIN.


	 



	Cost of sales




	 



	During the three months ended March
	31, 2016, costs of sales amounted to $118,000 which is principally attributable to the Cards Plus business acquired in the FIN
	Acquisition. Cost of sales in the three month period March 31, 2015 was zero as the Company had no revenue.


	 



	Operating Expenses




	 



	During the three months ended March 31, 2016
	compared to March 31, 2015, general and administrative expense increased approximately $.7 million dollars (excluding stock compensation
	expense of $3.2 million dollars) due in part to higher compensation expense as staff was added in the first quarter of 2016 to
	support the current and future operations and certain executives did not draw a salary in the first quarter of 2015.


	 


	During the quarter ended March 31, 2016,
	the Company recorded approximately $3.2 million for stock option compensation expense. There was no stock option compensation expense
	in the first quarter of 2015.


	 


	Depreciation and amortization expense increased
	approximately $92,000 in the quarter ended March 31, 2016 compared to March 31, 2015 as a result of the acquisitions of FIN and
	Multipay and their related assets acquired.


	 



	Other Income (Expense)




	 




	Derivative Liability



	 


	During 2015,
	the Company recorded an expense of $26.6 million for the derivative liability associated with potential adjustments in the
	conversion price associated with certain convertible debentures and warrants that were used to finance the business. As a
	result of the March 31, 2016 valuation of these derivatives, the Company reduced the value of the liability and recorded a
	benefit of $12.9 million. The decline in the derivative liability is associated with the decline in stock price.


	 



	Interest expense



	 


	Interest expense increased
	$0.9 million in the three months ended March 31, 2016 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2015 due to higher levels of
	debt outstanding.


	 



	Liquidity and Capital Resources




	 



	Liquidity is the ability of a company
	to generate sufficient cash to satisfy its needs for cash. As of March 31, 2016, the Company had approximately $1.3 million
	and $15.7 million of current assets and current liabilities respectively. Current liabilities include $12.3 million related
	to the derivative liability, $1.8 million of promissory and convertible notes payable, (see subsequent events in consolidated
	financial statements). The Company has an accumulated deficit of approximately $31.4 million.


	 


	Net cash used in operating activities was principally
	related to making investments in personnel and infrastructure as the Company is seeking to monetize the assets it owns.


	 


	The Company raised $100,000 of additional financing
	in the first three months of 2016 and conserved cash by issuing common stock to pay for certain services.


	 


	Additionally, in the acquisition of FIN Holdings
	by issuing common stock, cash of approximately $.4 million became available to the Company.


	 


	As of March 31, 2016, and the date of
	this report, we expect to incur ongoing expenditures related to developing the technology and services we will offer. Our
	current cash position will not be sufficient to support our development. The success of our business plan is contingent
	upon us obtaining additional financing. See subsequent events in consolidated financial statements.


	 






	 



	20



	 







	 




	 


	We intend to fund operations through debt and/or
	equity financing arrangements, which may be insufficient to fund our capital expenditures, working capital, or other cash requirements.
	Our current set of investors and interested parties have provided financing to support the business.


	 


	We do not have any formal commitments or arrangements
	for the sales of stock or the advancement or loan of funds at this time. There can be no assurance that such additional financing
	will be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. Our failure to obtain financing would have a material adverse effect on
	our business.



	 








	Subsequent Events



	 


	On January 31, 2017, the Company converted
	its outstanding debt and accrued interest of approximately $6.3 million dollars into approximately 84.8 million shares of common
	stock, $.0001 par value per share (“Common Stock”), at a conversion price of $0.10 per share unless such shares were
	priced at less than the $0.10 per share. Additionally, the exercise price of approximately 11.7 million warrants to acquire shares
	of common stock were reduced to $0.10 per share and certain price protection and antidilution provisions were removed.


	 


	Additionally on January 31, 2017, the Company
	entered into and closed a Securities Purchase Agreement with an Accredited Investors pursuant which the Company borrowed $3,000,000
	in consideration of a Senior Unsecured Note an aggregate of 4,500,000 shares of Common Stock the Senior Unsecured Note matures
	in January 2019 and bears interest at a rate of 10%.







	 







	Furthermore, on March 22, 2017,
	Ipsidy Inc. (the “Company”) entered into Subscription Agreements with several accredited investors (the
	“March 2017 Accredited Investors”) pursuant to which the March 2017 Accredited Investors agreed to purchase an
	aggregate of 20,000,000 shares of the Company’s common stock for an aggregate purchase price of $4,000,000. The Company
	has received proceeds of $3,170,000 as of March 22, 2017. The combination of the above events effectively refinanced the
	Company’s financial position and provided new term financing requirements. The Company anticipates additional financing
	will be required beyond these current actions and the amount will be dependent on current operations and the investments the
	Company may pursue







	 




	Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements



	 


	The Company has no off-balance sheet arrangements

	ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES
	ABOUT MARKET RISK.



	 


	As a smaller reporting company, we are not
	required to include disclosure under this item.




	 








	ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.



	 



	Evaluation of
	Disclosure Controls and Procedures




	 




	Pursuant
	to Rules 13a-15(b) and 15-d-15(b) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (“Exchange Act”), the Company
	carried out an evaluation, with the participation of the Company’s management, including the Company’s former Chief
	Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer of the effectiveness of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures as
	of the end of the period covered by this report. The term “disclosure controls and procedures”, as defined under Rules
	13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that
	information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed,
	summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include,
	without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports
	that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the company's management, including its principal
	executive and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based upon the
	evaluation of the disclosure controls and procedures at the end of the period covered by this report, the Company’s Chief
	Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were not effective

	as a result of continuing weaknesses in its internal control over financial reporting initially identified in the Company’s
	Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 which are as follows:


	 




	 



	-




	The Company has not established adequate financial reporting monitoring activities to mitigate the risk of management override, specifically because there were only a few employees at such time and only two officers with management functions and therefore there is lack of segregation of duties.





	 




	 



	-




	There was and continues to be a strong reliance on outside consultants to review and adjust the annual and quarterly financial statements, to monitor new accounting principles, and to ensure compliance with GAAP and SEC disclosure requirements.





	 




	 



	-




	There was and continues to be a strong reliance on the external attorneys to review and edit the annual and quarterly filings and to ensure compliance with SEC disclosure requirements.





	 




	 



	-




	A formal audit committee has not been formed.





	 



	In
	order to address the above material weaknesses, Philip D. Beck, the Chief Executive Officer and President of the Company, and Stuart
	P. Stoller, the Chief Financial Officer of the Company, which were appointed to such offices on January 31, 2017, a date subsequent
	to the relevant filing period disclosed herein, have initiated the following actions to remediate the material weaknesses:




	 







	-



	In addition to the engagement of Mr. Beck and Mr. Stoller,
	who are both experienced public company executives, the Company is evaluating its personnel resources and is considering engaging
	additional permanent skilled finance and accounting resources.






	 







	-



	The Company has engaged independent consultants to assist
	with certain areas of the reconciliation and accounting functions and may continue such engagement or hire additional consultants
	as needed.






	 







	-



	The Company will seek to enhance its control environment
	to promote the adherence to appropriate internal control policies and procedures. These efforts will be focused on assessing the
	capabilities of the financial staff, reviewing systems and ensuring appropriate levels of analytical reviews among other appropriate
	steps.






	 







	-



	The Company has and is continuing to reassess and revise
	key policies and procedures, including the general ledger, general ledger reconciliation, capital expenditure and accounts payable,
	to develop and deploy effective policies and procedures and reinforced compliance in an effort to constantly improve the Company’s
	internal control environment.






	 







	 



	22



	 







	 





	 







	-



	The Company intends to enhance its internal governance and
	compliance function. The Company intends to form appropriate committees and periodic and regular meetings will be held with the
	internal governance and compliance functions to discuss and coordinate operational, compliance and financial matters as well as
	the progress of the Company’s plan to remediate its material weaknesses.






	 




	Changes in Internal Control over Financial
	Reporting



	 


	There were no changes in our internal control
	over financial reporting during the three months ended March 31, 2016 that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially
	affect, our internal control over financial reporting.





	 








	PART II

	 



	 








	ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS



	 


	We are currently not a party to any material
	legal or administrative proceedings and are not aware of any pending or threatened material legal or administrative proceedings
	arising in the ordinary course of business.  We may from time to time become a party to various legal or administrative
	proceedings arising in the ordinary course of our business.




	 








	ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS



	 


	Risk factors describing the major risks to
	our business can be found under Item 1A, “Risk Factors”, in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December
	31, 2015. There has been no material change in our risk factors from those previously discussed in the Annual Report on Form 10-K.



	 







	ITEM 2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES
	AND USE OF PROCEEDS



	 


	On February 8, 2016, the Company closed on
	the acquisition of FIN Holdings Inc. ("FIN"), a related party as a result of common management and partial common ownership,
	and its wholly owned subsidiaries, ID Solutions Inc. a Delaware Corporation specializing in field proven, cutting-edge biometric
	fingerprint software technology and algorithms, as well as Cards Plus Pty Ltd, a South African company which provides unique secure
	credential products and solutions to government customers in Africa. The purchase price of $9,000,000 was paid in the form of common
	stock of the Company, resulting in the issuance of 22,500,000 shares of the Company’s common stock to the FIN shareholders.


	 



	The above
	offers and sales of the securities were made to accredited investors and the Company relied upon the exemptions contained in Section
	4(2) of the Securities Act and/or Rule 506 of Regulation D promulgated there under with regards to the sales. No advertising or
	general solicitation was employed in offerings the securities. The offers and sales were made to accredited investors and transfer
	of the securities was restricted by the Company in accordance with the requirements of the Securities Act of 1933.
