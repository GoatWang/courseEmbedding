QVT - Approach













QVT originated   as a non-traditional proprietary trading group inside an investment bank and currently has approximately $2 billion under management. Our core team has spent over 10 years working together to develop and implement innovative, fundamental and quantitatively-oriented trading strategies, many of which make extensive use of internally-developed, proprietary software.

The staffing philosophy at QVT is to employ a select number of exceptionally high-caliber individuals who can apply original thinking to a wide range of investment opportunities, across sectors and around the world. In contrast to many financial firms, we provide a work environment that encourages balance between professional and personal lives.

There is also a level of friendship amongst interns and full-time hires don't look down upon the little guys.ConsThere could have been a more structured program or the ability to learn about other aspects of the organization. It wasn't discouraged by any means, but wasn't necessarily promoted either. Plus more kpi drivers for the interns.Advice to ManagementKeep doing what you're doing, but let the interns learn about other aspects of the business as long as it doesn't interfere with their tasks.Share on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on WhatsAppShare via EmailCopy LinkLink Copied!Flag as InappropriateFlag as InappropriateHelpful (0) QVT Financial Response seconds agoEdit • Delete QVT Financial 2016-08-19 16:10 PDT Jan 11, 2016"analyst"StarStarStarStarStarCurrent Employee - Anonymous EmployeeCurrent Employee - Anonymous EmployeeRecommendsPositive OutlookApproves of CEOProsintellectual curiosity is very strongConshedge fund industry in general is competitiveShare on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on WhatsAppShare via EmailCopy LinkLink Copied!Flag as InappropriateFlag as InappropriateHelpful (0) QVT Financial Response seconds agoEdit • Delete QVT Financial 2016-01-11 19:52 PST Jan 27, 2016"Operations Analyst"StarStarStarStarStarWork/Life BalanceCulture & ValuesCareer OpportunitiesComp & BenefitsSenior ManagementCurrent Employee - Operations Analyst in New Delhi (India)Current Employee - Operations Analyst in New Delhi (India)RecommendsPositive OutlookApproves of CEOI have been working at QVT Financial full-time (More than a year)ProsIf you are new into the world of capital markets and wants to gain exposure across investment products then this is the job for you.

There is a lot of learning but the job will get a little monotonous after a while. But then that can be said about every job which is not a top-line affecting job.Advice to ManagementInvest more in your employees.
