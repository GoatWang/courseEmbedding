(1) Accredited Investor Exemption

            There is no regulatory minimum purchase amount requirement for investments in a Fund made by investors who qualify under the Accredited Investor
            Exemption. However, the minimum initial purchase amount established by the Manager for "accredited investors" is $25,000 (or such lesser amount that
            the Manager may accept from time to time).
        

            The criteria for qualification as an "accredited investor" is defined in National Instrument 45-106 of the Canadian Securities Administrators and is
            set out in the Subscription Instructions of the Investment Application.
        
(2) Minimum Amount Exemption (not available to individuals)

            The minimum amount for an initial investment in a Fund made by an investor purchasing under the Minimum Amount Exemption is $150,000 in each
            province and territory.
