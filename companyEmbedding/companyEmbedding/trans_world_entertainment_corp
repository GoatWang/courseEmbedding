Trans World Entertainment Corporation is a chain of entertainment media retail stores in the United States. It currently operates just over 300 freestanding and shopping mall-based stores under several brand names, down from about 540 in August 2010.
Based out of Albany, New York, Trans World was founded in 1972 by Robert Higgins. It opened its first store, called Record Town (formerly Record Land), in 1973. The company went public in July 1986 and has expanded through acquisitions of a number of smaller or failing companies including Strawberries, Camelot Music, and Wherehouse Entertainment.
On September 23, 2000, Trans World signed a definitive agreement to acquire the assets of WaxWorks, and the deal was expected to close by the end of October.[1]
As part of a 2002 settlement with 41 states over CD price fixing Trans World Entertainment, along with retailers Musicland and Tower Records, agreed to pay a $3 million fine.[2] It is estimated that between 1995 and 2000 customers were overcharged by nearly $500 million and up to $5 per album.[3]
In February 2006, Trans World acquired the Musicland Group, which owned Sam Goody, Suncoast Motion Picture Company, and Media Play. This also included a handful of On Cue stores.
Trans World operated at a net loss from 2006 to 2010. In fiscal year 2011 it turned a profit of $2.2 million (compared to a $31 million loss in FY 2010). The company closed some locations and increased margins on its products.[4]

Trans World Entertainment Corporation is a chain of entertainment media retail stores in the United States. It currently operates just over 300 freestanding and shopping mall-based stores under several brand names, down from about 540 in August 2010.
Based out of Albany, New York, Trans World was founded in 1972 by Robert Higgins. It opened its first store, called Record Town (formerly Record Land), in 1973. The company went public in July 1986 and has expanded through acquisitions of a number of smaller or failing companies including Strawberries, Camelot Music, and Wherehouse Entertainment.
On September 23, 2000, Trans World signed a definitive agreement to acquire the assets of WaxWorks, and the deal was expected to close by the end of October.[1]
As part of a 2002 settlement with 41 states over CD price fixing Trans World Entertainment, along with retailers Musicland and Tower Records, agreed to pay a $3 million fine.[2] It is estimated that between 1995 and 2000 customers were overcharged by nearly $500 million and up to $5 per album.[3]
In February 2006, Trans World acquired the Musicland Group, which owned Sam Goody, Suncoast Motion Picture Company, and Media Play. This also included a handful of On Cue stores.
Trans World operated at a net loss from 2006 to 2010. In fiscal year 2011 it turned a profit of $2.2 million (compared to a $31 million loss in FY 2010). The company closed some locations and increased margins on its products.[4]

The company went public in July 1986 and has expanded through acquisitions of a number of smaller or failing companies including Strawberries, Camelot Music, and Wherehouse Entertainment.
On September 23, 2000, Trans World signed a definitive agreement to acquire the assets of WaxWorks, and the deal was expected to close by the end of October.[1]
As part of a 2002 settlement with 41 states over CD price fixing Trans World Entertainment, along with retailers Musicland and Tower Records, agreed to pay a $3 million fine.[2] It is estimated that between 1995 and 2000 customers were overcharged by nearly $500 million and up to $5 per album.[3]
In February 2006, Trans World acquired the Musicland Group, which owned Sam Goody, Suncoast Motion Picture Company, and Media Play. This also included a handful of On Cue stores.
Trans World operated at a net loss from 2006 to 2010. In fiscal year 2011 it turned a profit of $2.2 million (compared to a $31 million loss in FY 2010). The company closed some locations and increased margins on its products.[4]

Company History

The history of Trans World Entertainment is a more than 40-year tradition of innovation, evolution and success.
Trans World was founded in 1972 by Robert J. Higgins and opened its first retail store in 1973 under the name Record Town, and grew its retail business to 38 stores over a 10-year period — capitalizing on the burgeoning mall phenomenon. In 1982, the Company sold its wholesale business to focus on retail, expanding the number of retail outlets to more than 200. Trans World went public in July 1986, selling 1.6 million shares of stock at $16.50 per share.
Between 1984 and 1990, Trans World increased its store base an average of 10% annually. The industry changed with the introduction of CDs in 1983 and home video in 1989, and Trans World quickly expanded its store count at an average of 41% annually. By 1994, Trans World owned and operated 712 stores.
1997 brought success with record-setting $571 million in annual sales and profits of $20.7 million. Trans World also acquired Strawberries, Inc. a 90-store music retailer operating in the New England area. Shareholders were awarded a 2-for-1 stock split during the year.
The Company again exceeded expectations in 1998 with sales totaling $700 million and profits reaching over $40 million. A retail website — www.twec.com — was launched and shareholders were awarded a 3-for-2 stock split. That same year, the Company signed a definitive agreement to acquire Camelot Music Holdings, one of its largest national competitors. The acquisition was completed in 1999.
In 2001, Trans World united its mall-based portfolio and retail Web site under the F.Y.E. (For Your Entertainment) brand name — creating a consistent, cross-channel experience for customers, and redefining entertainment retail in the process. Interactive, ubiquitous and customer-centric, the F.Y.E. concept involved proprietary in-store technologies which positioned Trans World for continued growth.
2003 featured more strategic growth, as Trans World acquired Wherehouse Entertainment. This acquisition added approximately 100 stores to the Company’s freestanding portfolio, and expanded its presence in the West Coast market. In 2006, Trans World acquired its largest competitor, Musicland, and added select high-performing stores to its mall portfolio.
In 2007, faced with continued declines in its core businesses, the company implemented a strategy to close or relocate underperforming stores and transform its product mix to become everything entertainment. From 2007 to 2011, the Company closed over 250 underperforming locations while shifting its product mix. In 2007, Trend & Electronics represented 13% of the Company’s business.
In 2012, based on the success of its strategic plan, the company paid the first dividend in its history.
2014 was a significant year for Trans World Entertainment. We achieved several milestones during the year. We listened to our customer and set out to leverage the strength of our entertainment heritage. We’ve focused on shifting our merchandise assortment to complement our legacy categories. Our emerging opportunities contributed nearly 25% of our sales for the year. In the fourth quarter, they contributed over 30% to our sales; a larger percentage of our business than music.
Further, through increased focus on improving inventory management, we reduced inventory per square foot to $70 at the end of the year versus $74 at the end of 2013.  This focus continues to enhance our financial position. We generated over $16 million in cash flow from operations and utilized our strong balance sheet to return approximately $20 million to shareholders, while at the same time maintaining the flexibility to implement our strategy and grow the company.
As we look to the future, the opportunity for Trans World Entertainment is substantial. As technology continues to change how customers engage with the entertainment world and the wider marketplace, one thing remains constant; customers respond to compelling product presented and delivered well through an engagement that communicates gratitude and respect.   Our opportunity is to enhance the relationship we’ve developed with our unique and wide customer demographic. Our legacy and heritage serve as a solid foundation to build higher by offering a unique entertainment perspective through innovative and creative products that further the connection between our customer and entertainment.
