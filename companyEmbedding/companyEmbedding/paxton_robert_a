About The Anatomy of Fascism
What is fascism? By focusing on the concrete: what the fascists did, rather than what they said, the esteemed historian Robert O. Paxton answers this question for the first time. From the first violent uniformed bands beating up “enemies of the state,” through   Mussolini’s rise to power, to Germany’s fascist radicalization in World War II, Paxton   shows clearly why fascists came to power in some countries and not others, and explores   whether fascism could exist outside the early-twentieth-century European setting   in which it emerged. “A deeply intelligent and very readable book. . . . Historical analysis at its best.” –The Economist The Anatomy of Fascism will have a lasting impact on our understanding   of modern European history, just as Paxton’s classic Vichy France redefined our vision   of World War II. Based on a lifetime of research, this compelling and important book   transforms our knowledge of fascism–“the major political innovation of the twentieth   century, and the source of much of its pain.”

Praise

    “So fair, so thorough and, in the end, so convincing, it may well become the most   authoritative . . . study of the subject. . . . A splendid book.” –The New York Times   Book Review “Useful and timely. . . . Mussolini and Hitler were the prototypical   fascist leaders, and Paxton chronicles their rise to power–and their global influence   and ultimate fall–with a brilliant economy.” –San Francisco Chronicle “A deeply   intelligent and very readable book. . . . Historical analysis at its best.” –The   Economist “[A] helpful contribution, thoughtfully mapping out the descent of a civilized   people — first the Italians, then the Germans — into a primal state (and state of   being) ruled by mythology, symbol and emotion. . . . Serves as a reminder of our   power and responsibility.”  –The Washington Post Book World “Until now there has   been no satisfying account of fascism that includes a convincing diagnostic kit for   identifying its symptoms. . . . Robert Paxton steps in to restore sanity, with his   view that fascism is not what was believed but what was done.” –Los Angeles Times   Book Review

WHY CHOOSE PAXTON



CUSTOM ENGINEERED
To maximize air drying, blow off, or air rinsing, Paxton engineers the air delivery devices based on the specifications of the target.  Next, the blower is sized to ensure performance and efficiency.



SERVICE
Paxton engineers provide expert technical service before, during and after installation. Paxton service components extend the life of the blower and minimize maintenance.




WARRANTY
Only Paxton Centrifugal Blowers carry a full three year warranty. Paxton’s superior design and workmanship maximize reliability.




PERFORMANCE GUARANTEE
Paxton Products offers a 100% Performance Guarantee for any Paxton Air Delivery System designed, assembled, balanced and approved by Paxton for drying and blow off applications.



ENERGY EFFICIENT
As much as 80% less energy than compressed air drying and blow off and up to 50% less energy than other blowers, Paxton Air Systems are highly efficient while providing superior drying, blow off and air rinsing.
















Craft Beer Bottle Drying
High demand for an extremely popular product resulted in higher volume production for a North Carolina craft brewery. Growth brought new challenges, however, since increased throughput made a bottle drying system necessary.  
The Paxton Power Dry Drying system with adjustable spyder manifold helped remove water at faster bottling speeds. The Paxton system also resolved moisture problems created by humid weather.  After comparison shopping, the brewery’s facility manager concluded that Paxton Products was the most cost effective drying solution, beating compressed air and other drying technologies hands-down.







Doughnut Conveying
A food manufacturer prepares doughnuts by sending them through a production line in a bath of oil.  To cook properly, the doughnuts need must be conveyed in the oil over 15 feet.  Currently, the company uses four  52” lengths of pipe with 60 holes drilled in each pipe spanning the width of the fryer. Each pipe is supplied with 30 psi of compressed air in order to convey doughnuts across the 15-foot span, using a total of 607 CFM of air. 
The manufacturer seeks to increase energy efficiency by switching to a blower-driven system. Paxton proposed an air delivery system comprised of four 52” air knives powered by a 20Hp blower, providing 1150 CFM at 20” of water column. The Paxton system will consume 16 hp compared to the 68  hp required for the compressed air. 
The client’s return on investment will be less than 11 months.  Thereafter, they will save $16,854 per year.







Wire Blow Off
A wire manufacturer located in India is having issues with a cleaning solution adhering to the wire and ending up on the final rolled product. 
 Not only does this cause quality issues, but the cost of the lost cleaning solution is expensive.  They have improvised a crude system of crimped pipes and compressed air along with mechanical wipers to reduce the “carry over” of the solution.  The compressed air nozzles they use require approximately 150 CFM @ 60 PSI.  
Their improved solution carries a high price tag in energy costs, requiring 25 hp of compressed air. The compressed air also takes a toll on air pressure in the plant, causing their compressor to run continuously. This in turn drives up their maintenance costs and it puts on strain on the rest of the plant’s operations.
Paxton will engineer a system that delivers 850 CFM @ 2.2 PSI  that will have an estimated ROI of around 2 years based on energy savings alone.  In addition to this, the wire manufacturer will save money due to reduced compressed air expense.







Conveyor Cleaning:  Gypsum Removal
An electric power company wants to remove residual gypsum from their conveyors after the bulk of the gypsum has unloaded.  Gypsum is a byproduct of the clean-coal burning process and is usually sent to a landfill if it cannot be used.  Recently, a drywall manufacturer built a facility nearby and will use this gypsum as feedstock.  By installing a blower system to blow the residual off the conveyor, the customer will be able to collect the gypsum, increase revenue and reduce the amount of gypsum deposited into landfills.
Paxton will supply a 126” length dual plenum air knife with two, 20HP AT 1200 blowers.  Each blower will supply 813 CFM @ 91” of W.C.







Conveyor Blow Off:  Metal Shavings
A Midwestern machining company needs to blow metal chips off of their conveyor after a machining process. They have three lines and are currently using one 18” and one 24” compressed air knife on each line, operating at 40 psi, to remove the chips from the conveyor, giving a total compressed air usage of 86 CFM. They would like to switch to blower-driven air in order to reduce energy consumption.
For the Paxton Air Systems, for each line, a 10 hp blower will supply two 24” air knives, providing 550 CFM at 50” of water column. The Paxton Systems will each use 7.8 hp compared to the 13 hp for each of the existing compressed air systems, a savings of over 5 hp per line.  Along with the energy savings, the company is able to free up almost 40 hp (3 x 13 hp) on their compressor for operations that require compressed air operation.







Metal Tube Drying, Pre-print
A Midwestern metal tube manufacturer must dry large metal tubes, ranging in diameter from 8” –20”, before printing.  They are currently drying the tubes using four 2” fan nozzles, with 105 psi compressed air, but are occasionally having quality issues, despite the use of 100 cfm of air.  They would like to switch to blower-driven air for the energy savings, while improving the quality of the drying.
For the Paxton Air System, a 5 hp blower will supply three 6’ air knives, providing 200 cfm air at 60” of water column.   The Paxton System will use only 3.3 hp compared to 22.8 hp for the existing compressed air system, resulting in an energy savings of about $1.50 per hour and yielding an ROI of less than 11 months for a 24 x 5 day operation.







Part Drying for Injection Molding
A West Coast metal injection molding/die casting company needed to blow off various products after rinsing. They have 7 lines in the facility using two 12” air knives each of unregulated compressed air at plant pressure 100 psi consuming 64 CFM. They would like to replace their compressed air drying application with an energy efficient solution that provides an ROI of 12 months or less.
The Paxton solution utilizes a 5 hp XT-500 blower with two 12” aluminum air knives which will provide the line with 250 CFM at 50” water column.  Each line of compressed air replaced with a Paxton system will free up approximately 12 hp of their existing compressed air system.  The system will have a wash-down enclosure so the system can be put right next to the wash-down area of each line.  The ROI of the project is less than 10 months.







Soda Can Rinsing
A major beverage manufacturer in drought-ridden California was looking to replace its water rinsing system prior to the filler with one of Paxton’s Ionizing Can Rinser systems.  The system provided needed to be able to rinse up to 900 cans per minute with the two lines merging together before the filler.
The Paxton solution included two x 3 hp XT-300 Blowers each complete with NANO filtration for the outlet air, an 8 nozzle air manifold with internal ionizing bar, and failsafe controls.  The installed Paxton system not only dramatically reduced the company’s water usage, but also maintained the high standards of product quality, as demonstrated by thorough QC testing.

TESTIMONIALS 




The Paxton Ionizing Air Rinser has been in operation in the Buena Park plant for 5 months. There have been no quality or mechanical issues during this time, and we are very satisfied with the performance. On several occasions we have had a few follow up questions and our Paxton rep, Patrick Donovan, has come to the plant to answer all questions and verify the operation of the unit and did some extra training. So far Pepsi Buena Park is very happy with Paxton.
Randy Williams, Maintenance Manager



I can’t believe how well the Paxton system operates. We should have gotten this system a long time ago. Every month we remained with the old equipment, it’s like we were throwing money down the drain in wasted energy costs.
-Bakery Plant Manager



This machine works wonders.
-Charlie Lyver, Project Manager/Maintenance Manager



With the kind of energy savings we experienced, the PowerDry unit paid for itself in less than a year. We’re working with Paxton now on replacing compressed air drying in other areas of the plant.
-Canning Facility Maintenance Manager



It does what it is supposed to do. It is nice to see a product work as advertised.
-Pat Cell, General Manager



The Paxton blowers not only outperform those previous installed, but they are also much quieter. And Paxton service was excellent throughout the entire process.
-Dan Lardinois, Corporate Engineer



A lot of times, when you get more technology in a plant, you have to pay for it with more work keeping the system running. But the PowerDry doesn’t create any extra hassles like that. This system is great, even better than we expected.
-Daniel Dolan, Plant Engineer

Early life[edit]
Paxton was born in 1932 in Lexington, Virginia. After attending secondary school in New England, he received a B.A. from Washington and Lee University in 1954. Later, he won a Rhodes Scholarship and spent two years earning an M.A. at Merton College, Oxford,[1] where he studied under historians including James Joll and John Roberts. He earned a Ph.D. from Harvard University in 1963.[2]
Career[edit]
Paxton taught at the University of California, Berkeley[1] and the State University of New York at Stony Brook before joining the faculty of Columbia University in 1969. He served there for the remainder of his career, retiring in 1997.
Paxton is best known for his 1972 book Vichy France: Old Guard and New Order, 1940-1944. In opposition to the traditional view pioneered by Robert Aron, he argued that the Vichy government was eager to collaborate with Nazi Germany and did not practice "passive resistance" to German rule. Upon the book's publication in French translation in 1973, Paxton became the subject of intense vitriol from French historians and commentators. During a televised debate with Paxton in 1976, the Vichy naval leader Gabriel Auphan called him a liar. However, the translation sold thousands of copies, particularly to the young generation shaped by the civil unrest of May 1968 and who were uninterested in the "cozy mythologies" of Vichy apologists. Today, the book is considered a historical classic and one of the best studies on France in the Vichy era.[2] It was published at a time when French historians and filmmakers were also exploring history under the Vichy regime, as in Marcel Ophüls' influential two-part documentary The Sorrow and the Pity (1969).
As an expert on the Vichy era, Paxton co-wrote Claude Chabrol's 1993 documentary The Eye of Vichy. In 1997 he testified at the trial of Vichy bureaucrat Maurice Papon.[3]
Paxton retired from Columbia University in 1997, but remains a professor emeritus. He has contributed more than twenty reviews to The New York Review of Books, beginning in 1978 and continuing through 2016.[4]
Awards[edit]
In 2009, the French government awarded Paxton the Legion d'honneur.[5]
Fascism[edit]
Paxton has focused his work on exploring models and definition of fascism.
In his 1998 paper "The Five Stages of Fascism," he suggests that fascism cannot be defined solely by its ideology, since fascism is a complex political phenomenon rather than a relatively coherent body of doctrine like communism or socialism. Instead, he focuses on fascism's political context and functional development. The article identifies five paradigmatic stages of a fascist movement, although he notes that only Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy progressed through all five:

Intellectual exploration, where disillusionment with popular democracy manifests itself in discussions of lost national vigor
Rooting, where a fascist movement, aided by political deadlock and polarization, becomes a player on the national stage
Arrival to power, where conservatives seeking to control rising leftist opposition invite the movement to share power
Exercise of power, where the movement and its charismatic leader control the state in balance with state institutions such as the police and traditional elites such as the clergy and business magnates.
Radicalization or entropy, where the state either becomes increasingly radical, as did Nazi Germany, or slips into traditional authoritarian rule, as did Fascist Italy.[6]

In his 2004 book The Anatomy of Fascism, Paxton refines his five-stage model and puts forward the following definition for fascism:

Fascism may be defined as a form of political behavior marked by obsessive preoccupation with community decline, humiliation, or victim-hood and by compensatory cults of unity, energy, and purity, in which a mass-based party of committed nationalist militants, working in uneasy but effective collaboration with traditional elites, abandons democratic liberties and pursues with redemptive violence and without ethical or legal restraints goals of internal cleansing and external expansion.[7]

Personal life[edit]
Paxton is an avid birdwatcher and a former president of the Linnaean Society of New York.[4]

Early life[edit]
Paxton was born in 1932 in Lexington, Virginia. After attending secondary school in New England, he received a B.A. from Washington and Lee University in 1954. Later, he won a Rhodes Scholarship and spent two years earning an M.A. at Merton College, Oxford,[1] where he studied under historians including James Joll and John Roberts. He earned a Ph.D. from Harvard University in 1963.[2]
Career[edit]
Paxton taught at the University of California, Berkeley[1] and the State University of New York at Stony Brook before joining the faculty of Columbia University in 1969. He served there for the remainder of his career, retiring in 1997.
Paxton is best known for his 1972 book Vichy France: Old Guard and New Order, 1940-1944. In opposition to the traditional view pioneered by Robert Aron, he argued that the Vichy government was eager to collaborate with Nazi Germany and did not practice "passive resistance" to German rule. Upon the book's publication in French translation in 1973, Paxton became the subject of intense vitriol from French historians and commentators. During a televised debate with Paxton in 1976, the Vichy naval leader Gabriel Auphan called him a liar. However, the translation sold thousands of copies, particularly to the young generation shaped by the civil unrest of May 1968 and who were uninterested in the "cozy mythologies" of Vichy apologists. Today, the book is considered a historical classic and one of the best studies on France in the Vichy era.[2] It was published at a time when French historians and filmmakers were also exploring history under the Vichy regime, as in Marcel Ophüls' influential two-part documentary The Sorrow and the Pity (1969).
As an expert on the Vichy era, Paxton co-wrote Claude Chabrol's 1993 documentary The Eye of Vichy. In 1997 he testified at the trial of Vichy bureaucrat Maurice Papon.[3]
Paxton retired from Columbia University in 1997, but remains a professor emeritus. He has contributed more than twenty reviews to The New York Review of Books, beginning in 1978 and continuing through 2016.[4]
Awards[edit]
In 2009, the French government awarded Paxton the Legion d'honneur.[5]
Fascism[edit]
Paxton has focused his work on exploring models and definition of fascism.
In his 1998 paper "The Five Stages of Fascism," he suggests that fascism cannot be defined solely by its ideology, since fascism is a complex political phenomenon rather than a relatively coherent body of doctrine like communism or socialism. Instead, he focuses on fascism's political context and functional development. The article identifies five paradigmatic stages of a fascist movement, although he notes that only Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy progressed through all five:

Intellectual exploration, where disillusionment with popular democracy manifests itself in discussions of lost national vigor
Rooting, where a fascist movement, aided by political deadlock and polarization, becomes a player on the national stage
Arrival to power, where conservatives seeking to control rising leftist opposition invite the movement to share power
Exercise of power, where the movement and its charismatic leader control the state in balance with state institutions such as the police and traditional elites such as the clergy and business magnates.
Radicalization or entropy, where the state either becomes increasingly radical, as did Nazi Germany, or slips into traditional authoritarian rule, as did Fascist Italy.[6]

In his 2004 book The Anatomy of Fascism, Paxton refines his five-stage model and puts forward the following definition for fascism:

Fascism may be defined as a form of political behavior marked by obsessive preoccupation with community decline, humiliation, or victim-hood and by compensatory cults of unity, energy, and purity, in which a mass-based party of committed nationalist militants, working in uneasy but effective collaboration with traditional elites, abandons democratic liberties and pursues with redemptive violence and without ethical or legal restraints goals of internal cleansing and external expansion.[7]

Personal life[edit]
Paxton is an avid birdwatcher and a former president of the Linnaean Society of New York.[4]

Paxton Automotive

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


					Jump to:					navigation, 					search





C4 Corvette fitted with Paxton SN-86 supercharger.


Paxton Automotive is a United States-based manufacturer of superchargers for automotive use. The company is the major proponent of the centrifugal type supercharger. Early products were offered under the McCulloch name. Some Paxton superchargers have been factory fitted, but most units sold have been aftermarket installed. Paxton products are possibly best known for their frequent use in performance-modified Ford Mustangs.
Inventor Robert Paxton McCulloch began producing superchargers to his design in 1937 for the Ford Flathead V8, a popular engine for performance modification at the time. The company estimates that around 5,000 were built before World War II stopped production.
Postwar, McCulloch developed a more sophisticated supercharger and began selling it in 1953. This was factory fitted to a number of vehicles at the time, including the Kaiser Manhattan, Packard Panther, Studebaker Golden Hawk, 1957 Packard Clipper and 1958 Packard Hawk.
In 1956, McCulloch set up a separate Paxton Superchargers division, selling it off in 1958. Supercharged engines were used for one successful year in NASCAR racing, after which forced induction was banned from the sport. For this purpose, Paxton superchargers were fitted as the rare (211 produced) F-option for the 1957 Ford Thunderbird.
A short run of Shelby Mustangs were fitted with Paxton superchargers, and Ford dealers offered Paxton superchargers as a dealer-fitted Ford Mustang option from 1965 to 1972. Paxton still provides supercharger kits for older Mustangs as well as more recent models.
Still in business, Paxton now supplies complete supercharging kits for popular performance-modified cars, as well as bare superchargers for more customised installations.
One of the more unusual applications for the Paxton brand superchargers was as an air pump in the air purifying CO2 scrubbers of U.S. Navy submarines.

                           This book presents the truth of Vichy; that in the interests of stability, national feeling favored collaboration with the
                              German-controlled regime. The author concludes that a coalition of the losers and victims of the Third French Republic seized
                              the opportunity offered by defeat in 1940 to try to impose their vision of France on a population that was, at least at first,
                              willing if not enthusiastic partners in a "national revolution."

                           "What is fascism? Many authors have proposed succinct but abstract definitions. Robert O. Paxton prefers to start with concrete
                              historical experience. He focuses more on what fascists did than on what they said. Their first uniformed bands beat up "enemies
                              of the nation," such as communists and foreign immigrants, during the tense days after 1918 when the liberal democracies of
                              Europe were struggling with the aftershocks of World War I. Fascist parties could not approach power, however, without the
                              complicity of conservatives willing to sacrifice the rule of law for security." "Paxton makes clear the sequence of steps
                              by which fascists and conservatives together formed regimes in Italy and Germany, and why fascists remained out of power elsewhere."
                              "This book, based on a lifetime of research, will have a lasting impact on our understanding of twentieth-century history."--Jacket

                           "Comparing German documents with newly available French sources, [the authors] conclusively demonstrate that, contrary to
                              postwar testimony, Vichy unleashed a wave of antisemitic laws independent of German pressure. On coming to power in 1940,
                              Vichy policy began by banning Jews from positions of public influence and from the military, then moved on to the confiscation
                              of property and internment, and ended by cooperating in the deportation from France, and the death in German camps, of over
                              75,000 Jews."--Jacket

                           In 1920s France the far-right peasantry wanted an authoritarian and agrarian society. This study examines their singular lack

                              collaborators during World War II. From the small town of Vichy in Central France, Field Marshall Petain's puppet government
                              worked with their Nazi overlords in creating pro-Nazi propaganda. They skillfully produced a strange alternative history of
                              the war years in order to turn public emotion against the Allies and the Jews

                              What is fascism? By focusing on the concrete: what the fascists did rather than what they said, the esteemed historian Robert
                                 O. Paxton answers this question for the first time. From the first violent uniformed bands beating up "enemies of the state,"
                                 through Mussolini's rise to power, to Germany's fascist radicalization in World War II, Paxton shows clearly why fascists
                                 came to power in some countries and not others, and he explores whether fascism could exist outside the early-twentieth-century
                                 European setting in which it emerged.The Anatomy of Fascism will have a lasting impact on our understanding of modern European
                                 history, just as Paxton's classic Vichy France redefined our vision of World War II. Based on a lifetime of research, this
                                 compelling and important book transforms our knowledge of fascism--"the major political innovation of the twentieth century,
                                 and the source of much of its pain."
