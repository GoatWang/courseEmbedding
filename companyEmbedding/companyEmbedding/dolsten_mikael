  "I am excited to have the opportunity to align the tremendous science        that is in every corner of Pfizer to bring forward medicines and        vaccines that transform lives" 



NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Today, Pfizer Inc. named Mikael Dolsten, M.D., PhD, President of Pfizer        Worldwide Research and Development, as the Company completes its        integration of these functions following the Wyeth acquisition. Dr.        Dolsten previously led Wyeth’s Research and Development organization        from May 2008, and after the close of the Wyeth acquisition was named        President of Pfizer’s BioTherapeutics Research & Development. Prior to        his appointment at Wyeth, Dr. Dolsten held key leadership roles in R&D        at Boehringer Ingelheim and AstraZeneca.             With this appointment, Dr. Dolsten will now lead all of research at        Pfizer, as well as development of all compounds through Phase 2, or        ‘proof of concept.’ Late-stage clinical development will continue to be        led by clinical teams throughout the Worldwide Biopharmaceutical        Businesses, as announced in April 2009.             “Since closing the Wyeth acquisition we have rapidly advanced        integration, completing the pipeline portfolio review, finalizing        decisions regarding our R&D network very quickly after close, and        steadily progressing the pipeline. Rapid integration has been enhanced        by strong and steady collaboration between the two legacy R&D groups --        making the consolidation under one leader a natural and progressive step        to take at this point,” said Jeffrey Kindler, Pfizer’s chairman and        chief executive officer.             The newly named Pfizer Worldwide Research & Development organization        will maintain an R&D structure that supports excellence in small        molecules, large molecules and vaccine research and development. It will        include biotherapeutics research and development, focused on large        molecules and biotechnologies; pharmatherapeutics research and        development, focused on small molecules; and vaccines research and        development. Pfizer adopted a novel R&D model following the Wyeth        acquisition to foster diversity of talent, assets and culture, as well        as the empowerment and accountability of research leaders across R&D.        Pfizer initially implemented this model with a two-division structure        (BioTherapeutics and PharmaTherapeutics) to ensure the progress and        steady integration of both legacy organizations. Due to the speed and        effectiveness of the integration, Pfizer is now able to implement a        diversified R&D platform with the same breadth and research programs,        under the consolidated leadership of Dr. Dolsten.             “Mikael Dolsten is an exceptional scientist who is highly regarded and        committed to bringing new preventative measures, treatments and cures to        people. Mikael’s scientific expertise, vision for R&D and commercial        mindset have distinguished him at Pfizer and uniquely qualify him to        lead our R&D colleagues and advance our pipeline. Having all of Pfizer’s        research conducted under Mikael’s leadership will enrich the alignment        between our research programs and commercial teams to address important        unmet medical needs and deliver the next generation of medicines,” said        Mr. Kindler.             “I am excited to have the opportunity to align the tremendous science        that is in every corner of Pfizer to bring forward medicines and        vaccines that transform lives,” said Dr. Dolsten. “We have great skills        in science, we have industry-leading technologies, and I am very proud        of our R&D pipeline. I look forward to working with our leaders to        advance our effort to become the world’s premier biopharmaceutical R&D        group.”             Pfizer also announced today the resignation of Martin Mackay, President,        PharmaTherapeutics Research & Development, who will leave the company        effective immediately. Dr. Dolsten will expand the role of Rod        MacKenzie, PhD, who is currently Senior Vice President and Head of        Worldwide Research for PharmaTherapeutics R&D. In addition to his        current responsibilities leading small molecule research, Dr. MacKenzie        will add responsibility for Asia R&D strategy, as well as small        molecules pharmaceutical science.             “We thank Martin Mackay for his many accomplishments and greatly        appreciate all he has done to help us develop world-class scientists at        Pfizer,” added Mr. Kindler. “I know Mikael will work closely with Rod        and all of our leaders across PharmaTherapeutics and BioTherapeutics to        ensure continuity of strategy and progress, as we continue to build our        science base at Pfizer,” said Mr. Kindler.             “Rod’s ability to transform pharmaceutical research has impressed me        tremendously,” said Dr. Dolsten. “I am excited he has accepted to take        on an expanded new role, and I look forward to a strong partnership to        advance Pfizer R&D - and to serve people who rely on science and        medicine for healthier and more productive lives.”       Pfizer Inc: Working together for a healthier world™          At Pfizer, we apply science and our global resources to improve health        and well-being at every stage of life. We strive to set the standard for        quality, safety and value in the discovery, development and        manufacturing of medicines for people and animals. Our diversified        global health care portfolio includes human and animal biologic and        small molecule medicines and vaccines, as well as nutritional products        and many of the world’s best-known consumer products. Every day, Pfizer        colleagues work across developed and emerging markets to advance        wellness, prevention, treatments and cures that challenge the most        feared diseases of our time. Consistent with our responsibility as the        world’s leading biopharmaceutical company, we also collaborate with        health care providers, governments and local communities to support and        expand access to reliable, affordable health care around the world.
