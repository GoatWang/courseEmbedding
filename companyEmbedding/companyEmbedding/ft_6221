SPARTAN HOT MELT
POWDER #6221


     #6221 is a
copolymer hot melt adhesive in granular form designed for the assembly and fabrication
of dissimilar substrates, including vinyls, polyesters, cellulosics, and most
synthetics.
     Application is by cold
application with powder metering equipment followed by heat fusion to the
substrate.  Subsequent lamination to
another substrate may be accomplished by pressure and heat reactivation.  Adequate bonds may be obtained with
add-on rates of 3 grams/sq.ft.
     #6221 is available in
various colors for visual quality control observation of add-on uniformity.

SPARTAN ADHESIVE
  SA-96981
 
     SA-96981 is a
  pressure sensitive type adhesive which can be used to laminate various porous
  and nonporous substrates including paper, cloth, sponge foam, plastics and
  polyvinyl chloride. This product resists migration of plasticizers and oil
  from substrate materials.

     SA-96981 has
  excellent tack stability along with superior aging resistance under adverse
  exposure to light, heat, chemicals, etc.

  Application methods include brush, roll coating, knife coating, and screen
  printing. It can be used for temporary tattoos.

  SA-96981 can be thinned for screen printing by the addition of common screen
  printing solvents.

  SA-96981 is FDA approved under Title 21 CFR 175.105, Adhesives; and Title 21
  CFR 176.180, Paper and Paperboard in Contact with Dry Foods, and is included
  among the regulated substances deemed acceptable for use as components of
  food contact applications.  It
  also conforms to the Toy Safety Standard ASTM F963-96a, Section 4.3.5.2
  regarding heavy metals and also meets the requirements of the Photographic
  Activity Test (per ISO 14523).

CAUTION: FLAMMABLE
 Keep away from heat and open flames.
  Use with adequate ventilation.
