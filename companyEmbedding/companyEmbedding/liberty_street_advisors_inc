OBJECTIVE
The Fund's investment objective is to achieve current income and long-term growth of capital. 
STRATEGY
The Fund seeks to achieve its investment objective by investing in equity Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs) and other real estate related entities. Under normal market conditions, the Fund will pursue its investment objective by investing at least 80% of its net assets (plus any borrowings for investment purposes) in income-producing equity securities, including common stocks, preferred stocks, convertible securities, rights, and warrants, of publicly traded companies participating in the real estate sector, such as Real Estate Investment Trusts (“REITs”).
The Fund is structured to provide investors with:

A focused portfolio, under normal market conditions, of approximately 20 to 30 investments in REITs and other companies participating in the real estate sector, diversified by property type, geographic location and issuer strategy, in an attempt to maximize risk-adjusted returns. The Fund’s portfolio companies may be of any size market capitalization, including small- and mid-capitalization companies. The Fund’s strategy is long only.


Access to an experienced professional REIT investment team with extensive knowledge and industry contacts with property management teams.


Access to a unique approach that allocates across three sub-strategies:

Sub-Strategy
Definition
Approximate Range
Core
Companies with superior balance sheets, established track records, and moderate growth
40-70%
Value-Add
Companies with moderate operating leverage, established track records, and high growth, both internal and external
20-50%
Opportunistic
Companies with high operating leverage, less established track records, and high growth, both internal and external
0-25%
 
 







 Effective September 30, 2014, the Fund changed its fund name from “Chilton Realty Income & Growth Fund” to “West Loop Realty Fund.” Chilton Capital Management, LLC remains as the Fund’s sub-advisor. The Fund’s investment objective, principal investment strategies and principal risks remain the same.
Before investing you should carefully consider the West Loop Realty Fund’s investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses. This and other information is in the prospectus and summary prospectus, a copy of which may be obtained by calling 800-207-7108. Please read the Fund’s prospectus or summary prospectus carefully before investing.
RISK AND OTHER DISCLOSURES:
An investment in the West Loop Realty Fund is subject to risk, including the possible loss of principal amount invested and including, but not limited to, the following risks, which are more fully described in the prospectus:
The Fund invests in Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs), which involve additional risks compared to those from investments in common stock. REITs are dependent upon management skills; generally may not be diversified; and are subject to heavy cash flow dependency, defaults by borrowers, self-liquidation, and tax risks.
Investments in REITs involve risks including, but not limited to, market risk, interest rate risk, equity risk and risks related to the real estate market.
The Fund will be closely linked to the performance of the real estate markets. The Real Estate industry is subject to certain market risks such as property revaluations, interest rate fluctuations, rental rate fluctuations and operating expenses, increasing vacancies, rising construction costs and potential modifications to government regulations.
REITs are subject to declines in the value of real estate as it relates to general and local economic conditions and decreases in property revenues. Continued disruptions in the financial markets and deteriorating economic conditions could adversely affect the value of the Fund’s investments.
As a non-diversified fund, the Fund may focus its assets in the securities of fewer issuers, which exposes the Fund to greater market risk than if its assets were diversified among a greater number of issuers.
The Fund’s investments will be concentrated in the real estate sector. The focus of the Fund’s portfolio on a specific sector may present more risks than if the portfolio were broadly diversified over numerous sectors.
Foreign investment risk. These risks include currency fluctuations, economic or financial instability, lack of timely or reliable financial information or unfavorable political or legal developments. Foreign companies are generally subject to different legal and accounting standards than U.S. companies.
The Fund invests in small and mid-cap real estate companies, which may involve less trading and, therefore, a larger impact on a stock’s price than customarily associated with larger, more established company stocks.
In order to qualify for the favorable tax treatment generally available to regulated investment companies, the Fund must satisfy certain diversification requirements. The Fund’s strategy of investing in a relatively small number of securities may cause it inadvertently to fail to satisfy the diversification requirements. If the Fund were to fail to qualify as a regulated investment company, it would be taxed in the same manner as an ordinary corporation, and distributions to its shareholders would not be deductible by the Fund in computing its taxable income.
The Fund may not be suitable for all investors. We encourage you to consult with appropriate financial professionals before considering an investment in the Fund.
Distributed by Foreside Fund Services, LLC. www.foreside.com
Liberty Street Advisors, Inc. is the advisor to the Fund. The Fund is part of the Liberty Street family of funds within the series of Investment Managers Series Trust.

Liberty Street Advisors Announces the Launch of the Robinson Tax Advantaged Income Fund (ROBAX, ROBCX, ROBNX)

						 from   Liberty Street Advisors, Inc. 











 
















































 

 




















 


NEW YORK, Oct. 2, 2014 /PRNewswire/ -- Liberty Street Advisors, Inc., an SEC registered investment advisor, announced the launch of the Robinson Tax Advantaged Income Fund ("the Fund") (ROBAX, ROBCX, ROBNX), the fourth in its series of funds focused on income production and inflation protection. The Liberty Street family of funds, which now has over $3.3 Billion in assets as of September 30th, 2014 also includes the Center Coast MLP Focus Fund (CCCAX, CCCCX, CCCNX), the Capital Innovations Global Agri, Timber, Infrastructure Fund (INNAX, INNCX, INNNX), the Horizon Spin-Off and Corporate Restructuring Fund (LSHAX, LSHCX, LSHUX), the West Loop Realty Fund (REIAX, REICX, REIIX) and the Toroso Newfound Tactical Allocation Fund (TNTAX, TNTCX, TNTNX). 
The Robinson Tax Advantaged Income Fund is led by veteran Fixed Income manager, James Robinson. Mr. Robinson is an investment manager and bond trader with more than three decades of experience. Mr. Robinson served for five years as the Chairman and CEO of Birmingham-based Munder Capital Management and President of the Munder Funds, where he was responsible for an investment complex with approximately $38 billion in assets under management. From 1987 to 1999, Mr. Robinson served as Executive Vice President and Chief Investment Officer-Fixed Income with Munder Capital Management, when income assets under management grew to more than $20 billion. Mr. Robinson was the sole architect of the firm's dynamic targeted duration fixed income investment process.
"Jim brings with him an investment style that is driven by proprietary financial models backed by years of experience analyzing not only the underlying municipal credits but also the historical dislocations and trading behavior of Closed End Funds," said Tim Reick, CEO of Liberty Street Advisors.
"Since its founding in December 2012, Robinson Capital has specialized in developing alternative value investing strategies, particularly through closed-end funds, that pursue the generation of higher cash flows than, and have lower correlations with stock and bond markets," said Jim Robinson, "We typically assemble portfolios of 30-40 closed-end Municipal Bond Funds that are diversified by underlying credits, investment manager, and trade at what we believe to be irrational discounts to their net asset value."
"A mutual fund consisting of closed-end Municipal Bond Funds is a natural fit for the Liberty Street fund family, the tax advantaged income stream that the Fund seeks to provide is consistent with our product offering," said Reick, "While closed-end Municipal Bond Funds have certainly been an option for investors historically, we believe that the exposure of a diversified portfolio of these funds along with the potential to hedge duration risk, is something that has not been previously made available to the retail investor. The Robinson Tax Advantaged Income Fund provides investors' access to a manager with extensive knowledge who has been investing in these markets for over 30 years." 
The Fund provides daily liquidity and is available in A, C, and Institutional share classes. The Robinson Tax Advantaged Income Fund intends to invest in a focused portfolio of approximately 30-40 closed-end funds, which invest primarily in Municipal Bond Funds. The Fund is currently available at TD Ameritrade and Pershing. 
For more information on the Robinson Tax Advantaged Income Fund, call 800 207-7108. Financial professionals only can call HRC Fund Associates, LLC ("HRC"), Member FINRA/SIPC, at 800 213-3080. HRC is the affiliated broker-dealer of Liberty Street Advisors. 
About Liberty Street AdvisorsLiberty Street Advisors, Inc. offers investors mutual funds, which are sub-advised by third party boutique independent managers who possess a particular expertise in their space. Importantly, in creating a mutual fund, Liberty Street is unconstrained and un-conflicted in its selection of the investment strategies and sub-advisors. Through its selective multi-manager family of funds, Liberty Street provides access to timely investment strategies designed to help investors and financial advisors meet the challenges of today's market environment. With $3.3 billion in assets under management as of September 30th, 2014 Liberty Street is the advisor to the Center Coast MLP Focus Fund, the Capital Innovations Global Agri, Timber, Infrastructure Fund, the Horizon Spin-Off and Corporate Restructuring Fund, the West Loop Realty Fund and the Toroso Newfound Tactical Allocation Fund. 
About Robinson Capital Management, LLCFounded in December 2012, Robinson is an independent investment advisor focused on wealth preservation for institutions, family offices and high net worth individuals. The firm specializes in developing alternative value investing strategies, particularly though closed-end funds, that pursue the generation of higher cash flow yields than, and have lower correlations with stock and bond markets. Robinson Capital's CEO is James Robinson, a veteran bond trader who formerly headed Michigan's largest private money management firm and specialized in developing investment management solutions for leading insurance companies.
About the FundThe Robinson Tax Advantaged Income Fund (the "Fund") is an open-ended mutual fund investing primarily in Closed-End Funds ("CEF"), which invest primarily in municipal bonds ("Municipal CEFs"). A substantial portion of the income generated to the Fund is expected to consist primarily of tax advantaged income by way of the underlying CEF's investments in municipal bonds. Robinson Capital Management, LLC ("Robinson"), the Fund's sub-advisor, provides an experienced professional management team with extensive knowledge of the CEF and municipal bond markets. The investment strategy first identifies a portfolio of Municipal CEFs to generate tax advantaged income to the Fund. In addition, Robinson seeks to identify CEFs that trade at discounts to their true market value of the CEFs' municipal bond holdings, and utilizes a number of trading techniques to unlock its estimate of the value of the premiums/discounts in the CEFs. Seeking to hedge against interest rate risk and mitigate the Fund's exposure to duration risk, Robinson may use short positions – primarily in the U.S. Treasury Futures contracts of various maturities. 
Before investing you should carefully consider the Fund's investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses. This and other information is in the prospectus and summary prospectus, a copy of which may be obtained by calling (800) 207-7108 or by visiting the Fund's website at www.robinsonincomefund.com. Please read the prospectus and summary prospectus carefully before you invest. 
RISK AND OTHER DISCLOSURES:An investment in the Fund is subject to risk, including the possible loss of principal amount invested and including, but not limited to, the following risks, which are more fully described in the prospectus:

The Fund will invest in shares of closed-end funds (CEFs). Investments in CEFs are subject to various risks, including reliance on management's ability to manage the CEF portfolio, fluctuation in the market value of CEF shares, and the Fund bearing a pro rata share of the fees and expenses of each underlying CEF in which the Fund invests. 
The underlying CEFs in which the Fund invests will invest primarily in municipal bonds. Litigation, legislation or other political events, local business or economic conditions or the bankruptcy of the issuer could have a significant effect on the ability of an issuer of municipal bonds to make payments of principal and/or interest. Changes related to taxation, legislation or the rights of municipal security holders can significantly affect municipal bonds. 
The underlying CEFs in which the Fund invests will invest primarily in fixed income securities. Interest rates have been and continue to be low relative to historical levels. A rise in interest rates could negatively impact the value of the Fund's shares. Generally, fixed income securities decrease in value if interest rates rise, and increase in value if interest rates fall, with longer-term securities being more sensitive than shorter-term securities. These risks are greater during periods of rising inflation. 
It is expected that the CEFs in which the Fund will invest will be leveraged as a result of borrowing or other investment techniques. As a result, the Fund will be exposed indirectly to leverage, and may expose the Fund to higher volatility in the market value of such CEF and the possibility that the Fund's long-term returns will be diminished. In addition, regulations implemented pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, particularly the Volcker Rule, may in the future hinder or restrict a CEF's ability to maintain leverage; which in turn may reduce the total return and tax exempt income generated by the underlying CEFs in which the Fund will invest and may cause a reduction in the value of the Fund's shares. 
There is no guarantee that the Fund's income will be exempt from regular federal income taxes. Events occurring after the date of issuance of a municipal bond or after a CEF's acquisition of a municipal bond may result in a determination that interest is subject to federal income tax. Federal or state changes in the tax treatment of municipal bonds may make municipal bonds less attractive as investments and cause them to decline in value. 
The Fund and the CEFs held by the Fund may use derivative instruments, futures contracts, options, swap agreements, and/or sell securities short. Each of these instruments and strategies involve risks different from direct investments in the underlying assets. Risks include: futures contracts may cause the value of the Fund's shares to be more volatile and expose the Fund to leverage and tracking risks; the Fund may not fully benefit from or may lose money on option or shorting strategies; swaps may be leveraged, are subject to counterparty risk and may be difficult to value or liquidate. 
The Fund's turnover rate may be high. A high turnover rate may lead to higher transaction costs, a greater number of taxable transactions, and negatively affect the Fund's performance. 
As a non-diversified fund, the Fund may focus its assets in the securities of fewer issuers, which exposes the Fund to greater market risk than if its assets were diversified among a greater number of issuers. 
The Fund is newly organized and has no operating history. As a result, prospective investors have no track record or history on which to base their investment decisions. 
Diversification does not assure a profit or protect against a loss.
The Fund may not be suitable for all investors. We encourage you to consult with appropriate tax and financial professionals before considering an investment in the Fund.

"StampManage is an elegant, full-feature 
	Windows inventory program for United States and Canadian stamps....The program allows you to enter more information about your stamps 
	than any other inventory program I've come across........the author of the program, has created a versatile program that is 
	comprehensive, yet not overly complex...." - William F. Sharpe

						and download the latest program updates. Free 
						Updates every few months include additional 
						data, images, reports and program features.

						Protect your data with our automatic data backup.  
						Your data and images will automatically be backed up at 
						an interval you specify.

						will have a complete record of your collection.  
						Invaluable for insurance in the case of loss or 
						theft.


						StampManage lets you work with the Entire 
						240,200 stamp database, compare to other leading 
						programs which only load 1 country at a time.  The 
						advantage to our method is you can see your inventory 
						for all the countries you have entered..

						your entire world stamp collection. Search the entire 
						stamp variety database for topical stamps, 
						stamps between a certain range of years, stamps of a

						hundreds of dollars more for additional country CDs unlike other 
						expensive (and non refundable) stamp software.
						












"...I 
	  would like to say that I really like StampManage, having looked at other 
	  (very expensive) stamp database programs. I especially like the fact that 
	  all of (well, almost all) the countries of the world are in a single 
	  database allowing me to identify some of the peculiar stamps that belong 
	  to territories of various European countries." 
	  - Bill
