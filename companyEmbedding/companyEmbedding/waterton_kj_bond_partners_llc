Butane (/ˈbjuːteɪn/) is an organic compound with the formula C4H10 that is an alkane with four carbon atoms. Butane is a gas at room temperature and atmospheric pressure. The term may refer to either of two structural isomers, n-butane or isobutane (also called "methylpropane"), or to a mixture of these isomers. In the IUPAC nomenclature, however, "butane" refers only to the n-butane isomer (which is the isomer with the unbranched structure). Butanes are highly flammable, colorless, easily liquefied gases. The name butane comes from the roots but- (from butyric acid, named after the Greek word for butter) and -ane. It was discovered by the chemist Edward Frankland in 1849.[6]

Rotation about the central C−C bond produces two different conformations (trans and gauche) for n-butane.[7]
Reactions[edit]

When oxygen is plentiful, butane burns to form carbon dioxide and water vapor; when oxygen is limited, carbon (soot) or carbon monoxide may also be formed.
When there is sufficient oxygen:

2 C4H10 + 13 O2 → 8 CO2 + 10 H2O

When oxygen is limited:

2 C4H10 + 9 O2 → 8 CO + 10 H2O

The maximum adiabatic flame temperature of butane with air is 2,243 K (1,970 °C; 3,578 °F).
n-Butane is the feedstock for DuPont's catalytic process for the preparation of maleic anhydride:

2 CH3CH2CH2CH3 + 7 O2 → 2 C2H2(CO)2O + 8 H2O

n-Butane, like all hydrocarbons, undergoes free radical chlorination providing both 1-chloro- and 2-chlorobutanes, as well as more highly chlorinated derivatives. The relative rates of the chlorination is partially explained by the differing bond dissociation energies, 425 and 411 kJ/mol for the two types of C-H bonds.
Uses[edit]
Normal butane can be used for gasoline blending, as a fuel gas, fragrance extraction solvent, either alone or in a mixture with propane, and as a feedstock for the manufacture of ethylene and butadiene, a key ingredient of synthetic rubber. Isobutane is primarily used by refineries to enhance (increase) the octane number of motor gasoline.[8][9][10][11]
When blended with propane and other hydrocarbons, it may be referred to commercially as LPG, for liquefied petroleum gas. It is used as a petrol component, as a feedstock for the production of base petrochemicals in steam cracking, as fuel for cigarette lighters and as a propellant in aerosol sprays such as deodorants.[12]
Very pure forms of butane, especially isobutane, can be used as refrigerants and have largely replaced the ozone-layer-depleting halomethanes, for instance in household refrigerators and freezers. The system operating pressure for butane is lower than for the halomethanes, such as R-12, so R-12 systems such as in automotive air conditioning systems, when converted to pure butane will not function optimally and therefor a mix of isobutane and propane is used to give cooling system performance comparable to R-12.
Butane is also used as lighter fuel for a common lighter or butane torch and is sold bottled as a fuel for cooking and camping stoves. Butane canisters are almost exclusively manufactured in South Korea with the only exception being one manufacturer in Houston, Texas.[13] Butane canisters manufactured in South Korea contain butane from Saudi Arabia, while the American manufacturer fills canisters with domestic butane.[14]
In this form it is often mixed with small amounts of hydrogen sulfide and mercaptans which will give the unburned gas an offensive smell easily detected by the human nose. In this way, butane leaks can easily be identified. While hydrogen sulfide and mercaptans are toxic, they are present in levels so low that suffocation and fire hazard by the butane becomes a concern far before toxicity. Most commercially available butane also contains a certain amount of contaminant oil which can be removed through filtration but which will otherwise leave a deposit at the point of ignition and may eventually block the uniform flow of gas. Contaminants are not used in fragrance extraction and can cause gas explosions poorly ventilated areas if leaks go unnoticed and are ignited by spark or flame.
Cordless hair irons are usually powered by butane cartridges.[15]

Effects and health issues[edit]
Inhalation of butane can cause euphoria, drowsiness, narcosis, asphyxia, cardiac arrhythmia, fluctuations in blood pressure and temporary memory loss, when abused directly from a highly pressurized container, and can result in death from asphyxiation and ventricular fibrillation. It enters the blood supply and within seconds produce intoxication.[16] Butane is the most commonly misused volatile substance in the UK, and was the cause of 52% of solvent related deaths in 2000.[17] By spraying butane directly into the throat, the jet of fluid can cool rapidly to −20 °C (−4 °F) by expansion, causing prolonged laryngospasm.[18] "Sudden sniffer's death" syndrome, first described by Bass in 1970,[19] is the most common single cause of solvent related death, resulting in 55% of known fatal cases.[18]
A small amount of nitrogen dioxide, a toxic gas, results from burning butane gas, along with any combustion in the earth's atmosphere, and represents a human health hazard from home heaters and stoves.[20]

(Logo:  http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20100908/CG61365LOGO)
Constructed in 2008, Parc Alpharetta is a four-story, two-building midrise structure containing 210 units consisting of 85 one-bedroom/one-bathroom, 26 one-bedroom/one and a half bathroom, 93 two-bedroom/two-bathroom, and six two-bedroom/two and a half bathroom townhome units.
Parc Alpharetta, Alpharetta's only active adult (55+) community, offers services and amenities today's active seniors find appealing including a fitness center with wellness salon, exercise classes, library and business center, shuttle services, planned social events, convenient walking paths and a beautifully landscaped courtyard with a meditation garden, luxury pool and deck, an upscale community room with a private catering/dining area, multi-purpose media room, conveniently located elevators, a gated parking deck and more. Additionally, Parc Alpharetta's well-appointed apartment homes offer 18 different spacious floor plans, balconies or sunrooms, walk-in closets, 9-foot or 10-foot ceilings, designer details, black Whirlpool® appliances and in-unit washers and dryers.
"The future trending within this niche demographic offers reason to be optimistic," said Max Peek, vice president, acquisitions, Waterton Residential. "Parc Alpharetta represented a great opportunity to buy a newer construction asset in an affluent submarket with traditionally high barriers to entry."
Located west of Highway 400 off Westside Drive in Alpharetta, Georgia, residents of Parc Alpharetta have access to shopping and dining less than a mile from the property with North Point Mall (anchored by Sears, JC Penney, Dillard's, Macy's and over 180 specialty retailers). Alpharetta includes much of the North Fulton office corridor consisting of over 15.4 million square feet of primarily class A office space.
Originally developed by Wood Partners and Parc Communities, Parc Alpharetta was financed initially with low floater bonds issued by the City of Alpharetta to fund construction. Waterton intends to remarket and enhance the bonds. Parc Alpharetta which closed June 1 was acquired as part of Waterton Residential Property Venture XI, a $500 million discretionary multifamily investment venture and is the first age-restricted apartment community in Waterton's portfolio. www.watertonresidential.com

Waterton Global Raises $725 million for Parallel Private Equity Fund
			  



























































 















TORONTO, June 14, 2016 /CNW/ - Waterton Global Resource Management ("Waterton Global") is pleased to announce the final closing of its third private equity fund Waterton Parallel Fund (the "Parallel Fund"), with total capital commitments of U.S. $725,000,000.
The Parallel Fund, along with Waterton Precious Metals Fund II Cayman, LP ("Fund II"), which received over U.S. $1 billion in capital commitments in April 2014, will provide additional capital for Waterton Global to continue pursuing its strategy of generally targeting production and late-stage development assets in the precious metals sector that are located in politically stable jurisdictions, through acquisitions, joint ventures and partnerships. Since inception, Fund II, has successfully transacted on high quality assets with leading international mining companies.
"We are gratified by the level of support from many of our existing investors in Fund II who have committed new capital to the Parallel Fund, and from new investors who see the merit in our unique multidisciplinary investment platform," said Isser Elishis, Managing Partner and Chief Investment Officer of Waterton Global.
"We intend to maintain our focused and disciplined approach to investing, while remaining a nimble and preferred transaction partner. Our ability to expediently assess, evaluate and execute upon opportunities will continue to distinguish Waterton Global in the mining space."
Atlantic-Pacific Capital, the largest privately-owned global placement agent and advisory firm, served as the exclusive global placement agent for the Waterton Parallel Fund.

Waterton Global Announces Purchase of Assets from Barrick Gold for $110 Million
			  



























































 















TORONTO, Nov. 12, 2015 /CNW/ - Waterton Global Resource Management ("Waterton") today announced that it has reached an agreement whereby subsidiaries of Waterton Precious Metals Fund II Cayman, LP will purchase Barrick Gold Corporation's (NYSE:  ABX)(TSX:ABX) ("Barrick") 70 percent interest in the Spring Valley project and 100 percent of the Ruby Hill mine for a total of $110 million in cash.
"We are very pleased to have reached an agreement with Barrick to acquire these advanced stage development and production assets, from a sought-after package of properties. These latest acquisitions underscore our commitment to acquiring high quality assets in favorable jurisdictions like the State of Nevada, where Waterton already has a diverse and growing portfolio," said Isser Elishis, CIO of Waterton Global. 
"I want to thank Barrick and our in-house team of interdisciplinary professionals, whose experience, expertise and diligent execution, enabled Waterton to participate in this opportunity. We appreciate Barrick's recognition that we were uniquely placed to transact on these assets in a quick and constructive manner," continued Mr. Elishis.
Spring Valley is an open-pit, oxide heap leach gold project located 75 miles west of Cortez in Nevada. It offers a highly prospective land package with significant exploration upside and potential. The property spans 11,022 gross acres on 618 contiguous unpatented lode and placer mining claims and 1,701 gross acres of fee lands.
The Ruby Hill mine is an open-pit, heap leach gold mine located on the Battle Mountain / Eureka gold trend. Since 2006, prior to commencing the permitting of the next phases of mining, the Ruby Hill mine produced over 1.4 Moz of gold. The mine offers additional gold and base metal potential.
The transaction is expected to be completed by the end of 2015 and is subject to customary closing conditions. Upon closing, Waterton anticipates working expediently to advance the projects and integrate the Spring Valley and Ruby Hill assets into its growing portfolio of high quality advanced stage development and production assets.
Stikeman Elliot LLP acted as Waterton's Canadian legal advisors, and Davis Graham & Stubbs LLP acted as Waterton's US legal advisors, in connection with the acquisition.
