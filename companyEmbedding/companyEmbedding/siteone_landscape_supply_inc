SiteOne Landscape Supply, Inc. Announces Secondary Public Offering of Common Stock


July 20, 2017



SiteOne Landscape Supply, Inc. Announces Secondary Public Offering of Common Stock
ROSWELL, Ga.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--
      SiteOne Landscape Supply, Inc. (NYSE:SITE) (the “Company”) today
      announced an underwritten secondary public offering of an aggregate of
      5,437,502 shares of common stock by selling stockholders CD&R Landscape
      Holdings, L.P., an affiliate of Clayton, Dubilier & Rice, LLC, and Deere
      & Company.
    
      Deutsche Bank Securities is acting as the sole underwriter in the
      registered public offering of those shares. Deutsche Bank Securities
      intends to offer for sale the shares of common stock from time to time
      in one or more transactions on the New York Stock Exchange, in the
      over-the-counter market, through negotiated transactions or otherwise
      subject to receipt and acceptance by it and subject to its right to
      reject any order in whole or in part. The Company will not receive any
      proceeds from the sale of shares being sold in this offering.
    
      The Company’s effective registration statement, including a prospectus,
      relating to the offering was previously filed with the U.S. Securities
      and Exchange Commission (SEC). Investors should read the prospectus in
      that registration statement and other documents the Company has filed
      with the SEC as well as the prospectus supplement related to this
      offering before investing for more complete information about the
      Company and this offering. These documents are available for free by
      searching for the Company’s public filings on the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov.
      Alternatively, copies of the prospectus supplement and the accompanying
      prospectus, when available, may be obtained from Deutsche Bank
      Securities Inc., Attention: Prospectus Group, 60 Wall Street, New York,
      NY 10005, by telephone at 1-800-503-4611 or by email at prospectus.cpdg@db.com.
    
      The offering of these securities is being made only by means of the
      prospectus supplement and the accompanying prospectus. This press
      release shall not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an
      offer to buy nor shall there be any sale of these shares in any state or
      jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be
      unlawful, prior to registration or qualification under the securities
      laws of such state or jurisdiction.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.



Value Score
A


Growth Score

Momentum Score

VGM Score

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

The ever popular one-page Snapshot reports are generated for virtually every single Zacks Ranked stock. It's packed with all of the company's key stats and salient decision making information. Including the Zacks Rank, Zacks Industry Rank, Style Scores, the Price, Consensus & Surprise chart, graphical estimate analysis and how a stocks stacks up to its peers.
The detailed multi-page Analyst report does an even deeper dive on the company's vital statistics. In addition to all of the proprietary analysis in the Snapshot, the report also visually displays the four components of the Zacks Rank (Agreement, Magnitude, Upside and Surprise); provides a comprehensive overview of the company business drivers, complete with earnings and sales charts; a recap of their last earnings report; and a bulleted list of reasons to buy or sell the stock. It also includes an industry comparison table to see how your stock compares to its expanded industry, and the S&P 500.
Researching stocks has never been so easy or insightful as with the ZER Analyst and Snapshot reports.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

Investors and traders can learn a lot about a stock’s momentum when it sets a new 52-week high. As an example, bullish investors view a company hitting its highest price in a year as a sign of 
momentum and may interpret it as a signal to buy. On the other hand, bearish investors could view a new 52-week high as a signal of the end of a strong run, with the stock possibly peaking out 
before an impending period of decline.
