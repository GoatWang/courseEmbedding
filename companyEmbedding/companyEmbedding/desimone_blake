WebMD Appoints Blake DeSimone as Chief Financial Officer

WebMD Reaffirms its Financial Guidance; Expects Results to be Around High End of Range




Sep 27, 2016, 8:00am EDT














NEW YORK, Sept. 27, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- WebMD Health Corp. (NASDAQ WBMD), the leading source of health information, today announced that the Board of Directors has appointed Blake DeSimone, its Senior Vice President of Finance, as its Chief Financial Officer.  Mr. DeSimone succeeds Peter Anevski who is leaving the Company.
Mr. DeSimone, 40, joined WebMD as its Senior Vice President of Finance in June 2015.  In that role, he has been responsible for the Company's SEC and financial reporting, financial planning and analysis, and treasury management. Prior to joining WebMD, Mr. DeSimone was Chief Financial Officer of D+M Holdings, a global consumer electronics company that had approximately $500 million of annual revenue during his tenure.  Prior to that, he was President and CFO of Advogent Group, Inc., a services company providing sales and marketing support to the healthcare industry.  He also served in other executive roles at Cardinal Health and Boron Lepore & Associates, Inc.  Mr. DeSimone is a Certified Public Accountant and started his career in Arthur Andersen's Assurance Practice. 
Steven L. Zatz, M.D., Chief Executive Officer of WebMD, said "I congratulate Blake on his promotion. Over the past year, I have had the opportunity to work closely with Blake, who has been a strong leader in our finance organization. Blake provides a unique combination of financial, operational and healthcare experience that will be of great value to the Company in his new role."  Dr. Zatz added, "We thank Pete for his many contributions during his tenure with the Company and wish him well in his future endeavors."
"I am excited to have this opportunity to become WebMD's Chief Financial Officer," said Mr. DeSimone. "We have a strong finance organization and I expect my transition to be seamless. I look forward to working closely with Steve to drive the future growth of WebMD." 
WebMD also announced today that it expects its financial results for the third quarter and full year of 2016 to be around the high end of its financial guidance issued on August 8, 2016. That financial guidance and this reaffirmation do not reflect the impact of deployment of capital for items such as share repurchases, convertible note repurchases or acquisitions, gains or losses from discontinued operations, or other non-recurring, one-time or unusual items in the quarters for which guidance was provided, including stock repurchases and severance related to recent management changes in the third quarter of 2016. 
As previously announced, WebMD will hold its Annual Meeting of Stockholders on September 29, 2016, beginning at 9:30 a.m. (ET), at W New York – Union Square, 201 Park Avenue South, New York, New York.

D+M Gets Acting Sales, Marketing President

By: Joseph PalencharFollow @thebauminator  




















Mahwah, N.J. – Blake DeSimone, who has been the chief financial officer for D+M Group’s America’s business, was appointed last month to the position of acting president of the company’s Americas sales and marketing organization, the company said.
DeSimone is filling the position vacated by Brian Poggi, who left in October as part of a restructuring that eliminated several positions at the company.
DeSimone “has assumed day-to-day management responsibilities on an interim basis and works closely with Jim Caudill, D+M Group CEO, on commercial strategy decisions as the midterm organization structure is finalized,” a spokesperson said. Kevin Zarow, sales VP for the Americas, reports directly to Blake and continues his primary responsibility for all customer relationships, the company said.
Poggi left the company along with several others in October as part of a restructuring in which Andrew Clark, global business team leader of soundbars and speakers, left to become president of Peachtree Audio. Stephen Shenefield left as program management director for D+M brands Denon and Boston Acoustics.
