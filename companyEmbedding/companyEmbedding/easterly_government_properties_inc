Striving to be the  partner of choice for the U.S. Government





Our Company
We focus primarily on the acquisition, development and management of Class A commercial properties that are leased to U.S. Government agencies that serve essential U.S. Government functions. We generate substantially all of our revenue by leasing our properties to such agencies through the GSA.

Overview
We identify U.S. Government agencies that we believe to have the most enduring missions, including a range of growing federal agencies such as the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Drug Enforcement Administration. We then identify the most critical buildings within the hierarchy of these agencies for acquisition or the projects proposed by such agencies for development.






History

Darrell W. Crate, William C. Trimble, III, and F. Joseph Moravec all previously worked together at Easterly Partners since it was founded in 2011. Together they raised two institutional private fund vehicles, acquiring 16 properties leased to government entities, primarily through the GSA, totaling 1.5 million square feet.
Over the last two decades, Michael P. Ibe has owned Western Devcon, Inc., a private real estate company focused primarily on the acquisition and development of built-to-suit GSA properties. Under Mr. Ibe’s leadership, Western Devcon has developed 19 build-to-suit projects for the GSA comprising 1.0 million square feet.
In 2014, seeing the wealth of opportunities in the GSA-leased space, Easterly Partners decided to team with Western Devcon, to form an internally managed REIT focused on the acquisition, development and management of Class A commercial properties that are leased primarily to the U.S. Government.
These discussions led to the birth of a newly organized and internally managed REIT focused on the acquisition, development and management of Class A commercial properties that are leased primarily to the U.S. Government.
To create our initial portfolio, the Easterly Funds contributed 15 properties to the new REIT while Western Devcon contributed 14 properties. In addition, certain senior team members of Western Devcon, including Michael P. Ibe, joined Easterly, bringing extensive development capabilities to our acquisition and management platform.
We completed our initial public offering on February 11, 2015.


Culture & Values

Our multidisciplinary team possesses complementary skills and experience that we expect will drive our business and growth strategies. We plan to grow our business primarily through the pursuit of attractive acquisition opportunities, the development of built-to-suit U.S. Government properties and the renewal of existing leases at positive spreads.
We maintain a proprietary database that tracks approximately 8,500 leases totaling approximately 200 million rentable square feet and includes substantially every major U.S. Government-leased property that meets our investment criteria as well as information about the ownership of such properties.

26001 Redlands Blvd, Loma Linda, Calif.
Easterly Government Properties Inc. closed on a $127.5 million mortgage loan for the Department of Veterans Affairs Ambulatory Care Facility in Loma Linda, Calif. Easterly acquired the 327,614-square-foot asset in June 2017. The 10-year non-amortizing loan carries a fixed interest rate of 3.59 percent per year.
State-of-the-Art Medical Facility
Located on a 37-acre site at 26001 Redlands Blvd., the asset traded for $212.5 million (less than the expected sale price) and is  second-largest Veterans Affairs outpatient facility in the country. JLL’s Capital Markets Government Solutions team led by Executive Vice President Brian Saal and Senior Managing Director Bill Prutting closed the transaction.
The property is 100 percent leased to the U.S. Government through May 2036 for a total initial, non-cancelable lease term of 20 years, offering comprehensive medical services to the 72,000 U.S. veterans who live in the region. The building is situated in close proximity to Interstate 10 and two miles northeast of the federally-owned Jerry L. Pettis Memorial VA Center.
“We are pleased to take advantage of the current low-interest rate environment to lock in a competitive rate, and further extend the average maturity of the Company’s debt to 8.9 years,” said Meghan Baivier, Easterly Government Properties’ chief financial and operating officer, in a prepared statement. “We believe this transaction highlights the company’s capital markets expertise and is indicative of the credit quality of its portfolio.”
Washington, D.C.-based Easterly Government Properties focuses primarily on the acquisition, development and management of Class A commercial properties leased to the U.S. Government.

Style Scores:



D Value | D Growth | D Momentum | F VGM                


The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.


Value Score
A


Growth Score

Momentum Score

VGM Score

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.
