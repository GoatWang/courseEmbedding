	Interview conducted by:


	Lynn Fosse, Senior Editor, CEOCFO Magazine, Published - September 26, 2016
 


CEOCFO:
Mr. Alfonsi, according to your site, WRAPmail is the easiest way to 
	promote someone and their business. How so?


Mr. Alfonsi: 
	In the simplest format, we take a regular email and we are able to inject 
	rich HTML content for day-to-day one-on-one emails. It is clickable, 
	trackable and recordable to the end user.
 


CEOCFO: 
	Why do we want this?



Mr. 
	Alfonsi: 
	Currently there over 2.5 billion email users sending over 200 billion Emails 
	a day, this is unequivocally the most pervasive form of communication, and 
	if you are sending emails as a regular course of business why not make each 
	email the best it can be, and a tool to brand and market your company, you 
	can message anything from a simple about us, to testimonials, couponing, 
	and even direct sales. Each email empowers the recipient to take an action, 
	to interact with your brand or drive them to your front line drive marketing 
	tool, your website. Wrapmail gives the user the ability to brand and market 
	with every email, it is that simple. From the C suite to the stockroom 
	employees send emails, if youre not empowering each email with Wrapmail 
	youre not branding, youre losing opportunity and youre losing business.

 


CEOCFO: 
	Why are people still clicking with all of the security issues?



Mr. 
	Alfonsi: 
	This is not spamming or bulk email, this is a known recipient; this is 
	simply maximizing what your employees are doing every day, youre not 
	changing the habits and process, with the Wrapmail solution your taking  
	daily emails and now making them an additional tool to bolster your brand 
	and increase sales.

 


CEOCFO: 
	Are companies trying to do this on their own and are many companies not 
	realizing the value of email and the branding of email?


Mr. Alfonsi: 
	In todays environment we came to the realization that a new generation is 
	starting to take over the old, which is good for our industry, especially 
	for a company like ours. Whereas the old guard saw email as strictly a form 
	of communication, the new generation is immersed in technology from the 
	start and they know how to utilize and maximize all of the tools afforded 
	them, business should take advantage of every opportunity to interact with a 
	client or potential client and email is unequivocally used the most out of 
	all forms of communication. The goal is always to get the user to take 
	action; with Wrapmail a simple click on a link starts the process, candidly 
	many clients dont know what other services you can provide them with, 
	instead of a client searching for solutions youre putting the information 
	directly in front of them in a non-offensive manner, educating, showcasing, 
	informing

 


CEOCFO: 
	What is the technology? What was the challenge in putting the technology 
	together so this is done easily and companies are able to utilize it?


Mr. Alfonsi: 
	If you go to a Mail Chimp or a Constant Contact, you have to have some kind 
	of ability to write code for HTML. That is not what we do. If you can upload 
	a picture and select a hot spot our technology does the rest, it gives the 
	user the ability to link that particular picture or segments of pictures 
	right to a clickable event. That was challenge one. Challenge two is how we 
	deliver and getting clean delivery with all the different providers, today 
	we have the ability to inject Wraps in Outlook from 2003 to 2016, Gmail. 
	Hotmail. Yahoo and SalesForce plus a few others, which admittedly was the 
	biggest challenge, building the plug-ins that deliver the content after you 
	create it. We were able to achieve that and now it is simple, create the 
	content and all your employees have to do is download the plug-in, 
	authenticate themselves with the username and password and they are 
	immediately WRAPping. As well we have initiated our mobile apps and soon you 
	can use Wrapmail on virtually all Mobile Devices with a simple app download.

 


CEOCFO: 
	How long has WRAPmail been in the marketplace?


Mr. Alfonsi: 
	WRAPmail has been in the marketplace since 2008, I took the company over in 
	2015 and performed a overhaul on the platform and technology to what we call 
	Wrapmail 2.0 today. When I first saw the initial version of WRAPmail, I knew 
	there was something there, but also that it needed some work to make the 
	user experience seamless and enjoyable, which I believe we have achieved, 
	the product is now very scalable and has great functionality. We currently 
	have thousands of users and are looking to scale to millions that is the 
	goal. We moved our hosting to the Azure Microsoft Cloud, this gave us 
	scalability beyond our original server farm. As important weve stripped out 
	all the third party ads and now we are selling it for a simple annual price 
	which is highly completive and I believe has a ROI second to none.

 


CEOCOF: 
	How are you reaching out?


Mr. Alfonsi: 
	The proposition is straightforward, were using a direct drive to web 
	campaign utilizing both traditional and current marketing trends to push 
	traffic, as well the product is inherently driving referrals, people see it 
	and ask what it is and how do they get it. We are hopeful this trend 
	continues and Wrapmail goes viral.


CEOCFO: Are you just in North America today?


Mr. Alfonsi: 
	No, this is a global proposition, today our services are provided to all 
	English speaking Nations, and we expect to cross over into all countries and 
	languages in the near future either by license or direct.

 


CEOCFO: 
	What is involved when a company signs up? How does it get implemented?


Mr. Alfonsi: 
	Its a simple process, visit 


	www.wrapmail.com 
	and follow the links, currently were offering a 30 day free trial, there 
	after its a low annual fee of $299 for up to 5 users, very simple and very 
	straight forward. 

 


CEOCFO: Do 
	companies tend to use it for all of their emails or are they selective?


Mr. Alfonsi: 
	Each company has a different dynamic. The bigger company will have a sales 
	department, customer service, executive management etc. The marketing team 
	typically provides each of those departments with different content and 
	different options so we create different WRAPS for different divisions that 
	may have different messaging or purpose. They also have the option of not 
	wrapping, they can inject the wrap or take it away, Its a click of a mouse 
	and it is either there or not, very simple. 

 


CEOCFO: 
	Would you tell us about Prosperity Bullseye?


Mr. Alfonsi: 
	Bullseye is exciting. My first career was on Wall Street from 1996 to 2008, 
	one thing Wall Street does very well is to create a lot of paper work and 
	documentation, and of course everything is audited and regulated. At the 
	time there was no paperless back office, the retaining of documents for 
	record keeping, audits and regulatory request was overwhelming. I was set on 
	creating a solution, A CRM specific to serving the needs of the firms and 
	being compliant with the regulatory agencies, created a product that is 
	write once, read many. You cannot alter, change or delete anything that goes 
	into our system, not even as an administrator because you cannot get to the 
	database and its worm. More importantly, it encompasses a CRM that does 
	email, email campaigning, you cannot erase or delete emails. There is 
	document management where you can create a project, assign it to other 
	people. It is a very robust platform yet very simple to use, and you can 
	keep contemporaries notes on everything. Once the system was completed I was 
	able to secure several broker dealers, now 22 and counting and we have 
	crossed over to other industries including travel agencies, security 
	companies, consulting companies and there is a whole menu of different 
	industries with corporate governance issues, it is product I am very proud 
	of and one we will continue to grow.

 


CEOCFO: 
	WRAPmail is traded on the pink sheets.  How is that working for you and 
	where do you see it going?


Mr. Alfonsi: 
	Were a fully reporting company and beginning to develop our shareholder 
	base, Pink sheets is a great platform for emerging companies like ours, we 
	look to continue to grow and ultimately up list to a more senior exchange at 
	a time that our success warrants it. We are PCOAB audited and have a mandate 
	to be as transparent with our shareholders as possible, I answer as many 
	investor calls as possible myself when I have the time and enjoy the 
	interaction, we look forwarded to growing the revenue, earnings and value 
	for our investors.

 


CEOCFO: 
	Why do you think the opportunity has been missed by and large?


Mr. Alfonsi: 
	I think the product was initially ahead of its time like so many technology 
	products, timing is very important. We discussed some of the previous flaws 
	in the platform that have since been addressed and now we are going to 
	market at a time that I believe is right and we will realize great user 
	adoption and hopefully be a product that goes viral, thats what Im 
	expecting.

 


CEOCFO: 
	Why pay attention to WRAPmail today?


Mr. Alfonsi: 
	WRAPmail is a diamond in the rough. It has great technology and the 
	application is seamless, email use is at an all-time high and although we 
	have made great strides the real journey begins today!

 


CEOCFO: 
	Final thoughts?


Mr. Alfonsi: 
	You can start your 30 day free trial, so everybody should be Wrapping, 
	please visit www.wrapmail.com

(WRAP) Acquires HealthMax Group, enters Multi-Billion Dollar Cannabis IndustryMarketwiredJanuary 26, 2017ReblogShareTweetShareHICKSVILLE, NY--(Marketwired - Jan 26, 2017) - WRAPmail, Inc. (  OTC PINK :  WRAP ) (http://www.wrapmail.com) announced today they have acquired 100% of HealthMax Group (www.HealthMaxgroup.com), thereby entering the multi-billion dollar cannabis industry.HealthMax Group (HealthMax) is at the forefront of the hemp market, offering Cannabidiol (CBD) in its near purest form and infusing consumer products with their proprietary nano-technology. HealthMax's solution was designed to increase product efficacy significantly over just CBD alone. Offering advanced products that are lab tested to be 99% pure and consistently rated among consumers as their favorite, HealthMax looks to continue expanding into all areas of the industry. HealthMax is currently selling classic and nano-technology infused CBD products, has actively expanded its sales and distribution channels, and is positioned to take advantage of the incredible growth within the industry.The company will begin the process to formalize a name and symbol change consistent with the new company profile and WRAPmail and Prosperity Systems will operate as wholly owned subsidiaries.Mr. Marco Alfonsi, CEO of WRAPmail, stated, "After getting to know David and the HealthMax team over the past month, we concluded this acquisition was a great opportunity for HealthMax to enter the public markets, and an incredible value proposition for our shareholders. Utilizing our collective resources, it's with great enthusiasm we enter into this transaction."HealthMax Group President and COO David Posel stated, "I am very proud of the progress we've made in the hemp industry over this short time span, as well as our advancements in nano-technology delivery of our imported all-natural hemp. HALO CBD is medicinal grade CBD, which is clear and does not have the harsh hemp taste, black color, residual solvents or toxic fillers like many competing products. Some analysts are projecting a 2-billion-dollar market for the hemp industry, and I think we are poised to be a leading competitor in this market with the addition of our multi-spectrum and nano-technology infused formulations. With our new expansion into large-scale production and by engaging the larger food and beverage industry with multiple first-to-market products, HealthMax endeavors to disrupt the market and set the bar for higher quality standards across the board. What we do here is important for the health outcomes of people here in America and across the globe, and I am very proud of our team."About HealthMax GroupHealthMax is located in Seattle, Washington and focuses on emerging nano-technologies and first-to-market development activities on branded OTC and Medicinal Grade products containing the purest hemp derived Cannabidiol (CBD) isolate known to the company as the active medicinal ingredient, the sale of bulk CBD isolate and the marketing and sales of end consumer products. HealthMax pure CBD isolate is refined in a cGMP certified facility in Italy, which is the world's largest supplier of Organically grown certified industrial hemp, and is fully standardized 99% CBD by mass with nominal trace of THC or other contaminants.What is Important to Note: All HealthMax products are contamination-free and able to be double-blinded in all forms of clinical research, while many competitors offer CBD shatters, waxes, pastes, CBD-oils and Rick Simpson type products which cannot pass the same simple, yet critical blind testing requirements. This fact is the cornerstone that makes HealthMax products a premier choice for definitive Cannabidiol research, and why it can be used for multiple clinical and medicinal applications. Additional information is available by visiting the HealthMax website.LEGAL DISCLOSUREHealthMax Group, Inc. believes it is in compliance with the United States Controlled Substances Act (US.CSA) and not subject to the Farm Bill of 2014. Health Max does import, manufacture and sell hemp-based products and distributes federally legal hemp-based products for distribution and consumption in all 50 States and most countries.About WRAPmail, Inc.WRAPmail, Inc., a public company trading under the symbol WRAP, is comprised of two complimentary business offerings.
