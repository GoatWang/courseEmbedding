Historical Growth
Since Plains All American Pipeline's initial public offering in 1998, we have built and acquired a diverse portfolio of strategically located assets and today are one of the largest independent midstream energy companies in North America.


 



Energy in Motion
On average, Plains handles 4.7 million barrels per day of crude oil and natural gas liquids through our extensive network of assets located in key North American producing basins, major market hubs, and transportation gateways. This plays a vital role in the movement of U.S. and Canadian energy supplies.


 



Financial Vision
A major factor in Plains’ continued success is its ability to maintain a competitive cost of capital and access to capital markets. The company aims to continuously grow its distribution to Unitholders over time through a combination of organic and acquisition-oriented activities.














Plains All American Pipeline, L.P. (NYSE: PAA) is a publicly traded master limited partnership that owns and operates midstream energy infrastructure and provides logistics services for crude oil, natural gas liquids, natural gas and refined products. PAA owns an extensive network of pipeline transportation, terminalling, storage and gathering assets in key crude oil and NGL producing basins and transportation corridors and at major market hubs in the United States and Canada.
Plains GP Holdings (NYSE: PAGP) is a publicly traded entity that owns a non-economic controlling interest in the general partner of PAA and an indirect 14% limited partner interest in PAA, one of the largest energy infrastructure and logistics companies in North America.
