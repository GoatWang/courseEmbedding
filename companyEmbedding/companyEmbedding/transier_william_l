Forward-looking statements are statements that are not historical facts. Such forward-looking statements are based upon the current beliefs and expectations of our management, but are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results and/or the timing of events to differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements and are subject to risks and uncertainties detailed from time to time in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K, as amended, for the year ended April 30, 2015 and Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended January 31, 2016. The Company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission are available at www.sec.gov. You are urged to consider these factors carefully in evaluating the forward-looking statements herein and are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements, which are qualified in their entirety by this cautionary statement. The forward-looking statements speak only as of the date on which they are made and the Company undertakes no obligation to publicly update such forward-looking statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. No assurances can be given that our efforts to effectively reorganize under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code will ultimately be successful or that we will succeed in strengthening our balance sheet or increase our financial flexibility. Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect, actual outcomes may vary materially from those indicated.   The Company cautions that trading in the Company's securities during the pendency of the Chapter 11 cases is highly speculative and poses substantial risks. Although the Company does not yet have a plan of reorganization or an agreement with creditors and lessors for such a plan, no assurance can be given that, when the reorganization is completed, its ordinary shares will not be cancelled without any distribution being made to shareholders.   CHC Group MEDIA Susan Gordon, +1.214.262.7426 Senior Director, Global Communications susan.gordon@chc.ca   INVESTORS +1.604.247.7060 investor@chc.ca
