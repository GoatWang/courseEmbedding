2015 Reflection and 2016 Predictions

2015 has been a really positive year. Rocket Fuel EMEA has been active in eight territories internationally, each reporting significant growth, resulting in a substantial contribution to the global business.
It’s been interesting to see how each market reacts and progresses differently in the programmatic space. Take the UK for example, it continues to be a heavy dominator of RTB and in the programmatic space and it also tends to be the most experimental market.
Germany has embraced the RTB and programmatic space as a brand mechanism. This is due, in part, to publishers embracing the private network environment to sell their inventory.
 And in Italy we have seen a real adoption of the self-service model.
Alongside changes in local markets, Rocket Fuel has also seen some great product improvements and updates, such as Dynamic Creative, Cross Device Optimisation and mobile geo-targeting.
The purchase of [x+1] and the enterprise model saw an impactful shift on the axis of our business. The DMP conversation is absolutely at its zeitgeist. Companies understand the power of first party data and are determined to utilise it in an effective way. Now we have come to a time when you can combine that data with technology like ours, across a multitude of devices in an impactful way to power more effective and relevant advertising. The Forrester TEI study reports an average of 832% ROI from our DMP offering.
There has definitely been a fun side to 2015. I’ve had a great time at events that I’ve attended throughout the year. The ones that really stand out for me would have to be Cannes, dmexco and our fantastic company summit in Portugal where we had a three day conference with all of our EMEA employees.

One of my key highlights of 2015 has to be the people I have worked with this year, that’s why it was so important to me to hold a company summit where we could all get together. I’ve been working in media for over 25 years and in the end it comes down to the people that you work with. Revenue, customer satisfaction and growth are all critical factors, but you have to have good people working alongside you.
In summary, 2015 has been the year of growing up for Rocket Fuel. We’ve had a period of grown up business practices which will follow as our legacy over the next 5 years.
2016 for Rocket Fuel means continued investment and growth in the international business. Investment in product, marketing practices and our sales teams.
For the wider digital space, I think brand is going to come to real investment in in 2016. It’s been held so securely by TV, but we are definitely chasing that spend, giving ourselves and companies as a whole a real opportunity to show people impact at a brand level, programmatic TV is going to be a real game changer.

Brits believe Artificial Intelligence is a force for good not evil 

 
 

Artificial Intelligence continues to get headlines and there has been a lot of discussion about the negative impact this technology could have on our lives.  As a company that uses AI to power our business and drive better, more efficient outcomes for our clients’ marketing campaigns, we were interested to understand just what is the British public’s perception of Artificial Intelligence – so we carried out a survey to find out for ourselves.
The research showed:
• Nearly half of Brits (48%) believe AI is A force for good for good or mostly good
• Just 10% of Brits believe AI is a force for evil
• 42% of Brits are excited by AI or think it will solve big world problems
• A fifth (21%) see it as a threat or are scared by AI
• 45% don’t believe AI will impact their job
Does the British public understand what AI is?

The vast majority of the British public (92%) claim an understanding about what AI is, compared to just 8% who say that they do not know what it is. Surprisingly, nearly half of people believe that AI is something that is already currently used in everyday life (49%).
There is a much greater awareness of the uses of AI in everyday life amongst men than women, with women more likely to perceive AI as a thing of science fiction or limited to science labs (21%), compared to men (13%).
Brits are excited by artificial intelligence

The research indicates that men and older age groups represent the demographics with the most positive sentiment towards AI.
The research also finds that males (35%) in the UK are much more excited by AI than women (18%), and that more females (33%) than males (22%) are simply indifferent to AI.
Significantly, the over 65s are the age group most excited about AI (33%), compared to just 23% of 18-24 year olds.
A development that won’t threaten jobs

45% of respondents believe AI will not impact their job, which is more than double the number that do think it will affect their job either negatively or positively (19%). Just 9% of people believe AI will threaten their job.
The most suspicious of AI is the younger age group of 18-24 year olds with 20% citing AI as a force for evil, which is double the percentage of any other age group. It is also 18-24 year olds who believe that AI will threaten their jobs (18%), double that of any other age group.
The findings revealed the overall sentiment towards AI is very positive and the British public well informed. Our own position on AI is that with the right safeguards in place there is no reason to believe it will be a threat to humanity, AI offers practical improvements, innovation and efficiency to the UK, than any danger.
Rocket Fuel’s survey was conducted by Gorkana and to be broadly representative of the online population. The results are post weighted to be representative of the UK population according to Census data.

Reflection of dmexco 2015 

 
 

I have just returned from the busiest dmexco to date, it’s an event that continues to grow with over 30,000 people in attendance this year. Every company that is trading in an effective way across Europe tends to be on display at dmexco, which is a great way to catch up and network with contacts. Relationships are made, people come by and say hello, and you also get to have a look at your competitors, which is always an interesting thing to do. For Rocket Fuel it is an event that continues to create a significant amount of business and powerful incentive based on ROI.
Rocket Fuel at dmexco 2015
This year the topic of ad blocking seemed to be at the top of everyone’s agenda, due to the introduction of new technologies and browsers that have made ad blocking possible for the user to control.
My feelings on ad blocking haven’t changed since the day I got into digital media, I strongly believe that content has to find a way to pay for its self. Content owners, the industry and tech owners, such as Apple, need to understand that if they start blocking ads, they will effectively block content. A lot of “normal” internet users don’t understand that that’s the trade-off. I suspect that the technology will continue to be out there but the adoption of it will change. It may also iron out some of the poor practices, like over use of retargeting.
Measurement challenges was also a hot topic and is one of the critical factors that this industry needs to address. Customers want a metric that proves success, yet there still isn’t agreement as an industry as a whole as to what this metric is. Big industries such as TV and radio, which have been generating billions of dollars for many years have a unified metric for success – this industry doesn’t have one yet, which shows that it is an industry that is still in its infancy. I hope we can get to a point where we can say this is what success looks like.
Although dmexco is great for networking and hearing everyone’s opinions on the key topics, one of the things I find exhausting is the sheer volume of content, you can never get round to seeing it all. There are so many halls and speakers that it is difficult to find time to view all of this content. From my perspective I think there should be some specific events that focus on what people want to see, rather than lots of different companies showcasing their best assets to lots of different halls.
Networking
If you’re thinking about attending dmexco next year the key is to plan your time. It’s very easy to get wrapped up in the show and get very little done. It’s not a question of whether you should be at dmexco, it’s a question of how much damage would you be doing to not attend dmexco – having some sort of presence is critical.

Over three quarters (78%) of telecom advertisers plan to increase programmatic spend in 2015

New research released by Rocket Fuel has revealed a dramatic surge towards programmatic advertising by the telecoms industry.
 
 
Telecoms Research
 
The study into the ad buying habits of the telecoms industry has revealed that over three quarters of advertisers plan to increase their spending on programmatic over the next year. The research surveyed 32 global telecoms advertisers and marketers in Q4 2014 and Q1 2015.
Interestingly, the study also uncovered that 95% of telecom marketers believe they can use first-party data to drive marketing and business decisions. Further, the study concluded that despite a wealth of first-party offline data, fewer than two in five telecom advertisers (38%) are actually using their data to measure or optimise against online goals.
I believe that increasingly, the telecoms industry is getting wise on the need to utilise ad tech to evolve their businesses and meet performance goals. Telecom advertising is shifting rapidly to a programmatic, data-intensive model, and each player in the telecom advertising ecosystem must stay current on the most effective technology and data-management strategies.

The Future of Artificial Intelligence for marketers in UAE?

I recently spoke at the Arabnet Digital Summit in Dubai, a conference for digital businesses in the Middle East. The advertising spend in the region is continuously growing – with this massive growth marketers need their their digital advertising campaigns to be efficient and impactful. This is where Artificial Intelligence (AI) comes into play.
 

 
AI has already nearly infiltrated every aspect of our daily lives. We consult Siri, the intelligent personal assistant developed by Apple, enjoy multi-player games on our Xbox, or appreciate the personalised film recommendations on Netflix.
When we look at the marketing universe today, many of the jobs people have now didn’t even exist a decade or two ago: web designers, SEO consultants, social media experts and mobile and web app developers are all relatively young professions. We’re seeing yet more roles emerge in this world of big data driven decision making. The role of the CMO has already been revolutionised by AI – there have never been more channels with which a marketer can reach their target market, nor have CMOs had so much data available to them with which they can use to make decisions. There is too much complicated data for humans to manage.
The potential to utilise marketing technology like Rocket Fuel’s is enormous. In the MENA region there are currently 151 million internet users, and 86 million smartphone users – with a particularly high percentage in UAE and Saudi Arabia – and 24 million tablet users. Rocket Fuel currently sees 31 million Display ad opportunities per day in Saudi Arabia, 10 million in Qatar, and in UAE 38 million.
And the online advertising spend in the region is continuously growing. A recent report from PwC predicts that Internet advertising will grow from roughly $707 million in 2014 to $2.46 billion in 2018. And especially the mobile channel is booming. Currently users from the MENA region upload around two hours of video every minute on YouTube and view 285 million videos every day, which puts the region in the number two spot for video views in the world according to the fifth Arab Social Media Report by the Dubai School of Government. Consequently mobile advertising is growing, in the UAE in particular, and PwC predicts that by 2018, mobile internet advertising revenue will be four times larger than display and reach $494 million in UAE.
One thing is certain, the emergence and continued development of AI in the marketing sphere is revolutionising the sector, and I believe for the better. It provides marketers with more time to identify their goals, achieve them with greater accuracy whether this be generating awareness, attracting new customers, or identifying new revenue streams. Most importantly, AI will continue to free up human creative potential and create a myriad of new roles and opportunities that we can’t even begin to imagine.

Raring to go after our European conference!

Our recent European Rocket Fuel conference in sunny Portugal has left us all energised for the rest of 2015 and beyond. The event reinforced what a special team I have across Europe – I saw a collective passion, camaraderie and vibrancy throughout.
The conference included various training and team building sessions, which included putting the team through some gruelling objection handling and tricky elevator pitching. The teams also delivered some pretty humorous takes on their greatest successes this year in video format.

We also took inspiration from the truly motivational guest speaker Kevin Allen, Founder & Chairman of Re:kap, the business transformation company.  Kevin is recognised as one of the world’s most accomplished growth professionals with a highly successful and illustrious career. His team at global marketing agency McCann were the ones behind the success of the “priceless” campaign for Mastercard.

The phrase ‘work hard play hard’ was definitely adopted and put into practice at our conference, where a fun time was had by all at the Rocket Fuel White Party and closing BBQ.
 

We are all back in the office now, feeling motivated, ready for action and rocket fuelled!

The power of data in creating effective campaigns

At Rocket Fuel we work with some of the smartest and most insightful people in the industry and we’re often able to take a look at the bigger picture and show how powerful data is helping to make our campaign more effective.

If you’re interested in reading the full report you can find it here. 
In a recent report, we analysed the advertising creative for 40,000 banner ads from 1,076 different advertisers over an 8 month period and found that people respond more positively to male faces in adverts than female faces.  Adverts featuring men averaged 102% higher conversion rates than those without a person in them and adverts featuring women saw a 25% higher conversion rate, whilst ads featuring a man and a woman underperformed with a 15% lower conversion rate.
Interestingly the entertainment industry saw the greatest gender bias.  41% of adverts for entertainment products ranging from films to TV shows to theatre productions featured male celebrities whilst only 8% of adverts featured female celebrities.  The adverts with male celebrities had a 670% higher conversion rate than ads featuring female celebrities.
Across the board online ads that feature a human in them saw 4% higher conversion rates than those that didn’t feature a person of either gender.
The full report, A Guide to Creative Optimisation highlights the impact (positive and negative) different creative design choices have on the success of an online campaign.  We dissected the designs to compare elements ranging from background colour, promotions and offers, inclusions of products, humans, call to actions and whether an advert was animated or not.
Some other key findings highlighted ads with red backgrounds had 31% higher conversion rates than average whereas grey backgrounds had 8% lower conversion rates than average. Furthermore, product images have 6% higher conversion rates than those without and animated ads have a 7% higher conversion rate. And ads with a logo placed in the lower left corner have 81% higher conversion rates than those with a logo placed anywhere else.
Some might look at the data and conclude that it over-prescribes creative opportunities but we think the opposite is true. The data illuminates what has worked well in the past, but it doesn’t limit the discovery of what might work in the future. One of the best benefits of programmatic is that it enables affordable and fast real-world testing of literally any idea or hypothesis you can imagine. It opens possibilities—it doesn’t close them.

Britain’s first digital election: have the major parties missed a trick?

Today Britain’s are going to the polls, in what may be the closest and hardest to predict election that the country has ever seen. Throughout the long campaign public opinion polls seemed to have barely moved one way or the other. What could the major and minor political parties have done differently to push the vote in their favour and win over undecided voters?
Preparing for 2016
 
 
 
 
 
New research on US voter behaviour produced by Rocket Fuel  indicates that digital advertising is indeed playing a bigger role than ever on the outcomes of elections and has emerged as a key way to create awareness and influence voters for political campaigns.
However, when looking back on the UK’s first truly digital and social-media-led general election campaign this research also indicates that the optimal time for political parties to influence floating voters ended around a month ago.
Since the 2010 election, digital has moved up the political agenda in the UK as British political parties have started to take digital marketing more seriously. The Labour Party signed up Obama election winners Blue State Digital, David Cameron took to the world of Twitter, the Liberal Democrats used geotargeting on their website and Richard Desmond’s £1m donation to UKIP was reportedly earmarked for boosting the party’s online presence. The influence of online advertising, strategic online posters, celebrity selfies on social media, and even the somewhat surprising emergence of #Milifandom should perhaps not be dismissed. The research has found that in the US, 36% of floating voters cast their ballot as a result of seeing an online advertisement.
The research report, “Driving Swing State Voter Activity Through Advertising”, which studied 2,832 registered voters in Colorado, Florida, Illinois, North Carolina, and Wisconsin, demonstrated that voters had high ad recall, and were behaviourally influenced by the timing and messaging of digital political marketing.
It suggests that half of key floating voters’ minds can be swayed with effectively targeted and personally persuasive online advertising up to two weeks before voting day. Effective online campaigns with targeted persuasive messages served up to the correct audience will still influence 19% of undecided voters up to 7 days before polling day. Yet once there are less than seven days to go it is too late for a party to do anything meaningful to influence a still undecided voter and the effectiveness of online advertising is dramatically reduced. With one week to go, have parties done enough?
With 194 marginal seats in the UK, needing only a 5% change in behaviour for them to switch allegiance, the party that has utilised effective online marketing campaigns targeted at voters in these constituencies could have helped provide a deciding factor in these last couple of weeks of the campaign.
Digital advertising is playing a bigger role than ever on the outcomes of elections and has emerged as a key way to create awareness and influence voters for political campaigns. Knowing when voters are most susceptible to persuasive messaging allows political parties to better target swing voters sitting on the fence. Traditionally, many campaigns spend a lot of money in the last few days before decision day. However, this research shows that political parties seeking to persuade voters to take a particular course of action should begin spending their media budgets well in advance of election day, and focus on GOTV initiatives within the final four weeks of an election campaign. Indeed, the lessons learned from the general election campaign may well see a huge shift in how political parties deliver their messages in future.

CHAPPiE shows how AI will help us all in years to come

Of the many major Hollywood movies that we’ve seen appear lately on the subject of AI, I feel that CHAPPiE staring Hugh Jackman understands the positive side of the developing relationship between humans and machines better than anything we’ve seen so far.
CHAPPiE set in the future where an AI powered police robot learns to think for himself and assist his human comrades.  Stephen Hawking, Elon Musk and Bill Gates have all recently issued statements that we should be very afraid of the dangers of AI and the ways it could endanger humans employment prospects and chance for a happy and fulfilled life.
This pessimistic view of burgeoning new technologies is nothing new, it can be seen throughout the history of development of communications and computing technology that each new departure is met with fear and criticism
However, the reciprocal relationships portrayed in CHAPPiE is not such a far flung idea as it may seem, AI is already helping humans in a variety of professions including our own world of marketing and advertising.
New technology is helping us constantly create new innovations and data. So much data in fact that to effectively sort through this all and make effective decisions that help us in the world of marketing we need to enlist the help of our robot helpers.
AI is able to look at a customer’s past behaviour online and process where they have previously spent a lot of time online and what has been of interest to them. This means looking at their most visited sites, how long they spend there, who they follow on Twitter, what brand pages they like and interact with on Facebook and what their recent purchases have been on leading eCommerce sites.  These data points can then be analysed to make sure advertisements are reaching shoppers at the points of influence and helping them on their way to their path of purchase
AI is here to stay and as movies like CHAPPiE are starting to show its role is going to be more helpful than hurtful.

Tech Companies at Cannes Lion Help Improve Quality of Creative

Updated
29 June 2016
























Dominic Trigg




Dominic is Rocket Fuel’s SVP & Managing Director Europe.










Last week saw the international creative community descending on the streets (and sandy beaches) of Southern France. The Cannes Lions International Festival is a yearly celebration and showcase of the work and innovations the world's creative and advertising industries have come up with. 
Jon Wilkins, Executive Chairman at Karmarama said at this year's festival that "Big tech firms at Cannes are trying to join the party. They are here to celebrate the meeting of the algorithm and the idea- the future of programmatic creativity. But I don't buy it". 
I would argue that Jon is missing the point, it's not a case of either or - it's about how we can work best together! To prove this we (a big tech firm) recently published a report analysing 40,000 banner ads, across 18 different industries from 1,076 different advertisers over an 8 month period. This report shows how technology can help improve the creative output of advertisers. It found that people respond more positively to male faces in adverts than female faces.  Adverts featuring men averaged 102% higher conversion rates than those without a person in them and adverts featuring women saw a 25% higher conversion rate, whilst ads featuring a man and a woman under performed with a 15% lower conversion rate.
Interestingly the entertainment industry saw the greatest gender bias, 41% of adverts for entertainment products ranging from films to TV shows to theatre productions featured male celebrities whilst only 8% of adverts featured female celebrities.  Some might find it surprising that adverts with male celebrities had a 670% higher conversion rate than ads featuring female celebrities.
Across the board online ads that feature a human in them saw 4% higher conversion rates than those that didn't feature a person of either gender.
The full report also looked to highlight the impact (positive and negative) different creative design choices have on the success of an online campaign. We dissected the designs to compare elements ranging from background colour, promotions and offers, inclusions of products, humans, call to actions and whether an advert was animated or not.
Key findings highlighted ads with red backgrounds had 31% higher conversion rates than average whereas grey backgrounds had 8% lower conversion rates than average. Furthermore, product images have 6% higher conversion rates than those without and animated ads have a 7% higher conversion rate. And ads with a logo placed in the lower left corner have 81% higher conversion rates than those with a logo placed anywhere else.
Some might look at the data and conclude that it over-prescribes creative opportunities but we think the opposite is true. The data illuminates what has worked well in the past, but it doesn't limit the discovery of what mightwork in the future.
With insight like this provided by analysis, tech and data, advertisers will be able to hone their content to be ever more effective and improve the overall quality of entries on show at Cannes Lion for years to come!

“Dominic has established an extremely strong EMEA and emerging markets business which continues to grow. We have a great leadership team in place across the region and I look forward to working with them even more closely as we continue to grow the business. We have an exciting product roadmap and a clear vision of what we want to achieve this year, I’m looking forward to working with the team to deliver a strong 2016,” said Mr. Frankel.
“I would like to thank Dominic on behalf of Rocket Fuel for his significant contribution to our business.
