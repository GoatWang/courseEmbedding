(Bloomberg) -- One man’s junk is another man’s treasure.






That’s a credo that’s helped some of Asia’s top hedge funds this year as peers stumbled, with BFAM Partners, LIM Advisors and Serica Partners Asia surging in 2016 after snapping up or adding commodity-related bonds during a first-quarter selloff. Their performance stood out as the region’s hedge funds struggled with volatile markets in Japan and China, with offerings from Greenwoods Asset Management, Symphony Financial Partners and Tantallon Capital among those with losses.






Asia’s hedge funds are trailing global peers for the first time since 2011, threatening to further erode investor confidence amid a global backlash against lackluster performance and high fees. They’ve eked out a 0.8 percent gain in the 11 months through November, on track for the lowest annual return in five years, according to Eurekahedge data.

“The year has been characterized by a great run in credit,” said Marlon Sanchez, Deutsche Bank AG’s Hong Kong-based Asia-Pacific head of prime finance.






Among some of the top hedge funds betting on credit:






BFAM’s multistrategy Asian Opportunities Master Fund, which is expected to end the year with more than $2 billion of assets, gained 16 percent this year through November, said a person with knowledge of the matter who asked not to be named as the information is private. About 35 percent of its returns this year came from credit trades that include buying distressed commodity bonds in the first quarter whose values have since rebounded, said Chief Investment Officer Benjamin Fuchs, who declined to comment on returns. Other trades include the debt restructuring of Chinese property developer Kaisa Group Holdings Ltd. and selling credit default swaps on embattled commodities firm Noble Group Ltd. to bearish investors in the first half. About half of its return this year came from volatility trades as event such as the U.K.’s vote to leave the European Union and the U.S. elections added to market swings.Serica’s credit fund, run by Ivan Lee in Hong Kong, surged more than 30 percent this year through November, said a person with knowledge of the matter. The majority of the profit came from the rebound in the value of Indonesian and resources company bonds it bought at the beginning of the year, said the person. It also made money from a number of distressed credit trades.The $304 million LIM Asia Special Situations Fund, managed by Don Ewer and Peter Warbanoff, made 10 percent after fees in the same period, said George Long, LIM’s chief investment officer. High-yield bonds, especially those in the commodity industry, recovered as the industry rebounded and as some companies refinanced their debt. It also made money from loans, including distressed ones it picked up as early as last year that have rebounded in value, said Long, whose Hong Kong-based multistrategy hedge-fund firm has $1.6 billion of assets under management. Another credit-related hedge fund that shone was OCP Asia’s about $1 billion Orchard Landmark Fund. It returned nearly 13 percent this year through November, making direct loans to small- and medium-sized companies across the Asia-Pacific region, said a person with knowledge of the matter. OCP Asia manages about $1.2 billion out of its Singapore and Hong Kong offices.






Some of this year’s best-performing large hedge funds didn’t focus on credit. Dymon Asia Capital (Singapore)’s $3.4 billion macro fund gained about 12 percent in the 11 months, according to an estimate sent to investors. Its $721 million Dymon Asia Currency Value Fund, which focuses on currencies and gold and takes more concentrated bets, was up 45 percent. Bets on Asian currencies, particularly the Japanese yen, to weaken against the dollar drove returns for both. Separately, the $296 million Credence Global Fund, a relative-value hedge fund that seeks to profit from changes in price relationships between assets, made 12 percent this year, according to an investor newsletter.






On the equity side, Japan’s benchmark Nikkei 225 Stock Average edged down 0.7 percent through November amid disillusionment with government policies to stoke growth. China funds struggled to claw back from losses after the Shanghai Composite Index plunged 22 percent in January amid concerns about the country’s economic slowdown, a falling currency and regulations.






Among some of the funds with losses:






Greenwoods Asset Management’s $1.5 billion Golden China Fund is down 5.1 percent this year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Symphony Financial Partners’s SFP Value Realization Fund, which invests in Japanese companies and works with management to prompt actions such as share buybacks, is set to have its first loss since 2009. The fund fell 6 percent this year through November, according to Co-founder David Baran, who said a lot of the volatility and uncertainty that sparked market declines are “somewhat behind us.”The $24 million Tantallon Fund, which trades Asia-Pacific stocks, lost nearly 13 percent this year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The fund fell nearly 15 percent in March in the worst month in its 13-year history when its bearish bets on most regional indexes and bullish bets on dollar suffered, according to a newsletter posted on its website. Rega Capital Dynamic Value Fund, a long-short China hedge fund, fell 35 percent this year through Nov. 30, according to the firm.






Some equity-focused funds bucked the trend.






Ally Bridge LB Healthcare Fund, managed by Hong Kong-based former Merck & Co. scientist Li Bin, made nearly 27 percent in the first 11 months, according to an update sent to investors. The Asia-focused fund invests in mostly publicly traded stocks in the industry, targeting particularly opportunities created by Chinese medical reforms. Li researched pharmaceutical companies for Merrill Lynch & Co. and Morgan Stanley in New York and Hong Kong before joining Ally Bridge Group.The $68.3 million RWC Asia Opportunity Fund rose 16 percent this year, according to an e-mailed statement from London-based RWC Partners. Winning trades include Korean steelmaker Posco and Japan’s Sumco Corp., said Garret Mallal, the fund’s Singapore-based manager.United Gain Investment’s ASEAN Plus Three Segregated Portfolio, with $15 million of assets, rose 16 percent this year, said Lau Chi Yiu, chief investment officer of the Hong Kong-based firm that oversees $300 million of assets. Profitable trades for the fund that focuses on Southeast Asia as well as Hong Kong, Japan and South Korea included Indonesian stocks such as noodles-maker PT Tiga Pilar Sejahtera Food Tbk and cement maker PT Semen Baturaja Persero Tbk.






Representatives from Ally Bridge, Greenwoods, Tantallon and Serica declined to comment.

        Dymon Hedge Fund Positioned on Right Side of Brexit Tops Peers

 GST-Related Earnings Weakness Priced In, Says Jyotivardhan Jaipuria 




 Why Bihar Matters, To India And PM Modi: BQ Explains 




 Flipkart May Be Able To Buy Snapdeal For $850 Million 




 With Banks Focused On The Distressed Dozen, Resolution On Smaller Accounts Slows 




 The BMR Saga: Built On Talent, Beaten By It 
























 






















(Bloomberg) -- A top-performing hedge fund is sticking with wagers on a stronger yen and a weaker pound after the positions paid off following the U.K. referendum to leave the European Union.






The Dymon Asia Currency Value Fund jumped an estimated 4 percent on the day the Brexit vote result was announced, and has gained 13 percent in the first half of this year for investors using less leverage, according to Gerald Chan, head of distribution for Dymon Asia Capital (Singapore) Pte. Fund investors willing to amplify bets through the use of borrowed money saw a 35 percent return in the six months, he said.






The fund, which oversees $425 million including leverage, has outperformed peers as many of the world’s biggest investors have been caught off-guard by jolts including government and central bank interventions and political events such as the Brexit vote. Macro funds, which trade in the currency, stock, bond and commodity markets, have been stymied by abrupt reversals of trends and exaggerated market swings.






Macro hedge funds managed by Brevan Howard Asset Management, Discovery Capital Management and Omni Partners are among those that have posted losses this year. The Eurekahedge Macro Hedge Fund Index edged up 0.4 percent in the first half of the year, according to preliminary data.






U.S. Outperforms






The U.S. is the best performer among major economies and investors will continue to flock to safe assets such as the dollar and gold in the event of a global economic meltdown, Chan said, while the yen will benefit as there isn’t much room for Bank of Japan to expand easing measures.






"One of our core themes is to be long the dollar, gold and yen against a basket of short developed Asian currencies such as the Korean won, Taiwan dollar and Singapore dollar,” Chan said, as the managers expect the Asian currencies to be hurt by a gradual depreciation in the yuan. The fund is also short commodity-related currencies like the Australian and New Zealand dollars, as well as the pound.






Pound Bear






The fund took a bearish bet on the pound against the dollar in the lead-up to the Brexit vote. Dymon fund managers believed the campaign to exit the EU had a 50 percent chance of winning in the referendum, while the markets were pricing in a 90 percent probability of the remain camp prevailing, said Chan.






The Dymon fund bought and has kept options against sterling, allowing it to profit from the Brexit win, said Chan. Dymon believes the Brexit vote would lead to capital outflows and postponement of investments into the U.K. because of near-term uncertainties. The country will see an interest rate cut by mid-July and a fall in the pound’s exchange rate to $1.25 per dollar, he said. The pound touched a 31-year low of $1.2798 last week as property funds froze redemptions, echoing the real-estate tremors at the start of the 2008 financial crisis.






Bets that the Chinese currency would strengthen were the biggest contributor toward the fund’s first-half return, according to Chan. It started the year owning options on the expectation of the yuan depreciating in the offshore market. It reversed the trade in the first quarter after changes in China’s currency-fixing mechanism convinced Dymon’s managers that the government would defend the yuan at all costs when U.S. hedge funds were betting on a collapse of the currency, Chan said. Since the end of the first quarter, Dymon’s managers have been negative on the prospects on the yuan.






Gold Bet






The fund’s bet on gold prices to rise amid government easing and a growing negative interest-rate environment was also a strong contributor toward the first-half return, according to Chan. The fund increased the bet after the Brexit vote, anticipating that governments worldwide may be compelled to continue easing monetary policies and investors would seek to protect their wealth with the metal amid global uncertainties, he said.






Wagers on the Australian dollar to depreciate against the greenback and yen were also a profit contributor, the firm said. Dymon went bearish on the Australian dollar after the country surprised the market by posting a 0.2 percent consumer price index decline from the previous quarter in late April, leading its central bank to cut interest rates in May.






By contrast, the Bank of Japan’s surprise announcement of a negative interest-rate strategy in late January triggered a plunge in stocks and the yen, Chan said. The fund bought profitable options that bet on the markets underestimating the odds of the Australian rate cut and the BOJ’s restraint from further easing at the end of April, he added.






Danny Yong, a former Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Citadel trader, started Dymon Asia Macro Fund with $113 million in 2008 with billionaire-investor Paul Tudor Jones’s Tudor Investment Corp. as his first outside backer. Assets of his Singapore-based firm have since grown to nearly $5 billion. The $3 billion flagship fund gained 2 percent in the first half, helped by a 1.5 percent profit spurred by Brexit, said Chan.






The Dymon currency fund makes more concentrated investments for clients that desire higher returns and can accept more risks. The more leveraged share class, started in May 2011, has returned nearly 180 percent since inception, according to Chan. It continues to see net inflows, he said, without giving numbers.

Singapore’s Very Own Investment Legend: Danny Yong of Dymon Asia
By Ong Kai Kiat on September 18, 2015

Dymon Asia was founded by Danny Yong in 2008 with US$113 million in AUM.
Today, Dymon Asia has US$4.5 billion in assets under management. For context, only 8% of hedge fund survive to their 8th year and only the top 2.3% go past the US$1 billion mark.
Dymon Asia was ranked No. 10 globally by Bloomberg for its 17% return in 2014.
Temasek Holdings invested $500 million to start a hedge fund platform with Dymon Asia in May 2014.
Danny Yong started his career at JP Morgan, then moving to Goldman Sachs and Citadel before founding Dymon Asia.

In the ‘Investment Legend’ series with The Fifth Person, I have covered famous investors like Warren Buffet of Berkshire Hathaway, Ray Dalio of Bridgewater Associates and David Einhorn of Greenlight Capital. All of them are based in the United States but today I would like to introduce to you a local Singaporean legend – Danny Yong, founder and chief investment officer of Dymon Asia.
Dymon Asia put Singapore on the investment world map and is the first notable, large-scale hedge fund from Singapore with US$4.5 billion in assets under management (AUM).
Global Recognition for Dymon Asia
So what is so outstanding about Dymon Asia? Why does it command global respect and recognition from professional in the ultra-competitive hedge fund industry?
Well, first and foremost, Dymon Asia was No. 10 globally among the 100 top-performing large hedge funds (above US$1 billion in AUM) in 2014:

Source: Bloomberg
According to Bloomberg, Dymon Asia returned 17% on US$3.5 billion in AUM. It is also the only macro strategy hedge fund to make it to the top 10. The list is dominated by the United States and Europe with only three hedge funds from Asia featuring – Singapore-based Quantedge Capital at No. 2 with 32.3% returns on US$1 billion in AUM and Hong Kong-based Golden China at No. 18 with 14.5% returns on US$1.2 billion in AUM.
(On a side note, Quantedge is managed by a team of 15 math wizards with degrees from Harvard, Wharton, Oxford, MIT, and Berkeley. They have a passion for actuarial science – the discipline that applies mathematical and statistical methods to assess risk in insurance, finance and other industries and professions.)
In addition to being a global top 10 performing large hedge fund, Dymon Asia is the only Singapore-based macro fund to be recognized by HSBC:

Source: HSBC
Dymon Asia did especially well in 2011 returning 20.11% when other notable macro funds on the list were returning between -30.07% to 9.69%. In fact, Dymon’s only calendar year loss was in 2008 when it was founded just before the global financial crises.
Besides accolades from Bloomberg and HSBC, we have to note that the hedge fund industry is very competitive. Dymon Asia is still going strong in its 8th year of existence – a milestone less than 8% of Asian hedge funds actually reach. In other words, more than nine out of ten hedge funds which started the race in 2008 with Dymon Asia are defunct now due to variety of reasons such as underperformance, liquidity and regulatory issues according to Cambridge Associates.

In addition, only the top 2.3% of Asian hedge funds actually cross the US$1 billion in AUM mark. Dymon Asia’s success is more notable given that the majority of hedge funds are long/short equity. Macro hedge funds like Dymon Asia only form 7% of hedge funds.

Lastly, it should be noted that Temasek Holdings invested $500 million in Dymon Asia in May 2014. Temasek Holdings would not invest with Yong just because Dymon Asia is a Singapore success story. Intensive due diligence would have been undertaken before a half-billion dollar decision is made. After all, Singaporeans have high expectations of our sovereign wealth fund.
When news of Temasek performing well is released, it hardly makes a wave. However when losses are reported, there is a huge public backlash from the populace. Temasek Holding’s CEO, Ho Ching, stepped down in February 2009 when the fund lost $2 billion out of its $5 billion investment in Merrill Lynch during the peak of the financial crisis. This happened six long years ago but I suspect most people can still recall the Merrill Lynch fiasco.
Temasek made record net profits of $14.5 billion for the financial year of 2014 and total shareholder return was 19.2% — the highest in the last five years. This was announced recently in July but can you remember it?
Success is taken for granted but failure results in massive public outcry. Temasek executives have to screen their investments very carefully or risk their careers in the global investment industry. Hence, this $500 million investment is a strong endorsement of the capabilities of Danny Yong and Dymon Asia.
Danny Yong’s Background
Dymon Asia’s achievements alone would more than justify Danny Yong inclusion as a local investment legend. However, Yong didn’t come from the most advantageous of family backgrounds and his is a classic rags-to-riches story. Let us trace Danny Yong’s journey to see how he ended up where he is today.
Yong’s father died of cancer when he was 10 years old. His mom motivated him to work hard so that people will not look down on him. As seen from this NTU interview in February 2013, growing up in a single family motivated him to keep pushing his boundaries. He would wake up at 5 a.m. every morning to run and his discipline allowed him to break into the national badminton team at the age of 17. Yong was at Catholic Junior College then and he had to juggle between his ‘A’ Levels studies and the rigours of national team badminton.
In order to save time, Yong would sleep at the badminton courts of the Singapore Badminton Association just so he could save the two-hour commute to study for his exams and train for badminton. This sacrifice is nothing to Yong:
“I don’t think sleeping at the courts was very extreme. I had school work to get done, and I had to train to stay on top of my chosen sport – I just did what I had to do. To me, if you want to do something, you do it properly.”
This drive opened the path to Nanyang Business School. In that competitive environment, he graduated with a first-class honours degree in banking and finance in 1997.
However, this was almost not enough for him to be selected by JP Morgan as an Asian currency derivatives trader. He had to compete with 1,000 other applicants for the job and his application was initially placed in the ‘reject’ pile. Luckily for Yong, a trader at JP Morgan was thumbing through the reject pile and recognised Yong’s photo and recused his application from the reject list. He eventually went on to secure the job. To this day, Yong admits there that may not be a Dymon Asia if not for that one small action that changed everything.
After a three-year stint with JP Morgan, Yong joined Goldman Sachs in February 2000 and would end up as the head of trading for South Asia derivatives. He then joined Citadel in November 2005. Two years later, he became chief investment officer and managing partner at Abax Global Capital which is partly owned by Morgan Stanley.
In July 2008, Yong founded Dymon Asia with US$100 million in funding from billionaire trader Paul Tudor Jones’s Tudor Investment Corp. A few months later, Lehman Brothers collapsed in September 2008 which sent the global economy into a tailspin. Yong would eventually part ways with Abax in 2009 to focus on Dymon Asia.
Ingredients for Success
It is clear that Yong has gotten to where he is today based on tenacity, hard work, and passion. Yong came from a single-parent family and instead of holding him back, he used it to spur him to greater heights. While others may have beaten at the cards life deals them, he was determined to prove that he was no less able than anyone just because he lost his dad at a young age.
He carried this tenacity into the other areas of his life and applied the same resolve and hard work in his studies and badminton. This enabled him to earn a first class honours degree which opened doors into the financial industry for him. Even today, as the successful founder and CIO of a US$4.5 billion hedge fund, Yong still brings the same work ethic and high standards into the office every day.
Instead of sleeping overnight at the badminton courts, he has graduated to sleeping in his office at times just so he can monitor global markets across different time zones. Yong continues to work so hard now even though Dymon Asia is now well established because he loves what he does and his passion for investing:
“This is what I love doing. It’s what I enjoy. Look at the guys from the U.S., like Soros in his 80s and Louis Bacon in his 60s, they’re all still going strong. To do well in investing, one has to be 100 per cent committed. The day one feels like slowing down, it is better to just retire. In this business, you are either 100 per cent engaged, or not at all. There is no in-between. I am fortunate that I have a passion for investing. If you’re in this only for the money, you will burn out quickly and end up quitting altogether.” – Danny Yong, NBS Alumni
His hard work, tenacity, and passion were all evident when Yong first founded Dymon Asia on the cusp of the global financial crisis. Immediately after its inception, the fund posted its biggest loss of -13.69% from July to September 2008 as the crisis started to accelerate. That meant that Dymon Asia lost US$15 million of its investors’ money in the first five months of its launch. But Yong responded to the setback the way he knows best and powered on, taking Dymon Asia from strength to strength to where it is today.
Conclusion
It is not every day that someone becomes the founder of a multibillion-dollar hedge fund. It requires a certain set of skills, talent, and drive to reach the top like Danny Yong. But even he admits, a little bit of luck came his way as well when a JP Morgan trader rescued his application and give him the break he needed in the financial industry.
But even then, if Dymon Asia never happened, one might still think that Danny Yong would still be a success somewhere else because of his tenacity and drive that’s allowed to deal with adversity that has come his way on his journey to reaching the top.

Dymon Hedge Fund’s Dollar Bet Yields Bonanza After Trump Rally
By Bei Hu

More stories by Bei Hu





December 1, 2016, 11:00 AM EST







                Currency fund rose 22% last month as Asian currencies weakened
            



                Dymon’s flagship macro hedge fund returned nearly 8%
            



Dymon Asia Capital (Singapore)’s currency hedge fund gained an estimated 22 percent in the first 25 days of November as bets on weaker Asian currencies paid off, with some investors making triple that gain by putting money into a highly leveraged version.The profits extended returns made by the $714 million Dymon Asia Currency Value Fund this year to nearly 46 percent, said Gerald Chan, the firm’s Singapore-based head of distribution, citing estimates. The money manager’s $3.4 billion flagship Dymon Asia Macro Fund made an estimated 7.8 percent during the same period in November, taking this year’s return to 12 percent, he said.Dymon joins macro hedge-fund peers such as Brevan Howard Asset Management and Rubicon Fund Management in turning a political shock into profit. Brevan Howard’s $12.7 billion main hedge fund gained 5.6 percent in the first 18 days of November, erasing earlier losses this year, and Rubicon surged almost 20 percent in the same period to return to profit.








The November returns for Dymon came primarily thanks to bearish bets on various Asian currencies, including the Japanese yen, against the greenback, said Chan. The dollar has surged for its biggest monthly gain versus the yen since 1995, on the prospect of President-elect Donald Trump’s proposed fiscal stimulus fueling inflation. The dollar gained 9.1 percent against the Japanese currency last month.‘Critical Component’“A critical component of the performance was the portfolio construction going into the U.S. presidential election on Nov. 8,” Chan said. “The portfolio was constructed with one express objective: enabling Dymon Asia Macro Fund to navigate through the anticipated volatility, allowing the fund to stay with its high-conviction short Asian currencies, long U.S. dollar positions.”Danny Yong, a former Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Citadel trader, started Dymon Asia Macro Fund with $113 million in 2008, with billionaire-investor Paul Tudor Jones’s Tudor Investment Corp. as his first outside backer. He is the lone manager of the Dymon currency fund.




Yong said he continues to remain bearish on Asian currencies and bullish on the dollar, a view Dymon has held for most of this year, as global trade continues to slow. While the election of either candidate would have led to different degrees of fiscal expansion, the Trump victory is expected to result in robust fiscal stimulus and “U.S.-centric policies,” he said.“This backdrop provides an attractive trading environment for macro strategies as the market digests the full impact of the massive structural changes ahead,” Yong said, citing an uncertain impact on Asia and the rest of the world.Concentrated Bets




Macro hedge funds seek to profit from broad economic trends by trading in markets including currencies, interest rates, credit, stocks and commodities. Dymon’s currency fund takes more concentrated bets, focuses on currencies and gold and has less risk constraint than its bigger macro fund.The Dymon funds entered the month with bearish positions on Asian currencies and bullish bets on gold. They used option trades to allow them to minimize losses should the firm’s views turn out wrong, while enabling them to make outsize gains should their positions be validated by markets. With that, they weathered a rally in the yen as the election outcome crystallized and profited when it reversed course.The funds also profited from short-term trading and risk management moves as the markets whipsawed on election day. The main macro fund gained 2.4 percent on Nov. 9 by the time the New York markets closed as the yen rally earlier in the day was erased, said Chan.

Dymon switched from a bullish bet on yen to a bearish wager between August and September, after the Bank of Japan indicated that it would seek to steepen the yield curve, said Yong. He cited this as evidence of the government’s intent to remedy the adverse effects of its surprise announcement of negative interest rates in January. Dymon also believed the Japanese currency had become too expensive by August after strengthening more than 20 percent against yuan and the dollar.Dymon plans to stop taking additional money for the macro fund when its assets hit $4.5 billion, said Chan. It will also cease accepting fresh capital for the currency fund when it hits $1.5 billion, he added.— With assistance by Nishant Kumar, and Sabrina Willmer

                Credit funds of OCP, LIM, Serica also had double-digit gains
            



                Greenwoods, Symphony equity hedge funds losing money so far
            













Who Were 2016's Hedge Fund Winners and Losers?




One man’s junk is another man’s treasure.That’s a credo that’s helped some of Asia’s top hedge funds this year as peers stumbled, with BFAM Partners, LIM Advisors and Serica Partners Asia surging in 2016 after snapping up or adding commodity-related bonds during a first-quarter selloff. Their performance stood out as the region’s hedge funds struggled with volatile markets in Japan and China, with offerings from Greenwoods Asset Management, Symphony Financial Partners and Tantallon Capital among those with losses.Asia’s hedge funds are trailing global peers for the first time since 2011, threatening to further erode investor confidence amid a global backlash against lackluster performance and high fees. They’ve eked out a 0.8 percent gain in the 11 months through November, on track for the lowest annual return in five years, according to Eurekahedge data.




For more on hedge fund winners and losers, click here“The year has been characterized by a great run in credit,” said Marlon Sanchez, Deutsche Bank AG’s Hong Kong-based Asia-Pacific head of prime finance.Among some of the top hedge funds betting on credit:BFAM’s multistrategy Asian Opportunities Master Fund, which is expected to end the year with more than $2 billion of assets, gained 16 percent this year through November, said a person with knowledge of the matter who asked not to be named as the information is private. About 35 percent of its returns this year came from credit trades that include buying distressed commodity bonds in the first quarter whose values have since rebounded, said Chief Investment Officer Benjamin Fuchs, who declined to comment on returns. Other trades include the debt restructuring of Chinese property developer Kaisa Group Holdings Ltd. and selling credit default swaps on embattled commodities firm Noble Group Ltd. to bearish investors in the first half. About half of its return this year came from volatility trades as event such as the U.K.’s vote to leave the European Union and the U.S. elections added to market swings.Serica’s credit fund, run by Ivan Lee in Hong Kong, surged more than 30 percent this year through November, said a person with knowledge of the matter. The majority of the profit came from the rebound in the value of Indonesian and resources company bonds it bought at the beginning of the year, said the person. It also made money from a number of distressed credit trades.The $304 million LIM Asia Special Situations Fund, managed by Don Ewer and Peter Warbanoff, made 10 percent after fees in the same period, said George Long, LIM’s chief investment officer. High-yield bonds, especially those in the commodity industry, recovered as the industry rebounded and as some companies refinanced their debt. It also made money from loans, including distressed ones it picked up as early as last year that have rebounded in value, said Long, whose Hong Kong-based multistrategy hedge-fund firm has $1.6 billion of assets under management. Another credit-related hedge fund that shone was OCP Asia’s about $1 billion Orchard Landmark Fund. It returned nearly 13 percent this year through November, making direct loans to small- and medium-sized companies across the Asia-Pacific region, said a person with knowledge of the matter. OCP Asia manages about $1.2 billion out of its Singapore and Hong Kong offices.

Some of this year’s best-performing large hedge funds didn’t focus on credit. Dymon Asia Capital (Singapore)’s $3.4 billion macro fund gained about 12 percent in the 11 months, according to an estimate sent to investors. Its $721 million Dymon Asia Currency Value Fund, which focuses on currencies and gold and takes more concentrated bets, was up 45 percent. Bets on Asian currencies, particularly the Japanese yen, to weaken against the dollar drove returns for both. Separately, the $296 million Credence Global Fund, a relative-value hedge fund that seeks to profit from changes in price relationships between assets, made 12 percent this year, according to an investor newsletter.On the equity side, Japan’s benchmark Nikkei 225 Stock Average edged down 0.7 percent through November amid disillusionment with government policies to stoke growth. China funds struggled to claw back from losses after the Shanghai Composite Index plunged 22 percent in January amid concerns about the country’s economic slowdown, a falling currency and regulations.




Among some of the funds with losses:Greenwoods Asset Management’s $1.5 billion Golden China Fund is down 5.1 percent this year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Symphony Financial Partners’s SFP Value Realization Fund, which invests in Japanese companies and works with management to prompt actions such as share buybacks, is set to have its first loss since 2009. The fund fell 6 percent this year through November, according to Co-founder David Baran, who said a lot of the volatility and uncertainty that sparked market declines are “somewhat behind us.”The $24 million Tantallon Fund, which trades Asia-Pacific stocks, lost nearly 13 percent this year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The fund fell nearly 15 percent in March in the worst month in its 13-year history when its bearish bets on most regional indexes and bullish bets on dollar suffered, according to a newsletter posted on its website. Rega Capital Dynamic Value Fund, a long-short China hedge fund, fell 35 percent this year through Nov. 30, according to the firm.Some equity-focused funds bucked the trend.Ally Bridge LB Healthcare Fund, managed by Hong Kong-based former Merck & Co. scientist Li Bin, made nearly 27 percent in the first 11 months, according to an update sent to investors. The Asia-focused fund invests in mostly publicly traded stocks in the industry, targeting particularly opportunities created by Chinese medical reforms. Li researched pharmaceutical companies for Merrill Lynch & Co. and Morgan Stanley in New York and Hong Kong before joining Ally Bridge Group.The $68.3 million RWC Asia Opportunity Fund rose 16 percent this year, according to an e-mailed statement from London-based RWC Partners. Winning trades include Korean steelmaker Posco and Japan’s Sumco Corp., said Garret Mallal, the fund’s Singapore-based manager.United Gain Investment’s ASEAN Plus Three Segregated Portfolio, with $15 million of assets, rose 16 percent this year, said Lau Chi Yiu, chief investment officer of the Hong Kong-based firm that oversees $300 million of assets. Profitable trades for the fund that focuses on Southeast Asia as well as Hong Kong, Japan and South Korea included Indonesian stocks such as noodles-maker PT Tiga Pilar Sejahtera Food Tbk and cement maker PT Semen Baturaja Persero Tbk.Representatives from Ally Bridge, Greenwoods, Tantallon and Serica declined to comment.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
