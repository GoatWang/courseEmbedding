Continental Finance Company LLC Reviews







December 16, 2007


Unwanted card!
								
				
HELP, I received a card from this company I called them regarding it and talk to them re: opening an account and then they told me about upfront payment prior to using the card and I told them I did not want the card then as I am trying to fix my credit and I have a bill now for the card showing that I opened the account the closed it on the same day. What do I do, I can not get a live person on the phone each time I call.








November 8, 2007


Billing after account was closed out!
								
				
To all those that have been wronged by CFC:

Following is a copy of the complaint I sent to the Better Business Bureau and will be sending to the following: 

Continental Finance Company, LLC
Ms. Beverly Knotts, Principal
P.O.Box 8099
Newark, DE 19714-8099
FAX: 302-454-7952

BBB of Delaware
60 Reads Way
New Castle, DE 19720
302-230-0108
info@delaware.bbb.org
FAX: 302-230-0116

Ms.Deborah Platt Majorus, Chairperson 
Federal Trade Commission
600 Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W.,
Washington, D.C. 20580

On October 1, 2007 after numerous attempts to call their CS number that is printed on the billing statement, which makes it VERY difficult to reach a "Live" CS person, I inquired about the “Late payment charges” for the October billing cycle. I was told that the Late Payment charges were due to late receipt of my payment. My payments to them are always made 2 weeks in advance to assure that payments are received on time, but in the last two months it seems that the checks are delayed or processed late in order to charge a late fee of $30.00. When the Customer Service Rep. told me that they were not responsible for the USPS mail being delivered late, I decided that this was a good indication of their business practices and it would be best for me to close this account out. 

I asked the C.S. Rep. to close the account out and asked for a payoff (that included the $30.00 Late Fees) she indicated it was $185.38 and that amount was minus a credit for disputed charges by Digicom. I advised her that I would be sending out the check to pay off the account and she acknowledged that she would be indicating this in her notes. 

Today, November 8, 2007 I received a statement for Total Due: $59.00 ($49.00 Annual Fee and Account Maintenance Fee). When I tried to reach their C.S., I spend more than an hour trying the different options and three different numbers in order to talk to a C.S. Rep.  The 800-518-6141 tells you to call 1-866-489-3649 and this number does not give you an option to talk to a live C.S. no matter what option you select. After going online and doing a general search for CFC, I found a local 302-456-1930 number. The first C.S. Rep. that I spoke to said this account was never closed out and that I had to pay the fees, I then asked to speak to his "supervisor" and they basically told me the same thing. I then asked to speak to his supervisor or manager and was transferred to a manager named "Mark" after approx. 10 min. of pleading my case and trying to remain calm, which I have to admit there was a few times I failed due to the collective frustration of trying to contact someone and resolving this issue, I was told that the account was never closed as there were no comments or notes and that the best he would do is “halve” the charges and the account would be settled.

About Continental Finance









 Founded in 2005, Continental Finance Company ("CFC") is one of America's leading marketers and servicers of credit cards  for consumers with less-than-perfect credit. 
Since the Company's founding, CFC has prided itself on its corporate responsibility to customers in terms of a strong customer support program, fair treatment, and responsible lending.






What We Do





With over 2 million credit cards managed since our founding, CFC prides itself on excellent customer service and access to products with innovative features. 





We specialize in providing access to credit products and services to consumers who are largely overlooked by traditional credit card issuers. With a state of the art consumer underwriting, marketing and servicing platform, we are able to provide a variety of services to consumers when other financial institutions will not accommodate them.




Whether you have fair credit, poor credit, or limited credit, we can provide you access to a product that is right for you.






Customer Support





 CFC has a dedicated customer support team that understands the importance of helping customers manage credit responsibly. Our goal is to provide each customer with the highest level of customer support, including providing all the necessary educational tools in order for them to be successful in managing their personal credit.






Fair Treatment





The products that are offered to you are continually reassessed, keeping in mind, you, the customer. The application and credit decision processes, along with fees and charges, and payment requirements, are outlined clearly and concisely, both in print and online. The goal is to be completely transparent in providing this information to both existing and future customers.  





Responsible Lending





Operating in a non-standard market requires a responsible attitude toward customer credit and lending. Therefore, making sure customers can afford to make regular payments on the credit that is extended to them is important. In turn, operating on a "low and grow" credit limit strategy, encourages customers to manage their account responsibly before increasing the credit limit to levels they might not be successful in managing today. For example, credit limits are increased only after a customer has demonstrated sound financial management.




Our Customers and Our Expertise



We are committed to providing our customers with superior value and customer service. Whether establishing or rebuilding credit, we are here to help you find the right product to achieve your goals. 
We report customer payment performance history to all three major credit bureaus (Experian, Equifax and TransUnion) every month! To make managing and servicing customer accounts easier, we provide 24/7 Online Account Access. Customers may enroll in email and text notifications to receive alerts when:

A payment is due
A payment has been posted
Credit limit has been reached  & more!



We also support a "GO GREEN" initiative where customers can receive their monthly statement and other notifications electronically via the internet and email.

7 Credit Score Lies You Shouldn’t Believe

Published February 13, 2017 


Information found at www.cheatsheet.com
How much do you really know about credit scores? Though your credit score affects everything from your ability to rent an apartment to how much you’ll pay every month on your car loan, many people aren’t sure how scores are calculated, don’t know what the scores are used for, and believe common credit score lies and myths that cause them to make dumb money decisions. So what’s the truth behind this all-important number?
“Your credit score plays a pivotal role in your financial journey. As far as numbers go, it’s one of the most important that will ever be attached to your name,” Julie Pukas, head of U.S. bankcard and merchant services at TD Bank, told The Cheat Sheet.

The majority of people understand that mortgage lenders and credit card companies use credit scores when making lending decisions, a recent survey by the Consumer Federation of America (CFA) and VantageScore found. Most also know that declaring bankruptcy or making late payments will hurt your score. But beyond those basics, misinformation and credit score lies abound. Only 25% of people surveyed by the CFA were aware that a low credit score could increase the cost of a car loan by $5,000, and more than half didn’t realize landlords, utility companies, cellphone companies, and insurers sometimes check credit scores.
“Many people scorn credit, but the simple fact of the matter is that in most situations, your credit score is a deciding factor in whether you’ll be approved for a mortgage, car loan, credit card, or another type of loan,” Pukas said. “If you’re looking for an apartment, your score may impact your probability of getting approved, the size of your security deposit, and how much you pay in fees. It can also impact how much you pay for home and auto insurance and might even decide whether you’re approved for a new cell phone plan.”
Being misinformed about credit scores or believing credit score myths can have serious financial consequences, whether you’re a borrower or not. You can boost your credit savvy by familiarizing yourself with the truth behind these seven big credit score lies.

Unsecured Loans vs. Secured

Published January 31, 2017 


There are two basic categories that most loan types fall into – Unsecured and Secured.
Unsecured Loan 
On the other hand, unsecured loans are the opposite of secured loans and include things like credit card purchases, education loans, or personal (signature) loans. Lenders take more of a risk by making such a loan, with no property or assets to recover in case of default, which is why the interest rates are considerably higher. If you have been turned down for unsecured credit, you may still be able to obtain secured loans, as long as you have something of value or if the purchase you wish to make can be used as collateral.
When you apply for a loan that is unsecured, the lender believes that you can repay the loan on the basis of your financial resources. You will be judged based on the five (5) C’s of credit — character, capacity, capital, collateral, and conditions – these are all criteria used to assess a borrower’s creditworthiness. Character, capacity, capital, and collateral refer to the borrower’s willingness and ability to repay the debt. Conditions include the borrower’s situation as well as general economic factors.

5 Reasons Why Good Credit Matters

Published January 30, 2017 

Society is becoming increasingly dependent on using credit to make purchases and decisions. These days, good credit is used for more than just getting a credit card or a loan. More and more businesses are making the case that you must have good credit before they extend products or services to you.
It Affects Where You Live and How Much You Pay
Before you can buy a house, mortgage lenders want to know that you won’t default on your mortgage.
If you don’t have good credit, the lender will consider it risky to give you a mortgage loan. If you’re approved for a mortgage your credit affects your interest rate which directly impacts your monthly mortgage payment. Bad credit could mean a higher mortgage payment. Worse than that, your mortgage application could be turned down because of your bad credit.

Fixing Your Credit

Published January 19, 2017 

Got bad credit? You’re not alone. According to a breakdown of credit bureau Experian’s 2015 VantageScore 3.0 data, close to one-third of Americans have a credit score lower than 601 — and, yeah, that’s not so hot. Finding out you’re in that lowest credit echelon often comes at the worst time. You’ve just applied for a credit card, a car loan, a mortgage or even an apartment, and you were rejected. Along with the dream-crushing news comes a letter that spells out the reasons you weren’t approved. It may say things like “Too few installment accounts” or “No recent revolving account activity.” And even though they’ve given you reasons why your credit isn’t good enough to be approved, you’re still lost on how to actually fix your credit.
Time for a Credit Repair?

Fraud Alert

Published January 13, 2017 

Nobody likes to have their security compromised even more so to have one’s identity stolen. As much as we want to be exempted from identity theft, there is just no guarantee that we won’t be targeted by those culprits. This doesn’t mean that you should take the security of your identity lightly; on the contrary, you have to be even more alert and vigilant.
If a time will come that you think you may fall prey to credit card fraud or identity theft, don’t hesitate to take the necessary actions to prevent it from happening. For example, if you have lost your wallet with your credit cards and social security card in it, don’t delay in contacting your creditor and have the card cancelled. Then immediately have a fraud alert placed on your credit report to help prevent a possible identity theft.
Fraud Alert
The name itself explains it; fraud alert basically notifies businesses or anyone who would pull up your credit report that your information has been compromised. The entities that have pulled up your credit report would then have to take extra measures in verifying that the person applying for a loan or a credit card is indeed you.
Placing a fraud alert on your credit report is free and you can do it on your own. So there shouldn’t be a reason for you not to activate this feature, if your personal information gets compromised.

BBB Accreditation





                BBB Accredited Since 04/06/2017
            

                BBB has determined that Continental Finance Company, LLC meets Standards of BBB Accreditation, which include a commitment to make a good faith effort to resolve any consumer complaints. BBB Accredited Businesses pay a fee for accreditation review/monitoring and for support of BBB services to the public.
            

                BBB accreditation does not mean that the business's products or services have been evaluated or endorsed by BBB, or that BBB has made a determination as to the business's product quality or competency in performing services.
            








Standards of BBB Accreditation






Build Trust









            Establish and maintain a positive track record in the marketplace.
        

           An accredited business or organization agrees to:

                   1. Have been operational (actively selling products or services) in any BBB service area for at least the most recent 6 months, unless the principle(s) previously operated a similar business with an eligible record (one that qualifies for BBB accreditation).
                

                   1. Fulfill contracts signed and agreements reached.
                

                   3. Be free from government action that demonstrates a significant failure to support BBB ethical principles in marketplace transactions (this requires a determination by BBB as to the nature of any violation, whether it was caused or condoned by management, and actions taken to resolve underlying issues that led to the government action).
                
4. Be free of an unsatisfactory rating and maintain at least a B rating at the accrediting BBB and the BBB where it is headquartered, if different.

                   5. In its relationship with BBB: 
1. meet all applicable standards within this Code of Business Practices

                            2. cooperate with BBB's activities and efforts to promote voluntary self- regulation within the business' industry
                        
3. honor any settlements, agreements or decisions reached as an outcome of a BBB dispute resolution process

                            4. complete the required application and pay all monetary obligations to BBB in a timely manner
                        









Advertise Honestly









            Adhere to established standards of advertising and selling.
        

            An accredited business or organization agrees to: 

                    1. Follow federal, state/provincial and local advertising laws.
                

                    2. Abide by the BBB Code of Advertising. Supply, upon request, substantiation for advertising and selling claims. Correct advertising and selling practices, when recommended by BBB.
                
3. Adhere to applicable BBB industry codes of advertising.
4. Cooperate with BBB self-regulatory programs for the resolution of advertising disputes.
5. Use the BBB name and logos in accordance with BBB policy.

                    6. Avoid misleading customers by creating the false impression of sponsorship, endorsement, popularity, trustworthiness, product quality or business size through the misuse of logos, trustmarks, pictures, testimonials, or other means
                







Tell the Truth

BBB Accreditation Reviews

BBB routinely monitors its files on all Accredited Businesses to affirm that they continue to meet all BBB Accreditation Standards











BBB Accreditation Process


        Not every business is eligible for BBB Accreditation. Businesses must meet, commit to and maintain the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards) 
        in order to be eligible for and maintain BBB Accreditation. The BBB Code of Business Practices represents sound advertising, selling and customer
        service practices that enhance customer trust and confidence in business. The Code is built on the BBB Standards for Trust, eight principles that
        summarize important elements of creating and maintaining trust in business.
    

        In order to be eligible for Accreditation a business must complete an Accreditation application.        
    

        Upon receipt of a fully completed BBB Application for Accreditation, BBB staff:        
        
Reviews the application
Researches the business
Verifies the information presented in the application 
May request additional information
May request proof of specific information on the application

        After the review and verification process, BBB will then evaluate if the business meets the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards)..
    
    
        Once BBB has finished its evaluation, the application for BBB Accreditation is either approved or denied. If the applicant is found in compliance with the BBB Code of Business Practices it will be presented to the BBB Board of Directors, or a committee of that board, for final approval. If the application is denied, BBB will contact the applicant, indicating the BBB Standard(s) that were not met and any recourse available to the applicant.

                                not impressed at the cost to "manage" my portfolio. High MERs costing me THOUSANDS of dollars... a $150,000 portfolio cost me $3,000 per year to "manage". What a joke. Go so ewhere else.

Continental Finance - DO NOT Apply with this company!!




                                    i had a credit card with Continental Finance when they offered a card ( Matrix) as a Discover card in 2012. My credit was pretty bad, and I knew it would take some time to improve, so I paid the rip-off fee of $125.00 that was to be deducted from my initial credit line...

Continental Finance - Talk to a Supervisor




                                    I called because I missed a payment due to my recent leg surgery. The service rep (Wanda) was so rude quick to tell me I owed 105.00 but couldn't explain why.

            This company has the worst online website. If you are ever late for a payment just tell them you had problems with the online service and they'll work with you because they know themselves that the system is out of order.

            Everytime you call customer service they tell you something different. Pretty sure no one there knows what is going on. They won't let you talk to a supervisor, just tell you a supervisor can't help you either. The online system does not let you see pending payments so you can easily duplicate your payment.

Continental Finance - Watch Out For These Guys




                                    Where Continental Finance gets its profits is luring in customers who have low credit scores and are desperate to find a credit card company that will help them repair their credit.

Continental Finance Credit Card - It's Good a card, don't be scared away- Good way to rebuild credit




                                    I have the unsecured Surge Credit Card through Continental Finance. Yes, there are a lot of fees. However, those fees are spelled out in the Customer Agreement form that is shown to you before your application is accepted. Also, the APR is shown in that same agreement....

Anonymous Exactly and when I called to activate the agreement was verbally stated. So I have the paperwork and it was reiterated verbally during activation. Should be no surprise here.
