About Us


What makes Moyer Realty Advisors different from all the rest? Service. Our appraisals are second to none but beyond that SERVICE is always paramount in our minds. Arriving at the clients’ site on time. Delivery of the final product, ON TIME. These are the important factors of our business.
We maintain memberships in the Appraisal Institute, the largest and most respected appraisal organization in the United States. Individuals who have earned the MAI (Member Appraisal Institute) have first attained extensive experience in the valuation of real property, received passing grades on a required series of written examinations, and demonstrated specific appraisal skills in rendering competent service to clients. Every member must adhere to the Appraisal Institute’s strict Code of Professional Ethics and Standards of Professional Practice. All work prepared by Moyer Realty Advisors, LLC is certified by a Member of the Appraisal Institute.
Appraisals completed in recent years include large industrial and commercial properties of all varieties including shopping centers, office buildings, flex buildings, distribution ware house buildings, hotels/motels, restaurants, adult care facilities, apartment complexes, low income housing tax credit complexes and subdivisions. Additionally, Moyer Realty Advisors, LLC has completed many appraisals and consultations on a wide variety of special-purpose facilities. Moyer Realty Advisors, LLC works on a regional scale, concentrating primarily in central, eastern and northeastern Pennsylvania, and western New Jersey.
