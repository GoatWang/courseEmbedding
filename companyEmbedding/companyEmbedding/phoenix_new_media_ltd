P/E Ratio (TTM) The Price to Earnings (P/E) ratio, a key valuation measure, is calculated by dividing the stock's most recent closing price by the sum of the diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the trailing 12 month period.  Earnings Per Share (TTM) A company's net income for the trailing twelve month period expressed as a dollar amount per fully diluted shares outstanding. Market Capitalization Reflects the total market value of a company. Market Cap is calculated by multiplying the number of shares outstanding by the stock's price. For companies with multiple common share classes, market capitalization includes both classes. Shares Outstanding Number of shares that are currently held by investors, including restricted shares owned by the company's officers and insiders as well as those held by the public. Public Float The number of shares in the hands of public investors and available to trade. To calculate, start with total shares outstanding and subtract the number of restricted shares. Restricted stock typically is that issued to company insiders with limits on when it may be traded. Dividend Yield A company's dividend expressed as a percentage of its current stock price.

Money Flow Uptick/Downtick Ratio Money flow measures the relative buying and selling pressure on a stock, based on the value of trades made on an "uptick" in price and the value of trades made on a "downtick" in price. The up/down ratio is calculated by dividing the value of uptick trades by the value of downtick trades. Net money flow is the value of uptick trades minus the value of downtick trades.

We estimate that we will receive net proceeds from this offering of 
approximately US$113.6 million, or approximately US$133.2 million if the 
underwriters exercise their option to purchase additional ADSs in full, in 
each case after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and the 
estimated offering expenses payable by us.

We intend to use the net proceeds from this offering for the following 
purposes:

• US$50.0 million for content acquisition and production;

• US$35.0 million for product development and technology infrastructure; and

• US$25.0 million for marketing and sales. 

We intend to use the remaining portion of the net proceeds we receive from 
this offering for other general corporate purposes, including potential 
facilities upgrade, and for potential acquisitions although we are not 
currently negotiating any acquisition transactions.

The foregoing represents our current intentions to use and allocate the net 
proceeds of this offering based upon our present plans and business 
conditions. Our management, however, will have significant flexibility and 
discretion to apply the net proceeds of this offering. If an unforeseen event 
occurs or business conditions change, we may use the proceeds of this offering
differently than as described in this prospectus.

Pending use of the net proceeds, we intend to hold our net proceeds in demand 
deposits or invest them in interest-bearing government securities.

In utilizing the proceeds from this offering, as an offshore holding company,
we are permitted, under PRC laws and regulations, to provide funding to our 
PRC operating subsidiary only through loans or capital contributions and to 
our affiliated consolidated entities only through loans. Subject to the 
satisfaction of applicable government registration and approval requirements, 
we may extend loans to our operating subsidiary and affiliated consolidated 
entities in China or make additional capital contributions to our operating 
subsidiary in China to fund their capital expenditures or working capital. 
For an increase of registered capital of our PRC subsidiary, we need to 
receive approval from the Ministry of Commerce of the PRC or its local 
counterparts, who will decide within 90 days after receiving the application 
documents. If we provide funding to our PRC subsidiary through loans, the 
total amount of such loans may not exceed the difference between its total 
investment as approved by the foreign investment authorities and its 
registered capital. Such loans should be registered with the SAFE which 
usually takes no more than 20 working days to complete. The cost of obtaining 
such approvals or completing such registration is minimal. If we are not able 
to receive such approvals in a timely basis or at all, we may consider 
adopting legally permissible alternatives, including we and our PRC subsidiary
entering into transactions by which our PRC subsidiary borrows RMB loans from 
a financial institution in China and we or any of our offshore entities 
providing corporate guarantees to an offshore affiliate of such financial 
institution in connection with the borrowing of such a loan by our PRC 
subsidiary.

We cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain these government 
registrations or approvals on a timely basis, if at all.


We operate in the market of Internet and mobile Internet content and services 
in China. The industry is highly competitive and rapidly changing due to the 
fast growing market and technological developments. Our ability to compete 
successfully depends on many factors, including the quality and relevance of 
our content, the demographic composition of our users, brand recognition and 
reputation, user experience, the robustness of our technology platform, our 
ability to provide innovative advertising services to our customers and our 
relationships with our advertisers. 

While we believe that our integrated platform business model and targeted user 
base is distinct, on the whole, from other companies in China, we compete with 
other content and service providers in each of our individual channels for user
traffic, advertising revenue and fee-based services. In online content and 
service provision, we compete primarily with NetEase.com, Inc., Sina 
Corporation, Sohu.com Inc. and Tencent Technology Limited (QQ.com). In video, 
we compete with a number of "pure play" online video companies, including 
Ku6.com, Qiyi.com, Tudou Holdings Limited and Youku.com Inc. In addition, CCTV,
China's largest and state-owned television network launched its online video 
website, China Network Television, or CNTV, in December 2009. We also face 
competition in this area from the online video websites of large Chinese 
Internet companies, such as NetEase.com, Sina Corporation, Sohu.com Inc., and 
Tencent Technology Limited. In mobile Internet, we primarily compete against 
3G Menhu, A8.com, and Kong Zhong Corporation, as well as the mobile businesses 
of the large Chinese Internet companies Sina Corporation and Tencent Technology
Limited (3G.QQ.com). 

For overseas Chinese users, we compete with Wenxuecity.com and Duowei News in 
the United States and Yahoo!Qimo in Taiwan. 

We also compete with traditional advertising media, such as television, radio, 
print media, as well as billboards and other forms of outdoor media. Large 
companies currently spend a relatively small portion of their advertising 
budgets on new media advertising as compared to traditional media advertising, 
but we expect their proportionate spending on new media advertising relative to
traditional media advertising to increase in the future.


Company Description
We are the leading new media company providing premium content on an 
integrated platform across Internet, mobile and TV channels in China. Having
originated from a leading global Chinese language TV network based in Hong
Kong, Phoenix Satellite Television Holdings Limited, or Phoenix TV, we enable


 
consumers to access professional news and other quality content and share 
user-generated content, or UGC, on the Internet and through their mobile 
devices. We also transmit our UGC and in-house produced content to TV viewers
primarily through Phoenix TV. Our ifeng.com website ranked number one in 
terms of page views, or PV, among the world's leading TV companies' websites, 
including CNN.com, BCC.co.uk and CNTV.cn, in March 2011 according to 
Alexa.com, a third-party web information company, and ranked 8 th  among all 
Chinese websites in terms of PV in December 2010, according to Google Ad 
Planner. We had 222 million online monthly unique visitors in March 2011, and 
according to a report we commissioned from Shanghai iResearch Co., Ltd., 
a third-party PRC consulting and market research firm focused on Internet 
media markets, or the iResearch Report, our online users' average monthly 
income was over four times that of the average Internet user in China in 
November 2010. Leveraging our coveted user demographic and influential brand, 
we have established a high-growth and profitable business model with 
diversified revenue streams from both advertising and paid services.

We provide journalism with balanced perspectives, global news coverage, 
investigative reports and in-depth analysis of events in compelling 
presentation formats. Our news vertical has been ranked number one in terms 
of PV compared to news verticals of Chinese Internet portals since July 2010 
by Alexa.com. We possess strong capabilities in sourcing and editing content,
as well as in original production. Our content library is enriched by our 
exclusive license to use Phoenix TV's copyrighted content and is enhanced by 
the interactive contribution from our users through UGC. We believe the high 
quality of our content distinguishes us within the new media industry in 
China. Our quality content has served to attract a large user base, as 
evidenced by the 311 million average daily online PV and 88 million average 
daily mobile PV that our platform received in March 2011. We believe the 
premium nature of our content is further demonstrated by ifeng.com's high
number of page views per visitor, or PV/UV, which was higher than the PV/UV 
of any major Chinese Internet portal in November 2010 according to the 
iResearch Report, and its high level of daily time on site per user, which 
was significantly greater than that of the leading Chinese online video 
websites in March 2011, according to Alexa.com.

Our brand, "ifeng.com" ( GRAPHIC ), has achieved prominence among Chinese 
Internet users. We were recognized as the "Most Valuable Chinese Internet 
Brand" at the Chinese Internet Advertisers Annual Convention in October 2010. 
The appeal of our brand is enhanced by its affiliation with the "Phoenix" 
( GRAPHIC ) brand of Phoenix TV. In Chinese culture, the Chinese Phoenix is 
an auspicious mythical bird that symbolizes unrivaled excellence. Benefiting 
from China's "open and reform" policy, Phoenix TV has been a driving force in
China's media reform and its programs are highly popular in China, as 
evidenced by the Phoenix Chinese Channel's thirteenth consecutive semi-annual 
first place ranking for audience appreciation since 2004 by CTR Market 
Research, a joint venture between China International TV Corporation and TNS 
Global Market Research. Our and Phoenix TV's active promotion of one another's
brands on our respective Internet-enabled and TV platforms helps to grow our 
combined audience synergistically.

Our distinguished content, attractive user base and diverse product lines 
provide us with multiple opportunities for monetization in both advertising 
and paid services. We derived 38.7% and 61.3% of our total revenues from 
advertising and paid services, respectively, in 2010. We recognize our 
advertising revenues on a net basis and generate them by providing 
advertising services through our online and video channels primarily and, to 
a small extent at present, through our mobile channel. Driven by the growing 
number of premium brand advertisers that we have attracted across a wide range
of industries, our net advertising revenues grew at rates of 102.8% from 2008 
to 2009, and 150.4% from 2009 to 2010. We offer a variety of paid services 
across all of our channels, including (i) mobile Internet and value-added 
services, or MIVAS, which includes our digital reading services, mobile game 
services and wireless value-added services, or WVAS, such as messaging-based 
services (SMS and MMS); (ii) video value-added services, or video VAS, which 
consists of our online subscription and pay-per-view video services, our 
mobile subscription and pay-per-view video services, and video content sales; 
and (iii) Internet value-added services, or Internet VAS. We primarily 
generate our paid service revenues from our WVAS, digital reading services
and mobile video subscription and pay-per-view services by providing content 
to mobile device users and collecting revenue shares or fixed fees for our 
content services from the relevant mobile operator. We also earn a significant
amount of paid service revenues in the form of fixed fees from China Mobile 
Communications Corporation, or China Mobile, for our digital reading services.
These offerings have driven the growth of our paid service users from 6.4 
million users as of March 31, 2010, to 10.1 million users as of March 31, 
2011, representing a growth rate of 57.0%.

In 2008, 2009 and 2010, we generated total revenues of RMB222.6 million, 
RMB262.3 million and RMB528.7 million (US$80.1 million), respectively, 
representing a compound annual growth rate, or CAGR, of 54.1%. Our net 
advertising revenues were RMB40.3 million, RMB81.6 million and RMB204.4 
million (US$31.0 million) in 2008, 2009 and 2010, respectively, representing
a CAGR of 125.3%, and our paid service revenues were RMB182.4 million, 
RMB180.7 million and RMB324.3 million (US$49.1 million) in 2008, 2009 and 
2010, respectively, representing a CAGR of 33.4%. We incurred a net loss 
attributable to Phoenix New Media Limited of RMB28.2 million in 2008. We 
achieved a net income attributable to Phoenix New Media Limited of RMB0.3 
million and RMB74.1 million (US$11.2 million) in 2009 and 2010, respectively. 
Adjusted net income attributable to Phoenix New Media Limited, a non-GAAP 
financial measure which excludes share-based compensation expenses, was 
RMB1.8 million, RMB10.5 million and RMB90.6 million (US$13.7 million) in 
2008, 2009 and 2010, respectively. 

While we attribute our success largely to the strength of our company, we 
also benefit from our relationship with Phoenix TV. In November 2009, our PRC 
subsidiary, Fenghuang On-line, entered into a cooperation agreement with 
Phoenix TV, or the Phoenix TV Cooperation Agreement, pursuant to which each 
of our affiliated consolidated entities entered into a program content 
license agreement, or Content License Agreement, with Phoenix Satellite 
Television Company Limited and a trademark license agreement, or Trademark 
License Agreement, with Phoenix Satellite Television Trademark Limited. Each 
of these agreements will expire in March 2016 unless both of the relevant 
parties agree to extend their respective terms. Under certain conditions, 
these agreements may be terminated early. The exclusive content licenses 
granted to our affiliated consolidated entities help to distinguish our 
content offerings from those of other Internet and new media companies in 
China and make a material contribution to our business, in particular, to 
our video VAS business, which accounted for 5.0% of our total revenues in 
2010, and, indirectly, to our video advertising business. Our most valuable 
intellectual property asset is our domain name, ifeng.com, which we own. In 
addition, our affiliated consolidated entities license certain of Phoenix 
TV's logos. These logos help to affiliate our brand with that of Phoenix TV 
and vice versa, which helps to enhance our respective brand names. For more
information about the potential consequences to our business if we are unable 
to receive the same level of support from Phoenix TV in the future.

Upon completion of this offering, Phoenix TV, through its wholly owned 
subsidiary, Phoenix Satellite Television (B.V.I) Holding Limited, or 
Phoenix TV (BVI), will continue to be our controlling shareholder, with 
beneficial ownership and voting power of 52.17% and 58.65%, respectively, 
of our outstanding ordinary shares, assuming the underwriters do not exercise
their over-allotment option, the entire assured entitlement distribution to
Phoenix TV's shareholders is made in ADSs and the assured entitlement 
distribution occurs immediately after this offering. Although we believe that 
our interests and those of Phoenix TV are mostly aligned because Phoenix TV 
will continue to consolidate our financial results as long as Phoenix TV 
maintains a majority voting interest in our company, there may be conflicts 
of interest between our company and Phoenix TV from time to time. We may not 
be able to resolve any potential conflicts, and even if we do, the resolution
may be less favorable to us than if we were dealing with a non-controlling 
shareholder.
