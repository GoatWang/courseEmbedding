JASON cd transportDownload Images Hi-Res The JASON CD Transport we conceived with the goal to play the music from a CD in a most transparent way and at the same time support the D/A Converter connected to the JASON Transport for optimum playback quality. We think we succeeded. With the JASON you won’t look back at any other CD playback solution.
 
Our renowned MEDUS D/A Converter complements the JASON CD Transport for a truly state of the art CD playback system. The design and electronics are of the same high quality in both units. We included many features in the JASON which make it the CD Transport of choice not only in conjunction with the MEDUS but for all kinds of D/A Converters.The JASON supports up-sampling of the 44.1kHz signal to 88.2 kHz or 176.4 kHz. A digital level control via the remote control unit is also built in. The DAC++ feature can be switched on to optimize the sonic quality with D/A Converters which have a jitter problem and as a consequence may give compromising sonic results.
 
A display informs about the track number played, the selected sampling frequency, the absolute polarity of the output signal, the audio volume, the mute status and the DAC++ feature setting.
 
The IR remote control allows to control all features mentioned above and in addition can set the display brightness.
“I wish to thank you for providing me with the opportunity to share your engineering expertise as manifest in the perfection of the JASON. I cannot contemplate ever replacing it in my system. It is the finest piece of electronics I have experienced in the 45 years I have been an audiophile.”

Robert R. Nowinski, USAMain Features Mechanics
 The JASON uses a high-quality top-loader transport system. A heavy-duty motor driven lid protects the CD and also safely puts the puck onto the CD upon closure. The motor is of the same Swiss brand as NASA is using for their Mars mobiles. The JASON employs a twin metal frame. The inner chassis is made of steel and acts as a very effective shield against electrostatic and electromagnetic radiation. The outer frame is made of massive anodized aluminium for additional shielding, resulting in optimal heat convection and beautiful looks. The four feet have been designed for optimum vibration and shock absorption.
 
TransportThe JASON uses the renowned Philips CDPRO2M transport as its core unit. The master clock for the CDPRO2M unit is generated by our own clock circuitry.
 
Power SupplyA powerful non-switching power supply is used. All sensitive voltages have their own regulators. The power switch activates a semiconductor relay which only switches on or off at zero crossings of the mains voltage. This assures a glitch free power switching.
 
SynchronizationAn internal high precision and low jitter clock generator generates all clocking signals, including those necessary for the CDPRO2M transport.
 
Up-sampling, Word-length Reduction, Jitter Processing
The JASON contains an up-sampler feature which allows the basic 44.1 kHz/16 Bit data stream of the CD to be up-sampled to 88.2 kHz or 176.4 kHz for subsequent D/A conversion. Our own state of the art algorithms for the up-sampling as used by many of our professional studio customers are put to work.
 
Since the up-sampling process has the effect of generating a word-length longer than 16 Bits, a 40 Bit Floating Point format is used. This is then reduced in its word-length to fit the standard AES/EBU or S/PDIF formats. This word-length reduction uses the POW-R #3 algorithm. POW-R is the de-facto standard in professional audio for word-length reduction. POW-R has been developed by the “POW-R Consortium LLC”, where Weiss Engineering Ltd. is one of the four member companies. The output word-length can be selected between 16, 20 or 24 Bits, which allows the connection of a wide variety of D/A converters to the JASON.
 
The JASON uses a special method to treat the output signal so that jitter generated in subsequent cables or D/A Converters has less influence on the audio quality. This allows D/A Converters with non-ideal jitter performance to be used with enhanced sonic quality.Digital Outputs

Ancient Greece. Jason and Medea. An epic but doomed love story full of murder and magic. Also a play by Euripides. Medea was King Aeetes of Colchi's daughter and a great sorceress. When Jason and his Argonautes arrived at the Colchis Court in search of the famed golden ram's fleece, Jason was charged with seemingly impossible tasks to be granted the fleece. With Medea's magic, Jason obtained the fleece regardless and promptly escaped with her and her younger brother Absyrtis, the king in hot pursuit. Medea killed and dismembered her own brother to slow down the pursuers who were honor-bound to collect the body parts for a proper funeral. While Medea bore Jason two children in exile, he eventually abandoned her in favor of the king of Corinth's daughter. Medea extracted due revenge by poisoning the new bride and killing her own children to spite the father. In short, plenty of sex and violence. Nothing much seems to have changed since when it comes to telling saucy tales that hold an audience enthralled.








Perhaps that's why Swiss pro-audio firm Weiss named its first consumer audio products Jason and Medea. It suggests spellbinding results full of juice and passion. Led by white magician Daniel Weiss -- weiss is German for white -- his design DNA goes back to Studer Revox in whose digital audio lab he worked for five year designing sample rate converters and DSP code for digital audio recorders. He launched Weiss Engineering in 1985 to focus on digital audio equipment for mastering studios - A/D and D/A converters, equalizers, dynamic processors, sampling rate converters and such. Clients of his pro









kit include Abbey Road, BMG, EMI, Telarc, Teldec, Sony, Warner and audiophile celebrities like Bob Ludwig and Bernie Grundman, to name just a few (for a more comprehensive list, click here).


							Sleek, of low profile and with very clean and simple lines, the Weiss consumer cosmetics are reminiscent of fellow Swiss company Orpheus, i.e. timeless, uncluttered and an antidote to the nouveau-riche glitz pursued in the audio jewelry sector. The professional mastering studio background meanwhile recalls Ed Meitner's EMM Labs. This spells no-compromise tech. It caters specifically to top professionals who don't mind committing murder to the checkbook to secure the ultimate tools for their trade craft. If Daniel Weiss was first and foremost a consumer audio provider, he couldn't justify this kind of heavy in-house R&D. Dwindling sales for state-of-the-art RedBook consumer machines don't pay for proprietary custom solutions in the DSP arena. No, it's the professional recording engineers who subsidize the high-end arm of Weiss Pro. Still, final retail pricing remains an Olympian $28,000 for the combo. Echoes of golden fleecing from ancient Greece? Weiss would point at hand-made in Suisse for perspective instead.


Based on their pro-arena DAC-1, the Medea DAC was introduced in 2001. It was duly greeted with fanfare in the audiophile glossies. It also measured like a dream. The newer Jason saw the light of day in 2004. To date, it lacks any English reviews though one each in German, Dutch and Chinese is on record. As you'd expect from its profile, Weiss Engineering is big on accuracy. In digital, accuracy depends on equal sampling of the signal every 22.67 microseconds. Wrong time spacing of these samples creates jitter which becomes most audible in the higher frequencies where wave forms are steeper. Hello digital glare. Besides the A/D and D/A conversion processes, asynchronous sample rate conversion used during vari-speed modes of digital audio recorders for example can also introduce jitter (i.e. inaccurate sample timing). Further jitter sources during D/A conversion include power supply crosstalk from spindle or servo motors; capacitive or inductive crosstalk between clock signals; microphony of the sample-rate crystal clock generator; and the connecting cables. With external units such as are under consideration, the received data also has to be sync'd with the send clock in the transport for the most obvious source of jitter.








The Weiss Jason with its motor-driven lid -- its disc clamp is conveniently fitted to it -- employs the Philips CDPRO2M transport and sports user-selectable upsampling to 88.2 and 176.4kHz. Incidentally, the Swiss company which supplied the lift motor also supplied motors for the NASA Mars Rover. Word length of course increases with upsampling engaged. Here it can be trimmed at the outputs from 24 bits down to 20 and 16 bits, for DACs like my 16-bit Zanden which won't lock to anything else. Word-length reduction from the 32-bit floating point length is accomplished via the POW-R #3 algorithm. That's short for Psychoacoustically Optimized Wordlength Reduction and was developed by a consortium of four companies including Weiss (the others are Millennia Media, Z-Systems and Lake Systems). Apparently it is the standard in 







professional recording studios as well as with Apple Computer. The DAC+ function on the remote engages spread spectrum technologies to optimize the signal in the jitter domain when used with converters of lesser jitter rejection. "It has the purpose of covering discrete jitter frequencies -- which can be present in less than optimum DAC designs -- with a broad band jitter spectrum. This in effect produces a broader or flatter jitter spectrum, which results in reduced jitter-induced distortions. Jitter is therefore turned into broadband white noise and much less detrimental to the sonic quality than discrete jitter frequencies would be." Like the Medea, the Jason employs a dual-chassis construction, with the inner chassis of steel for superior shielding, the outer chassis of aluminum for heat convection, additional shielding and appearance.











							Jason's connectivity bay includes 7 digital outputs - RCA and Toslink fixed at 44.1kHz; RCA, BNC, XLR and ST optical at either 44.1, 88.2 or 176.4kHz; and twinned XLRs at 88.2 and 176.4kHz (muted at 44.1kHz). There's also the ubiquitous IEC power inlet and a USB port for future software upgrades via downloads. The included custom aluminum remote has a few double-function buttons whose lesser-used commands are accessed by pressing the ALT button first. Those include sample rate and word length options which you'll likely only set once during initial setup. The remote also controls volume, absolute phase and display brightness, the former two manipulated in the DSP domain like the upsampling, i.e. external to the commercial converter chip. The mains voltage can be changed by prying off the IEC cover and turning the internal drum to the desired value.


							The Weiss Medea converter uses a dual phase-lock-loop said to be unusually effective into subsonic frequencies where conventional PLLs begin to lose accuracy below 1kHz. Like Jason, Medea performs its upsampling -- here necessary to allow for a shallower, more phase-benign 3rd-order reconstruction filter -- mostly in the external DSP domain. The 8 x oversampling DACs run at 352.8kHz and a Class A output stage with massively paralleled transistors for nearly zero output impedance -- 0.2 ohms to be precise -- follows the converter stage. Several reclocking schemes are combined to minimize jitter while a proprietary MRCS Mutual Relation Correlation System circuit lowers the S/N ratio of the converter yet further. Incoming signal from a disc spinner can be locked at 44.1, 48, 88.2, 96, 176.4 and 192kHz. For connectivity, the Medea offers four front-panel selectable digital inputs carried in parallel on both XLR and RCA (one Toslink) for a total of eight. Analog outputs appear on both RCA and XLR, no servos employed. Output voltage level can be trimmed with dual-mono front-panel pots and a supplied screw driver. Hi-gain or lo-gain mode are selected on the rear panel. Max output voltage is 21/27dBu for RCA/XLR respectively. Upsampling, jitter reduction and deemphasis are once again handled in the DSP domain. No HDCD processing is included.






With the different upsampling options between Jason and Medea, I asked Daniel for some clarification. "Upsampling basically can be done anywhere between the 44.1 output of the CD transport and the DAC. Modern DACs usually have some upsampling built in to relax the requirements for the analog reconstruction filter after the DAC. The upsampling process is in essence a digital low-pass filter and its quality is crucial to the overall quality of the transport-to-DAC chain. By performing the upsampling in our Jason transport, we have control over the quality of that process independent of the type of DAC connected. If our Medea DAC connects to the Jason, the user can choose between various types of up/over-sampling schemes depending on preference. These are: Jason none, Medea DSP to 88.2, Medea DAC chip to 352.8 | Jason to 88.2, Medea DSP none, Medea DAC chip to 352.8 | and Jason to 176.4, Medea DSP none, Medea DAC chip to 352.8. Technically the most critical part is the 44.1 to 88.2 upsampling." On the subject of which commercial silicon handles conversion duties, Daniel reserved the right not to be specific. He explained that he didn't want any discussions of his Medea DAC to center on preconceived notions over certain chips. He also wants the freedom to switch suppliers if and when this improves performance. 











If this were marketing propaganda, we would spin incessantly. "Hear it on the equipment that was used to record your music". And, "if it was the choice for the performing and recording artists, shouldn't it be yours". Which, truly, doesn't take much spin. If you really want to hear just what remains hidden in the groove code of your silver discs, top shelf professional kit ought to retrieve it. Therein lies the potential rub though. From professional monitors by PMC and Klein & Hummel to source gear by dCS or Benchmark Media, audiophiles often claim



such kit to be too neutral, too clinical or sterile to serve the music. The test bench meanwhile responds regularly with superb linearity graphs for just such gear to underline the old dichotomy. Truth and beauty. Clearly, audiophiles must pay at least lip service to data honesty. How else to retain their memberships in Club High Fidelity? Yet when the gavel comes down, many judge in favor of less honesty. They desire more musicality. That's everyone's favorite weasel word. Recording engineers need microscopic honesty. They would tell us that we need the same - if we are truly serious about hearing their work rather than editorialize it arbitrarily. (And to editorialize it with conscious choice of course would rely on intimate familiarity with the untouched source code. Since we weren't present during the recording session, we cannot. Thus the issue is both mute and unresolved). The question is, do we really want the truth? Can we handle it? Like the judge in the pornography case, we claim we know musicality when we see/hear it even though we're otherwise mostly incapable of defining it. Based on the pro-arena connection, the exclusive pricing and the longevity of the company and its resident engineering department, technical excellence at the edge of the art seems pretty much a given. How would all that translate though to decidedly non-technical ears that don't give a twit about specs and theory?

Weiss JASON CD TRANSPORTReference CD Transport

“I wish to thank you for providing me with the opportunity to share your engineering expertise as manifest in the perfection of the Jason. I cannot contemplate ever replacing it in my system. It is the finest piece of electronics I have experienced in the 45 years I have been an audiophile.”Robert R. Nowinski, USA

The JASON CD Transport is an addition to our already famous MEDEA D/A Converter. The design and electronics are of the same high quality in both units. We included many features in the JASON which make it the CD Transport of choice not only in conjunction with the MEDEA but for all kinds of D/A Converters or Digital Amplifiers.

MechanicsThe JASON uses a high-quality top-loader transport system. A heavy-duty motor driven lid protects the CD and also safely puts the puck onto the CD upon closure. The chassis is of the same quality as the Medea chassis, a dual design with a inner chassis made of steel and an aluminium outer chassis. The feet are resonance absorbing types of our own design.

OutputsThe digital outputs come in a variety of formats and sampling rates to cover all requirements on the D/A Converter side:

Connector Sampling Rates (kHz) Wordlength FormatRCA 44.1 fixed 16 Bit fixed S/PDIFToslink (optical) 44.1 fixed 16 Bit fixed S/PDIFSingle XLR Single wire 44.1 / 88.2/ 176.4 selectable 16 / 20 / 24 Bit selectable AES/EBUDouble XLR Double wire 88.2/ 176.4 selectable 16 / 20 / 24 Bit selectable AES/EBUBNC 44.1 / 88.2/ 176.4 selectable 16 / 20 / 24 Bit selectable AES/EBUST Optical 44.1 / 88.2/ 176.4 selectable16 / 20 / 24 Bit selectable AES/EBU

UpsamplingThe JASON contains an upsampler feature which allows to upsample the basic 44.1kHz / 16Bit data stream from the CD to 88.2 kHz or 176.4 kHz for subsequent D/A conversion. For the upsampling we use our proven algorithms used by many of our professional studio customers.

Wordlength ReductionThe upsampling process has the effect of generating a wordlength longer than 16 Bits, in the JASON a 40 Bit Floating Point format is generated. In order to output the upsampled signal, it is reduced in its wordlength to fit the standard AES/EBU or S/PDIF formats. This wordlength reduction uses the POW-R # 3 algorithm, which is one of the best wordlength reduction schemes, widely used in Pro Audio equipment. The output wordlength can be selected between 16, 20 and 24 Bits, which allows to hook up a wide variety of D/A converters to the JASON.

D/A Converter EnhancementThe JASON uses a specific method (spread spectrum technology) to treat the output signal such that the clocking quality of the subsequent D/A Converter does not have much influence on the audio quality. This allows for the use D/A Converters with non-ideal clocking performance.

Weiss Engineering Jason








Take a cleaver and hack a CD player into two functional halves. What you end up with is a transport and a digital-to-analog converter (DAC). Is that really necessary? Is there a good reason to break an integrated CD player, which is bound to be a more cost-effective design, into two pieces? The most compelling reason is flexibility—the ability to experiment with new DAC designs as digital technology continues to evolve. Having lived with the Jason for some time now, I am convinced that a good transport is essential to laying the foundation for a sonically superior digital front end. The notion, popular in some circles, that a good DAC can overcome the limitations of a mediocre transport gets crushed by the Jason. But then this is no ordinary transport. The Weiss Engineering Jason was built without compromise in either electronics or software to partner with not only Weiss’ own Medea DAC but any DAC or digital amplifier out there. At the Jason’s core is the impressive Philips CDPRO2M top-loader mechanism. Push the “Eject” button and a motor drive lifts a heavy-duty lid. Push it again and the lid closes while securely capturing the CD. As with the Medea, the chassis consists of a twin frame. The inner steel chassis provides an effective shield against electrostatic and electromagnetic fields, while the outer anodized aluminum frame is responsible mainly for heat convection and the unit’s elegant cosmetics. 

Attention to detail is abundant. All sensitive voltages have dedicated regulators. The power switch activates a solid-state-based relay which only switches on or off at zero crossings of the mains voltage, ensuring glitch-free power switching. An internal low-jitter clock generates all clocking signals, including those required for the CDPRO2M transport. In order to ensure maximum compatibility with 196kHz/24-bit or 88.2kHz/16-bit DACs, the 44.1kHz/16-bit signal from the CDPRO2M may be optionally upsampled to 88.2kHz or 176.4kHz. When upsampling is engaged, the output word-length can be set to 16, 20, or 24 bits to accommodate the word-length requirement of the partnering DAC. Word-length reduction to 16, 20, or 24 bits is performed via proprietary on-board digital signal processing using the POW-R dithering algorithm, which is the de facto standard in professional audio for this operation. In the case of the Medea DAC or any other DAC which can accept any of the Jason’s outputs, it is possible to experiment with the various upsampling options to determine which sounds best in the context of a particular system. The Medea’s onboard DSP upsamples 44.1 to 88.2kHz, while its DAC chip upsamples 88.2 and 176.4kHz input to 352.8kHz. Thus, for Jason and Medea users, the critical step of upsampling from 44.1 to 88.2kHz may be performed either by the Jason or the Medea. According to designer Daniel Weiss, some users prefer the 44.1kHz/16-bit output from the Jason. And I can understand why. For a single cable connection (e.g., Jason AES/EBU output #4 into Medea input #3), I absolutely, positively, preferred 44.1kHz/16-bit settings. However, for a dual AES/EBU cable connection (Jason output #1 feeding inputs 1 and 2 on the Medea), 176.4kHz/24-bit was definitely king. Image outlines became more robust. Soundstage depth perspective was enhanced. In a nutshell, the music flowed with greater microdynamic conviction and analog-like spatiality; timbre accuracy, the cornerstone of musical realism, was exceptional. The Jason also incorporates an optional DAC+ circuit whose goal it is to mask discrete jitter frequencies with wideband noise. This spread-spectrum technology is based on the premise that raising a DAC’s noise floor is sonically benign while discrete jitter frequencies are not. With the Medea as the partnering DAC, activating the DAC+ circuit made no audible difference during my listening tests. Weiss does believe, however, that it would help inferior DACs perform better.

The remote control deserves special mention. It’s solidly built and provides complete control over all of the Jason’s functions, including selection of sampling rate and word-length. The Jason’s 0/180-degree phase inversion function is worth writing home about. The ability to invert signal polarity on the fly is essential to maximizing sound quality during CD playback. The ubiquitous multitrack recording process whereby 24 or more tracks are being mixed down to as few as two stereo tracks almost guarantees that one or more tracks in the mix are reversed in polarity. And the situation may differ from track to track. Quickly checking the 0 and 180-degree settings on the fly makes it extremely convenient to select the best sounding setting for a particular track. Generally speaking, one setting gives the most focused image outlines and is the criterion I use for setting polarity.The main focus of this review is the Jason since the Medea already earned a TAS Golden Ear Award (from JV) in 2003. However, I felt it important to reunite these protagonists in order to experience Weiss Engineering’s best digital front end. The Medea uses the Analog Devices AD1853 chipset in mono mode. The AD1853 is a 24-bit/192kHz multi-bit sigma-delta DAC introduced around 1999. It continues a minor design trend I have noted over the past several years of giving preference to older DAC chipsets. To be perfectly honest, even vintage 1980s DAC chips were already sporting incredible dynamic range. The relevant technical stories in recent years have been jitter reduction, more benign digital and analog filters, and the significant reduction of digital artifacts and brightness.In the past it has been easy for me to divide digital front ends into two distinct camps. On the one hand, there were the single-bit sigma-delta DACs that at their worst were harsh and grainy sounding, and at their best only mildly bright and grainy. On the other end of the spectrum were the multi-bit DACs that sounded pretty much de-fanged but also as if they had undergone a frontal lobotomy, being boring dynamically. This was not the sort of polite sound I could fall in love with, and at the end of the day, I would be willing to accept a bit of textural grit for the sake of convincing microdynamics. Enter the Jason and Medea. Now there’s no longer the need for any such concession. Harmonic textures were remarkably pure, totally non-digital sounding. It’s ironic that 26 years after the introduction of the CD and digital recording, one of the highest compliments I could pay a digital component is to label it analog-like. But my musical values are closely aligned with analog sound’s forte of smooth textures, microdynamic passion, and stable image outlines. In the case of the Jason and Medea, my listening notes added up mostly to a litany of “No’s”: No harmonic grain, no hyped-up upper octaves, no digital artifacts, no monotonous microdynamics. In fact, the music’s kinetic energy was propelled forward with a veritable “soul train” of emotions. Timbre accuracy was exceptional, each instrument being portrayed with believable tone and harmonic bloom. Performance at the frequency extremes is critically dependent on the associated speaker. But when the rest of the system was finely tuned, I can safely state that bass lines were full, tight, and in time with the upper octaves.Transients unfolded with startling clarity and precision. On the flip side, the decay of musical lines was resolvable in breathtaking fashion down to a velvety black background. There was simply no veiling of the music’s tapestry. As a consequence, a wealth of low-level detail was revealed, as if observing the soundstage though a microscope. Yet, the overall presentation remained quite natural. My favorite analogy to explain precisely what I mean is that it was like observing a school of fish in an aquarium. Most of the time it was the ensemble that captured my attention, but it was always possible to focus in on a specific instrument.The Medea uses a solid-state Class A output stage that features exceptionally low output impedance and allows it to drive long interconnect runs without a problem. The output stage’s distortion figures are very low. How low, you might ask? Well, apparently the Medea’s distortion figures are predominantly driven by the D/A converter and not by the output stage. Yet, the output stage did imprint its solid-state character upon the soundstage. That much was immediately obvious in a direct confrontation with the PrimaLuna Eight CD player. Make no mistake about it, the Weiss Engineering front end was much purer-sounding than the PrimaLuna, but it lacked the latter’s palpable imagery and soundstage depth. To be fair, it’s obviously a case of transistors versus tubes. Most listeners will agree that tubes portray a soundstage with greater spatiality. I’ve been asked why that is, and I can’t say that I have a definitive answer. It may well be a consequence of a tube’s inherent distortion spectrum, and I’m willing to accept that as a means to an end since in the final analysis I’m after the illusion of “live.” And the gestalt of listening to a musical ensemble is typically much stronger with tubes.There were still two more configurations to audition. First, having the Jason feeding my favorite under-$3k DAC, the Altmann Micro Machines’ Attraction DAC, and second, using the PrimaLuna Eight CD player as a transport with its digital output connected to the Medea. The Attraction DAC is the only zero-upsampling DAC to my knowledge that can accept a 16-bit/88.2kHz datastream in addition to 16-bit/44.1kHz. With the Jason it was obviously possible to try both sampling rates. To my surprise, I discovered that I actually preferred to upsample out of the Jason at 88.2kHz. In this context, the Attraction’s mids were slightly sweeter than the Medea’s, but clearly lacked the latter’s resolving power. And finally, the Medea was rather unhappy being coupled to the PrimaLuna Eight. Certainly, a good DAC can to some extent handle a lower-pedigree datastream, but the resultant sound quality was well below the standard set by the Jason. Hence, the notion that a DAC can fully overcome the limitations of an indifferent (i.e., inexpensive) transport bit the dust in these listening tests. I was a bit skeptical initially about the importance of a good transport, but no more! The Jason made a believer out of me. I can now safely state that the even the best of DACs can benefit from a world-class transport. The Jason’s blend of design excellence, useful features, purity of tone, and intrinsic boogie factor catapults it to the head of the class. Coupled with the Medea DAC, this is a digital front end that will recalibrate your expectations of CD sound quality.

Weiss Jason CD Transport






Default Title - $22,999.00 CAD




The JASON CD Transport is an addition to our already famous MEDEA D/A Converter. The design and electronics are of the same high quality in both units. We included many features in the JASON which make it the CD Transport of choice not only in conjunction with the MEDEA but for all kinds of D/A Converters or Digital Amplifiers. The JASON contains an upsampler feature which allows to upsample the basic 44.1kHz / 16Bit data stream from the CD to 88.2 kHz or 176.4 kHz for subsequent D/A conversion.

	Dear Vitacost.com Customer:
We regret to inform you that Burt’s Bees, which is owned by parent company Clorox, has decided to stop selling their products through Vitacost.com. Neither Clorox nor Burt’s Bees offered an explanation for this change, other than saying that selling through our website is not “consistent” with their current strategy.
	We find it unfortunate that you will no longer be able to benefit from the convenience of online delivery of this product, as well as Vitacost.com’s competitive pricing.

New Chapter Combines Nature’s Wisdom & Science for Supplements You Can Trust

If you’re familiar with New Chapter, the Vermont-based vitamin and supplement company that was founded in 1982, you probably know their remarkable dedication to sourcing the best ingredients for health in environmentally responsible ways.
New Chapter believes the best way to deliver the healing wisdom of nature is through effective, high-quality products that acknowledge not only the latest science, but are also inspired by time-tested herbal tradition. New Chapter has vowed to only introduce products that will make meaningful contributions-products that are new chapters for holistic health.
Inspired by nature, validated by science
New Chapter’s uncompromising dedication to quality and Mother Earth goes all the way back to their roots. New Chapter® was founded in 1982 by Paul and Barbi Schulick out of a desire to bring the remarkable value of nature’s botanicals into people’s lives. From the beginning, Paul and Barbi made a firm commitment to utilizing each whole plant in its pure, unadulterated form.
Nature, in its wholeness, offers a profound opportunity for supporting well-being!
What sets New Chapter apart
Sourcing the ideal ingredients is key in the production of New Chapter supplements. The company travels the globe for herbs, vegetables, mushrooms and fruits that meet strict standards for purity, potency and especially sustainable sourcing. And these ingredients are bursting with nourishment-organic turmeric from India in Turmeric Force™, wild-caught salmon from Alaska’s clean waters in Wholemega™, 10 potent herbs in clinically studied Zyflamend™ Whole Body and sustainably harvested plant calcium from Iceland in Bone Strength Take Care™. 
New Chapter is also a fermentation pioneer. In 1986 they began creating fermented multivitamins that are easily digestible and gentle on the stomach. Their proven, two-step fermentation method uses the power of clinically studied probiotics to bring vitality to each nutrient and unlock its health benefits. Fermentation creates a nutritious fermentate and unleashes Nature’s immune-boosters called beta glucans. Today, New Chapter makes holistic multivitamins for every stage of life, including prenatal and postnatal support.
 Plus New Chapter became a Certified B Corporation in 2014. B Corps are a vibrant new kind of business that define success not just in terms of profit, but in terms of people and planet.
Discover the New Chapter difference
Just as you might check foods for organic and non-GMO labeling, you can confirm the credentials of New Chapter vitamins and supplements the same way. New Chapter multivitamins are made with third-party certified organic vegetables and herbs, and they’re verified by the Non-GMO Project. You can find the Non-GMO Project Verified seal on Zyflamend™ Whole Body, on all New Chapter herbals and herbal blends, on LifeShield™ mushrooms and on their plant calcium, too.
Paul and Barbi’s mission today remains still the same: to deliver the wisdom of nature to all those seeking natural wellness. Check out New Chapter’s whole family of products and experience your own new chapter in holistic health!
