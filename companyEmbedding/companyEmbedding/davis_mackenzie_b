Mackenzie Davis: “There’s a Lot of Sex on the Show” 
Features. Posted 3 years ago

Mackenzie Davis’s bleach job is uneven. The top of her boyish mop is platinum but the short brush along her nape is brassy—it’s the piss-on-snow yellow of bleach not set long enough, a mistake no professional colorist would make, unless it’s deliberate: it is. This hair—hair Davis has been wearing for six months now—belongs to Cameron Howe, the punk programming prodigy (a do-it-yourself, “don’t give a damn ‘bout my bad reputation” kinda girl) Davis plays on AMC’s latest original series, Halt and Catch Fire. 
Halt and Catch Fire is a fictional period drama about early computing culture. Set in 1983, roughly one year after IBM released its first major product (the IBM PC) the show, which Mackenzie explains, “has little pieces of a lot of people and but is in no way emblematic of any one life or history,” follows a team of three—executive Joe McMillan (Lee Pace), engineer Gordon Clark (Scoot McNairy), and hacker Cameron Howe—as they race to create a product that will get them into the burgeoning PC market. In the opening scenes of the pilot, the somewhat swarmy McMillan, scouting for talent at Austin Tech, ends up sleeping with the rakish Howe in the back storage room of a video game arcade. 
“There’s a lot of sex on the show,” says Davis. But the sex, she insists, is neither gratuitous nor exploitative; it’s, rather, essential to the plot: “this is sex as power play or sex as a key to unlock one’s creative potential.” Even coding is sexy on the show, according to the actor: “There’s this eroticism that you get when you’re really close to cracking something that mentally turns you on,” she told me. “It’s an excitement that comes from within, a sensational creativity, and that’s in the show: there are scene where it’s like the characters are having a ménage à trois with computers as the third party.”
In developing the character of Cameron, Mackenzie focused on the erotics of hacking, as she found the math and science to be humblingly beyond her. “I audited an introductory MIT class on the programming language Python and,” she confesses, “my mind just doesn’t operate that way. I have so much respect for those that do.” 
Mackenzie’s mind is bent more towards art and literature. Before pursuing acting, the Canadian stunner (b. 1987 in Vancouver, BC) studied English Lit at McGill University in Montreal. On the day that I met her, at a restaurant in Greenpoint, Brooklyn (she was in town for 24 hours to sign an apartment lease and visit “best friends”), Mackenzie was reading Rachel Kushner’s Telex From Cuba, which she’d picked up after reading Kushner’s second, bestselling novel, The Flamethrowers. There’s an affinity between those two novels and Halt and Catch Fire. All are 20th century historical dramas featuring radical politics and strong female leads: Telex tells of an American expat community in Cuba in the (1958-59) years leading up to Castro’s revolution; The Flamethrowers is the coming-of-art story of a 20-something girl traveling through the Salt Flats of Utah, the Conceptual Art scene of New York, and the “Years of Lead” protests of Italy in the mid-1970s; while Halt and Catch Fire captures the idealistic and anarchic dawn of the Internet culture as it manifests in Texas’s “Silicon Prairie” circa 1983. 
For her role on the show, Davis delved deep into this history. “I researched early hackers,” she told me, “like phone phreakers, who’d create blue boxes and hack into AT&T phone lines and make long distance calls. They’d run these offline systems where they could have three to eighteen way calls on another grid that wasn’t immediately detected by AT&T. Captain Crunch was the name of one early phone phreaker. He had the same sort of egalitarian access to information ethos that motivates my character, Cameron.” 
Davis also did a lot of research into women in the tech industry. She wanted to understand the roles that were, “carved out for women and the roles they needed to carve out for themselves from the 1960s to the ‘80s, ‘90s, and onwards.” She was baffled when she learned that there were more women pursuing careers in programming and computer science in 1983 than there are now. “It’s such a male dominated industry still,” bemoans Mackenzie. Within this masculine sphere, Cameron Howe, Mackenzie says, is great feminist role model. “My character neither asks permission nor accepts it when it is handed to her,” she asserts, “Cameron believes so fiercely in the power of her ideas and in her abilities that her being looked down upon because she’s young or a woman never clouds her thoughts. She doesn’t allow her male superiors to tell her what’s what.” 
Feminism is important to Mackenzie. Though she studied some in school, her most formative feminist education has come from being online. Davis follows a number of feminist critics on Twitter, including Ayesha Siddiqi, aka @pushinghoops, an editor at the online-only publications Buzzfeed and The New Inquiry, who Mackenzie says, “has made me a believer: she’s smart, funny, and has a very clear point of view on race, feminism, and media. Her words wake me up.” 
Thanks to tools like Twitter and users like Siddiqi, Mackenzie says she’s, “never felt more educated, like I’ve never had so many tentacles out in the world.” Still, Mackenzie recognizes that the Internet we know now is a far cry from the utopian community its innovators, like those Cameron and her colleagues are based on, wanted it to be. “People creating computers in the early days of the Internet had this sense that they were creating an ultimately good contribution to the world,” says Davis, “a product imagined—in that young, idealistic, Liberal Arts mindset—as one that could change minds and bring people together.” If Cameron were a real person, alive today, Mackenzie says she could see her getting involved in the hacker collective Anonymous: “Something to counteract the evil—the surveillance, the data mining—that she has wrought.”
Halt and Catch Fire is one of a series of new media exploring Internet and startup culture. There’s HBO’s new original series Silicon Valley, which debuted two months before Halt and Catch Fire, Andrew Bujalski’s 1980-set 2013 Sundance hit Computer Chess, Dave Eggers’ Google-dystopian novel The Circle, the Jobs biopic (2013) starring Ashton Kutcher as Steve Jobs, and, of course, David Fincher’s The Social Network. These very recent histories tell us as much about where we’ve come from as they reveal our anxieties about where we are going. 
Halt and Catch Fire captures its time—Star Wars: Return of the Jedi is visible on the banquet of a local theatre, the cubicles are fresh out of the factory, and young Cameron is styled like a cross between Annie Lennox (the Eurythmic’s “Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This)” topped the charts in 1983), The Clash (“Rock the Casbah,” another ‘83 chart-topper), and Pris, the acrobatic replicant played by Daryl Hannah (with whom Mackenzie bears more than a passing resemblance) in Ridley Scott’s 1982 cult film Blade Runner. The anxieties and conflicts of the show, though, are very now, and personally felt by Mackenzie Davis. The big question, which Davis struggles with in pursuing acting within Hollywood and its adjacent arenas, is how can one create change and maintain creative freedom when there’s a ruling supersystem checking you along the way? One solution comes by way of Cameron Howe: “She’s an anarchist, at least intellectually,” notes Mackenzie, admiringly. “She doesn’t buck the system and order entirely, but her way of operating in the world is much like how she interacts with a computer: she’s tweaking and improving from within.”
