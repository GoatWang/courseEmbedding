Civ. A. No. 14-CV-1031-DAP 

CLASS ACTION 

Judge Dan Aaron Polster 

Magistrate Judge Greg White 


STIPULATED PROTECTIVE ORDER 







The parties to this Stipulated Protective Order (“Order”), having by and through their 

respective counsel agreed to the terms set forth therein, and good cause having been shown; 

IT IS HEREBY ORDERED THAT: 

1. 

Scope: All documents produced in the course of discovery, including initial 

disclosures, all responses to discovery requests, all deposition testimony and exhibits, other 

materials which may be subject to restrictions on disclosure for good cause and information 

derived directly therefrom (collectively, “Documents”), shall be subject to this Order concerning 

confidential information as set forth below. This Order shall be strictly construed in favor of 

public disclosure and open proceedings wherever possible. The Order is also subject to the 

Local Rules of this District and the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure on matters of procedure and 

calculation of time periods. 

2. 

Form and Timing of Designation: A party may designate Documents as 

confidential and restricted in disclosure under this Order by placing or affixing the word 

“CONFIDENTIAL” on the Document in a manner that will not interfere with the legibility of the 



Case: 1:14-cv-01031-DAP Doc #: 91 Filed: 12/01/15 2 of 13. PageID #: 2520

Document and that will permit complete removal of the “CONFIDENTIAL” designation. 

Anything that cannot be so labeled or marked on its face shall be labeled or marked by placing 

the appropriate legend on a container or package in which it is produced or on a tag attached 

thereto. Documents shall be designated “CONFIDENTIAL” prior to or at the time of the 

production or disclosure of the Documents. The designation “CONFIDENTIAL” does not mean 

that the Document has any status or protection by statute or otherwise except to the extent and 

for the purposes of this Order. 

3. 

Documents Which May Be Designated “CONFIDENTIAL”: Any party (or a 

non-party producing Documents pursuant 

to subpoena) may designate Documents as 

“CONFIDENTIAL” upon making a good faith determination that the Documents contain 

information protected from disclosure by statute or that should be protected from disclosure as 

confidential personal information, medical or psychiatric information, trade secrets, personnel 

records, proprietary business information or such other sensitive commercial information that is 

not publicly available. Public records and other information or documents that are publicly 

available may not be designated as “CONFIDENTIAL.” 

4. 

Depositions: Either party (or a non-party providing testimony pursuant to 

subpoena) may orally designate a deposition as “CONFIDENTIAL” at the outset or conclusion 

of the deposition, or in writing no later than fourteen (14) days after receipt from the court 

reporter of the final deposition transcript. Any deposition so designated, and any transcripts 

made of any testimony at such deposition, shall be designated as “CONFIDENTIAL” and 

governed by this Order, subject to a challenge to such designation as provided for in paragraph 7 

of this Order. Until the expiration of the fourteen (14) day period, all deposition transcripts 

automatically shall be treated as “CONFIDENTIAL.” 

5. 

Protection of Confidential Material: 

A. 

General Protections. Documents designated “CONFIDENTIAL” under 

this Order shall not be used or disclosed by the parties, counsel for the parties, or any 



2 

Case: 1:14-cv-01031-DAP Doc #: 91 Filed: 12/01/15 3 of 13. PageID #: 2521

other persons identified in ¶ 5(B) for any purpose whatsoever other than to prepare for 

and to conduct discovery and trial in this action, including any appeal thereof. 

B. 

Limited Third-Party Disclosures: The parties and counsel for the parties 

shall not disclose or permit the disclosure of any “CONFIDENTIAL” Documents to any 

third person or entity except as set forth in subparagraphs (i)-(viii). Subject to these 

requirements, the following categories of persons may be allowed to review Documents 

that have been designated “CONFIDENTIAL”: 

i. 

Counsel: Counsel for the parties and employees and agents of 

counsel who have responsibility for the preparation and trial of the 

action; 

ii. 

Parties: Parties to this Order and their employees and agents, but 

only after such Parties, employees and agents have completed the 

certification contained 

in Exhibit A (“Acknowledgment of 

Understanding and Agreement to be Bound”); 

iii. 

Court Reporters and Recorders: Court reporters and recorders 

engaged for deposition; 

iv. 

Consultants, 

Investigators and Experts: 

Consultants, 

investigators or experts (collectively, “Experts”) employed by the 

parties or counsel for the parties to assist in the preparation and 

trial of this action, but only after such Experts have completed the 

v. 

vi. 

certification contained in Exhibit A; 

Witnesses: Any deponent or witness at trial; 

Potential Witnesses: Any potential witness reasonably believed 

to possess relevant information, but only after such potential 

witness has completed the certification contained in Exhibit A; 



3 

Case: 1:14-cv-01031-DAP Doc #: 91 Filed: 12/01/15 4 of 13. PageID #: 2522

vii. 

Authors and Recipients: Any person known, or reasonably 

believed to be, the author or a recipient of “CONFIDENTIAL” 

material; and 

viii. 

Others by Consent: Other persons, but only by written consent of 

the producing party or upon order of the Court and on such 

conditions as may be agreed or ordered. All such persons shall 

execute 

the 

certification 

contained 

in 

Exhibit A 

(“Acknowledgment of Understanding and Agreement to be 

Bound”).1 

C. 

Control of Documents: Counsel for the parties shall take reasonable and 

appropriate measures to prevent unauthorized disclosure of Documents designated as 

“CONFIDENTIAL” pursuant to the terms of this Order. Counsel shall maintain the 

originals of the forms signed by persons acknowledging their obligations under this Order 

for a period of one (1) year after dismissal of the action, the entry of final judgment, 

and/or the conclusion of any appeals arising therefrom. 

D. 

Copies: Prior to production to another party, all copies, electronic images, 

duplicates, extracts, summaries or descriptions (collectively, “Copies”) of Documents 

designated as “CONFIDENTIAL” under this Order, or any individual portion of such a 

Document, shall be affixed with the designation “CONFIDENTIAL” if the word does not 

already appear on the copy. All such Copies shall thereafter be entitled to the protection 

of this Order. The term “Copies” shall not include indices, electronic databases or lists of 

Documents; provided, however, that these indices, electronic databases or lists do not 


1 If the “CONFIDENTIAL” Documents contain highly sensitive trade secrets or other highly 
sensitive competitive or confidential information and disclosure to another party would result in 
demonstrable harm to the disclosing party, then the parties may stipulate to or move for the 
establishment of an additional category of protection that prohibits disclosure of such Documents 
or information to persons in category (ii) or that limits disclosure only to specifically designated 
in-house counsel or party representative(s) whose assistance is reasonably necessary to the 
conduct of the litigation and who agree to be bound by the terms of this Order. 



4 

Case: 1:14-cv-01031-DAP Doc #: 91 Filed: 12/01/15 5 of 13. PageID #: 2523

contain portions or images of the text of “CONFIDENTIAL” Documents or otherwise 

disclose the substance of the “CONFIDENTIAL” information contained in those 

Documents. 

E. 

Inadvertent Failure to Designate Documents as “CONFIDENTIAL”: 

If a party inadvertently produces any confidential Documents without a designation of 

“CONFIDENTIAL,” the producing party may notify the receiving parties of the 

circumstance and identify the Documents that should be designated “CONFIDENTIAL.” 

The producing party shall also provide a new set of the Documents, bearing the 

“CONFIDENTIAL” legend, which shall thereupon be treated in accordance with this 

Order. 

6. 

Filing of “CONFIDENTIAL” Documents Under Seal: The Court highly 

discourages the manual filing of any pleadings or Documents under seal. To the extent that a 

brief, memorandum or pleading references any Document marked as “CONFIDENTIAL,” then 

the brief, memorandum or pleading shall refer the Court to the particular exhibit filed under seal 

without disclosing the contents of any confidential information. 

A. 

Before any Document marked as “CONFIDENTIAL” is filed under seal 

with the Clerk, the filing party shall first consult with the party that originally designated 

the Document as “CONFIDENTIAL” to determine whether, with the consent of that 

party, the Document or a redacted version of the Document may be filed with the Court 

not under seal. 

B. Where agreement is not possible or adequate, and to the extent Documents 

containing “CONFIDENTIAL” information are filed with the Clerk, the filing counsel 

shall file such “CONFIDENTIAL” Documents under seal using the Court-specified 

procedures for the same as are set forth in Local Rule 5.2, with the appropriate labeling 

attached, and to alert opposing counsel of the filing. 

C. 

To the extent that it is necessary for a party to discuss the contents of any 

“CONFIDENTIAL” information in a brief, memorandum or pleading, then such portion 



5 

Case: 1:14-cv-01031-DAP Doc #: 91 Filed: 12/01/15 6 of 13. PageID #: 2524

of the brief, memorandum or pleading may be filed under seal as set forth in subsection B 

above. In such circumstances, counsel shall prepare two versions of the brief, 

memorandum or pleading, a public and a confidential version. The public version shall 

contain a 

redaction of 

references 

to “CONFIDENTIAL” Documents. 

The 

“CONFIDENTIAL” version shall be a full and complete version of the pleading and shall 

be filed with the Clerk under seal as set forth in subsection B above. 

7. 

Challenges by a Party 

to Designation as Confidential: 

Any 

“CONFIDENTIAL” designation is subject to challenge by any party. Before filing with the 

Court any motions or objections to a confidentiality designation, the objecting party shall have 

an obligation to meet and confer in a good faith effort to resolve the objection by agreement. If 

agreement is reached confirming or waiving the “CONFIDENTIAL” designation as to any 

Documents subject to the objection, the designating party shall serve on all parties a notice 

specifying the Documents and the nature of the agreement. 

8. 

Action by the Court: Applications to the Court for an order relating to any 

Documents designated “CONFIDENTIAL” shall be by motion under Local Rule 7.1. Nothing in 

this Order or any action or agreement of a party under this Order limits the Court’s power to 

make any orders that may be appropriate with respect to the use and disclosure of any 

Documents produced or used in discovery or at trial. 

9. 

Use of Confidential Documents or Information at Trial: All trials are open to 

the public. Absent order of the Court, there will be no restrictions on the use of any Document 

that may be introduced by any party during the trial. If a party intends to present at trial 

“CONFIDENTIAL” Documents, such party shall provide advance notice to the other party at 

least ten (10) days before the commencement of trial by identifying the Documents at issue as 

specifically as possible (i.e., by Bates number, page range, deposition transcript lines, etc.) 

without divulging the actual “CONFIDENTIAL” Documents. The Court may thereafter make 

such orders as are necessary to govern the use of such Documents at trial. 

10. Obligations on Conclusion of Litigation: 



6 

Case: 1:14-cv-01031-DAP Doc #: 91 Filed: 12/01/15 7 of 13. PageID #: 2525

A. Order Remains in Effect: Unless otherwise agreed or ordered, this Order 

shall remain in force after dismissal or entry of final judgment not subject to further 

appeal. 

B. Return of “CONFIDENTIAL” Documents: Within thirty (30) days 

after dismissal or entry of final judgment not subject to further appeal, all Documents 

treated as “CONFIDENTIAL” under this Order, including copies as defined in ¶ 5(D), 

shall be returned to the producing party unless: (1) the Document has been offered into 

evidence or filed without restriction as to disclosure; (2) the parties agree to destruction in 

lieu of return; or (3) as to Documents bearing the notations, summations or other mental 

impressions of the receiving party, that party elects to destroy the Documents and 

certifies to the producing party that it has done so. Notwithstanding the above 

requirements to return or destroy Documents, counsel may retain attorney work product, 

including an index which refers or relates to information designated “CONFIDENTIAL,” 

so long as that work product does not duplicate verbatim substantial portions of the text 

or images of “CONFIDENTIAL” Documents. This work product shall continue to be 

“CONFIDENTIAL” under this Order. An attorney may use his or her work product in a 

subsequent litigation provided that its use does not disclose “CONFIDENTIAL” 

Documents or information derived therefrom. 

C. Return of Documents Filed under Seal: After dismissal or entry of final 

judgment not subject to further appeal, the Clerk may elect to return to counsel for the 

parties or, after notice, destroy Documents filed or offered at trial under seal or otherwise 

restricted by the Court as to disclosure. 

11. 

Receipt 

of Non-Party Demand 

for Documents Designated 

“CONFIDENTIAL”: If any receiving party is subpoenaed or served any legal process by a 

non-party to this action seeking “CONFIDENTIAL” Documents that were designated as such by 

another party to this action or a non-party, the receiving party shall give written notice of such 

subpoena or process to the producing party within five (5) business days or a reasonable period 



7 

Case: 1:14-cv-01031-DAP Doc #: 91 Filed: 12/01/15 8 of 13. PageID #: 2526

before the “CONFIDENTIAL” Documents must be disclosed, whichever is earlier. The 

receiving party shall be permitted to respond in a timely manner to such subpoena or legal 

process without violation of this Order, if (i) the notice is timely given, and (ii) within the period 

provided for response to such subpoena or legal process, the producing party has neither moved 

to intervene to seek a court order preventing disclosure of the “CONFIDENTIAL” Documents 

nor made other arrangements with the person or entity issuing the subpoena or legal process. If 

the producing party has moved to intervene to seek a court order preventing disclosure of the 

“CONFIDENTIAL” Documents, the receiving party is prohibited from disclosing the 

“CONFIDENTIAL” Documents until the motion to prevent such disclosure is adjudicated. 

12. 

Privileged Materials: 

(a) Pursuant to Federal Rule of Evidence 502, the production or disclosure of 

any Document otherwise protected by the attorney-client privilege, work-product 

immunity, or other privilege or immunity shall not operate as a waiver of any such 

privilege or immunity in this or any other proceeding. 

(b) Upon discovering that a production of privileged Documents has occurred, 

the party who made the production or disclosure will send to each receiving party a 

written request for return of the Documents. After receiving such a written request, the 

receiving party shall not use the information contained in such Documents for any 

purpose, or disseminate or transmit such information (except to provide the Documents 

under seal to the Court in conjunction with filing a motion to compel as set forth in 

subsection (c) below), unless the Court issues an order finding that the Documents are 

not privileged or otherwise protected from disclosure. Within five (5) days of receiving 

the producing party’s written request, the receiving party shall either: 



8 

Case: 1:14-cv-01031-DAP Doc #: 91 Filed: 12/01/15 9 of 13. PageID #: 2527

(1) 

return to the producing party all Documents identified by the 

producing party as being protected by the attorney-client privilege, work product 

immunity, or other privilege or immunity; 

(2) 

(3) 

destroy all such Documents and any copies or extracts of them; or 

if the receiving party files a motion to compel the production of the 

Documents, it shall sequester all such Documents by placing them in a sealed 

envelope that shall remain sealed pending an order of the Court, and it shall 

destroy all other copies or extracts of the Documents. 

(c) The receiving party expressly reserves its right to challenge the producing 

party’s designation of any Document as privileged or immune under Federal Rule of 

Evidence 502 or any other applicable authority. If the receiving party reasonably and in 

good faith believes that there is a basis for contesting the privileged or protected status 

of a Document whose return has been requested pursuant to subsection (b), the 

receiving party may promptly file a motion for an order compelling production of the 

Document, and may present the Document to the Court under seal for a determination 

of that motion. 

13. Order Subject to Modification: This Order shall be subject to modification by 

the Court on its own motion or on motion of a party. Motions to modify this Order shall be 

served and filed under Local Rule 7.1. 

14. 

No Prior Judicial Determination: This Order is entered based on the 

representations and agreements of the parties and for the purpose of facilitating discovery. 

Nothing herein shall be construed or presented as a judicial determination that any Documents 

designated “CONFIDENTIAL” by counsel or the parties is subject to protection under Rule 

26(c) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure or otherwise until such time as the Court may rule 



9 

Case: 1:14-cv-01031-DAP Doc #: 91 Filed: 12/01/15 10 of 13. PageID #: 2528

on a specific Document or issue. Nothing in this Order shall prejudice in any way the rights of a 

producing party to object to the production of documents, testimony or other material that such 

party considers not subject to discovery. 

15. 

Persons Bound: This Order shall take effect when entered and shall be binding 

upon all counsel and their law firms, the parties, and persons made subject to this Order by its 


















terms.

MESSAGE 

                  REGARDING 
              ASSET-BACKED EXPOSURE

In response to recent inquiries, 

                  we are pleased to report that the State of New Jersey Cash Management 

                  Fund does not have any exposure to asset-backed commercial paper, 

                  and specifically no investment in securities backed by sub-prime 

                  mortgages.Historically, the Fund has 

                  maintained limited exposure to asset-backed commercial paper. 

                  We have always utilized strict credit criteria for our eligible 

                  investments, and we have capped our exposure to any one issuer 

                  at relatively low levels. Nonetheless, we became increasingly 

                  concerned about our potential exposure to asset-backed commercial 

                  paper in the spring of 2007, and began a series of steps to 

                  eliminate the Funds exposure to these securities with 

                  no negative impact to the Funds performance. We are pleased 

                  to report that as of September 2007, the Fund does not have 

                  any exposure to asset-backed commercial paper.
