Biography[edit]
A native of Michigan, Bacow received his S.B. in economics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, his J.D. from Harvard Law School and his M.P.P. and Ph.D. from Harvard University's Kennedy School of Government.
Bacow has authored four books and numerous articles, and has consulted extensively throughout the world. Prior to Tufts, he was chancellor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 2003.[4] On February 8, 2010 in an email to the student body he announced that he will be stepping down as President of Tufts in June 2011. On March 1, 2010, President Barack Obama announced that Bacow was appointed to the board of advisors for the White House Initiative on Historically Black Colleges and Universities.[5]

He is allergic to cats and most dogs.[10]
On May 25, 2011, Bacow was named as a member of the Harvard Corporation, the board tasked with guiding the endeavors and initiatives of Harvard University.[11]
Speculation[edit]
After Bacow was mentioned in the Chronicle of Higher Education in 2006 as a possible candidate to succeed Lawrence Summers as president of Harvard University, Bacow categorically denied interest in the position, saying, "I took this job [Tufts] expecting it to be my last. I still do."[12]

President Emeritus Lawrence S. Bacow
President Emeritus Lawrence S. Bacow served as the twelfth President of Tufts University from September 2001 through July 2011. During his ten years as President, he advanced the university’s role as a leader in teaching, research, and public service. Within Tufts, he championed academic excellence and placed a premium on open communication and close engagement with students, faculty, staff, and alumni. Nationally, he became well known as an advocate of broader access to higher education and the importance of need-based financial aid. Internationally, he played an important role in efforts to strengthen universities’ commitment to civic engagement.
Under Dr. Bacow’s leadership, Tufts built on its historic strengths to enhance the undergraduate experience, deepen graduate and professional education and research in critical fields, broaden international engagement, and foster active citizenship among members of the university community. He emphasized increased collaboration among Tufts’ eight schools and generated creativity and enthusiasm for interdisciplinary study.
Initiatives in undergraduate education and student life during Dr. Bacow’s tenure built on the recommendations of a comprehensive review completed in 2003, and he himself served as an advisor to first- and second-year undergraduates throughout his time at Tufts. He has long advocated for broadening access to higher education and the importance of need-based financial aid.
As President, Dr. Bacow was also committed to strengthening Tufts through effective outreach to alumni, parents, and friends, speaking to them with welcome candor about pressing priorities. During his tenure, Tufts benefited from unprecedented donor generosity and completed its historic Beyond Boundaries campaign, which raised $1.2 billion to support the university’s highest academic priorities. He strengthened relations between Tufts and its host communities, and the annual President’s Marathon Challenge he established in 2003 brought members of the Tufts community together to run and volunteer at the Boston Marathon.
A lawyer and economist whose research focuses on environmental policy, Dr. Bacow is an internationally recognized expert on non-adjudicatory approaches to the resolution of environmental disputes. Prior to coming to Tufts, he spent 24 years on the faculty at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where he held the Lee and Geraldine Martin Professorship of Environmental Studies. He served as the elected Chair of the MIT Faculty and subsequently as Chancellor, one of the Institute’s two most senior academic officers. He has also held visiting professorships and research appointments at five universities abroad.
Dr. Bacow received his S.B. in economics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, his J.D. from Harvard Law School, and his M.P.P. and Ph.D. from Harvard’s Kennedy School of Government. A Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, he is the recipient of six honorary degrees.
After stepping down as President of Tufts after ten years of service, Dr. Bacow served for three years as President-in-Residence in the Higher Education Program at Harvard’s Graduate School of Education. He is currently the Leader-in-Residence at the Center for Public Leadership at Harvard’s Kennedy School. He is a Senior Advisor to Ithaka S+R and was one of the authors of its major 2012 study of the barriers to the adoption of online learning systems in U.S. higher education. He is also a member of the Lincoln Project of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences to investigate the future of the public research university.
Dr. Bacow is a member of the Harvard Corporation. He also serves on the boards of Liquidnet, Loews Corporation, Henry Schein, Inc. and TIAA-CREF.

        Lawrence S. Bacow        






Tufts President Anthony P. Monaco will award Lawrence S. Bacow an honorary degree during the University's 156th Commencement ceremonies on Sunday, May 20, 2012.
Lawrence Bacow:  Your leadership as the twelfth president of Tufts propelled this university to a newfound place of prominence and established you as a national leader in higher education.  With you at its tiller, Tufts moved ahead rapidly and on course.  You encouraged everyone in the community to set their sights high, and then worked tirelessly to support their aspirations.  The academic profile of our students rose dramatically, while the university extended its commitment to access.  Your boundless energy, and your ability to connect personally with alumni and friends, helped fuel a tremendous increase in the university’s financial resources.  Known for balancing innovation with prudence, you steered Tufts deftly through a challenging economic downturn, inspiring confidence when it was needed most.  An unusual combination of intellect, humanity, and humility was at the base of your manifold contributions.  Your personal commitment to the Marathon team you established was just one manifestation of the warmth and accessibility that made you and your wife, Adele, beloved.  For your dedication to Tufts, and your enduring contributions to its success, it is a personal privilege to confer upon you the degree of Doctor of Humane Letters, honoris causa.
 

LAWRENCE S. BACOW served from September 2001 to July 2011 as the twelfth president of Tufts University, and is now presidentemeritus. During his tenure, he advanced the university’s role as a leader in teaching, research, and public service while earning a national reputation as an advocate of broader access to higher education.
Students remember Bacow as warm and approachable, and he forged connections around campus in numerous ways. An avid runner, he began inviting the Tufts community to join him in running the Boston Marathon in 2003, to raise funds in support of health and nutrition research and to promote fitness. The early morning training runs also provided opportunities for informal talks with the president. He invited graduating students to his home on campus for Senior Dinners, and he responded to each and every email that came his way. Bacow was so popular with students that chants of “Larry, Larry” became a tradition at the university’s annual commencement ceremony.
The son of immigrants—one a Holocaust survivor—Bacow grew up in a close-knit family. Eager to see the United States, Bacow’s parents took him and his sister on trips throughout the country. “My parents, in some ways, were the products of the American dream,” he told the Tufts Daily. “They came to this country literally with nothing. . . . I think there was this desire, being in the country that was not one of their origin, to embrace everything that was American.”
A lawyer and an economist, Bacow earned a bachelor’s degree from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and a J.D. from Harvard Law School. In addition, he holds an M.P.P. and a Ph.D. from Harvard’s Kennedy School of Government. Before coming to Tufts, he was the Lee and Geraldine Martin Professor of Environmental Studies and later chancellor at MIT. His research focused on environmental policy and the resolution of environmental disputes. 
While at Tufts, Bacow enhanced the undergraduate experience, deepened graduate and professional education and research in critical fields, broadened international engagement, and fostered active citizenship. He emphasized increased collaboration among the schools on Tufts’ three campuses and generated creativity and enthusiasm for interdisciplinary study. He told a Boston newspaper that “institutions that can work seamlessly across disciplinary boundaries, across school boundaries, are schools that will make a difference in the world.”
Tufts made significant financial progress under Bacow’s leadership. Its endowment grew by nearly eighty-six percent, and the president established an office to manage university investments. He has long been interested in making college more accessible, and thanks to the financial growth under his watch, Tufts has increased undergraduate financial aid by almost ninety-four percent since 2001. In 2007, the university replaced loans with outright grants for undergraduates whose family income was below $40,000 a year. The following year, Tufts launched the first university-wide program in the country to ease the debt of graduates pursuing careers in public service.
Bacow strengthened the university’s relationship with its host communities, reaching a landmark partnership agreement with the cities of Medford and Somerville in 2004; he also initiated such activities as Community Day, inviting residents of Tufts’ host communities to campus every fall for a day of fun and scholarship, and an annual symposium on active citizenship and community partnerships.
This year, Bacow is president-in-residence in the Higher Education Program at Harvard’s Graduate School of Education. He is also working with colleagues on a study to identify barriers to online learning at large public universities and colleges. A member of the President’s Board of Advisors on Historically Black Colleges and Universities, he joined the Harvard Corporation, the governing body of Harvard University, in July 2011.
Bacow will receive an honorary Doctor of Humane Letters degree.

About this book




This book has its origins in an M.I.T. research project that was funded by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Our immediate objective was to prepare a set of case studies that examined bargaining and negotiation as they occurred between government, environmental advocates, and regulatees throughout the traditional regulatory process. The project was part of a larger effort by the EPA to make environmental regulation more efficient and less litigious. The principal investigator for the research effort was Lawrence Sus­ skind of the Department of Urban Studies and Planning. Eight case studies were prepared under the joint supervision of Susskind and the authors of this book. Studying the negotiating behavior of parties as we worked our way through an environmental dispute proved enlightening. We observed missed oppor­ tunities for settlement, negotiating tactics that backfired, and strategies that ap­ peared to be grounded more in intuition than in thoughtful analysis. At the same time, however, we were struck by how often the parties ultimately managed to muddle through. People negotiated not out of some idealistic commitment to consensus but because they thought it better served their own interests. When some negotiations reached an impasse, people improvised mediation. These disputants succeeded in spite of legal and institutional barriers, even though few of them had a sophisticated understanding of negotiation.

MELVILLE, N.Y., Dec. 3, 2014 /PRNewswire/ -- Henry Schein, Inc. (NASDAQ:   HSIC), the world's largest provider of health care products and services to office-based dental, animal health and medical practitioners, today announced the appointment of Lawrence S. Bacow, Ph.D., to the Company's Board of Directors, increasing the size of the Board to 15 Directors.  Having held executive leadership positions at three of the world's finest academic institutions, Dr. Bacow will bring expertise and unique insights into the needs of future dentists, veterinarians and physicians.   
From 2001 to 2011, Dr. Bacow was the 12th President of Tufts University, where he oversaw all seven of the University's schools, including its School of Dental Medicine, School of Medicine and the Cummings School of Veterinary Medicine.  In addition, he served on the Board of Trustees and as a member of the executive committee of Tufts Medical Center.  Following Tufts, Dr. Bacow served as President-in-Residence in the Higher Education Program at Harvard's Graduate School of Education for three years.  He currently is Leader-in-Residence at the Center for Public Leadership at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government.
Earlier in his career, Dr. Bacow spent 24 years on the faculty at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where he held the Lee and Geraldine Martin Professorship of Environmental Studies.  He served as the elected Chair of the MIT Faculty and subsequently as Chancellor, one of the Institute's two most senior academic officers.
"Dr. Bacow is a leader in academia and public service who will bring an important, new perspective to our Board of Directors.  He has overseen the training of every customer group we serve, namely dentists, physicians and veterinarians, and brings to Henry Schein impeccable credentials and broad-based management expertise," said Stanley M. Bergman, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of Henry Schein.  "As a lawyer and economist whose research focuses on environmental policy, Dr. Bacow's passion for the environment complements Henry Schein's long-standing commitment to global corporate responsibility."
Dr. Bacow is a member of the Harvard Corporation, the fiduciary oversight board of Harvard University, where he chairs the Joint Committee on Inspection which functions as Harvard University's audit committee.  He serves on the Board of Overseers of TIAA-CREF, and is a Director of Liquidnet and Loews Corporation, serving on the audit committee of both Boards.  He is a past Director of Boston Properties, Inc., where he was a member of the audit committee and the compensation committee.
Dr. Bacow received an S.B. in economics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, a J.D. from Harvard Law School, and a M.P.P. and a Ph.D. from Harvard's Kennedy School of Government.  He is a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and the recipient of five honorary degrees.

He served as the twelfth president of Tufts University from September 2001 until August 2011. His research focuses primarily on environmental policy, and he held faculty appointments in five departments at Tufts. Bacow is an expert on non-adjudicatory approaches to the resolution of environmental disputes, and is well known as an advocate of broader access to higher education and the importance of need-based financial aid.[2] He has been described as "perhaps the most respected university president in the country."[3]Contents1 Biography2 Speculation3 References4 External linksBiographyA native of Michigan, Bacow received his S.B. in economics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, his J.D. from Harvard Law School and his M.P.P. and Ph.D. from Harvard University's Kennedy School of Government.Bacow has authored four books and numerous articles, and has consulted extensively throughout the world. Prior to Tufts, he was chancellor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 2003.[4] On February 8, 2010 in an email to the student body he announced that he will be stepping down as President of Tufts in June 2011. On March 1, 2010, President Barack Obama announced that Bacow was appointed to the board of advisors for the White House Initiative on Historically Black Colleges and Universities.[5]Bacow is an avid runner, with five marathons under his belt.[6] As a youth, Bacow attained the rank of Eagle Scout in the Boy Scouts of America (BSA).[7] As an adult, the BSA awarded him the Distinguished Eagle Scout Award.[8][9] He and his wife Adele Fleet Bacow have two sons, Jay and Ken. He is allergic to cats and most dogs.[10]On May 25, 2011, Bacow was named as a member of the Harvard Corporation, the board tasked with guiding the endeavors and initiatives of Harvard University.[11]SpeculationAfter Bacow was mentioned in the Chronicle of Higher Education in 2006 as a possible candidate to succeed Lawrence Summers as president of Harvard University, Bacow categorically denied interest in the position, saying, "I took this job [Tufts] expecting it to be my last. I still do."[12]References^ Who's Who in America - 2010, 64th Edition (pub. 2009)^ http://president.tufts.edu/1173361337309/Pres-Page-pres2w_1173575082497.html^ Vest, Charles.
