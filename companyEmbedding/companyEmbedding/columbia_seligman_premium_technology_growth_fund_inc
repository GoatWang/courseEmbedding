Performance
Performance for different share classes varies based on differences in sales charges and fees associated with each class. Not all Funds offer every class of shares.
Net asset value (NAV) returns do not include sales charges or contingent deferred sales charges (CDSC). If they were included, returns would be lower.
Class A and T: Public offering price (POP) returns are calculated with the effect of the maximum initial sales charge.
Class B: Class B shares are closed to new investors. Returns W/CDSC are calculated with the effect of a contingent deferred sales charge (CDSC).
Class C: Returns W/CDSC are calculated with the effect of a CDSC.
Class V: POP returns are calculated with the effect of the maximum initial sales charge.
Class R, R4, R5, Y and Z: Shares are sold only at NAV. Only eligible investors may purchase these shares. See the prospectus for eligibility requirements and other important information.
Gross expense ratio: Fund expense ratios are calculated based on the Fund's average net assets during the Fund's most recently completed fiscal year (or based on estimated amounts for funds that have been in existence less than one year), and have not been adjusted for current asset levels. If adjusted for any decrease or increase in assets, expense ratios would be higher or lower, respectively, than the numbers shown above. Please see the Fund's prospectus for additional details.
Net expense ratio: Net expenses are after expense waiver/reimbursement. The investment manager and certain of its affiliates have contractually (for at least the current fiscal year) agreed to waive certain fees and/or to reimburse certain expenses of the Fund, as described in the Fund's prospectus, unless sooner terminated at the sole discretion of the Fund's board. Fee waivers/expense caps would limit the impact that any decrease in assets would have on net expense ratios in the current fiscal year.
†† For Columbia Adaptive Alternatives Fund, effective March 4, 2015, the investment manager and certain of its affiliates have contractually agreed (for at least twelve months after the date of the fund prospectus), in addition to an existing arrangement, to waive certain fees and/or to reimburse certain expenses of the fund. The capped expense ratio consists of the gross expense ratio, as reflected in the fund's prospectus adjusted to reflect any fee waiver/expense reimbursement and excluding dividends and interest expense on securities sold short at the fund and underlying fund levels.
*Inception date shown is the share class inception date. The since inception returns shown are since fund inception. Returns shown for periods prior to the fund's share class inception date include the returns of the oldest share class of the fund, adjusted to reflect higher class-related operating expenses, as applicable. In addition, the returns shown include the returns of any predecessor to the fund. Click here for more information.
**Portfolio characteristics are subject to change periodically and may not be representative of current characteristics.

Morningstar Rating
For each fund with at least a three-year history, Morningstar calculates a Morningstar Rating™ used to rank the fund against other funds in the same category. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a fund's monthly excess performance, without any adjustments for loads (front-end, deferred, or redemption fees), placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. The top 10% of funds in each category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars and the bottom 10% receive 1 star (each share class is counted as a fraction of one fund within this scale and rated separately, which may cause slight variations in the distribution percentages).

Morningstar Percentile Rankings are based on the average annual total returns of the funds in the category for the periods stated and do not include any sales charges or redemption fees, but do not include 12b-1 fees and the reinvestment of dividends and capital gains distributions. The highest (or most favorable) percentile rank is 1 and the lowest (or least favorable) percentile rank is 100. Rankings for each share class will vary due to different expenses. Had sales charges or redemption fees been included, total returns would be lower.
Morningstar Style Box 
The Morningstar Style BoxTM is based on the Fund's portfolio holdings as of period end. The vertical axis shows the market capitalization of the stocks owned, and the horizontal axis shows investment style (value, blend, or growth). Information shown is based on the most recent data provided by Morningstar. The Morningstar style box data is updated on the 10th business day after every month end.
© 2017 Morningstar, Inc. All Rights Reserved. The Morningstar information contained herein: (1) is proprietary to Morningstar and/or its content providers; (2) may not be copied or distributed; and (3) is not warranted to be accurate, complete or timely. Neither Morningstar nor its content providers are responsible for any damages or losses arising from any use of this information.
Definitions
Alpha measures the relationship between the Fund's performance and its beta over a three-year period. Alpha greater than 0.0 means an investment has performed better than the compared index given its level of risk. It can be viewed as a measure of the value added by the Fund manager.
Annual Distribution Rate at NAV: is based on the Fund's most recent distribution per share (annualized) divided by the Fund's NAV.
Average effective duration provides a measure of the fund's interest-rate sensitivity.
Beta measures a fund's risk relative to its benchmark The index is equivalent to 1.0. A fund with a beta greater than 1.0 has been more volatile than the index while a fund with a beta less than 1.0 has been less volatile.
Price-to-Book Ratio is a stock's price divided by its book value, and may help determine if the stock is valued fairly.
Price-to-Earnings Ratio is a stock's price divided by after-tax earnings over a trailing 12-month period, which serves as an indicator of value based on earnings.
R-Squared ranges from 0.00 to 100 and measures how closely the Fund's performance matches (or doesn't match) the performance of its benchmark index.
30-day SEC Yield: The SEC yield should be regarded as an estimate of the fund's rate of investment income reflecting an estimated yield to maturity (assuming all current portfolio holdings are held to maturity), and it may not equal the fund's actual income distribution rate or the income paid to a shareholder's account. The yield shown reflects fee waivers in effect, if any. In the absence of such waivers, yields would be reduced. The fund may own treasury inflation protected securities (TIPS) or other inflation indexed securities. If so, the yield will reflect an inflation adjustment that is attributable to these securities. This adjustment and the resulting yield can be positive (in the case of inflation) or negative (in the case of deflation) during the period shown.
Unsubsidized 30-day SEC Yield: The unsubsidized yield shown is the SEC yield adjusted to reflect the gross expense ratio applicable to the class of shares shown and without regard to the contractual reimbursements and fee waivers required of the fund's investment manager and affiliates.
The 30-day yields may appear to be the same due to rounding.
The Columbia Inflation Protection Securities Fund and certain other funds own treasury inflation protected securities (TIPS) or other inflation indexed securities. For a fund that owns TIPS or other inflation indexed securities, the SEC Yield, when shown, will reflect an inflation adjustment that is attributable to these types of securities. This adjustment as well as the resulting yield can be positive (in the case of inflation) or negative (in the case of deflation) during the period shown. Absent the inflation adjustment, the yield shown may be materially different and may vary significantly from month to month, especially for a fund such as Columbia Inflation Protection Securities Fund which invests substantially in TIPS and other inflation indexed securities. In periods when the SEC yield is exceptionally high due to a rise in the inflation rate, it is important to bear in mind that the adjustment in the yield from the inflation rate may not be repeated.
Sharpe Ratio divides a fund's return in excess of the 90-day Treasury bill by the investment's standard deviation to measure risk-adjusted performance.
Standard Deviation is a statistical measure of the degree to which an individual value in a probability distribution tends to vary from the mean of the distribution.
Turnover Rate (fiscal year end%) measures the percentage of holdings that has been "turned over" or replaced, in the past year.
Average Coupon is a calculation of the total interest cost for a bond issue expressed as a percentage. The average coupon is equal to the total interest payments of an issue divided by bond year dollars.
Duration to Worst is the duration of a bond computed using the bond's nearest call date or maturity, whichever comes first. This measure ignores future cash flow fluctuations due to embedded optionality.
It is not possible to invest directly in an index. For index descriptions, click here.


Performance
Returns shown do not reflect any fees, expenses or sales charges imposed by your Contract or Qualified Plan, or imposed on Accounts that may own shares directly. Inclusion of these charges would reduce total returns for all periods shown.
Gross expense ratio: Fund expense ratios are calculated based on the Fund's average net assets during the Fund's most recently completed fiscal year (or based on estimated amounts for funds that have been in existence less than one year), and have not been adjusted for current asset levels. If adjusted for any decrease or increase in assets, expense ratios would be higher or lower, respectively, than the numbers shown above. Please see the Fund's prospectus for additional details.
Net expense ratio: Net expenses are after expense waiver/reimbursement. The investment manager and certain of its affiliates have contractually (for at least the current fiscal year) agreed to waive certain fees and/or to reimburse certain expenses of the Fund, as described in the Fund's prospectus, unless sooner terminated at the sole discretion of the Fund's board. Fee waivers/expense caps would limit the impact that any decrease in assets would have on net expense ratios in the current fiscal year. 
*Inception date shown is the share class inception date. The since inception returns shown are since fund inception. Returns shown for periods prior to the fund’s share class inception date include the returns of the oldest share class of the fund, adjusted to reflect higher class-related operating expenses, as applicable. In addition, the returns shown include the returns of any predecessor to the fund. Click here for more information.
It is not possible to invest directly in an index. For index descriptions, click here.
The Columbia Variable Portfolios and Wanger Funds (the "Variable Funds") are available only through variable annuity contracts and variable life insurance policies issued by participating insurance companies or certain eligible retirement plans. The Variable Funds are not offered to the public. Not all Variable Funds and classes are available in all contracts, policies or plans. Please contact your financial advisor or insurance representative for more information.
Columbia Management Investment Advisers, LLC serves as the investment adviser to the Columbia Variable Portfolios. Columbia Wanger Asset Management, LLC serves as the investment adviser to the Wanger Funds. The variable funds are distributed by Columbia Management Investment Distributors, Inc., member FINRA.


Performance
Effective 09/01/2016, performance reporting for Class A and Class AG with all sales charges reflects a maximum sales charge of 3.75% , except for the Columbia Conservative 529 Portfolio, FA Strategic Income 529 Portfolio, Columbia Income Opportunities 529 Portfolio, Columbia Total Return Bond 529 Portfolio, JP Morgan Core Bond 529 Portfolio, iShares TIPS Bond ETF 529 Portfolio, Templeton Global Bond 529 Portfolio and Columbia US Government Mortgage 529 Portfolio, which reflect a maximum sales charge of 3%. The Columbia College 529 Portfolio, Columbia Short Term Bond 529 Portfolio, Columbia Legacy Capital Preservation 529 Portfolio have no initial sales charges for Pricing Alternative A, but the Legacy Capital Preservation 529 Portfolio has a contingent deferred sales charge (CDSC) for Pricing Alternative C.
Please consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses carefully before investing. Contact your financial advisor or visit columbiathreadneedle.com/us for a Program Description, which contains this and other important information about the Future Scholar College Savings Plan. Read it carefully before investing. You should also consider, before investing, whether the investor’s or designated beneficiary’s home state offers any state tax or other benefits that are only available for investments in such state’s qualified tuition program.
Expense ratios are as of the plan's most recent Program Brochure & Tuition Savings Agreement. Performance may reflect waivers or reimbursements of fund expenses by the adviser or its affiliates. Absent these waivers, or reimbursement arrangements, performance results may be lower. The net and gross expense ratios shown are updated on the first day of each month.
Total returns assume the reinvestment of all underlying fund distributions at NAV. Portfolio unit value (PUV) returns do not include sales charges or contingent deferred sales charges (CDSCs). If they were included, returns would have been lower.
Pricing Alternative B: Public offering price (POP) returns are calculated with the effect of the applicable CDSC for the holding period after an initial purchase as follows: through the first year, 5%; second year, 4%; third year, 3%; fourth year, 3%; fifth year, 2%; sixth year, 1% and thereafter, 0%. These shares convert to Pricing Alternative A units in the eighth year after purchase. Effective December 1, 2010, Class B of each portfolio was closed to both new accounts and additional contributions to existing accounts.
Pricing Alternative C: Public offering price (POP) returns are calculated with the effect of a 1% CDSC for the first year after purchase except for the Conservative 529 and College 529 Portfolios as well as the single-fund fixed-income portfolios and the Legacy Capital Preservation 529 Portfolio, which have a 0.75% CDSC.
Pricing Alternative E: Units are sold only at portfolio unit value (PUV). Only eligible investors may purchase these units. See the program description for eligibility requirements and other important information.
Pricing Alternative Z: Units are sold only at portfolio unit value (PUV). Only eligible investors may purchase these units. See the program description for eligibility requirements and other important information.
Contributions initially invested directly into the Columbia Bank Deposit 529 Portfolio are not subject to the imposition of an initial or deferred sales charge under any Pricing Alternative.
It is not possible to invest directly in an index. For index descriptions, click here.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
