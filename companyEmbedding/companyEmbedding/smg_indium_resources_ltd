SMG Indium Resources Ltd. Announces $1 Million Stock Repurchase Program

May 23, 2012, 10:00 ET
		  		  					
						 from   SMG Indium Resources Ltd. 











 
















































 

 




















 


NEW YORK, May 23, 2012 /PRNewswire/ -- SMG Indium Resources Ltd. (the "Company") (OTCBB: SMGI, SMGIW, SMGIU), today announced a program authorizing the repurchase of up to $1 million of the Company's common stock, par value $.001 per share (the "Common Stock") through May 31, 2013.
Under this program, Common Stock repurchases may be made from time to time in the open market at prevailing market prices or through privately negotiated transactions at the discretion of the Company's manager, Specialty Metals Group Advisors LLC. The timing of open market and privately negotiated purchases will be dependent on market conditions and other corporate considerations, including price, corporate and regulatory requirements and alternative investment opportunities. The program is expected to be funded from existing cash balances. The Company is not obligated to repurchase any particular amount of Common Stock during any period and may choose to suspend or discontinue the repurchase at any time.
Shares of Common Stock repurchased by the Company through the repurchase program will become authorized but unissued shares. As of May 23, 2012, the Company has 8,832,301 shares of Common Stock outstanding.
"We believe it is the right time to initiate a share repurchase plan and to opportunistically repurchase shares at a deep discount to our underlying Net Market Value ("NMV")* which was approximately $3.55 per share on May 18, 2012. By repurchasing shares below NMV, we would be, in essence, purchasing physical indium at a substantial discount to the current spot market price. This would be an accretive use of capital to boost our NMV," said Alan C. Benjamin, Chief Executive Officer. 
The Company's management welcomes the opportunity to meet and speak with shareholders.  Please email Richard A. Biele at rbiele@smg-indium.com for further information.  We wish to thank all of our existing shareholders for their continued support.
** We use the term NMV per share when we discuss the value of the Company. We define the term NMV, as used in this release, as the product of multiplying the number of kilograms of indium held by the Company at any given point by the spot price for indium as published by Metal Bulletin PLC and posted on Bloomberg L.P., plus cash and other Company assets, less any liabilities divided by the Common Stock outstanding. The use of the term NMV is a non-GAAP financial measurement. The Company's GAAP net book value per Common Stock was approximately $3.60 on March 31, 2012.

Disclosure Notice 
This press release may contain forward-looking statements regarding SMG Indium Resources Ltd. current expectations of future events that involve risks and uncertainties, including, without limitation, and not limited to indium price volatility from supply and demand factors, international export quotas that could affect the availability of indium and our ability to purchase indium, lack of any internationally recognized exchanges for indium, limited number of potential suppliers of indium and potential customers who purchase indium, disruption of mining operations, technological obsolescence, substitution of other materials decreasing the demand for indium, regulatory requirements regarding indium, risks associated with international economic and political events, lack of operational liquidity, lack of investment liquidity, factors affecting our NMV, and changes in interest rates. Such statements are based on management's current expectations and are subject to a number of substantial risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results or timeliness to differ materially from those addressed in the forward-looking statements.

SMG Indium Resources LTD. Reports Net Market Value At June 30, 2013






GlobeNewswire



Jul 9, 2013 10:00 AM EDT













 


















































    1    We use the term NMV per share when we discuss the value of the Company. We define the term NMV, as used in this release, as the product of multiplying the number of kilograms of indium held by the Company at any given date by the spot price for indium as published by Metal Bulletin PLC and posted on Bloomberg L.P. for such date, plus cash and other Company assets, less any liabilities divided by the common stock outstanding as of such date. The use of the term NMV is a non-US generally accepted accounting principle (GAAP)financial measurement. The Company's GAAP net book value (NBV) per share of common stock was approximately $3.08  2  on June 30, 2013. The difference between such GAAP NBV and NMV at June 30, 2013 is attributable to the excess of the indium spot price over GAAP book value of indium.     2    Calculated based on the number of shares of common stock outstanding exclusive of all options and warrants outstanding because their effect would be anti-dilutive.    3   Reflects indium we have physically stored in our third-party storage facility. Also reflects indium we are committed to buy back under an unconditional sale and purchase agreement and indium leased to a third party.      4   The original cost per kilogram of indium is different from the carrying value determined under GAAP as a result of lower of cost or market adjustments due to changes in the spot price of inventory recorded on a quarterly basis.     5   Market value of indium inventory is determined based on the spot price of indium ($547.50 per kilogram)  published by Metal Bulletin PLC and posted on Bloomberg L.P. (Bloomberg L.P. is not regulated or government approved) times the 47,021 kilograms held in inventory at June 30, 2013. Such amount differs from the carrying amount of inventory under GAAP.    6   All financial information is unaudited.   About SMG Indium Resources Ltd.   SMG Indium Resources Ltd. purchases and stockpiles the metal indium and believes it maintains the largest strategic stockpile of indium held outside of the People's Republic of China.
