Zacks Investment Research upgraded shares of Flowserve Corporation (NYSE:FLS) from a sell rating to a hold rating in a research report report published on Monday morning. 
According to Zacks, “Flowserve’s key strengths include leading position in the flow control industry, strong aftermarket business comprehensive product portfolio and wide global footprint. Also, the company’s strong aftermarket business is expected to act as a major growth catalyst. Moreover, the diligent restructuring plans are resulting in substantial cost savings, thus adding to Flowserve’s strength. In addition, increased project bidding activities in the energy markets signal brighter days, going forward. However, on the flip side, pricing pressure has proved to be a major drag on the company’s top-line performance over the past few quarters. Also, loss of sales leverage and related under-absorption are pressurizing the financials. The company’s shares have witnessed a negative return, comparing unfavorably to the Zacks categorized Machinery-General industry's average gain over the past six months.”
