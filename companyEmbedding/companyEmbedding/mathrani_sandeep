General Growth CEO gets $25 million incentive package


Mall owner General Growth Properties granted CEO Sandeep Mathrani an incentive package worth $25 million and extended his employment contact for another five years.Mathrani will receive an annual base salary of $1.2 million and an annual target bonus of $3 million under his new employment agreement, according to a Securities and Exchange Commission filing from General Growth, a Chicago-based real estate investment trust. Under his previous employment agreement, he received a salary of $1.2 million and a target bonus of $1.5 million.Mathrani also received stock units under the company's long-term incentive plan valued at $25 million, according to the filing. The Long-Term Incentive Plan units, as they are called, vest over five years.Mathrani, who has led General Growth since 2010, was the highest-paid REIT CEO in the Chicago area in 2013, with total compensation of $22.1 million, boosted by stock option awards. The company has not released executive pay data for 2014.General Growth, whose local properties include Water Tower Place and Northbrook Court, is the nation's second-largest mall owner, with nearly $50 billion in assets. A rebounding job market and pickup in consumer spending have boosted the company's profits and stock price in recent years. The firm's shares have returned 37.9 percent over the past year, including dividends, versus 33.6 percent for the Bloomberg REIT Regional Mall Index.A General Growth spokesman declined to comment.Mathrani must achieve certain performance goals to receive his $3 million target bonus. But he is guaranteed a minimum annual bonus of $2 million in 2015 and 2016, according to the SEC filing.

Howard Hughes Might Be Bill Ackman's Last Hope To Build A Real Estate Empire 


 

	Decreased spending by U.S. businesses caused GDP growth to slow in Q4 2014; however, consumer spending was a bright spot, clocking in at a torrid 4.3 percent.

	That was great news if you happen to be a shareholder of General Growth Properties Inc (NYSE: GGP) the second largest owner of top U.S. malls. In fact, all REITs focused on Class-A malls were outstanding performers in 2014.

	Tale Of The Tape - 2014

	General Growth's 43.84 percent total return handily outperformed the healthy 30.4 percent returns from the Vanguard REIT Index Fund (NYSE: VNQ), a proxy for the broader REIT sector.


 Macerich Co (NYSE: MAC) led the way at just over 47 percent, boosted by an announcement that mall giant Simon Property Group Inc (NYSE: SPG) had bought a 3 percent stake in its rival.
 
	General Growth owns just under 25 percent of the estimated 425 better quality malls in the U.S.

	GGP - Financial Outlook

	The General Growth earnings call on January 29, was upbeat. Results for Q4 2014 generally exceeded expectations and were assisted by the unanticipated steep drop in the price of oil.

Related Link: General Growth Properties Beats On Q4 Revenue

	Initial guidance for 2015 FFO was $1.40 to $1.46 per share, or 8 percent growth at the midpoint.
	Q1 2015 Expectations:


		Same Store NOI growth of 4 percent.

		EBITDA growth of 4 percent.

		FFO range of $305 million to $315 million, or $0.31 to $0.33 per share.


	5 Key Retail Trends - CEO Sandeep Mathrani

1. Omnichannel: "Real-time information of inventory in the store and warehouse is essential, and must be seamless to the customer."

2. Technology: Implementing omnichannel requires complex IT systems to support customer shopping in stores and online. "Some retailers are there and some are not, which has led to new technologies." Mathrani cited eBay's Connected Fitting Room and tablet based Retail Associate Platform, featuring Endless Aisle inventory view to help in-store sales associates interact with customers across more sales channels.
	Footlocker was mentioned as a company which was ahead of the curve on implementing omnichannel by utilizing its Super Stock Locator initiative to give customers various options to buy online and ship to store, buy on mobile device and pick up at store.
 3. Online Retailers: "Online is an incubator for bricks and mortar," examples cited include: Bonobos, Birchbox, Warby Parker and Zappos. Zappos, an Amazon.com company, now has a 20,000 SF store in Las Vegas.
	"The physical store is about advertising a business in a way not possible online. The store allows them not only to sell products but also sell their brand."
 4. Distressed Retailers: actually represent an opportunity for many top tier malls. GGP proactively identifies weak retailers and takes advantage of "lack of new supply" and "unmet demand" to increase revenues.
 5. Redevelopment Opportunities: are more profitable than new development. GGP allocates the first $200 million to $400 million each year to redeveloping existing properties at 8 percent to 11 percent yields vs. new developments typically yielding in the 6's.

	This reinforces the idea that the 425 or so top tier U.S. mall locations are irreplaceable, which is likely the rationale behind Simon Property Group's recent investment in Macerich.

	Bottom Line
	Many investors who realized that U.S. commercial real estate had a huge year in 2014, may still have been surprised to learn that REITs focused on Class-A malls had outperformed the broader REIT sector.

	The retail trends discussed by Mathrani -- combined with the recent plunge in energy prices -- represent favorable dynamics for General Growth and its peer group moving forward.
