Agilent Technologies Names Patrick Kaltenbach, Jacob Thaysen Business 
      Group Presidents; New Organization Designed to Support Customers, Growth




Company Announces Three Reporting Segments as of Q1 FY15






November 20, 2014 04:05 PM Eastern Standard Time



SANTA CLARA, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Agilent Technologies Inc. (NYSE:A) today announced it has named two new 
      business presidents and realigned its businesses to better serve 
      customers.
    


      Patrick Kaltenbach has been named senior vice president, Agilent, and 
      president of the Life Sciences and Applied Markets Group (LSAG) business 
      unit, which combines the former Chemical Analysis Group and Life 
      Sciences business. The combination will result in most of Agilent’s 
      instrumentation and software being in one organization to better serve 
      analytical laboratories with similar needs.
    

      Jacob Thaysen has been appointed senior vice president, Agilent, and 
      president of the Diagnostics and Genomics Group (DGG). This new business 
      unit combines the Diagnostics and Genomics businesses and will serve the 
      needs of clinical laboratories.
    

      Both appointments are effective immediately. Fred Strohmeier, who has 
      been president of the Life Sciences and Diagnostics Group (LDG), has 
      announced his retirement, planned for the second quarter of FY15. He 
      will serve as an advisor to the company until that time.
    

      “I would like to thank Fred for his more than 35 years of contributions 
      to the company,” said Mike McMullen, Agilent president, chief operating 
      officer and CEO-elect. “Building on his years of experience in life 
      sciences, Fred most recently provided superb leadership of Agilent’s 
      entry into diagnostics. I wish him the best in his retirement.”
    

      “The organization we’re announcing today is about serving our customers 
      with ease, efficiency and a single voice,” McMullen added. “By combining 
      our businesses around market needs, rather than technologies, we provide 
      our customers with an easier, more direct way to get the products, 
      software and services they need.
    

      “I am excited about the addition of Patrick and Jacob as business 
      presidents. They are both proven leaders with deep knowledge and 
      exceptional customer insights across the range of our businesses. The 
      formation of our high-caliber executive team marks another step toward 
      positioning Agilent to deliver on its outstanding growth opportunities.”
