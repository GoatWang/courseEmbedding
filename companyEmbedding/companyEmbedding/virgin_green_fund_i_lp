Green Bonds – Income with Impact 



 Print   





























 
Green bonds are issued to fund projects or activities that have a positive impact on the environment. Supranational organizations, banks, corporations and governments have increasingly recognized green bonds as an essential tool to finance climate-related and other environmental projects. Most green bonds are structurally identical to “plain vanilla” conventional bonds, but are distinguished by a clearly disclosed “green” use of proceeds.

Important Disclosure
An investment in the Fund may be subject to risks which include, among others, credit rating downgrades, issuers that may be unable and/or unwilling to make timely interest payments and/or repay the principal on its debt, high yield securities risk, call risk, and interest rate risk, all of which may adversely affect the Fund. International investing involves additional risks which include greater market volatility, the availability of less reliable financial information, higher transactional and custody costs, taxation by foreign governments, decreased market liquidity and political instability. Changes in currency exchange rates may negatively impact the Fund's return. The Fund's assets may be concentrated in a particular sector and may be subject to more risk than investments in a diverse group of sectors.

Standard & Poor's® and S&P® are registered trademarks of Standard & Poor's Financial Services LLC ("S&P") and Dow Jones® is a registered trademark of Dow Jones Trademark Holdings LLC ("Dow Jones").

Neither S&P Dow Jones Indices make any representation or warranty, express or implied, to the owners of the Fund or any member of the public regarding the advisability of investing in securities generally or in the Fund particularly or the ability of the Index to track general market performance.  S&P Dow Jones Indices only relationship to Van Eck Associates Corporation ("VanEck") with respect to the Index is the licensing of the Index and certain trademarks, service marks and/or trade names of S&P Dow Jones Indices and/or its licensors.  The Index is determined, composed and calculated by S&P Dow Jones Indices without regard to VanEck or the Fund. S&P Dow Jones Indices has no obligation to take the needs of VanEck or the owners of the Fund into consideration in determining, composing or calculating the Index. S&P Dow Jones Indices is not responsible for and has not participated in the determination of the prices, and amount of the Fund or the timing of the issuance or sale of the Fund or in the determination or calculation of the equation by which the Fund is to be converted into cash, surrendered or redeemed, as the case may be. S&P Dow Jones Indices have no obligation or liability in connection with the administration, marketing or trading of the Fund. There is no assurance that investment products based on the Index will accurately track index performance or provide positive investment returns.  S&P Dow Jones Indices LLC is not an investment advisor.

THERE ARE NO THIRD PARTY BENEFICIARIES OF ANY AGREEMENTS OR ARRANGEMENTS BETWEEN S&P DOW JONES INDICES AND VANECK, OTHER THAN THE LICENSORS OF S&P DOW JONES INDICES.
Index returns are not Fund returns and do not reflect any management fees or brokerage expenses. Investors cannot invest directly in the Index. Returns for actual Fund investors may differ from what is shown because of differences in timing, the amount invested and fees and expenses. Index returns assume that dividends have been reinvested.
The "Net Asset Value" (NAV) of a VanEck Vectors exchange-traded fund (ETF) is determined at the close of each business day, and represents the dollar value of one share of the fund; it is calculated by taking the total assets of the fund, subtracting total liabilities, and dividing by the total number of shares outstanding. The NAV is not necessarily the same as the ETF's intraday trading value.  VanEck Vectors ETF investors should not expect to buy or sell shares at NAV.
Fund shares are not individually redeemable and will be issued and redeemed at their NAV only through certain authorized broker-dealers in large, specified blocks of shares called creation units and otherwise can be bought and sold only through exchange trading. Shares may trade at a premium or discount to their NAV in the secondary market.
Investing involves substantial risk and high volatility, including possible loss of principal. Bonds and bond funds will generally decrease in value as interest rates rise. An investor should consider the investment objective, risks, charges and expenses of a Fund carefully before investing. To obtain a prospectus and summary prospectus, which contains this and other information, call 800.826.2333 or visit www.vaneck.com. Please read the prospectus and summary prospectus carefully before investing.

Virgin Green Fund to Launch Fund II
Virgin Green Fund, a private equity firm affiliated with Sir Richard Branson, the media and airline mogul, plans to launch a second fund, the Virgin Green Fund II LP, shortly, a person familiar with the plans told Buyouts, peHUB's sister magazine. 

The new fund will target $300 million and is expected to close by the end of 2011, the person said.

The San Francisco and London-based growth capital firm invests mainly in renewable energy companies and enterprises that develop efficient ways to use resources. It invests primarily in North American and European firms that have already achieved a measure of growth, helping to distinguish it from the many venture capital firms that operate in the renewable energy space.

The San Francisco and London-based growth capital firm invests mainly in renewable energy companies and enterprises that develop efficient ways to use resources. It invests primarily in North American and European firms that have already achieved a measure of growth, helping to distinguish it from the many venture capital firms that operate in the renewable energy space.
Like Virgin’s debut fund, Fund II will be earmarked for investments of between $10 million and $30 million. The debut fund has so far made 10 investments, including some control situations, although most have entailed significant minority stakes where the firm takes an active management role.
Branson is a significant investor in the firm’s initial fund, which raised $220 million and closed in 2008. He also lent the firm his company’s iconic Virgin brand, which gave the upstart firm instant name recognition. Branson, a billionaire who has long championed environmental issues, is expected to invest in the firm’s new fund, the person said.
In the past, the firm has tapped Branson for investment ideas due to his experience in the energy-dependent transportation sector. Besides Branson, Virgin’s investors include pensions, endowments, foundations and family offices.
Among the firm’s notable portfolio companies is Gevo, which Virgin helped take public this year. Gevo develops biobutanol, a chemical used in liquid fuels that can be used as a gasoline blend that helps vehicles meet clean air standards. The company is listed on Nasdaq and has a market capitalization of $477 million.
Another notable portfolio company is GreenRoad, which makes equipment that helps people become safer drivers, while simultaneously improving fuel efficiency.
