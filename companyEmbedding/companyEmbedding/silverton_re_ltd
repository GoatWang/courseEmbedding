Aspen Re Renews Silverton for 2016 | Business Wire
























































Aspen Re Renews Silverton for 2016






December 14, 2015 09:00 AM Eastern Standard Time



HAMILTON, Bermuda--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Aspen Reinsurance (“Aspen Re”), the reinsurance segment of Aspen 
      Insurance Holdings Limited (“Aspen”) (NYSE:AHL), announces that its 
      Aspen Capital Markets division renewed Silverton Re Ltd. (“Silverton 
      Re”) for 2016.


      Silverton Re, a Bermuda-domiciled special purpose insurer, was 
      established in December 2013 to provide additional collateralized 
      capacity to support Aspen Re’s global reinsurance business.
    

      Silverton Re was renewed in December 2015 with $125 million of capital 
      raised to write a quota share of Aspen Re’s property catastrophe 
      portfolio for 2016, which compares with the $65 million of capital 
      raised at launch in December 2013 and the $85 million of capital raised 
      in December 2014. Aspen is investing $25 million with the additional 
      funding secured from third-party investors. Aon Securities Inc. acted as 
      the placement agent. The capital is being raised through the issuance of 
      Series 2016-1 Participating Notes which will mature on September 17, 
      2018.
    

      Silverton Re will enter into a quota share retrocession agreement with 
      Aspen Bermuda Limited and Aspen Insurance UK Limited under which 
      Silverton Re will reinsure a proportionate share of Aspen Re’s globally 
      diversified property catastrophe excess of loss portfolio.
    

      Stephen Postlewhite, Chief Executive Officer, Aspen Re, said: “We are 
      very pleased with the partnerships we are building through Silverton Re. 
      Our aim has been to leverage the expertise within Aspen Re, in 
      underwriting, research, distribution and analysis, and provide investors 
      with access to diversified natural catastrophe risk. We remain confident 
      that the strong relationships we have built will continue to develop as 
      we make further progress in our strategy to increase our operational 
      flexibility in the capital markets.”
    

      This release is not an offer of securities for sale into the United 
      States or elsewhere. No securities may be offered or sold in the United 
      States absent registration or an exemption from, or in a transaction not 
      subject to, the registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act of 
      1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), including pursuant to the 
      private offering exemption provided by Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities 
      Act and the provisions of Regulation D promulgated thereunder.

      materially from such statements. For a detailed description of 
      uncertainties and other factors that could impact the forward-looking 
      statements in this press release, please see the “Risk Factors” section
