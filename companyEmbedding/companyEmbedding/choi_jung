At sex toy shop, South Korean women seek to shatter taboosHomeMailFlickrTumblrNewsSportsFinanceCelebrityAnswersGroupsMobileMoreYahooSearchSearchSkip to NavigationSkip to Main ContentSkip to Related Content0At sex toy shop, South Korean women seek to shatter taboosBy Ju-min ParkReutersDecember 16, 2015ReblogShareTweetShareView photosKwak Eura (R) and Choi Jung-yoon arrange products at their sex toy shop in Seoul, South Korea, December 16, 2015.  REUTERS/Kim Hong-JiMoreBy Ju-min ParkSEOUL (Reuters) - Choi Jung-yoon and Kwak Eura are on a quest to shatter taboos when it comes to talking about sex in conservative South Korea.The women are co-founders of "Pleasure Lab" in Seoul, a shop selling sex toys and related items targeted at women. They hope to break social silence about women and sexuality, while teaching customers how to use items such as vibrators."You can call us activists, and we think we are curators," said Choi, 30, a former journalist who spent her teenage and college years in the United States."The way to change the world can be doing campaigns or fighting outside, which are important, but we think selling sex toys in a bright atmosphere with a smile here can be our own battle and own campaign," she said in an interview at the store, open since August.The shop, in a building that is also home to two churches in a residential part of Seoul, has white walls which highlight the products, many of them in pink or purple, and holds public workshops on sexual health.It is featuring festive "Merry Clitorismas" gift boxes that contain vibrators and lingerie.Traditionally, adult shops in South Korea are targeted towards men.South Korea is a Confucian, male-dominated society that is undergoing a transition when it comes to gender roles. The pair said there is still a stigma when it comes to women's sexual empowerment, or women talking about sex.The country ranks 115th out of 145 in the World Economic Forum's index of gender equality, and a massive beauty and plastic surgery industry tends to reinforce traditional perceptions of the feminine ideal."In pop culture, like TV shows and movies, heterosexual males are still the ones who have say and sexual independence," said Choi."Women who speak out for their sexual life are socially stigmatized, called whores or sluts," she said.The shop generates monthly turnover of about 20 million won ($17,000), including online sales. Most customers are women in their 20s and 30s."We are not a generation who grew up getting proper sexual education," said Kwak, 28, who is bisexual and worked as a nurse for three years."We have been sheepish about this ... It may sound grandiose, but we think we are really pioneers."(Editing by Tony Munroe, Robert Birsel)ReblogShareTweetSharePopular in the CommunityObamacare Repeal Flames Out In The Republican Senate723 reactions9%69%22%Zuckerberg Wife's Ambitious Secret Finally ExposedUNewz.MeSponsoredClashes in Venezuela ahead of Sunday’s election20 reactions7%59%34%Man says he killed wife aboard cruise ship because 'she would not stop laughing at me': Affidavit1,693 reactions4%73%23%These Sorority Sisters Did a ‘Melanin Illustrated’ Photo Shoot4,683 reactions7%64%29%Shop July Specials at Macy's - Extra 25-60% OffMacys.comSponsoredPortugal battles raging wildfires17 reactions0%67%33%2 of Trump's top advisers at odds with each other34 reactions5%74%21%Luis Fonsi On Justin Bieber's Spanish, 'Despacito' Hitting No. 1528 reactions3%80%17%After Losing 218lbs Rebel Wilson Drops JawsHealthSkilletSponsoredGrandmother lays in pool of blood playing dead after being attacked night before her husband's funeral1,057 reactions6%71%23%McDonald's worker puts everyone off ice cream with 'disgusting' photos  3,107 reactions4%74%22%Here’s What Happens When 2 African Beauty Bloggers Switch Makeup Routines39 reactions9%81%10%"Women Need To Carry This Device With Them"Siren SongSponsoredDeadly accident at the Ohio State Fair93 reactions2%81%17%Senate Republicans determined to pass 'skinny repeal'13 reactions6%63%31%Obamacare Repeal Flames Out In The Republican Senatecommunicator: Senator McCain saved a lot of people from losing their health insurance tonight.

"Weki Meki" as a Group name ; seems 'JUVENILE' somehow. It sounds like "Lucky Ducky." I prefer Group Names that seem more like an 'AGE 25' members 'long run' successful K-pop Group would choose it. Having said that, SUPER JUNIOR seems like they should be SUPER *SENIOR* Group by now ... (Joking) ... And ... (here it comes) ... this gives me yet *another* chance to mention PRITZ Group = (P)retty (R)angers (I)n (T)errible (Z)one ... XkrellView Profile


krell •  18 days ago
KIM DO YEON seems *definitely* an 'anchor member' to build a successful Group around her. Although ; yet another WHOLESOME CONCEPT DEBUT seems 'safe but repetitive' to me. I could wish for something more *between* STELLAR Group and GFRIEND Group ; say something along KARA5 ; or what APINK seems to be doing it *currently.*

What the fuck is up with the title? Since when did Yoojung and Doyeon OWN the group? Please, do tell...XintroverteddeedlView Profile


introverteddeedl  snsdtwinkle •  18 days ago
ugh came here to say the same thing. Its like when they call Gugudan "Sejeong's group". You dont call Pristin "Nayoung and Kyulkyung's group" and DIA as "Chaeyeon's group" ffsXkrellView Profile


krell  snsdtwinkle •  18 days ago
I would say that *currently* KIM DO YEON is probably the *high profile* member of this Group. Due to her IOI Group activity. 4MINUTE Group was built around HYUNA ; right from the beginning. Actually, that IS the 'idea' behind the PD101 TV Show (IOI Group). You generate a 'FAN BASE' of sorts that attaches to a TRAINEE (KIM DO YEON) *prior* to their DEBUT with their *eventual* 'IN HOUSE' Agency K-pop Group. You try to avoid the K-pop Fan reaction of 'WHO are ANY of these New Group Members?' Instead, you have 'Oh, it is KIM DO YEON from IOI Goup ; I *remember* her!' ... I do *not* care for the "WEKI MEKI" Group name either ; if you are saying that too. I was just now thinking like 'TICKY TACKY' would work too! Who knows . Maybe 5 Years from now ; WEKI MEKI will be the SNSD of K-pop ... Anyway, *this* LIVE MV below (KIM DO YEON and SOMI = Black Wig) is a *good reason* (my view) why that KDY will be a FEATURED MEMBER of WEKI MEKI Group ... XCutie888View Profile


Cutie888  snsdtwinkle •  18 days ago
It's like Hyuna and her backup dancers or Suzy and the girls "-"XkrellView Profile


krell  Cutie888 •  18 days ago
I am *not* quite sure that MISS A Group was *conceived* (planned from the start) as a 'vehicle' that would FEATURE SUZY over the other members exactly. But yes, surely JYPe Agency was *planning* to target SUZY for PRODUCT ENDORSEMENTS and FASHION SHOOTS over the other members. With HYUNA, she had her WONDER GIRLS member experience *before* 4MINUTE Group was *formed* for her. I have always felt that HYUNA's fame was/is more based as a K-pop Idol. Whereas SUZY became more 'famous' via her *subsequent* 'outside work' in PRODUCT ENDORSEMENTS and FASHION SHOOTS ... (Added a bit later) ... With GIRL's DAY Group ; *not* clear to me that member HYERI was going to be the 'break out' member for Product Endorsements and CF work ; over the other members. With APINK ; I was a bit surprised that NAEUN did not 'break out' sooner. With AOA ; SEOLHYUN had a definite 'break out' VISUAL potential for 'outside work.' ... With MEKI WEKI Group here ; KIM DO YEON *already* has a MAYBELLINE *NEW YORK* USA Cosmetics PRODUCT ENDORSEMENT contract. Which, that is a fairly BIG DEAL for KIM DO YEON ; as I see it. KDY is *not* just 'any trainee' debuting with a New Group.

The official short name is WEME. WM is the company to B1A4, Oh My Girl, I (Yoonji) and WM BOYS (unofficial name and to debut soon too).
