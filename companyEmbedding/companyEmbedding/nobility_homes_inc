Important information about manufactured homes





The Mission of Nobility Homes, Inc. is to design and build homes 
        that are leaders in quality, cost, and customer satisfaction through the integration of people, technology, 
        and business systems and to transfer knowledge and experience throughout the company and its subsidiaries. 




Nobility Homes, Inc. has been a Florida-based manufactured housing company 
        producing some of the best home values for over forty-five years. Our manufacturing facilities 
        are staffed with highly qualified personnel working with the finest materials and supported by 
        an excellent corporate staff to build homes that truly appreciate in value.

Over the past forty-six 
        years Nobility Homes has constantly prided itself on providing a well-designed and affordably-built 
        home that is comfortable, pleasantly decorated, energy efficient and engineered for years of carefree 
        living. During this time, our great tradition of Quality, Service and Value has not changed. 
        Through our operational excellence, extensive resources and professional knowledge, 
        we are able to offer our customers more value and quality throughout the home building process. 
        This expertise has been developed during the forty-six years Nobility Homes has spent building 
        over 50,000 homes and combines with our continued commitment to customer satisfaction, 
        making Nobility the leader it is today.

With our company-owned retail model centers, 
        Prestige Home Centers, we are dedicated to making the entire experience of 
        buying a new home a pleasurable and rewarding one for our customers. We believe the relationship 
        between Nobility and our customers is the key to fulfilling this objective, and we are committed 
        to making customer satisfaction the standard against which all our actions are measured.

BBB Accreditation





                This Business Is Not BBB Accredited
            

                
                Businesses are under no obligation to seek BBB accreditation, and some businesses are not accredited because they have not sought BBB accreditation.
            

                To be accredited by BBB, a business must apply for accreditation and BBB must determine that the business meets
                BBB accreditation standards, which include a commitment to make a good faith effort to resolve any consumer complaints. BBB Accredited Businesses must pay a fee for accreditation review/monitoring and for support of BBB services to the public.
            








Standards of BBB Accreditation






Build Trust









            Establish and maintain a positive track record in the marketplace.
        

           An accredited business or organization agrees to:

                   1. Have been operational (actively selling products or services) in any BBB service area for at least the most recent 6 months, unless the principle(s) previously operated a similar business with an eligible record (one that qualifies for BBB accreditation).
                

                   1. Fulfill contracts signed and agreements reached.
                

                   3. Be free from government action that demonstrates a significant failure to support BBB ethical principles in marketplace transactions (this requires a determination by BBB as to the nature of any violation, whether it was caused or condoned by management, and actions taken to resolve underlying issues that led to the government action).
                
4. Be free of an unsatisfactory rating and maintain at least a B rating at the accrediting BBB and the BBB where it is headquartered, if different.

                   5. In its relationship with BBB: 
1. meet all applicable standards within this Code of Business Practices

                            2. cooperate with BBB's activities and efforts to promote voluntary self- regulation within the business' industry

4. Cooperate with BBB self-regulatory programs for the resolution of advertising disputes.
5. Use the BBB name and logos in accordance with BBB policy.

                    6. Avoid misleading customers by creating the false impression of sponsorship, endorsement, popularity, trustworthiness, product quality or business size through the misuse of logos, trustmarks, pictures, testimonials, or other means
                







Tell the Truth

5. the business' return/refund policy

                            6. any recurring commitment into which the customer may be entering, including information on how future billing will occur

Be Responsive









            Address marketplace disputes quickly, professionally, and in good faith.
        

            An accredited business or organization agrees to: 

                    1. Promptly respond to all complaints forwarded by BBB by: 
1. Resolving the complaint directly with the complainant and notifying BBB, or

                            2. Providing BBB with a response that BBB determines: 

                                    1. is professional,
                                
2. addresses all of the issues raised by the complainant,

                    2. Make a good faith effort to resolve disputes, which includes mediation if requested by BBB. Other dispute resolution options, including arbitration, may be recommended by BBB when other efforts to resolve a dispute have failed. BBB may consider a business' willingness to participate in recommended dispute resolution options in determining compliance with these standards.
                

                    3. Comply with any settlements, agreements or decisions reached as an outcome of a BBB dispute resolution process.
                

                    4. Cooperate with BBB in efforts to eliminate the underlying cause of patterns of customer complaints that are identified by BBB.

BBB Accreditation Reviews

BBB routinely monitors its files on all Accredited Businesses to affirm that they continue to meet all BBB Accreditation Standards











BBB Accreditation Process


        Not every business is eligible for BBB Accreditation. Businesses must meet, commit to and maintain the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards) 
        in order to be eligible for and maintain BBB Accreditation. The BBB Code of Business Practices represents sound advertising, selling and customer
        service practices that enhance customer trust and confidence in business. The Code is built on the BBB Standards for Trust, eight principles that
        summarize important elements of creating and maintaining trust in business.
    

        In order to be eligible for Accreditation a business must complete an Accreditation application.        
    

        Upon receipt of a fully completed BBB Application for Accreditation, BBB staff:        
        
Reviews the application
Researches the business
Verifies the information presented in the application 
May request additional information
May request proof of specific information on the application

        After the review and verification process, BBB will then evaluate if the business meets the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards)..
    
    
        Once BBB has finished its evaluation, the application for BBB Accreditation is either approved or denied. If the applicant is found in compliance with the BBB Code of Business Practices it will be presented to the BBB Board of Directors, or a committee of that board, for final approval. If the application is denied, BBB will contact the applicant, indicating the BBB Standard(s) that were not met and any recourse available to the applicant.

                        The Customer Review Rating percentages are based on the total number of positive,
                        neutral, and negative reviews posted.

Composite Score:





                        Nobility Homes, Inc. has received 2.54 out of 5 stars based on 1 Customer Reviews and a BBB Rating of D-.
                        






                            Comprised of 67% BBB Rating and 33% Customer Review Rating.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating represents the customer's opinion of the business. The Customer Review
                            Rating percentages are based on the total number of positive, neutral, and negative reviews posted.
                        

                            The BBB letter grade represents the BBB's opinion of how the business is likely to interact with its customers.
                            The BBB grade is based on BBB file information about the business.
                            In some cases, a business' grade may be lowered if the BBB does not have sufficient
                            information about the business despite BBB's requests for that information from the business.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating plus the BBB Rating is not a guarantee of a business'
                            reliability or performance. BBB recommends that consumers consider a business'
                            BBB Rating and Customer Review Rating in addition to all other available information

But before you start sending out dozens of emails and making phone calls, sit down and think about your project. What's your budget? What is the scope of your project? Will you need more than one type of professional to complete your home improvement project? Can you afford to complete the full project now, or should you tackle it bit by bit?Once you've settled on your project’s priorities, budget and scope, it's time to start researching home design professionals. Don't sell yourself short and settle on the first professional you set your sights on. Make sure that you're working with someone local, who can get to the jobsite easily and efficiently. Look into the person’s reviews, ask to speak with former clients and to see previous jobs in person. Take a good look at their portfolio photos: How similar are these projects to your own?

Comparing multiple Mckinney, TX professionals' bids and experiences can help you find the one that’s best for you. Ask a lot of questions now, so you won't have unexpected answers later.Find a home design professional on Houzz. Narrow down your search by type of professional and location.

What is a general contractor?General, or construction contractors, are often known as project managers. They oversee the entire remodeling or new home construction project and facilitate all day-to-day tasks that move it toward completion. A Mckinney general building contractor will work with your architect to review plan as you build a house and ensure everything is in place before work is started as well as arrange for permits and necessary inspections. While good local home improvement contractors in Mckinney will have the skills to handle certain tasks onsite, such as carpentry, he or she is also responsible for hiring subcontractors for the majority of jobs, such as electrical work, painting or plumbing. In addition, the general contractor should be on-site regularly to inspect the progress and resolve issues. Here are some related professionals and vendors to complement the work of general contractors: Architects & Building Designers, Interior Designers & Decorators, Landscape Architects & Landscape Designers, Kitchen & Bath Designers, Specialty Contractors.Home remodeling contractors are a must for successful completion of a renovation. Because of this, it's essential that you do your homework before deciding on the right general contractor in Mckinney as you remodel or build a house. Inspect bids carefully. Was it ready when the contractor promised it? Was the bid for building a home unusually high or low? Each of these things can be very telling: A late bid may reflect timing standards, and an off-the-mark bid could be code for a pricey premium or a deliberate underbid to score the remodeling job. You should call references, carefully read reviews and visit completed projects in Mckinney, TX to see if they’re what you expect for your job. Once you do secure your local Mckinney contractors, read the contract very carefully to be sure everyone is on the same page.Questions to ask prospective Mckinney general contractors: How long have you been in the business? How many projects like mine have you completed? Who will be working on the project? What qualities do you look for in your subcontractors? Can you provide me with references? Are you licensed and insured? How do you charge, and what does that include? What happens when costs exceed budget, whether due to materials or labor pricing changes? What about changes made by the client or by the professionals — what kinds of situations would cause those costs to be incurred? Can you give me a written estimate? What do your services include? When can your job get done? What will I need to provide? Are there any important considerations or concerns you foresee with this project?Find a Mckinney contractor on Houzz.

You can also search for photos in Mckinney, TX and contact the Mckinney general contractor who worked on the project. Professional Categories in Mckinney
