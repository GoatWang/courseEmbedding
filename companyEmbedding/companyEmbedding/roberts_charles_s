Charles Swann Roberts (February 3, 1930 – August 20, 2010,[1][2][3] Baltimore, Maryland[4]) was a wargame designer, railroad historian, and businessman. He is renowned as "The Father of Board Wargaming", having created the first modern wargame (a boardgame) in 1952, and the first wargaming company in 1954. He is also the author of a series of books on railroad history, published by the small publishing firm, Barnard, Roberts, and Company, Inc.

As a wargame designer[edit]
Charles S. Roberts created the first board wargame for the mass market, Tactics,[5] in an apartment in Catonsville, Maryland in 1952.[citation needed] In 1954, out of a garage in Avalon, Maryland, he began selling it via mail-order as The Avalon Game Company,[citation needed] and Roberts formed Avalon Hill in 1958 to publish Tactics II (1958), the newest incarnation of his wargame.[5] Tactics II improved on the basic game design of his earlier effort, and formed the genesis for the concept of the combat results table. In 1958 he published Gettysburg,[6] considered to be the first board wargame based upon an actual historical battle,[7] with subsequent versions in 1961 and 1964.
Hard hit by a recession, Roberts turned over Avalon Hill to one of his creditors, Eric Dott of Monarch Services,[5] in December 1963.[citation needed] Tom Shaw, an old friend of Roberts and the only person to stay on from the original company, oversaw the company's successful period from 1963-1982.[5]
Starting in 1988, Roberts' name was given to the Charles S. Roberts Awards, given for excellence in the historical wargaming hobby. He was a charter member of the Charles Roberts Awards Hall of Fame.
In 1999 Pyramid magazine named Charles S. Roberts as one of The Millennium's Most Influential Persons "at least in the realm of adventure gaming."[8]
As a railroad historian[edit]
Following the sale of his wargame company, Avalon Hill, Charles Roberts held various positions in the publishing industry. In 1973, he founded a small press, Barnard, Roberts, and Company, which he has described as "publishing to the Catholic market," even though Roberts himself is non-Catholic.[9] Over time, the company's emphasis shifted away from religious publications and toward railroad history.
Roberts took pride in coming from a long line of railroaders.[10] One of his great great uncles was Thomas Swann, president of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad from 1848 to 1853. Roberts' father and grandfather (also named Charles Swann Roberts) had long careers with the Baltimore and Ohio. In one of his books, Roberts reminisced about childhood trips with his father to observe the operations of the Pennsylvania Railroad, of which Roberts had always been an enthusiast.[10]
The firm of Barnard, Roberts, and Company published numerous books about railroad history, many written by Charles Roberts himself. Earlier volumes focused on the Baltimore and Ohio, and later books documented the Pennsylvania Railroad. The first in this series was Triumph I: Altoona to Pitcairn: 1846-1996,[10] and the last was Triumph IX: Salt Sea to Bays, Valleys, Dells, and Firestorms: 1927-2007.[11] In Triumph IX, Roberts includes reminiscences about his life and movingly pays tribute to his late first wife, Patricia.[11]

The Charles S. Roberts Awards (or CSR Awards) are given annually for excellence in the historical wargaming hobby. It is named after Charles S. Roberts the "Father of Wargaming" who founded Avalon Hill. The award is informally called a "Charlie" and officially called a "Charles S. Roberts Award". The Wargamer magazine called it "very prestigious".[1]
Created at the first Origins Game Convention in 1975, the awards were the "brainchild of Canadian hobbyist John Mansfield."[2][3] Originally the awards were the Origins Awards but were informally known as the Charles Roberts Awards[4] and it was only in 1988 that Charles Roberts officially agreed to let his name be used.[5] The split from the Origins Awards occurred in 1987, after Fortress America by Milton Bradley Company won an award. Fortress America was not considered a traditional historical wargame by the older members in the wargaming community. Prior to 2000, the awards were given at the Origins Game Fair. Since 2000, the awards have been given at the World Boardgaming Championships (formerly "AvalonCon"). The Award is managed by the Charles S. Roberts Award Committee with winners chosen by votes submitted by fans.
The Awards also include the Charles Roberts Awards Hall of Fame which recognizes game designers and producers that have made a significant and long lasting contribution to the contemporary board wargaming hobby.

The Charles S. Roberts Awards (or CSR Awards) are given annually for excellence in the historical wargaming hobby. It is named after Charles S. Roberts the "Father of Wargaming" who founded Avalon Hill. The award is informally called a "Charlie" and officially called a "Charles S. Roberts Award". The Wargamer magazine called it "very prestigious".[1]
Created at the first Origins Game Convention in 1975, the awards were the "brainchild of Canadian hobbyist John Mansfield."[2][3] Originally the awards were the Origins Awards but were informally known as the Charles Roberts Awards[4] and it was only in 1988 that Charles Roberts officially agreed to let his name be used.[5] The split from the Origins Awards occurred in 1987, after Fortress America by Milton Bradley Company won an award. Fortress America was not considered a traditional historical wargame by the older members in the wargaming community. Prior to 2000, the awards were given at the Origins Game Fair. Since 2000, the awards have been given at the World Boardgaming Championships (formerly "AvalonCon"). The Award is managed by the Charles S. Roberts Award Committee with winners chosen by votes submitted by fans.
The Awards also include the Charles Roberts Awards Hall of Fame which recognizes game designers and producers that have made a significant and long lasting contribution to the contemporary board wargaming hobby.

The Charles S. Roberts Awards (or CSR Awards) are given annually for excellence in the historical wargaming hobby. It is named after Charles S. Roberts the "Father of Wargaming" who founded Avalon Hill. The award is informally called a "Charlie" and officially called a "Charles S. Roberts Award". The Wargamer magazine called it "very prestigious".[1]
Created at the first Origins Game Convention in 1975, the awards were the "brainchild of Canadian hobbyist John Mansfield."[2][3] Originally the awards were the Origins Awards but were informally known as the Charles Roberts Awards[4] and it was only in 1988 that Charles Roberts officially agreed to let his name be used.[5] The split from the Origins Awards occurred in 1987, after Fortress America by Milton Bradley Company won an award. Fortress America was not considered a traditional historical wargame by the older members in the wargaming community. Prior to 2000, the awards were given at the Origins Game Fair. Since 2000, the awards have been given at the World Boardgaming Championships (formerly "AvalonCon"). The Award is managed by the Charles S. Roberts Award Committee with winners chosen by votes submitted by fans.
The Awards also include the Charles Roberts Awards Hall of Fame which recognizes game designers and producers that have made a significant and long lasting contribution to the contemporary board wargaming hobby.

The Charles S. Roberts Awards (or CSR Awards) are given annually for excellence in the historical wargaming hobby. It is named after Charles S. Roberts the "Father of Wargaming" who founded Avalon Hill. The award is informally called a "Charlie" and officially called a "Charles S. Roberts Award". The Wargamer magazine called it "very prestigious".[1]
Created at the first Origins Game Convention in 1975, the awards were the "brainchild of Canadian hobbyist John Mansfield."[2][3] Originally the awards were the Origins Awards but were informally known as the Charles Roberts Awards[4] and it was only in 1988 that Charles Roberts officially agreed to let his name be used.[5] The split from the Origins Awards occurred in 1987, after Fortress America by Milton Bradley Company won an award. Fortress America was not considered a traditional historical wargame by the older members in the wargaming community. Prior to 2000, the awards were given at the Origins Game Fair. Since 2000, the awards have been given at the World Boardgaming Championships (formerly "AvalonCon"). The Award is managed by the Charles S. Roberts Award Committee with winners chosen by votes submitted by fans.
The Awards also include the Charles Roberts Awards Hall of Fame which recognizes game designers and producers that have made a significant and long lasting contribution to the contemporary board wargaming hobby.

Charles Swann Roberts (February 3, 1930 – August 20, 2010,[1][2][3] Baltimore, Maryland[4]) was a wargame designer, railroad historian, and businessman. He is renowned as "The Father of Board Wargaming", having created the first modern wargame (a boardgame) in 1952, and the first wargaming company in 1954. He is also the author of a series of books on railroad history, published by the small publishing firm, Barnard, Roberts, and Company, Inc.

Roberts created the first board wargame for the mass market, Tactics,[5] in an apartment in Catonsville, Maryland in 1952.[citation needed] In 1954, out of a garage in Avalon, Maryland, he began selling it via mail-order as The Avalon Game Company,[citation needed] and Roberts formed Avalon Hill in 1958 to publish Tactics II (1958), the newest incarnation of his wargame.[5] Tactics II improved on the basic game design of his earlier effort, and formed the genesis for the concept of the combat results table. In 1958 he published Gettysburg,[6] considered to be the first board wargame based upon an actual historical battle,[7] with subsequent versions in 1961 and 1964.
Hard hit by a recession, Roberts turned over Avalon Hill to one of his creditors, Eric Dott of Monarch Services,[5] in December 1963.[citation needed] Tom Shaw, an old friend of Roberts and the only person to stay on from the original company, oversaw the company's successful period from 1963-1982.[5]
Starting in 1988, Roberts' name was given to the Charles S. Roberts Awards, given for excellence in the historical wargaming hobby. He was a charter member of the Charles Roberts Awards Hall of Fame.
In 1999 Pyramid magazine named Charles S. Roberts as one of The Millennium's Most Influential Persons "at least in the realm of adventure gaming."[8]
As a railroad historian[edit]
Following the sale of his wargame company, Avalon Hill, Charles Roberts held various positions in the publishing industry. In 1973, he founded a small press, Barnard, Roberts, and Company, which he has described as "publishing to the Catholic market," even though Roberts himself is non-Catholic.[9] Over time, the company's emphasis shifted away from religious publications and toward railroad history.
Roberts took pride in coming from a long line of railroaders.[10] One of his great great uncles was Thomas Swann, president of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad from 1848 to 1853. Roberts' father and grandfather (also named Charles Swann Roberts) had long careers with the Baltimore and Ohio. In one of his books, Roberts reminisced about childhood trips with his father to observe the operations of the Pennsylvania Railroad, of which Roberts had always been an enthusiast.[10]
The firm of Barnard, Roberts, and Company published numerous books about railroad history, many written by Charles Roberts himself. Earlier volumes focused on the Baltimore and Ohio, and later books documented the Pennsylvania Railroad. The first in this series was Triumph I: Altoona to Pitcairn: 1846-1996,[10] and the last was Triumph IX: Salt Sea to Bays, Valleys, Dells, and Firestorms: 1927-2007.[11] In Triumph IX, Roberts includes reminiscences about his life and movingly pays tribute to his late first wife, Patricia.[11]

Charles Swann Roberts (February 3, 1930 – August 20, 2010,[1][2][3] Baltimore, Maryland[4]) was a wargame designer, railroad historian, and businessman. He is renowned as "The Father of Board Wargaming", having created the first modern wargame (a boardgame) in 1952, and the first wargaming company in 1954. He is also the author of a series of books on railroad history, published by the small publishing firm, Barnard, Roberts, and Company, Inc.

As a wargame designer[edit]
Charles S. Roberts created the first board wargame for the mass market, Tactics,[5] in an apartment in Catonsville, Maryland in 1952.[citation needed] In 1954, out of a garage in Avalon, Maryland, he began selling it via mail-order as The Avalon Game Company,[citation needed] and Roberts formed Avalon Hill in 1958 to publish Tactics II (1958), the newest incarnation of his wargame.[5] Tactics II improved on the basic game design of his earlier effort, and formed the genesis for the concept of the combat results table. In 1958 he published Gettysburg,[6] considered to be the first board wargame based upon an actual historical battle,[7] with subsequent versions in 1961 and 1964.
Hard hit by a recession, Roberts turned over Avalon Hill to one of his creditors, Eric Dott of Monarch Services,[5] in December 1963.[citation needed] Tom Shaw, an old friend of Roberts and the only person to stay on from the original company, oversaw the company's successful period from 1963-1982.[5]
Starting in 1988, Roberts' name was given to the Charles S. Roberts Awards, given for excellence in the historical wargaming hobby. He was a charter member of the Charles Roberts Awards Hall of Fame.
In 1999 Pyramid magazine named Charles S. Roberts as one of The Millennium's Most Influential Persons "at least in the realm of adventure gaming."[8]
As a railroad historian[edit]
Following the sale of his wargame company, Avalon Hill, Charles Roberts held various positions in the publishing industry. In 1973, he founded a small press, Barnard, Roberts, and Company, which he has described as "publishing to the Catholic market," even though Roberts himself is non-Catholic.[9] Over time, the company's emphasis shifted away from religious publications and toward railroad history.
Roberts took pride in coming from a long line of railroaders.[10] One of his great great uncles was Thomas Swann, president of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad from 1848 to 1853. Roberts' father and grandfather (also named Charles Swann Roberts) had long careers with the Baltimore and Ohio. In one of his books, Roberts reminisced about childhood trips with his father to observe the operations of the Pennsylvania Railroad, of which Roberts had always been an enthusiast.[10]

Charles Swann Roberts (February 3, 1930 – August 20, 2010,[1][2][3] Baltimore, Maryland[4]) was a wargame designer, railroad historian, and businessman. He is renowned as "The Father of Board Wargaming", having created the first modern wargame (a boardgame) in 1952, and the first wargaming company in 1954. He is also the author of a series of books on railroad history, published by the small publishing firm, Barnard, Roberts, and Company, Inc.

As a wargame designer[edit]
Charles S. Roberts created the first board wargame for the mass market, Tactics,[5] in an apartment in Catonsville, Maryland in 1952.[citation needed] In 1954, out of a garage in Avalon, Maryland, he began selling it via mail-order as The Avalon Game Company,[citation needed] and Roberts formed Avalon Hill in 1958 to publish Tactics II (1958), the newest incarnation of his wargame.[5] Tactics II improved on the basic game design of his earlier effort, and formed the genesis for the concept of the combat results table. In 1958 he published Gettysburg,[6] considered to be the first board wargame based upon an actual historical battle,[7] with subsequent versions in 1961 and 1964.
Hard hit by a recession, Roberts turned over Avalon Hill to one of his creditors, Eric Dott of Monarch Services,[5] in December 1963.[citation needed] Tom Shaw, an old friend of Roberts and the only person to stay on from the original company, oversaw the company's successful period from 1963-1982.[5]
Starting in 1988, Roberts' name was given to the Charles S. Roberts Awards, given for excellence in the historical wargaming hobby. He was a charter member of the Charles Roberts Awards Hall of Fame.
In 1999 Pyramid magazine named Charles S. Roberts as one of The Millennium's Most Influential Persons "at least in the realm of adventure gaming."[8]
As a railroad historian[edit]
Following the sale of his wargame company, Avalon Hill, Charles Roberts held various positions in the publishing industry. In 1973, he founded a small press, Barnard, Roberts, and Company, which he has described as "publishing to the Catholic market," even though Roberts himself is non-Catholic.[9] Over time, the company's emphasis shifted away from religious publications and toward railroad history.
Roberts took pride in coming from a long line of railroaders.[10] One of his great great uncles was Thomas Swann, president of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad from 1848 to 1853. Roberts' father and grandfather (also named Charles Swann Roberts) had long careers with the Baltimore and Ohio. In one of his books, Roberts reminisced about childhood trips with his father to observe the operations of the Pennsylvania Railroad, of which Roberts had always been an enthusiast.[10]
The firm of Barnard, Roberts, and Company published numerous books about railroad history, many written by Charles Roberts himself. Earlier volumes focused on the Baltimore and Ohio, and later books documented the Pennsylvania Railroad. The first in this series was Triumph I: Altoona to Pitcairn: 1846-1996,[10] and the last was Triumph IX: Salt Sea to Bays, Valleys, Dells, and Firestorms: 1927-2007.[11] In Triumph IX, Roberts includes reminiscences about his life and movingly pays tribute to his late first wife, Patricia.[11]

            Hey there! Are you maybe looking for Firebase instead?

            







    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

22 GB gzip250 GB uncompressed

Download



The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.


RDF
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage.date> "2001-02"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#gYearMonth>  .

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

This is the program booklet from the physical auction at Origins where Roberts himself was on-site offering signatures for these games which were from his private collection.
