 Empire BiotechnologiesCombating Malabsorption 
 

     Our FocusEmpire Biotechnologies is developing an orally delivered, protein therapeutic called Mfge8 to treat diseases of malabsorption. Our long-term vision is a therapy for the millions suffering from malabsorption resulting from diseases and syndromes such as: Short Bowel Syndrome (SBS), Nectotizing Enterocolotis, Cystic Fibrosis, Wasting syndrome, and infant prematurity.    


 

the mfge8 solution

Empire Biotechnologies is developing an orally delivered, therapeutic protein (Mfge8) capable of significantly increasing the absorption of nutrients in the intestine. This endogenous integrin ligand is found highly concentrated in breast milk. Mfge8 works two-fold by increasing fat uptake directly in intestinal epithelial cells, while simultaneously slowing gastric motility. Because of these two complementary mechanisms of action, this protein promises to be highly effective in treating malabsorption
