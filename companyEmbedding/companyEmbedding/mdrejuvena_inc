Facial redness occurs when hundreds of tiny blood vessels close to the surface of the skin become dilated or inflamed due to some sort of trigger. It can be caused by emotional or environmental factors and may be a temporary or chronic problem.

Flushing
Allergic reactions
Sunburn
Acne
Hot flashes

Rejuvaphyl™ Redness Recovery has been shown to reduce the visual appearance of redness with continuous use.



Acne


Acne is a skin condition in which small hair follicles become plugged with oil and dead skin cells, creating an environment in which bacteria can grow, causing inflammation. When these blocked pores become inflamed or infected, the result may be whiteheads, blackheads, pimples or cysts.



Factors that may worsen acne:

Hormones
Certain medications
Diet
Stress

Product recommendations

REJUVAPHYL®









Rejuvaphyl is the MDRejuvena brand of high potency skincare products that contain the proprietary and patented ingredient Phytochromatic MD® Complex.
 

MDRejuvena is at the forefront of skin health featuring Phytochromatic MD® Complex, a naturally-derived, plant-based ingredient clinically proven to provide a number of important skincare benefits.
Ideal for patients looking for a more natural alternative with proven results, this complex provides a multi-functional approach to dynamically improve the signs of stressed, unbalanced and aging skin such as fine lines and wrinkles, irregular pigmentation, dull, sallow appearance and skin coarseness. Providing the skin what it naturally craves results in the appearance of healthier and more radiant skin.



 
What is Phytochromatic MD® Complex?
Phytochromatic MD® complex contains copper that is bound to the water soluble chlorophyll molecule, chlorophyllin, which allows for slow release of copper in the skin. Copper is needed for a number of important enzymes that have various functions in the skin. As skin ages, changes in these copper-dependent enzymes can result in fine lines and wrinkles, loss of firmness and uneven skin tone.

Click here to read more about the in vitro effects of Phytochromatic MD® Complex on hyaluronidase inhibition.




Where did Phytochromatic MD® Complex come from?
Originating from a molecule necessary to sustain plant life and known for its healing properties in humans, Chlorophyll is bound with copper, an essential element for maintaining optimal skin health with proven healing, anti-inflammatory, and antimicrobial properties. The joining of these elements within a unique delivery system forms Phytochromatic MD® Complex, a potent copper chlorophyllin antioxidant proven to provide a number of powerful anti-aging benefits.
Shown to help reduce the appearance of:

Fine lines
Coarse wrinkles
Skin laxity
Skin roughness
Uneven pigmentation
Age spots
Skin blotchiness
Sallowness

The daily MDRejuvena regimen included the highly differentiated Rejuvaphyl® Rejuvenating Complex products containing retinol (LS or HS) which were customized to individual patient needs," stated Suzanne Bruce, MD, board-certified dermatologist in Houston, TX. In the study, titled "The effects of a daily skincare regimen on maintaining the benefits obtained from previous chemical resurfacing treatments," subjects who completed participation in a clinical experience trial in which they received 3 chemical resurfacing treatments (AGE and MELA skin resurfacing) were recruited to participate in a continuation trial and used a daily regimen of MDRejuvena facial products for 12 weeks. No other facial products were used during the trial. Thirteen subjects completed participation in the 12-week evaluation. All physician assessments and all but one of the subject assessments showed overall improvement in facial skin condition compared to baseline.Salts of copper chlorophyllin complex are naturally-derived compounds with anti-aging, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and anti-redness activities. Sodium copper chlorophyllin in a liposomal complex, branded as Phytochromatic® MD Complex, is the primary ingredient in the Rejuvaphyl® line of skin care products from MDRejuvena. A recent study published in Clinical, Cosmetic and Investigational Dermatology, demonstrated that the sodium copper chlorophyllin complex, contained in Phytochromatic MD Complex, has the ability to inhibit hyaluronidase and repair photoaged skin by increasing epidermal and dermal hyaluronic acid (HA), and precursors of collagen and elastin.

The daily MDRejuvena regimen included the highly differentiated Rejuvaphyl® Rejuvenating Complex products containing retinol (LS or HS) which were customized to individual patient needs," stated Suzanne Bruce, MD, board-certified dermatologist in Houston, TX. In the study, titled "The effects of a daily skincare regimen on maintaining the benefits obtained from previous chemical resurfacing treatments," subjects who completed participation in a clinical experience trial in which they received 3 chemical resurfacing treatments (AGE and MELA skin resurfacing) were recruited to participate in a continuation trial and used a daily regimen of MDRejuvena facial products for 12 weeks. No other facial products were used during the trial. Thirteen subjects completed participation in the 12-week evaluation. All physician assessments and all but one of the subject assessments showed overall improvement in facial skin condition compared to baseline.Salts of copper chlorophyllin complex are naturally-derived compounds with anti-aging, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and anti-redness activities. Sodium copper chlorophyllin in a liposomal complex, branded as Phytochromatic® MD Complex, is the primary ingredient in the Rejuvaphyl® line of skin care products from MDRejuvena. A recent study published in Clinical, Cosmetic and Investigational Dermatology, demonstrated that the sodium copper chlorophyllin complex, contained in Phytochromatic MD Complex, has the ability to inhibit hyaluronidase and repair photoaged skin by increasing epidermal and dermal hyaluronic acid (HA), and precursors of collagen and elastin.

MDRejuvena™ Launches Novel Proprietary Product Line Focused on Skin 
      Health






March 23, 2015 07:00 AM Eastern Daylight Time



SAN DIEGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--MDRejuvena, Inc., a San Diego based company focused on the development 
      and commercialization of products that enhance skin health, announced 
      that it launched its novel, proprietary product line at the American 
      Academy of Dermatology Meeting in San Francisco. MDRejuvena’s product 
      line, which has been designed to rejuvenate, enhance and maintain skin 
      health, incorporates Phytochromatic MD™ Complex, a proprietary, 
      patented, plant-derived liposomal complex of copper chlorophyllin.
    

      Phytochromatic MD Complex has been shown in clinical studies to have a 
      number of important skin care benefits including anti-inflammatory, 
      anti-oxidant, anti-aging, anti-redness and anti-microbial activity. In 
      vitro studies also show that copper chlorophyllin inhibits the activity 
      of hyaluronidase, which breaks down hyaluronic acid in the skin. 
      Hyaluronic acid is a key component of the extracellular matrix which 
      supports the skin. Phytochromatic MD Complex has been incorporated into 
      a line of products trade named Rejuvaphyl™, some of which have been 
      designed into a dual dispensed system with other ingredients including 
      peptides, retinol, skin conditioners, and humectants. Rejuvaphyl 
      products will provide a multi-functional approach to dynamically 
      rejuvenate and enhance aging, photodamaged and stressed skin, as well as 
      improve skin conditions such as chronic redness, oiliness and acne.
    

      MDRejuvena obtained an exclusive, worldwide license from CHL Industries, 
      LLC, for the use of Phytochromatic MD Complex in products directed to 
      the professional, physician-dispensed market. In 2014, there were over 
      $1 billion in sales in this market within the U.S. The company is 
      planning to launch the MDRejuvena product line internationally through 
      distributors in approximately 30 countries in mid-year 2015.
    

      According to John McCook, CEO of CHL Industries, and a scientist with 
      years of product development experience in the skin care field, “We have 
      been studying the benefits of copper chlorophyllin in a liposomal 
      complex in skin conditions for many years. We believe that 
      Phytochromatic MD Complex has the potential to significantly improve and 
      enhance skin health and we are pleased to be working with MDRejuvena on 
      multi-functional products that incorporate Phytochromatic MD Complex.”
    

      MDRejuvena has also obtained the exclusive rights for North America to a 
      proprietary line of skin resurfacing products developed by pHformula, a 
      European company. This skin resurfacing product line is currently being 
      sold by pHformula’s distributors in approximately 27 countries in 
      Europe, the Middle East and the Far East. The pHformula® product line is 
      focused on skin resurfacing regimens for anti-aging, hyperpigmentation, 
      acne and chronic redness. Results have shown that pHformula’s 
      proprietary, skin resurfacing regimens may restore and enhance skin 
      health and improve certain skin conditions.
    

      According to Petru van Zyl, President and Co-Founder of pHformula, “Our 
      objective in the creation and development of the pHformula line of skin 
      resurfacing regimens was to develop a proprietary product line that 
      could restore and enhance skin in women with damaged skin or certain 
      skin conditions. We are having good success with our skin resurfacing 
      products in many countries. We are very pleased to be working with 
      MDRejuvena to launch this product line for the first time in the North 
      American markets.”
    

      David Hale, Acting CEO and former Chairman of SkinMedica, Inc., 
      commented, “We are very excited to bring this novel proprietary line of 
      skin care products to aesthetic dermatologists, plastic surgeons and 
      aestheticians in the professional, physician-dispensed market in the 
      U.S. and international markets. We believe that our products can provide 
      physicians with options to restore, enhance and maintain the skin health 
      of their patients.”
