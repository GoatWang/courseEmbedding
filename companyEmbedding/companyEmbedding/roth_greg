Empirical tests were conducted to characterize the stem seal damping as a function of valve stem velocity. In addition, a simplified dynamics equation approach was developed. The results were successfully correlated to recorded strain gauge data.Authors: Greg RothFatigue Analysis Methodology for Predicting Engine Valve Life (03P-43)Society of Automotive Engineers, Inc.2003ABSTRACTUsing FEM (Finite Element Method) and other analytical approaches, a systematic methodology was developed to predict an engine valve's fatigue life. In this study, a steel (SAE 21-2N) exhaust valve on an engine with a type 2 valve train configuration was used as a test case. Temperature and stress/strain responses of each major event phase of the engine cycle were analytically simulated. CFD models were developed to simulate the exhaust gas flow to generate boundary conditions for athermal model of the valve. FEM simulations accounted for thermal loads,temperature dependent material properties, thermalstresses, closing impact stresses and combustion load stresses. An estimated fatigue life was calculated using Miner's rule of damage accumulation in conjunction with the Modified Goodman approach for fluctuating stresses. Predicted life results correlated very well with empirical tests. In one scenario for an unstable valve train, early valve failure was predicted at 500 hours of engine testing that correlated to actual test failures from 460-500 hours. In other test scenarios, the methodology was able to accurately predict Authors: Greg RothDevelopment and Prove Out of a Thermoelectric Cooling Scheme to Cool Electronic Components in High Temperature Environments (165 °C) (03AE-10)Society of Automotive Engineers, Inc.2003ABSTRACTThis paper represents the results of a series of design studies, CAE simulations and empirical tests to determine if an innovative thermoelectric cooling configuration can effectively maintain the temperature of electronic components below an environmental ambient temperature of 165 °C. The configuration employs an insulated container mounted to a thermoelectric cooling module. This configuration can selectively cool a region of components within a larger electronics module.The container is made of a highly insulative foam material. A copper cooling blanket surrounds theelectronics and provides a direct and efficient cooling path for a thermoelectric cooler chip to extract heat. The insulative container prevents parasitic heat drain into the electronic components from the surrounding environment. This approach allows for the use of cheaper electronic components with lower operating temperature ranges for components such as microprocessors, memory and capacitors. Results for a specific thermoelectric cooler chip demonstrated that components could be kept up to 25 -29 °C cooler than the ambient operating environment temperature.

Advancements in theentire spectrum of computer-aided design, manufacturing,and engineering (CAD/CAM/CAE) tools in particular haveautomated many design, engineering, and analysis tasks toshorten development cycles, mostly as labor savings to minimizeoverhead costs.Progressive manufacturers are now investigatingways to further reduce design cycle time by evaluating andchanging the product development process itself. The goalhere is not so much economic savings in the engineeringdepartment but rather a broad business advantage in gettingproduct innovations to customers faster, and thereby increasinga company’s market share. Efforts at the Eaton CorporationInnovation Center, for example, are being directedtoward studying the benefits of distributing analysis activitiesthroughout product development instead of waiting to facedesign problems just before a product is released to manufacturing.One approach now under investigation is called theinteractive feedback CAD/CAE process, where basic analysistools for first-pass studies are tightly coupled with CAD software.This allows designers and engineers to quickly iterateback and forth in performing basic conceptual “what-if?”studies to evaluate the merit of different ideas, compare alternatives,and filter out design weaknesses before more detailedanalysis, prototype testing, and production planning.Authors: Greg RothPitfalls in Determining Analysis AccuracyANSYS Solutions Magazine2000Authors: Greg RothBreakthrough for Brake DesignANSYS Advantage Magazine  Vol 8 Issue 12014New method simulates brake-squeal problems early in the design process.
