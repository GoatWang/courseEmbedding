GET DETAILSClickFIND A STOREThe Journey Home: A Novelby Olafsson, OlafA lyrical and arresting novel by acclaimed Icelandic writer Olaf Olafsson about one woman's redemptive journey home.Disa Jonsdottir has managed an inn for years with her companion, Anthony, in the English countryside. Compelled by the demands of time to revisit the village of her childhood, she departs England for her native Iceland. Along the way memories surface-of the rift between her and her mother, of the fate of her German-Jewish lover, of the trauma she experienced while working as a cook in a wealthy household. Skillfully weaving past and present, Olafsson builds toward an emotional climax that rendersThe Journey Home moving, suspenseful, and unforgettable.LiteraryCondition: Used - GoodHPB condition ratingsNew: Item is brand new, unused and unmarked, in flawless condition.Fine/Like New (F): No defects, little usage.

Top positive reviewSee all 17 positive reviews› 5.0 out of 5 starsOlaf Olafsson: Icelandic NovelistByMiriam Saganon October 2, 2010Icelanders have often travelled abroad--first as Vikings, then as immigrants, and in contemporary times as individuals seeking a different world. These ex-patriots people the novels of Olaf Olafsson--they may be emigrants, but they are still of Iceland.  In ABSOLUTION the setting is Manhattan, and the back story is Scandinavia during the Second World War. The hero is not a likeabe person--corrupt, self-engrossed, potentially a criminal. It is a tribute to the subtly of the novel that we come to like him. The redemptive twist at the end works even for readers (like me) who as a rule don't like a startling revelation at the end--this one is satisfying.  The heroine of THE JOURNEY HOME is a more likable protagonist--she has her faults, but like an old friend, one can put up with them. Disa Jonsdotir left Iceland as a young woman, in search of a career as a chef. She goes to England, but the disappearance of her German-Jewish lover and family events propel her back home, where she confronts not just the dry Lutheranism of her family but the rise of pro-Nazism in Iceland itself. As an aging and terminally ill woman she not only looks back but goes back on one last journey.  The Iceland of these novel is a complex one. It contains childhoods of startling pristine Arctic beauty--and depression and despair. Interiors might be out of Ibsen--restrained, middle-class. Protagonists don't rail against fate--they try to aim for happiness but don't necessarily triumph. However, small moments serve as compensation.  Disa says: Sometimes you have to get a grasp on yourself to keep your thoughts under control, but it's worth it. The reward is just around the next corner, whether it is a clutch of perfect eggs in a basket or the sound of birdsong on a still day. The soul can take delight in small things if one's dreams only leave it in peace long enough."***For more reviews by Sagan see Miriam's Well [...]

3.0 out of 5 starsWell written but . . .ByPam Gearharton October 28, 2006Disa didn't come alive for me and parts of the book felt contrived, especially Disa's estrangement from her mother.  So her mother disapproved of her career choice -- that's hardly enough of a reason for Disa to cut her mother out of her life.  Disa's moment of sadness at not being able to say goodbye when her mother died was false -- something she was supposed to say because that's how a daughter should feel.  Same with her feelings for the child she gave up -- forced emotion.Much is made of her "journey home" to Iceland, but it didn't seem that Iceland meant that much to her, and we didn't see anything about Iceland that formed her character or shaped her life.  It could have just as easily been Pennsylvania.She's a woman with secrets and a lost, tragic love.  She has persevered.  This made it even more infuriating on the journey home, when she dismissed her fellow passengers as unworthy of her attention.  Wouldn't she have a clue that people aren't always what they appear to be?Disa's self-delusion, self-aggrandizement, and self-pity kept me from having any sympathy for her.  Maybe that's what Olafsson intended.  Disa is emotionally removed from everything except food.  The times when she talked about cooking were the only times she felt like a real person to me.

Media Deals and Novels From One Busy Mind

By DAVID CARRMARCH 5, 2012

As writers’ offices go, Olaf Olafsson’s is a bit of a surprise. It is a giant lair in a futuristic skyscraper, with enough room for both a desk and a big table, along with an expansive view of Central Park. With its abundant light and helpful assistant out front, it’s not exactly the kind of dark warren where the author of sprawling historical novels would find himself.Then again, this office is in the Time Warner Center, where Mr. Olafsson does his day job as an executive vice president for international and corporate strategy at Time Warner. At 6 a.m. on a recent Tuesday morning, before going to work, he had gotten up in his Upper East Side apartment and plunged into research on his next novel. His discipline and dual life is all the more admirable given that “Restoration,” his waning-days-of-war novel set in the rolling hills of Tuscany, was published in February.Mr. Olafsson, 49, is no hobbyist, having written four books in the past 12 years. His work is characterized by meticulous attention to place and historical events. Given his deep and steady involvement in setting the strategic course of a global media company, his ability to pull off serious novels at the same time is enough to make the rest of us feel like slackers. “That’s funny, I always scold myself for not being productive enough,” he said, his voice conveying his roots in Iceland, where two of his other books were partially set. “If anything, I think I am good at organizing my time. I don’t go to a lot of social events, so I think that gives me time that I can structure in other ways.”Some corporate executives have trouble fitting in a round of golf now and then, let alone hundreds of hours of research and writing. Count Jeffrey L. Bewkes, the chief executive of Time Warner, among the impressed.

“I’ve read all of Olaf’s books, and I’m frankly amazed that a guy whom I rely on during the day to structure complex digital deals and identify international business opportunities can create novels with such rich characters and intricate plotlines,” he said. Continue reading the main story

“Restoration” is an ambitious historical novel — it brings to mind “Atonement” and “The English Patient” — that motors along on a dark mystery taking place in the sunlit vistas of Tuscany, which Mr. Olafsson visited as a young student and has been back to many times since.There the two central female characters struggle to find a place to stand amid encroaching armies; both the Allies and Axis powers have designs on the crumbling villa where they are staying. Their destinies are entwined with a single work of purloined art that may, or may not, be a masterpiece. The plot is based in part on the life of Iris Origo, a British expat of means who married an Italian nobleman and spent years restoring a crumbling estate — where she sheltered refugee children — that also became a refuge for Allied soldiers. (Her memoir of that experience was called “War in Val d’Orcia.”)

”I was messing around the topics of art and Tuscany when I came across her diaries, which are amazing, and she became the basis for one of the characters,” he said. “I’m drawn to characters who aren’t black and white, because I’m not a black-and-white person.”Library Journal called the book “beautifully realized,” while a review in The New York Times said it was a “mixed bag” that leaned too heavily on historical sources.Born in Reykjavik and the son of a novelist, Mr. Olafsson came to the United States to study at Brandeis University in Massachusetts, graduating with a degree in physics. He eventually ended up working at Sony, where he founded Sony Interactive Entertainment in 1991 and led the rollout of the Sony PlayStation in the United States and Europe. At Time Warner he is a strategic adviser on digital and international matters and oversees a $500 million investment fund for new ventures.That disparate portfolio can be hard to reconcile with the quiet, affable Mr. Olafsson, who is also married, has three children and plays soccer — quite well judging by the trophies stashed in a drawer — when he isn’t writing novels or helping to run one of the world’s largest media companies.Lee Boudreaux, his editor at Ecco/HarperCollins, said she found herself wishing she worked with more writers like him.

“He is über-professional,” she said. “For someone who is extremely busy, with a full family life and a very serious job, he gets back to you immediately and decisively.”Artistically all has not gone so smoothly. Mr. Olafsson had to be pressed in an e-mail to talk about his efforts as a playwright, perhaps because “Feast of Snails,” produced at the Lyric Theater in London in 2002, was described by The Daily Mail as “bad Ibsen with zero plausibility.”

His reaction to the review now? “It wasn’t good,” he said of the play, “and I think I knew it. You live and you learn.”He has since survived an even bigger jolt to the system: the disastrous Time Warner merger with AOL. He left the company but returned at the request of Richard D. Parsons, then the chief executive, after the merger broke down and Time Warner reasserted control.In corporate life, and in fiction, best laid plans have a way of going astray, but those who work with Mr. Olafsson say he avoids drama. “Olaf is a very original thinker in terms of business and has no ambitions to rise up and gather more titles in the sometimes contrived world of big media,” said Joseph Ravitch, an investment banker who became a friend after they did a number of deals together. “That gives him a great deal of independence. He says what he thinks but stays above the fray.”

Asked about the roiling media landscape, Mr. Olafsson maintains that the old-new media dichotomy is a false one. And he all but shrugs when asked why he would pile a career as a novelist on top of an already overstuffed portfolio.He has written three other novels — “Absolution,” “The Journey Home” and “Walking into Night” — along with a collection of short stories, “Valentines.” Fred Berner, a film and television producer, is working with Mr. Olafsson to turn the stories in that volume into a television series.“He has an insanely good work ethic, turns things around quickly, and for someone who is supposedly this solid, Nordic persona, he writes women extremely well,” Mr. Berner said.Mr. Olafsson has a reputation at Time Warner for collaboration, and as a non-American he’s been particularly helpful in the international realm. But beneath the exterior of his almost eerie Nordic calm there is an operational ego, at least when it comes to writing. He admits that it is nice to be alone in a room where he doesn’t have to reach consensus with anyone else. He likes playing God, at least when he is typing.“You don’t get much done around here by being autocratic or pontificating,” he said. “But when I am working on a novel, I pretty much call all the shots.”

About the Book 



“A tremendous talent.”—Boston Globe“Restoration is an elegantly constructed work of fiction, seamlessly moving between the past and the present.”—Ron Rash, bestselling author of SerenaAcclaimed novelist Olaf Olafsson brings us Restoration, a sweeping story of love tested by human frailty and the terrors and tragedies of war.  Departing from the landscapes of his native Iceland—so beautifully evoked in Absolution, The Journey Home, and other previous works—Olafson sets Restoration in the gorgeous Italian hills of Tuscany during the World War Two years of the early 1940s. He captivates readers with a deeply emotional story in the vein of The English Patient by Michael Ondaajte, Ian McEwan’s Atonement, and other contemporary literary classics, spinning a tale of passion, art, war, and betrayal centered around a pair of love triangles and a forged Caravaggio.

Critical Praise
“An elegant meditation on the interplay among politics, aesthetics, and personal ethics. It’s also a surprisingly moving story about two women, each of whom struggles with grief and guilt as she navigates life during wartime….Gently paced [and] satisfying.” — Boston Globe
“[Olaf’s] literary skills bring Restoration to life on a windy Tuscan hilltop north of Florence...[and] shows the reader the permutations of love betrayed, and the enormous losses that war will claim.” — Shelf Awareness
“[A] beautifully realized novel…Olafsson masterfully depicts the interior lives of these women, creating a richly complex portrait of love and passion at work even as his harrowing depictions of daily life in war-torn Italy add additional depth and power to the novel.” — Library Journal
“With a backdrop of the ravages of WWII, particularly as they affect the civilian population, Olafsson casts a keen eye on Germany’s wartime acquisition of artistic masterpieces. A beautifully written literary novel of love, betrayal, reconciliation, and art.” — Booklist
“RESTORATION is an elegantly constructed work of fiction, seamlessly moving between the past and the present, but what makes Olafsson’s novel so compelling is his empathy and compassion for Alice Orsini, a woman trying to redeem her life in a country ravaged by war.” — Ron Rash, bestselling author of SERENA and THE COVE

Publisher's Description+


                From  Iceberg Reader: 


    ValentinesOlaf OlafssonPantheonJanuary 30, 2007From the acclaimed Icelandic author of Absolution, The Journey Home (now about to start filming under Liv Ullmann’s direction) and Walking into the Night: a haunting collection of thematically linked stories that encompasses the twelve months of a year, capturing the most candid moments between lovers, husbands and wives, parents and children–when truths and true feelings surge to the surface and everything changes.Olaf Olafsson’s fans will recognize the perfect restraint and precision–and quick wit–with which he characteristically explores these dark epiphanies, when the heart is suddenly laid bare, whether by love or betrayal, disenchantment or regret, or the shock of loss. While their settings range from the East Coast to the West Coast, from Paris to Slovenia and Iceland, these contemporary stories probe the complexity of modern relationships over time. A wife realizes her closest confidante is much more than that. A father tries to make his new lover into the image of his late wife. A lusty photographer confronts his own mortality. A couple’s long-anticipated anniversary vacation opens onto the past. A husband, a wife, a child, a boating accident: no harm done . . . and yet? Each of the twelve stories reveals another element in the agonizing nature of passion, diminished and yet sustained over time. This is a powerful work of fiction from one of our most gifted and subtle international writers at work today.From the Hardcover edition. About the AuthorOlaf Olafsson was born in Reykjavík, Iceland, in 1962. He studied physics as a Wien Scholar at Brandeis University. The author of three novels–The Journey Home, Absolution and Walking into the Night–he lives in New York City with his wife and three children.From the Hardcover edition.About IcebergThe Iceberg Reader revolutionizes the reading experience, making it easier than ever to browse, buy and enjoy books.Features- Attractive interface provides a natural reading experience with full pagination.- Table of Contents incorporates one click navigation.- Vertical and horizontal page orientation.- Adjust font size with a pinch, text reflows automatically.- Search the text within a book.- Create margin notes with user notation.About Knopf Doubleday Publishing GroupRandom House, Inc., the world's largest English-language trade book publisher, publishes many of the foremost & most popular fiction & nonfiction authors in hardcover, trade & mass market paperback, audio, electronic, digital & other formats.
