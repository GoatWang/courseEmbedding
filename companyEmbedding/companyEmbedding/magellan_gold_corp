Welcome to Magellan Gold Corporation | (OTCBB: MAGE)




Skip to main content


















































































































Welcome to Magellan Gold Corporation


Magellan Gold Corporation (OTCQB: MAGE) intends to establish itself as a major player in the precious metals mining field. The Company’s goal is to produce significant cash flow from precious metals holdings while creating a portfolio of quality exploration and development projects that will ensure future revenue growth.

Magellan recently acquired an option to purchase the operating SDA Mill in the State of Nayarit, Mexico. The SDA Mill is a flotation plant with a precious metals leach circuit that has been in commercial operation for ten years. Acquisition of this facility will transform Magellan into a gold production company. Following the purchase, Magellan’s strategy is to increase production and build cash flow, which will make the Company self-supporting and provide the basis for future growth.
Magellan’s flagship advanced exploration project is its 100% owned district-scale Silver District Project in southwest Arizona. Historical drilling delineated 16 million ounces of silver plus fluorspar available for open pit mining. Potential for resource expansion is excellent and the Company intends to carry out additional drilling.
Magellan recently announced a 50% earn-in on the Niñobamba Silver/Gold Project in central Peru owned by Rio Silver Inc. (TSX.V: RYO). The project includes an extensive database comprising geological, geochemical, geophysical and drilling data and exhibits promising potential for discovery of large disseminated precious metals deposits. Initial drilling is planned for 2017.
With an exciting gold production facility in its sights, and two quality advanced silver exploration projects in its control, Magellan is poised for significant growth.
Magellan has a small but experienced management team capable of successfully executing the Company’s goals.

RENO, Nevada, June 21, 2016 /PRNewswire/ --
Magellan Gold Corporation (OTCQB:  MAGE) ("Magellan" or "the Company") today announced the launch of its newly designed and updated website, which can be accessed at http://www.magellangoldcorp.com.
 "The new website is meant to reflect Magellan Gold's updated strategic objective of building a mid-tier precious metals exploration and mining company", said Dr. Pierce Carson, CEO. "At the Silver District Project in southwest Arizona, we intend to expand our already substantial resource base containing a historic resource of 16 million ounces of silver. We also plan to acquire additional advanced-stage properties that have tangible promise for development.  
"Our website has a new look and has been redesigned to facilitate navigation among the various sections. We will be updating the site on a regular basis to keep stockholders and interested parties apprised of news and corporate developments," added Carson.
About Magellan Gold Corporation

The Silver District Property in southwest Arizona consists of 94 unpatented lode mining claims, 6 patented lode claims, an Arizona mining lease of 335 acres and 23 unpatented mill site claims, totaling over 2,000 acres.

(TSX.V: RYO) (“Rio Silver”) pursuant to which Magellan has the right to earn an undivided 50% interest in the Niñobamba Silver/Gold Project in central Peru. To earn its 50...% interest, Magellan must spend $2.0 million in exploration over three years. The Niñobamba project is comprised of four concessions that total 31 square kilometers (7,660 acres). As announced September 12, 2016, three of the concessions were recently acquired from a Peruvian company owned jointly by Newmont Mining Corporation and Southern Peru Copper Corporation. “The Niñobamba Silver/Gold Project has all the early indications of a significant, disseminated precious metals system”, said Pierce Carson, CEO. “We are very encouraged by the results of the historical drilling and surface trenching, which returned potential ore grade mineralization over substantial widths. The concessions contain a number of largely untested and open-ended silver and gold anomalies, several of which appear to represent excellent bulk mineable open pit targets. “With the signing of the Definitive Agreement, we can now proceed with local community agreements and drilling permits that will allow for surface exploration and a first phase of drilling. We anticipate drilling in early 2017. We feel our upcoming programs have the potential to demonstrate substantial value and that our shareholders will be duly rewarded.” In connection with the Rio Silver transaction, Magellan is obliged to subscribe to two private placement unit financings in Rio Silver, each for aggregate proceeds of Cdn$75,000. The Company completed the first unit private placement on August 23, 2016. The second unit private placement is expected to close within the next ninety days. 展开Magellan Gold Corporation 分享了 RUMBO MINERO 的帖子 · 2016年8月4日 · RUMBO MINERO · 2016年7月4日 · Las empresas mineras #RioSilver y #MagellanGoldCorporation suscribieron una carta de intención (LOI, por su siglas en inglés) para la participación de 50% de la... propiedad #MineraNiñobamba, ubicada en la región de Ayacucho, por el pago de US$ 2 millones en un período de tres años en la #exploración y desarrollo de los gastos directos e indirectos relacionados con la propiedad #Ninobamba, 展开Rio Silver y Magellan Gold firman acuerdo por NiñobambaTambién se indicó que el proyecto de plata Niñobamba tiene una extensión de 900 hectáreas y su mineralización indicaría un potencial de gran tonelaje.rumbominero.comMagellan Gold Corporation 分享了 OTC Penny Stock Community 的帖子 · 2016年8月4日 · OTC Penny Stock Community · 2016年6月2日 · Magellan Gold Corporation (MAGE: OTCQB) | Magellan Gold Corporation Appoints Senior Mining Executive as President and CEO #otc #otcmarketsMagellan Gold Corporation Appoints Senior Mining Executive as President and CEO - OTCMarkets.comView complete news release for Magellan+Gold+Corporation+Appoints+Senior+Mining+Executive+as+President+and+CEO - OTCMarkets.comwww.otcmarkets.comMagellan Gold Corporation 分享了 RUMBO MINERO 的帖子 · 2016年8月4日 · RUMBO MINERO · 2016年7月4日 · Las empresas mineras #RioSilver y #MagellanGoldCorporation suscribieron una carta de intención (LOI, por su siglas en inglés) para la participación de 50% de la... propiedad #MineraNiñobamba, ubicada en la región de Ayacucho, por el pago de US$ 2 millones en un período de tres años en la #exploración y desarrollo de los gastos directos e indirectos relacionados con la propiedad #Ninobamba, 展开Rio Silver y Magellan Gold firman acuerdo por NiñobambaTambién se indicó que el proyecto de plata Niñobamba tiene una extensión de 900 hectáreas y su mineralización indicaría un potencial de gran tonelaje.rumbominero.comMagellan Gold Corporation 更换了封面照片 · 2016年8月4日 · Magellan Gold Corporation 更换了头像 · 2016年8月4日 · Magellan Gold Corporation 更换了头像 · 2016年8月4日 · 更多
