Early life[edit]
Malek was born in Berwyn, Illinois of Czech and Croatian descent,[4][5] the son of a beer truck driver.[1] He was raised in Chicago. He graduated with a Bachelor of Science from West Point in 1959,[6] and served in Vietnam with Army Special Forces as an airborne ranger. He received his M.B.A. degree from Harvard Business School in 1964 and worked as a management consultant for McKinsey & Co.. He and two classmates made a pact to purchase a business together; two would work and support the third while he scouted out opportunities. In 1967, he left McKinsey and, with his partners, purchased Triangle Corp., a struggling hand tool manufacturing company in Orangeburg, South Carolina.[6][7]
Political career[edit]
Nixon administration[edit]
Malek served in the Nixon administration in several different roles, including Deputy Under Secretary of the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare under Secretary Robert Finch, as special assistant from 1970–73 and deputy director of Nixon's re-election campaign.[8] Malek served as deputy chief of the Committee to Re-elect the President in 1972.[9]
As an efficiency expert to Nixon, Malek helped restructure Nixon's staff and officials and streamline the bureaucracy.[10] In his memoirs, Nixon described Malek as a "tough young businessman whose specialty was organization and management."[11]
In the first Nixon administration, Malek designed and directed the "Responsiveness Program", a strategy to replace civil servants with Nixon supporters and to steer government resources to benefit Nixon's 1972 re-election.[12][13][14] According to the Senate Watergate report, Malek wrote in a 1972 memo to Haldeman that someone was needed to "take the lead in the program to politicize Departments and Agencies" and to "supervise the patronage operation and closely monitor the grantmanship operation."[15] In advocating the plan, Malek wrote of "substantial risks" to politicizing the Executive Branch and expressed concern that the plan would "undoubtably backfire" if made public; therefore he recommended that "to minimize any links to the President, there should be no directions on this project in writing."[16]
As an advisor to President Nixon, Malek played a significant role in the early days of the Environmental Protection Agency, earning credit from William Ruckelshaus, the agency’s first Administrator, and others for helping to ensure that EPA had outstanding top people in its ranks.[17]
Malek was sworn in as Deputy Director of the Office of Management and Budget on February 2, 1973 and served until 1975 when he resigned to re-enter the private sector.
BLS controversy[edit]
In 1971, Richard Nixon became convinced the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) had come under the control of Democratic rivals and what Nixon termed a "Jewish cabal." He instructed aides Charles Colson and H. R. Haldeman to identify a list of Democrats and "important Jewish officials" at the agency.[18]
Malek provided the data on Democrats after a check of voter registration rolls, but balked at fulfilling the rest of Nixon's query. "I refused four times. The fifth time he came back and gave me a direct order through Haldeman, so I gave him a number. I regret my compliance. It was a mistake."[19] Malek did not have access to BLS employees' religious affiliations, so his list comprised those BLS employees with "Jewish-sounding names", and two months after he sent the list, two of the officials on it were reassigned to "less visible jobs" within the Labor Dept.[20] Slate columnist Timothy Noah, however, asserts that a September 8, 1971 memo from Malek to Haldeman appears to contradict Malek's assertions of limited involvement, in which Malek states he has recommended to the Secretary of Labor "fairly drastic moves" including the "compromise" reassignment of three officials. Documents released by the Nixon library in January 2010 also appear to contradict Malek's statement.[18][21][22]
Seymour D. Reich, chairman of Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations during the 1990s, said "Malek made a mistake 18 years ago when he agreed to a regrettable request by President Nixon." But he added, Malek "has taken pains to assure the Jewish community that he realizes his error and that he intended no harm. I believe he is sincere."[23] In 2010, Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Ca.) called Malek "a man of high principle" who "has proved many times over the years his loyalty to the highest principles of freedom, human rights and international tolerance.".[24] On December 15, 2014 Malek received the Anti Defamation League's Achievement award during a ceremony in Washington, DC.[25]
Bush administration[edit]
In September 1989, Malek was appointed by President Bush to coordinate plans for the 1990 economic summit of industrialized nations. The appointment was seen as a test of whether Malek could successfully serve in the administration. Malek had been a deputy chairman of the RNC in charge of the national convention in 1988 and was said to be "on track" for chief of staff in the Bush White House, but resigned to dissasociate the Vice President from negative publicity from the Nixon administration controversy.[26]
Malek served as Director of the 1990 Economic Summit of Industrialized Nations where he was responsible for the preparation and staging of the event.[27]
The appointment proved a success, and in 1992 Bush appointed Fred Malek campaign manager for his re-election. Malek was "responsible for nuts-and-bolts daily management." Malek ran the campaign with fundraiser Robert Mosbacher and pollster Robert Teeter out of a rented office in downtown Washington.[28]
Malek also served as co-chairman of the finance committee for John McCain in 2008,[29] raising $500,000 for his presidential campaign.[30]
American Action Network[edit]
Malek is founder, chairman and one of three primary financial supporters of the American Action Network, a 501(c)(4) center-right think tank established in January 2010 to promote policies based on the principles of freedom, limited government, and strong national security.
Republican Governors Association[edit]
Malek also chairs the Executive roundtable meetings of the Republican Governors Association, an organization supporting the election of Republican governors.[31] In 2012 it was announced that Malek agreed to serve as the Republican Governors Association's Finance Chairman.[32] Before gubernatorial elections in 2013 and 2014, the RGA, under Malek's leadership, outpaced the Democratic Governors Association by about $10 million.[33]
Business career[edit]
Marriott Corp.[edit]
In 1975, Fred Malek joined the board of Bethesda-based Marriott Corp., where he oversaw Marriott's hotel business, its design and construction division, and Sun Line Cruises. He was elected executive vice president of Marriott in March 1978, adding to his duties oversight of Marriott's contract food services group.[34] Under Malek's oversight of the hotel and resort division from 1981 to 1988, earnings increased nearly fourfold, or 18 percent a year, during a period that encompassed a recession, industry overbuilding and profit declines by competitors.[35]
In early 1989, Malek joined the Carlyle Group as a senior adviser. On April 19, 1989, he led a group of investors to purchase the Coldwell Banker Commercial Group, the nation's largest commercial real estate services company, from Sears, Roebuck and Company at a price estimated at $300 million.
Northwest Airlines[edit]
Malek soon joined Los Angeles investor Al Checchi and Marriott's Gary Wilson in a $3.65 billion, all-cash purchase of Northwest Airlines. The investor group, including representatives of the Bass brothers, and Bankers Trust New York Corp. was joined in the leveraged buyout by KLM Royal Dutch Airlines and Elders IXL, which contributed $480 million in equity. Malek and Checchi joined the airline's 10-member board.[36] Checchi named Malek as president to replace president and CEO John Horn, and the two split the chairman duties held by Steven Rothmeier.[37]
In July 1989, Malek and a group of Carlyle investors bought Marriott's leading airline catering division for an estimated price of $650 million.[38] From January 1, 2002 to December 31, 2005, Malek was a member of the Board of Directors of Fannie Mae.[39]
Thayer Lodging Group[edit]
Founded in 1991, Malek and Leland Pilsbury are the two founding partners of Thayer Lodging Group. The US Military Academy at West Point's Thayer Hotel is a 151-room "Historic Hotel of America" property located 50 miles north of New York City on the banks of the Hudson River at 674 Thayer Road in West Point, New York on the campus of the USMA. It is named after Sylvanus Thayer, West Point class of 1808, the "father of the Military Academy." Thayer has a lengthy and successful track record: since forming its first private equity fund in 1991, Thayer has completed 41 hotel investments with a total acquisition cost of approximately $2.4 billion.[40] Thayer’s funds currently own a portfolio of 14 hotels and 3,637 guest rooms and, through its investment in Interstate, have ownership interests in 64 hotels with 11,655 guest rooms.[40] On July 1, 2013 Thayer acquired Ritz Carlton-San Francisco to the delight of Malek, who said, "we hope to replicate the success of our Orlando Grand Lakes Ritz Carlton, one of our highest return investments."[41]
On May 21, 2014, Thayer Lodging Group announced its acquisition by Brookfield Asset Management.[42] Thayer continues to own the hotels it acquired during the years prior to its partnership with Brookfield. Malek continues to be actively involved in Thayer's day-to-day operations.[43]
SEC administrative action[edit]
On August 12, 2003, the SEC filed a civil fraud lawsuit[44] against former Connecticut state Senate Majority Leader William DiBella for participating in a fraudulent scheme to invest $75 million of the state pension funds with Malek's firm, Thayer Capital Partners.[44][45] The SEC said that Thayer failed to disclose payments to DiBella who performed "no meaningful work" and was hired by Thayer at the request of the state treasurer.[46] On May 18, 2007, DiBella and North Cove were found liable for aiding and abetting Silvester's intentional violations of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Thayer was found in negligence of Investment Advisers Act of 1940. Thayer paid a civil penalty of $150,000, and Malek personally paid a fine of $100,000.[47]
Virginia government reform commission[edit]
On May 7, 2010, Virginia Governor Robert McDonnell appointed Malek to chair a 31-member commission to find efficiencies and savings in government.[29] Critics objected to Malek's appointment based on both the BLS and SEC administrative action and McDonnell responded that he did not know of these parts of Malek's past.[21][46][48][49]
American Friends of the Czech Republic[edit]
Malek, of Czech descent, is the Chairman of the American Friends of the Czech Republic.[50] Following the April 17th, 2013 explosion that left West, TX devastated, Malek and the Friends of the Czech Republic donated substantial funds to help put the town of primarily Czech descent back on its feet; the group even sponsored an essay contest for two children to travel on an all expenses paid trip to the Czech Republic.[51][52] Following unprecedented flooding in Prague and nearby villages in early June, 2013, Malek traveled to the city to meet with Ambassador Norm Eisen and local officials to pledge aid and discuss ways to help the region recover.[53]
Major League Baseball[edit]
Malek was a co-owner in the Texas Rangers along with former President George W. Bush and other investors. After selling his stake in the team, Malek earned his money back fivefold.[54]
Malek played a major role in recruiting the Montreal Expos franchise to Washington, D.C.[55] Working alongside city leaders, Malek set up the Washington Baseball Club, an investment group with partners that included Jeff Zients, Steve Porter, Paul Wolff, Frank Raines, Jim Kimsey, Colin Powell, Vernon Jordan and David Bradley.[56]
Other work[edit]
In 2008, Malek was nominated to the Board of Visitors of the United States Military Academy at West Point by the President of the United States at the time, George W. Bush.[57] He was the 2011 Chairman of this board.[58] He has been a philanthropic support of West Point, underwriting the Malek Tennis Center. “Harvard was extraordinarily helpful in teaching me to analyze problems on a purely academic front," Malek has said. "It did more than that, actually. But in terms of overall effect, it was not even close to the U.S. Military Academy in making me who I am. West Point builds the entire structure of the man, the values of the man. It develops you in the whole.”[6]
On Tuesday, May 29, 2012, Marymount University celebrated the formal renaming of its School of Health Professions in honor of Fred and Marlene Malek. Mrs. Marlene Malek graduated from the school in 1979 and is a member of the Marymount Board of Trustees. The School of Health Professions was renamed "Malek School of Health Professions" to honor the Maleks' ongoing commitment to Marymount University.[59]
Fred and Marlene Malek were honored with the Outstanding Philanthropist Award by the Association of Fundraising Professionals’ Washington, DC, Metro Area Chapter at their National Capital Philanthropy Day in 2012.[60]
Personal life[edit]
Malek is married to Marlene A. Malek. They have two children, and reside in McLean, Virginia.[61]
In 1959, at age 22, Malek was arrested along with five other men in Vicary's Park near Peoria, Illinois, after police found their car spattered with blood, and a dog that had been skinned, gutted and spitted over a barbecue pit in the park. Malek and the other men were charged with cruelty to animals, but the charges against Malek were dropped after one of the others confessed to killing the dog and said he acted alone. Malek has claimed that he did not participate in the incident.[45]
Malek is a "fitness fanatic" who has kept up healthy habits since West Point. A skiing accident in the mid-1980s left Malek with an artificial hip, which forced him to switch from running to lifting weights, swimming and bicycling.[35]

Early life[edit]
Malek was born in Berwyn, Illinois of Czech and Croatian descent,[4][5] the son of a beer truck driver.[1] He was raised in Chicago. He graduated with a Bachelor of Science from West Point in 1959,[6] and served in Vietnam with Army Special Forces as an airborne ranger. He received his M.B.A. degree from Harvard Business School in 1964 and worked as a management consultant for McKinsey & Co.. He and two classmates made a pact to purchase a business together; two would work and support the third while he scouted out opportunities. In 1967, he left McKinsey and, with his partners, purchased Triangle Corp., a struggling hand tool manufacturing company in Orangeburg, South Carolina.[6][7]
Political career[edit]
Nixon administration[edit]
Malek served in the Nixon administration in several different roles, including Deputy Under Secretary of the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare under Secretary Robert Finch, as special assistant from 1970–73 and deputy director of Nixon's re-election campaign.[8] Malek served as deputy chief of the Committee to Re-elect the President in 1972.[9]
As an efficiency expert to Nixon, Malek helped restructure Nixon's staff and officials and streamline the bureaucracy.[10] In his memoirs, Nixon described Malek as a "tough young businessman whose specialty was organization and management."[11]
In the first Nixon administration, Malek designed and directed the "Responsiveness Program", a strategy to replace civil servants with Nixon supporters and to steer government resources to benefit Nixon's 1972 re-election.[12][13][14] According to the Senate Watergate report, Malek wrote in a 1972 memo to Haldeman that someone was needed to "take the lead in the program to politicize Departments and Agencies" and to "supervise the patronage operation and closely monitor the grantmanship operation."[15] In advocating the plan, Malek wrote of "substantial risks" to politicizing the Executive Branch and expressed concern that the plan would "undoubtably backfire" if made public; therefore he recommended that "to minimize any links to the President, there should be no directions on this project in writing."[16]
As an advisor to President Nixon, Malek played a significant role in the early days of the Environmental Protection Agency, earning credit from William Ruckelshaus, the agency’s first Administrator, and others for helping to ensure that EPA had outstanding top people in its ranks.[17]
Malek was sworn in as Deputy Director of the Office of Management and Budget on February 2, 1973 and served until 1975 when he resigned to re-enter the private sector.
BLS controversy[edit]
In 1971, Richard Nixon became convinced the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) had come under the control of Democratic rivals and what Nixon termed a "Jewish cabal." He instructed aides Charles Colson and H. R. Haldeman to identify a list of Democrats and "important Jewish officials" at the agency.[18]
Malek provided the data on Democrats after a check of voter registration rolls, but balked at fulfilling the rest of Nixon's query. "I refused four times. The fifth time he came back and gave me a direct order through Haldeman, so I gave him a number. I regret my compliance. It was a mistake."[19] Malek did not have access to BLS employees' religious affiliations, so his list comprised those BLS employees with "Jewish-sounding names", and two months after he sent the list, two of the officials on it were reassigned to "less visible jobs" within the Labor Dept.[20] Slate columnist Timothy Noah, however, asserts that a September 8, 1971 memo from Malek to Haldeman appears to contradict Malek's assertions of limited involvement, in which Malek states he has recommended to the Secretary of Labor "fairly drastic moves" including the "compromise" reassignment of three officials. Documents released by the Nixon library in January 2010 also appear to contradict Malek's statement.[18][21][22]

Reich, chairman of Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations during the 1990s, said "Malek made a mistake 18 years ago when he agreed to a regrettable request by President Nixon." But he added, Malek "has taken pains to assure the Jewish community that he realizes his error and that he intended no harm. I believe he is sincere."[23] In 2010, Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Ca.) called Malek "a man of high principle" who "has proved many times over the years his loyalty to the highest principles of freedom, human rights and international tolerance.".[24] On December 15, 2014 Malek received the Anti Defamation League's Achievement award during a ceremony in Washington, DC.[25]
Bush administration[edit]
In September 1989, Malek was appointed by President Bush to coordinate plans for the 1990 economic summit of industrialized nations. The appointment was seen as a test of whether Malek could successfully serve in the administration. Malek had been a deputy chairman of the RNC in charge of the national convention in 1988 and was said to be "on track" for chief of staff in the Bush White House, but resigned to dissasociate the Vice President from negative publicity from the Nixon administration controversy.[26]
Malek served as Director of the 1990 Economic Summit of Industrialized Nations where he was responsible for the preparation and staging of the event.[27]
The appointment proved a success, and in 1992 Bush appointed Fred Malek campaign manager for his re-election. Malek was "responsible for nuts-and-bolts daily management." Malek ran the campaign with fundraiser Robert Mosbacher and pollster Robert Teeter out of a rented office in downtown Washington.[28]
Malek also served as co-chairman of the finance committee for John McCain in 2008,[29] raising $500,000 for his presidential campaign.[30]
American Action Network[edit]
Malek is founder, chairman and one of three primary financial supporters of the American Action Network, a 501(c)(4) center-right think tank established in January 2010 to promote policies based on the principles of freedom, limited government, and strong national security.
Republican Governors Association[edit]
Malek also chairs the Executive roundtable meetings of the Republican Governors Association, an organization supporting the election of Republican governors.[31] In 2012 it was announced that Malek agreed to serve as the Republican Governors Association's Finance Chairman.[32] Before gubernatorial elections in 2013 and 2014, the RGA, under Malek's leadership, outpaced the Democratic Governors Association by about $10 million.[33]
Business career[edit]
Marriott Corp.[edit]
In 1975, Fred Malek joined the board of Bethesda-based Marriott Corp., where he oversaw Marriott's hotel business, its design and construction division, and Sun Line Cruises. He was elected executive vice president of Marriott in March 1978, adding to his duties oversight of Marriott's contract food services group.[34] Under Malek's oversight of the hotel and resort division from 1981 to 1988, earnings increased nearly fourfold, or 18 percent a year, during a period that encompassed a recession, industry overbuilding and profit declines by competitors.[35]
In early 1989, Malek joined the Carlyle Group as a senior adviser. On April 19, 1989, he led a group of investors to purchase the Coldwell Banker Commercial Group, the nation's largest commercial real estate services company, from Sears, Roebuck and Company at a price estimated at $300 million.
Northwest Airlines[edit]
Malek soon joined Los Angeles investor Al Checchi and Marriott's Gary Wilson in a $3.65 billion, all-cash purchase of Northwest Airlines. The investor group, including representatives of the Bass brothers, and Bankers Trust New York Corp. was joined in the leveraged buyout by KLM Royal Dutch Airlines and Elders IXL, which contributed $480 million in equity. Malek and Checchi joined the airline's 10-member board.[36] Checchi named Malek as president to replace president and CEO John Horn, and the two split the chairman duties held by Steven Rothmeier.[37]
In July 1989, Malek and a group of Carlyle investors bought Marriott's leading airline catering division for an estimated price of $650 million.[38] From January 1, 2002 to December 31, 2005, Malek was a member of the Board of Directors of Fannie Mae.[39]
Thayer Lodging Group[edit]
Founded in 1991, Malek and Leland Pilsbury are the two founding partners of Thayer Lodging Group. The US Military Academy at West Point's Thayer Hotel is a 151-room "Historic Hotel of America" property located 50 miles north of New York City on the banks of the Hudson River at 674 Thayer Road in West Point, New York on the campus of the USMA. It is named after Sylvanus Thayer, West Point class of 1808, the "father of the Military Academy." Thayer has a lengthy and successful track record: since forming its first private equity fund in 1991, Thayer has completed 41 hotel investments with a total acquisition cost of approximately $2.4 billion.[40] Thayer’s funds currently own a portfolio of 14 hotels and 3,637 guest rooms and, through its investment in Interstate, have ownership interests in 64 hotels with 11,655 guest rooms.[40] On July 1, 2013 Thayer acquired Ritz Carlton-San Francisco to the delight of Malek, who said, "we hope to replicate the success of our Orlando Grand Lakes Ritz Carlton, one of our highest return investments."[41]
On May 21, 2014, Thayer Lodging Group announced its acquisition by Brookfield Asset Management.[42] Thayer continues to own the hotels it acquired during the years prior to its partnership with Brookfield. Malek continues to be actively involved in Thayer's day-to-day operations.[43]
SEC administrative action[edit]
On August 12, 2003, the SEC filed a civil fraud lawsuit[44] against former Connecticut state Senate Majority Leader William DiBella for participating in a fraudulent scheme to invest $75 million of the state pension funds with Malek's firm, Thayer Capital Partners.[44][45] The SEC said that Thayer failed to disclose payments to DiBella who performed "no meaningful work" and was hired by Thayer at the request of the state treasurer.[46] On May 18, 2007, DiBella and North Cove were found liable for aiding and abetting Silvester's intentional violations of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Thayer was found in negligence of Investment Advisers Act of 1940. Thayer paid a civil penalty of $150,000, and Malek personally paid a fine of $100,000.[47]
Virginia government reform commission[edit]
On May 7, 2010, Virginia Governor Robert McDonnell appointed Malek to chair a 31-member commission to find efficiencies and savings in government.[29] Critics objected to Malek's appointment based on both the BLS and SEC administrative action and McDonnell responded that he did not know of these parts of Malek's past.[21][46][48][49]
American Friends of the Czech Republic[edit]
Malek, of Czech descent, is the Chairman of the American Friends of the Czech Republic.[50] Following the April 17th, 2013 explosion that left West, TX devastated, Malek and the Friends of the Czech Republic donated substantial funds to help put the town of primarily Czech descent back on its feet; the group even sponsored an essay contest for two children to travel on an all expenses paid trip to the Czech Republic.[51][52] Following unprecedented flooding in Prague and nearby villages in early June, 2013, Malek traveled to the city to meet with Ambassador Norm Eisen and local officials to pledge aid and discuss ways to help the region recover.[53]
Major League Baseball[edit]
Malek was a co-owner in the Texas Rangers along with former President George W. Bush and other investors. After selling his stake in the team, Malek earned his money back fivefold.[54]
Malek played a major role in recruiting the Montreal Expos franchise to Washington, D.C.[55] Working alongside city leaders, Malek set up the Washington Baseball Club, an investment group with partners that included Jeff Zients, Steve Porter, Paul Wolff, Frank Raines, Jim Kimsey, Colin Powell, Vernon Jordan and David Bradley.[56]
Other work[edit]
In 2008, Malek was nominated to the Board of Visitors of the United States Military Academy at West Point by the President of the United States at the time, George W. Bush.[57] He was the 2011 Chairman of this board.[58] He has been a philanthropic support of West Point, underwriting the Malek Tennis Center. “Harvard was extraordinarily helpful in teaching me to analyze problems on a purely academic front," Malek has said. "It did more than that, actually. But in terms of overall effect, it was not even close to the U.S. Military Academy in making me who I am. West Point builds the entire structure of the man, the values of the man. It develops you in the whole.”[6]
On Tuesday, May 29, 2012, Marymount University celebrated the formal renaming of its School of Health Professions in honor of Fred and Marlene Malek. Mrs. Marlene Malek graduated from the school in 1979 and is a member of the Marymount Board of Trustees. The School of Health Professions was renamed "Malek School of Health Professions" to honor the Maleks' ongoing commitment to Marymount University.[59]
Fred and Marlene Malek were honored with the Outstanding Philanthropist Award by the Association of Fundraising Professionals’ Washington, DC, Metro Area Chapter at their National Capital Philanthropy Day in 2012.[60]
Personal life[edit]
Malek is married to Marlene A. Malek. They have two children, and reside in McLean, Virginia.[61]
In 1959, at age 22, Malek was arrested along with five other men in Vicary's Park near Peoria, Illinois, after police found their car spattered with blood, and a dog that had been skinned, gutted and spitted over a barbecue pit in the park. Malek and the other men were charged with cruelty to animals, but the charges against Malek were dropped after one of the others confessed to killing the dog and said he acted alone. Malek has claimed that he did not participate in the incident.[45]
Malek is a "fitness fanatic" who has kept up healthy habits since West Point. A skiing accident in the mid-1980s left Malek with an artificial hip, which forced him to switch from running to lifting weights, swimming and bicycling.[35]

Early life[edit]
Malek was born in Berwyn, Illinois of Czech and Croatian descent,[4][5] the son of a beer truck driver.[1] He was raised in Chicago. He graduated with a Bachelor of Science from West Point in 1959,[6] and served in Vietnam with Army Special Forces as an airborne ranger. He received his M.B.A. degree from Harvard Business School in 1964 and worked as a management consultant for McKinsey & Co.. He and two classmates made a pact to purchase a business together; two would work and support the third while he scouted out opportunities. In 1967, he left McKinsey and, with his partners, purchased Triangle Corp., a struggling hand tool manufacturing company in Orangeburg, South Carolina.[6][7]
Political career[edit]
Nixon administration[edit]
Malek served in the Nixon administration in several different roles, including Deputy Under Secretary of the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare under Secretary Robert Finch, as special assistant from 1970–73 and deputy director of Nixon's re-election campaign.[8] Malek served as deputy chief of the Committee to Re-elect the President in 1972.[9]
As an efficiency expert to Nixon, Malek helped restructure Nixon's staff and officials and streamline the bureaucracy.[10] In his memoirs, Nixon described Malek as a "tough young businessman whose specialty was organization and management."[11]
In the first Nixon administration, Malek designed and directed the "Responsiveness Program", a strategy to replace civil servants with Nixon supporters and to steer government resources to benefit Nixon's 1972 re-election.[12][13][14] According to the Senate Watergate report, Malek wrote in a 1972 memo to Haldeman that someone was needed to "take the lead in the program to politicize Departments and Agencies" and to "supervise the patronage operation and closely monitor the grantmanship operation."[15] In advocating the plan, Malek wrote of "substantial risks" to politicizing the Executive Branch and expressed concern that the plan would "undoubtably backfire" if made public; therefore he recommended that "to minimize any links to the President, there should be no directions on this project in writing."[16]
As an advisor to President Nixon, Malek played a significant role in the early days of the Environmental Protection Agency, earning credit from William Ruckelshaus, the agency’s first Administrator, and others for helping to ensure that EPA had outstanding top people in its ranks.[17]
Malek was sworn in as Deputy Director of the Office of Management and Budget on February 2, 1973 and served until 1975 when he resigned to re-enter the private sector.
BLS controversy[edit]
In 1971, Richard Nixon became convinced the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) had come under the control of Democratic rivals and what Nixon termed a "Jewish cabal." He instructed aides Charles Colson and H. R. Haldeman to identify a list of Democrats and "important Jewish officials" at the agency.[18]
Malek provided the data on Democrats after a check of voter registration rolls, but balked at fulfilling the rest of Nixon's query. "I refused four times. The fifth time he came back and gave me a direct order through Haldeman, so I gave him a number. I regret my compliance. It was a mistake."[19] Malek did not have access to BLS employees' religious affiliations, so his list comprised those BLS employees with "Jewish-sounding names", and two months after he sent the list, two of the officials on it were reassigned to "less visible jobs" within the Labor Dept.[20] Slate columnist Timothy Noah, however, asserts that a September 8, 1971 memo from Malek to Haldeman appears to contradict Malek's assertions of limited involvement, in which Malek states he has recommended to the Secretary of Labor "fairly drastic moves" including the "compromise" reassignment of three officials. Documents released by the Nixon library in January 2010 also appear to contradict Malek's statement.[18][21][22]
Seymour D. Reich, chairman of Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations during the 1990s, said "Malek made a mistake 18 years ago when he agreed to a regrettable request by President Nixon." But he added, Malek "has taken pains to assure the Jewish community that he realizes his error and that he intended no harm. I believe he is sincere."[23] In 2010, Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Ca.) called Malek "a man of high principle" who "has proved many times over the years his loyalty to the highest principles of freedom, human rights and international tolerance.".[24] On December 15, 2014 Malek received the Anti Defamation League's Achievement award during a ceremony in Washington, DC.[25]
Bush administration[edit]
In September 1989, Malek was appointed by President Bush to coordinate plans for the 1990 economic summit of industrialized nations. The appointment was seen as a test of whether Malek could successfully serve in the administration. Malek had been a deputy chairman of the RNC in charge of the national convention in 1988 and was said to be "on track" for chief of staff in the Bush White House, but resigned to dissasociate the Vice President from negative publicity from the Nixon administration controversy.[26]
Malek served as Director of the 1990 Economic Summit of Industrialized Nations where he was responsible for the preparation and staging of the event.[27]
The appointment proved a success, and in 1992 Bush appointed Fred Malek campaign manager for his re-election. Malek was "responsible for nuts-and-bolts daily management." Malek ran the campaign with fundraiser Robert Mosbacher and pollster Robert Teeter out of a rented office in downtown Washington.[28]
Malek also served as co-chairman of the finance committee for John McCain in 2008,[29] raising $500,000 for his presidential campaign.[30]
American Action Network[edit]
Malek is founder, chairman and one of three primary financial supporters of the American Action Network, a 501(c)(4) center-right think tank established in January 2010 to promote policies based on the principles of freedom, limited government, and strong national security.
Republican Governors Association[edit]
Malek also chairs the Executive roundtable meetings of the Republican Governors Association, an organization supporting the election of Republican governors.[31] In 2012 it was announced that Malek agreed to serve as the Republican Governors Association's Finance Chairman.[32] Before gubernatorial elections in 2013 and 2014, the RGA, under Malek's leadership, outpaced the Democratic Governors Association by about $10 million.[33]
Business career[edit]
Marriott Corp.[edit]
In 1975, Fred Malek joined the board of Bethesda-based Marriott Corp., where he oversaw Marriott's hotel business, its design and construction division, and Sun Line Cruises. He was elected executive vice president of Marriott in March 1978, adding to his duties oversight of Marriott's contract food services group.[34] Under Malek's oversight of the hotel and resort division from 1981 to 1988, earnings increased nearly fourfold, or 18 percent a year, during a period that encompassed a recession, industry overbuilding and profit declines by competitors.[35]
In early 1989, Malek joined the Carlyle Group as a senior adviser. On April 19, 1989, he led a group of investors to purchase the Coldwell Banker Commercial Group, the nation's largest commercial real estate services company, from Sears, Roebuck and Company at a price estimated at $300 million.
Northwest Airlines[edit]
Malek soon joined Los Angeles investor Al Checchi and Marriott's Gary Wilson in a $3.65 billion, all-cash purchase of Northwest Airlines. The investor group, including representatives of the Bass brothers, and Bankers Trust New York Corp. was joined in the leveraged buyout by KLM Royal Dutch Airlines and Elders IXL, which contributed $480 million in equity. Malek and Checchi joined the airline's 10-member board.[36] Checchi named Malek as president to replace president and CEO John Horn, and the two split the chairman duties held by Steven Rothmeier.[37]
In July 1989, Malek and a group of Carlyle investors bought Marriott's leading airline catering division for an estimated price of $650 million.[38] From January 1, 2002 to December 31, 2005, Malek was a member of the Board of Directors of Fannie Mae.[39]
Thayer Lodging Group[edit]
Founded in 1991, Malek and Leland Pilsbury are the two founding partners of Thayer Lodging Group. The US Military Academy at West Point's Thayer Hotel is a 151-room "Historic Hotel of America" property located 50 miles north of New York City on the banks of the Hudson River at 674 Thayer Road in West Point, New York on the campus of the USMA. It is named after Sylvanus Thayer, West Point class of 1808, the "father of the Military Academy." Thayer has a lengthy and successful track record: since forming its first private equity fund in 1991, Thayer has completed 41 hotel investments with a total acquisition cost of approximately $2.4 billion.[40] Thayer’s funds currently own a portfolio of 14 hotels and 3,637 guest rooms and, through its investment in Interstate, have ownership interests in 64 hotels with 11,655 guest rooms.[40] On July 1, 2013 Thayer acquired Ritz Carlton-San Francisco to the delight of Malek, who said, "we hope to replicate the success of our Orlando Grand Lakes Ritz Carlton, one of our highest return investments."[41]
On May 21, 2014, Thayer Lodging Group announced its acquisition by Brookfield Asset Management.[42] Thayer continues to own the hotels it acquired during the years prior to its partnership with Brookfield. Malek continues to be actively involved in Thayer's day-to-day operations.[43]
SEC administrative action[edit]
On August 12, 2003, the SEC filed a civil fraud lawsuit[44] against former Connecticut state Senate Majority Leader William DiBella for participating in a fraudulent scheme to invest $75 million of the state pension funds with Malek's firm, Thayer Capital Partners.[44][45] The SEC said that Thayer failed to disclose payments to DiBella who performed "no meaningful work" and was hired by Thayer at the request of the state treasurer.[46] On May 18, 2007, DiBella and North Cove were found liable for aiding and abetting Silvester's intentional violations of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Thayer was found in negligence of Investment Advisers Act of 1940. Thayer paid a civil penalty of $150,000, and Malek personally paid a fine of $100,000.[47]
Virginia government reform commission[edit]
On May 7, 2010, Virginia Governor Robert McDonnell appointed Malek to chair a 31-member commission to find efficiencies and savings in government.[29] Critics objected to Malek's appointment based on both the BLS and SEC administrative action and McDonnell responded that he did not know of these parts of Malek's past.[21][46][48][49]
American Friends of the Czech Republic[edit]
Malek, of Czech descent, is the Chairman of the American Friends of the Czech Republic.[50] Following the April 17th, 2013 explosion that left West, TX devastated, Malek and the Friends of the Czech Republic donated substantial funds to help put the town of primarily Czech descent back on its feet; the group even sponsored an essay contest for two children to travel on an all expenses paid trip to the Czech Republic.[51][52] Following unprecedented flooding in Prague and nearby villages in early June, 2013, Malek traveled to the city to meet with Ambassador Norm Eisen and local officials to pledge aid and discuss ways to help the region recover.[53]
Major League Baseball[edit]
Malek was a co-owner in the Texas Rangers along with former President George W. Bush and other investors. After selling his stake in the team, Malek earned his money back fivefold.[54]
Malek played a major role in recruiting the Montreal Expos franchise to Washington, D.C.[55] Working alongside city leaders, Malek set up the Washington Baseball Club, an investment group with partners that included Jeff Zients, Steve Porter, Paul Wolff, Frank Raines, Jim Kimsey, Colin Powell, Vernon Jordan and David Bradley.[56]
Other work[edit]
In 2008, Malek was nominated to the Board of Visitors of the United States Military Academy at West Point by the President of the United States at the time, George W. Bush.[57] He was the 2011 Chairman of this board.[58] He has been a philanthropic support of West Point, underwriting the Malek Tennis Center. “Harvard was extraordinarily helpful in teaching me to analyze problems on a purely academic front," Malek has said. "It did more than that, actually. But in terms of overall effect, it was not even close to the U.S. Military Academy in making me who I am. West Point builds the entire structure of the man, the values of the man. It develops you in the whole.”[6]
On Tuesday, May 29, 2012, Marymount University celebrated the formal renaming of its School of Health Professions in honor of Fred and Marlene Malek. Mrs. Marlene Malek graduated from the school in 1979 and is a member of the Marymount Board of Trustees. The School of Health Professions was renamed "Malek School of Health Professions" to honor the Maleks' ongoing commitment to Marymount University.[59]
Fred and Marlene Malek were honored with the Outstanding Philanthropist Award by the Association of Fundraising Professionals’ Washington, DC, Metro Area Chapter at their National Capital Philanthropy Day in 2012.[60]
Personal life[edit]
Malek is married to Marlene A. Malek. They have two children, and reside in McLean, Virginia.[61]
In 1959, at age 22, Malek was arrested along with five other men in Vicary's Park near Peoria, Illinois, after police found their car spattered with blood, and a dog that had been skinned, gutted and spitted over a barbecue pit in the park. Malek and the other men were charged with cruelty to animals, but the charges against Malek were dropped after one of the others confessed to killing the dog and said he acted alone. Malek has claimed that he did not participate in the incident.[45]
Malek is a "fitness fanatic" who has kept up healthy habits since West Point. A skiing accident in the mid-1980s left Malek with an artificial hip, which forced him to switch from running to lifting weights, swimming and bicycling.[35]

Early life[edit]
Malek was born in Berwyn, Illinois of Czech and Croatian descent,[4][5] the son of a beer truck driver.[1] He was raised in Chicago. He graduated with a Bachelor of Science from West Point in 1959,[6] and served in Vietnam with Army Special Forces as an airborne ranger. He received his M.B.A. degree from Harvard Business School in 1964 and worked as a management consultant for McKinsey & Co.. He and two classmates made a pact to purchase a business together; two would work and support the third while he scouted out opportunities. In 1967, he left McKinsey and, with his partners, purchased Triangle Corp., a struggling hand tool manufacturing company in Orangeburg, South Carolina.[6][7]
Political career[edit]
Nixon administration[edit]
Malek served in the Nixon administration in several different roles, including Deputy Under Secretary of the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare under Secretary Robert Finch, as special assistant from 1970–73 and deputy director of Nixon's re-election campaign.[8] Malek served as deputy chief of the Committee to Re-elect the President in 1972.[9]
As an efficiency expert to Nixon, Malek helped restructure Nixon's staff and officials and streamline the bureaucracy.[10] In his memoirs, Nixon described Malek as a "tough young businessman whose specialty was organization and management."[11]
In the first Nixon administration, Malek designed and directed the "Responsiveness Program", a strategy to replace civil servants with Nixon supporters and to steer government resources to benefit Nixon's 1972 re-election.[12][13][14] According to the Senate Watergate report, Malek wrote in a 1972 memo to Haldeman that someone was needed to "take the lead in the program to politicize Departments and Agencies" and to "supervise the patronage operation and closely monitor the grantmanship operation."[15] In advocating the plan, Malek wrote of "substantial risks" to politicizing the Executive Branch and expressed concern that the plan would "undoubtably backfire" if made public; therefore he recommended that "to minimize any links to the President, there should be no directions on this project in writing."[16]
As an advisor to President Nixon, Malek played a significant role in the early days of the Environmental Protection Agency, earning credit from William Ruckelshaus, the agency’s first Administrator, and others for helping to ensure that EPA had outstanding top people in its ranks.[17]
Malek was sworn in as Deputy Director of the Office of Management and Budget on February 2, 1973 and served until 1975 when he resigned to re-enter the private sector.
BLS controversy[edit]
In 1971, Richard Nixon became convinced the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) had come under the control of Democratic rivals and what Nixon termed a "Jewish cabal." He instructed aides Charles Colson and H. R. Haldeman to identify a list of Democrats and "important Jewish officials" at the agency.[18]
Malek provided the data on Democrats after a check of voter registration rolls, but balked at fulfilling the rest of Nixon's query. "I refused four times. The fifth time he came back and gave me a direct order through Haldeman, so I gave him a number. I regret my compliance. It was a mistake."[19] Malek did not have access to BLS employees' religious affiliations, so his list comprised those BLS employees with "Jewish-sounding names", and two months after he sent the list, two of the officials on it were reassigned to "less visible jobs" within the Labor Dept.[20] Slate columnist Timothy Noah, however, asserts that a September 8, 1971 memo from Malek to Haldeman appears to contradict Malek's assertions of limited involvement, in which Malek states he has recommended to the Secretary of Labor "fairly drastic moves" including the "compromise" reassignment of three officials. Documents released by the Nixon library in January 2010 also appear to contradict Malek's statement.[18][21][22]
Seymour D. Reich, chairman of Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations during the 1990s, said "Malek made a mistake 18 years ago when he agreed to a regrettable request by President Nixon." But he added, Malek "has taken pains to assure the Jewish community that he realizes his error and that he intended no harm. I believe he is sincere."[23] In 2010, Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Ca.) called Malek "a man of high principle" who "has proved many times over the years his loyalty to the highest principles of freedom, human rights and international tolerance.".[24] On December 15, 2014 Malek received the Anti Defamation League's Achievement award during a ceremony in Washington, DC.[25]
Bush administration[edit]
In September 1989, Malek was appointed by President Bush to coordinate plans for the 1990 economic summit of industrialized nations. The appointment was seen as a test of whether Malek could successfully serve in the administration. Malek had been a deputy chairman of the RNC in charge of the national convention in 1988 and was said to be "on track" for chief of staff in the Bush White House, but resigned to dissasociate the Vice President from negative publicity from the Nixon administration controversy.[26]
Malek served as Director of the 1990 Economic Summit of Industrialized Nations where he was responsible for the preparation and staging of the event.[27]
The appointment proved a success, and in 1992 Bush appointed Fred Malek campaign manager for his re-election. Malek was "responsible for nuts-and-bolts daily management." Malek ran the campaign with fundraiser Robert Mosbacher and pollster Robert Teeter out of a rented office in downtown Washington.[28]
Malek also served as co-chairman of the finance committee for John McCain in 2008,[29] raising $500,000 for his presidential campaign.[30]
American Action Network[edit]
Malek is founder, chairman and one of three primary financial supporters of the American Action Network, a 501(c)(4) center-right think tank established in January 2010 to promote policies based on the principles of freedom, limited government, and strong national security.
Republican Governors Association[edit]
Malek also chairs the Executive roundtable meetings of the Republican Governors Association, an organization supporting the election of Republican governors.[31] In 2012 it was announced that Malek agreed to serve as the Republican Governors Association's Finance Chairman.[32] Before gubernatorial elections in 2013 and 2014, the RGA, under Malek's leadership, outpaced the Democratic Governors Association by about $10 million.[33]
Business career[edit]
Marriott Corp.[edit]
In 1975, Fred Malek joined the board of Bethesda-based Marriott Corp., where he oversaw Marriott's hotel business, its design and construction division, and Sun Line Cruises. He was elected executive vice president of Marriott in March 1978, adding to his duties oversight of Marriott's contract food services group.[34] Under Malek's oversight of the hotel and resort division from 1981 to 1988, earnings increased nearly fourfold, or 18 percent a year, during a period that encompassed a recession, industry overbuilding and profit declines by competitors.[35]
In early 1989, Malek joined the Carlyle Group as a senior adviser. On April 19, 1989, he led a group of investors to purchase the Coldwell Banker Commercial Group, the nation's largest commercial real estate services company, from Sears, Roebuck and Company at a price estimated at $300 million.
Northwest Airlines[edit]
Malek soon joined Los Angeles investor Al Checchi and Marriott's Gary Wilson in a $3.65 billion, all-cash purchase of Northwest Airlines. The investor group, including representatives of the Bass brothers, and Bankers Trust New York Corp. was joined in the leveraged buyout by KLM Royal Dutch Airlines and Elders IXL, which contributed $480 million in equity. Malek and Checchi joined the airline's 10-member board.[36] Checchi named Malek as president to replace president and CEO John Horn, and the two split the chairman duties held by Steven Rothmeier.[37]
In July 1989, Malek and a group of Carlyle investors bought Marriott's leading airline catering division for an estimated price of $650 million.[38] From January 1, 2002 to December 31, 2005, Malek was a member of the Board of Directors of Fannie Mae.[39]
Thayer Lodging Group[edit]
Founded in 1991, Malek and Leland Pilsbury are the two founding partners of Thayer Lodging Group. The US Military Academy at West Point's Thayer Hotel is a 151-room "Historic Hotel of America" property located 50 miles north of New York City on the banks of the Hudson River at 674 Thayer Road in West Point, New York on the campus of the USMA. It is named after Sylvanus Thayer, West Point class of 1808, the "father of the Military Academy." Thayer has a lengthy and successful track record: since forming its first private equity fund in 1991, Thayer has completed 41 hotel investments with a total acquisition cost of approximately $2.4 billion.[40] Thayer’s funds currently own a portfolio of 14 hotels and 3,637 guest rooms and, through its investment in Interstate, have ownership interests in 64 hotels with 11,655 guest rooms.[40] On July 1, 2013 Thayer acquired Ritz Carlton-San Francisco to the delight of Malek, who said, "we hope to replicate the success of our Orlando Grand Lakes Ritz Carlton, one of our highest return investments."[41]
On May 21, 2014, Thayer Lodging Group announced its acquisition by Brookfield Asset Management.[42] Thayer continues to own the hotels it acquired during the years prior to its partnership with Brookfield. Malek continues to be actively involved in Thayer's day-to-day operations.[43]
SEC administrative action[edit]
On August 12, 2003, the SEC filed a civil fraud lawsuit[44] against former Connecticut state Senate Majority Leader William DiBella for participating in a fraudulent scheme to invest $75 million of the state pension funds with Malek's firm, Thayer Capital Partners.[44][45] The SEC said that Thayer failed to disclose payments to DiBella who performed "no meaningful work" and was hired by Thayer at the request of the state treasurer.[46] On May 18, 2007, DiBella and North Cove were found liable for aiding and abetting Silvester's intentional violations of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Thayer was found in negligence of Investment Advisers Act of 1940. Thayer paid a civil penalty of $150,000, and Malek personally paid a fine of $100,000.[47]
Virginia government reform commission[edit]
On May 7, 2010, Virginia Governor Robert McDonnell appointed Malek to chair a 31-member commission to find efficiencies and savings in government.[29] Critics objected to Malek's appointment based on both the BLS and SEC administrative action and McDonnell responded that he did not know of these parts of Malek's past.[21][46][48][49]
American Friends of the Czech Republic[edit]
Malek, of Czech descent, is the Chairman of the American Friends of the Czech Republic.[50] Following the April 17th, 2013 explosion that left West, TX devastated, Malek and the Friends of the Czech Republic donated substantial funds to help put the town of primarily Czech descent back on its feet; the group even sponsored an essay contest for two children to travel on an all expenses paid trip to the Czech Republic.[51][52] Following unprecedented flooding in Prague and nearby villages in early June, 2013, Malek traveled to the city to meet with Ambassador Norm Eisen and local officials to pledge aid and discuss ways to help the region recover.[53]
Major League Baseball[edit]
Malek was a co-owner in the Texas Rangers along with former President George W. Bush and other investors. After selling his stake in the team, Malek earned his money back fivefold.[54]
Malek played a major role in recruiting the Montreal Expos franchise to Washington, D.C.[55] Working alongside city leaders, Malek set up the Washington Baseball Club, an investment group with partners that included Jeff Zients, Steve Porter, Paul Wolff, Frank Raines, Jim Kimsey, Colin Powell, Vernon Jordan and David Bradley.[56]
Other work[edit]
In 2008, Malek was nominated to the Board of Visitors of the United States Military Academy at West Point by the President of the United States at the time, George W. Bush.[57] He was the 2011 Chairman of this board.[58] He has been a philanthropic support of West Point, underwriting the Malek Tennis Center. “Harvard was extraordinarily helpful in teaching me to analyze problems on a purely academic front," Malek has said. "It did more than that, actually. But in terms of overall effect, it was not even close to the U.S. Military Academy in making me who I am. West Point builds the entire structure of the man, the values of the man. It develops you in the whole.”[6]
On Tuesday, May 29, 2012, Marymount University celebrated the formal renaming of its School of Health Professions in honor of Fred and Marlene Malek. Mrs. Marlene Malek graduated from the school in 1979 and is a member of the Marymount Board of Trustees. The School of Health Professions was renamed "Malek School of Health Professions" to honor the Maleks' ongoing commitment to Marymount University.[59]
Fred and Marlene Malek were honored with the Outstanding Philanthropist Award by the Association of Fundraising Professionals’ Washington, DC, Metro Area Chapter at their National Capital Philanthropy Day in 2012.[60]
Personal life[edit]
Malek is married to Marlene A. Malek. They have two children, and reside in McLean, Virginia.[61]
In 1959, at age 22, Malek was arrested along with five other men in Vicary's Park near Peoria, Illinois, after police found their car spattered with blood, and a dog that had been skinned, gutted and spitted over a barbecue pit in the park. Malek and the other men were charged with cruelty to animals, but the charges against Malek were dropped after one of the others confessed to killing the dog and said he acted alone. Malek has claimed that he did not participate in the incident.[45]
Malek is a "fitness fanatic" who has kept up healthy habits since West Point. A skiing accident in the mid-1980s left Malek with an artificial hip, which forced him to switch from running to lifting weights, swimming and bicycling.[35]

Early life[edit]
Malek was born in Berwyn, Illinois of Czech and Croatian descent,[4][5] the son of a beer truck driver.[1] He was raised in Chicago. He graduated with a Bachelor of Science from West Point in 1959,[6] and served in Vietnam with Army Special Forces as an airborne ranger. He received his M.B.A. degree from Harvard Business School in 1964 and worked as a management consultant for McKinsey & Co.. He and two classmates made a pact to purchase a business together; two would work and support the third while he scouted out opportunities. In 1967, he left McKinsey and, with his partners, purchased Triangle Corp., a struggling hand tool manufacturing company in Orangeburg, South Carolina.[6][7]
Political career[edit]
Nixon administration[edit]
Malek served in the Nixon administration in several different roles, including Deputy Under Secretary of the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare under Secretary Robert Finch, as special assistant from 1970–73 and deputy director of Nixon's re-election campaign.[8] Malek served as deputy chief of the Committee to Re-elect the President in 1972.[9]
As an efficiency expert to Nixon, Malek helped restructure Nixon's staff and officials and streamline the bureaucracy.[10] In his memoirs, Nixon described Malek as a "tough young businessman whose specialty was organization and management."[11]
In the first Nixon administration, Malek designed and directed the "Responsiveness Program", a strategy to replace civil servants with Nixon supporters and to steer government resources to benefit Nixon's 1972 re-election.[12][13][14] According to the Senate Watergate report, Malek wrote in a 1972 memo to Haldeman that someone was needed to "take the lead in the program to politicize Departments and Agencies" and to "supervise the patronage operation and closely monitor the grantmanship operation."[15] In advocating the plan, Malek wrote of "substantial risks" to politicizing the Executive Branch and expressed concern that the plan would "undoubtably backfire" if made public; therefore he recommended that "to minimize any links to the President, there should be no directions on this project in writing."[16]
As an advisor to President Nixon, Malek played a significant role in the early days of the Environmental Protection Agency, earning credit from William Ruckelshaus, the agency’s first Administrator, and others for helping to ensure that EPA had outstanding top people in its ranks.[17]
Malek was sworn in as Deputy Director of the Office of Management and Budget on February 2, 1973 and served until 1975 when he resigned to re-enter the private sector.
BLS controversy[edit]
In 1971, Richard Nixon became convinced the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) had come under the control of Democratic rivals and what Nixon termed a "Jewish cabal." He instructed aides Charles Colson and H. R. Haldeman to identify a list of Democrats and "important Jewish officials" at the agency.[18]
Malek provided the data on Democrats after a check of voter registration rolls, but balked at fulfilling the rest of Nixon's query. "I refused four times. The fifth time he came back and gave me a direct order through Haldeman, so I gave him a number. I regret my compliance. It was a mistake."[19] Malek did not have access to BLS employees' religious affiliations, so his list comprised those BLS employees with "Jewish-sounding names", and two months after he sent the list, two of the officials on it were reassigned to "less visible jobs" within the Labor Dept.[20] Slate columnist Timothy Noah, however, asserts that a September 8, 1971 memo from Malek to Haldeman appears to contradict Malek's assertions of limited involvement, in which Malek states he has recommended to the Secretary of Labor "fairly drastic moves" including the "compromise" reassignment of three officials. Documents released by the Nixon library in January 2010 also appear to contradict Malek's statement.[18][21][22]
Seymour D. Reich, chairman of Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations during the 1990s, said "Malek made a mistake 18 years ago when he agreed to a regrettable request by President Nixon." But he added, Malek "has taken pains to assure the Jewish community that he realizes his error and that he intended no harm. I believe he is sincere."[23] In 2010, Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Ca.) called Malek "a man of high principle" who "has proved many times over the years his loyalty to the highest principles of freedom, human rights and international tolerance.".[24] On December 15, 2014 Malek received the Anti Defamation League's Achievement award during a ceremony in Washington, DC.[25]
Bush administration[edit]
In September 1989, Malek was appointed by President Bush to coordinate plans for the 1990 economic summit of industrialized nations. The appointment was seen as a test of whether Malek could successfully serve in the administration. Malek had been a deputy chairman of the RNC in charge of the national convention in 1988 and was said to be "on track" for chief of staff in the Bush White House, but resigned to dissasociate the Vice President from negative publicity from the Nixon administration controversy.[26]
Malek served as Director of the 1990 Economic Summit of Industrialized Nations where he was responsible for the preparation and staging of the event.[27]
The appointment proved a success, and in 1992 Bush appointed Fred Malek campaign manager for his re-election. Malek was "responsible for nuts-and-bolts daily management." Malek ran the campaign with fundraiser Robert Mosbacher and pollster Robert Teeter out of a rented office in downtown Washington.[28]
Malek also served as co-chairman of the finance committee for John McCain in 2008,[29] raising $500,000 for his presidential campaign.[30]
American Action Network[edit]
Malek is founder, chairman and one of three primary financial supporters of the American Action Network, a 501(c)(4) center-right think tank established in January 2010 to promote policies based on the principles of freedom, limited government, and strong national security.
Republican Governors Association[edit]
Malek also chairs the Executive roundtable meetings of the Republican Governors Association, an organization supporting the election of Republican governors.[31] In 2012 it was announced that Malek agreed to serve as the Republican Governors Association's Finance Chairman.[32] Before gubernatorial elections in 2013 and 2014, the RGA, under Malek's leadership, outpaced the Democratic Governors Association by about $10 million.[33]
Business career[edit]
Marriott Corp.[edit]
In 1975, Fred Malek joined the board of Bethesda-based Marriott Corp., where he oversaw Marriott's hotel business, its design and construction division, and Sun Line Cruises. He was elected executive vice president of Marriott in March 1978, adding to his duties oversight of Marriott's contract food services group.[34] Under Malek's oversight of the hotel and resort division from 1981 to 1988, earnings increased nearly fourfold, or 18 percent a year, during a period that encompassed a recession, industry overbuilding and profit declines by competitors.[35]
In early 1989, Malek joined the Carlyle Group as a senior adviser. On April 19, 1989, he led a group of investors to purchase the Coldwell Banker Commercial Group, the nation's largest commercial real estate services company, from Sears, Roebuck and Company at a price estimated at $300 million.
Northwest Airlines[edit]
Malek soon joined Los Angeles investor Al Checchi and Marriott's Gary Wilson in a $3.65 billion, all-cash purchase of Northwest Airlines. The investor group, including representatives of the Bass brothers, and Bankers Trust New York Corp. was joined in the leveraged buyout by KLM Royal Dutch Airlines and Elders IXL, which contributed $480 million in equity. Malek and Checchi joined the airline's 10-member board.[36] Checchi named Malek as president to replace president and CEO John Horn, and the two split the chairman duties held by Steven Rothmeier.[37]
In July 1989, Malek and a group of Carlyle investors bought Marriott's leading airline catering division for an estimated price of $650 million.[38] From January 1, 2002 to December 31, 2005, Malek was a member of the Board of Directors of Fannie Mae.[39]
Thayer Lodging Group[edit]
Founded in 1991, Malek and Leland Pilsbury are the two founding partners of Thayer Lodging Group. The US Military Academy at West Point's Thayer Hotel is a 151-room "Historic Hotel of America" property located 50 miles north of New York City on the banks of the Hudson River at 674 Thayer Road in West Point, New York on the campus of the USMA. It is named after Sylvanus Thayer, West Point class of 1808, the "father of the Military Academy." Thayer has a lengthy and successful track record: since forming its first private equity fund in 1991, Thayer has completed 41 hotel investments with a total acquisition cost of approximately $2.4 billion.[40] Thayer’s funds currently own a portfolio of 14 hotels and 3,637 guest rooms and, through its investment in Interstate, have ownership interests in 64 hotels with 11,655 guest rooms.[40] On July 1, 2013 Thayer acquired Ritz Carlton-San Francisco to the delight of Malek, who said, "we hope to replicate the success of our Orlando Grand Lakes Ritz Carlton, one of our highest return investments."[41]
On May 21, 2014, Thayer Lodging Group announced its acquisition by Brookfield Asset Management.[42] Thayer continues to own the hotels it acquired during the years prior to its partnership with Brookfield. Malek continues to be actively involved in Thayer's day-to-day operations.[43]
SEC administrative action[edit]
On August 12, 2003, the SEC filed a civil fraud lawsuit[44] against former Connecticut state Senate Majority Leader William DiBella for participating in a fraudulent scheme to invest $75 million of the state pension funds with Malek's firm, Thayer Capital Partners.[44][45] The SEC said that Thayer failed to disclose payments to DiBella who performed "no meaningful work" and was hired by Thayer at the request of the state treasurer.[46] On May 18, 2007, DiBella and North Cove were found liable for aiding and abetting Silvester's intentional violations of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Thayer was found in negligence of Investment Advisers Act of 1940. Thayer paid a civil penalty of $150,000, and Malek personally paid a fine of $100,000.[47]
Virginia government reform commission[edit]
On May 7, 2010, Virginia Governor Robert McDonnell appointed Malek to chair a 31-member commission to find efficiencies and savings in government.[29] Critics objected to Malek's appointment based on both the BLS and SEC administrative action and McDonnell responded that he did not know of these parts of Malek's past.[21][46][48][49]
American Friends of the Czech Republic[edit]
Malek, of Czech descent, is the Chairman of the American Friends of the Czech Republic.[50] Following the April 17th, 2013 explosion that left West, TX devastated, Malek and the Friends of the Czech Republic donated substantial funds to help put the town of primarily Czech descent back on its feet; the group even sponsored an essay contest for two children to travel on an all expenses paid trip to the Czech Republic.[51][52] Following unprecedented flooding in Prague and nearby villages in early June, 2013, Malek traveled to the city to meet with Ambassador Norm Eisen and local officials to pledge aid and discuss ways to help the region recover.[53]
Major League Baseball[edit]
Malek was a co-owner in the Texas Rangers along with former President George W. Bush and other investors. After selling his stake in the team, Malek earned his money back fivefold.[54]
Malek played a major role in recruiting the Montreal Expos franchise to Washington, D.C.[55] Working alongside city leaders, Malek set up the Washington Baseball Club, an investment group with partners that included Jeff Zients, Steve Porter, Paul Wolff, Frank Raines, Jim Kimsey, Colin Powell, Vernon Jordan and David Bradley.[56]
Other work[edit]
In 2008, Malek was nominated to the Board of Visitors of the United States Military Academy at West Point by the President of the United States at the time, George W. Bush.[57] He was the 2011 Chairman of this board.[58] He has been a philanthropic support of West Point, underwriting the Malek Tennis Center. “Harvard was extraordinarily helpful in teaching me to analyze problems on a purely academic front," Malek has said. "It did more than that, actually. But in terms of overall effect, it was not even close to the U.S. Military Academy in making me who I am. West Point builds the entire structure of the man, the values of the man. It develops you in the whole.”[6]
On Tuesday, May 29, 2012, Marymount University celebrated the formal renaming of its School of Health Professions in honor of Fred and Marlene Malek. Mrs. Marlene Malek graduated from the school in 1979 and is a member of the Marymount Board of Trustees. The School of Health Professions was renamed "Malek School of Health Professions" to honor the Maleks' ongoing commitment to Marymount University.[59]
Fred and Marlene Malek were honored with the Outstanding Philanthropist Award by the Association of Fundraising Professionals’ Washington, DC, Metro Area Chapter at their National Capital Philanthropy Day in 2012.[60]
Personal life[edit]
Malek is married to Marlene A. Malek. They have two children, and reside in McLean, Virginia.[61]
In 1959, at age 22, Malek was arrested along with five other men in Vicary's Park near Peoria, Illinois, after police found their car spattered with blood, and a dog that had been skinned, gutted and spitted over a barbecue pit in the park. Malek and the other men were charged with cruelty to animals, but the charges against Malek were dropped after one of the others confessed to killing the dog and said he acted alone. Malek has claimed that he did not participate in the incident.[45]
Malek is a "fitness fanatic" who has kept up healthy habits since West Point. A skiing accident in the mid-1980s left Malek with an artificial hip, which forced him to switch from running to lifting weights, swimming and bicycling.[35]

Early life[edit]
Malek was born in Berwyn, Illinois of Czech and Croatian descent,[4][5] the son of a beer truck driver.[1] He was raised in Chicago. He graduated with a Bachelor of Science from West Point in 1959,[6] and served in Vietnam with Army Special Forces as an airborne ranger. He received his M.B.A. degree from Harvard Business School in 1964 and worked as a management consultant for McKinsey & Co.. He and two classmates made a pact to purchase a business together; two would work and support the third while he scouted out opportunities. In 1967, he left McKinsey and, with his partners, purchased Triangle Corp., a struggling hand tool manufacturing company in Orangeburg, South Carolina.[6][7]
Political career[edit]
Nixon administration[edit]
Malek served in the Nixon administration in several different roles, including Deputy Under Secretary of the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare under Secretary Robert Finch, as special assistant from 1970–73 and deputy director of Nixon's re-election campaign.[8] Malek served as deputy chief of the Committee to Re-elect the President in 1972.[9]
As an efficiency expert to Nixon, Malek helped restructure Nixon's staff and officials and streamline the bureaucracy.[10] In his memoirs, Nixon described Malek as a "tough young businessman whose specialty was organization and management."[11]
In the first Nixon administration, Malek designed and directed the "Responsiveness Program", a strategy to replace civil servants with Nixon supporters and to steer government resources to benefit Nixon's 1972 re-election.[12][13][14] According to the Senate Watergate report, Malek wrote in a 1972 memo to Haldeman that someone was needed to "take the lead in the program to politicize Departments and Agencies" and to "supervise the patronage operation and closely monitor the grantmanship operation."[15] In advocating the plan, Malek wrote of "substantial risks" to politicizing the Executive Branch and expressed concern that the plan would "undoubtably backfire" if made public; therefore he recommended that "to minimize any links to the President, there should be no directions on this project in writing."[16]
As an advisor to President Nixon, Malek played a significant role in the early days of the Environmental Protection Agency, earning credit from William Ruckelshaus, the agency’s first Administrator, and others for helping to ensure that EPA had outstanding top people in its ranks.[17]
Malek was sworn in as Deputy Director of the Office of Management and Budget on February 2, 1973 and served until 1975 when he resigned to re-enter the private sector.
BLS controversy[edit]
In 1971, Richard Nixon became convinced the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) had come under the control of Democratic rivals and what Nixon termed a "Jewish cabal." He instructed aides Charles Colson and H. R. Haldeman to identify a list of Democrats and "important Jewish officials" at the agency.[18]
Malek provided the data on Democrats after a check of voter registration rolls, but balked at fulfilling the rest of Nixon's query. "I refused four times. The fifth time he came back and gave me a direct order through Haldeman, so I gave him a number. I regret my compliance. It was a mistake."[19] Malek did not have access to BLS employees' religious affiliations, so his list comprised those BLS employees with "Jewish-sounding names", and two months after he sent the list, two of the officials on it were reassigned to "less visible jobs" within the Labor Dept.[20] Slate columnist Timothy Noah, however, asserts that a September 8, 1971 memo from Malek to Haldeman appears to contradict Malek's assertions of limited involvement, in which Malek states he has recommended to the Secretary of Labor "fairly drastic moves" including the "compromise" reassignment of three officials. Documents released by the Nixon library in January 2010 also appear to contradict Malek's statement.[18][21][22]
Seymour D. Reich, chairman of Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations during the 1990s, said "Malek made a mistake 18 years ago when he agreed to a regrettable request by President Nixon." But he added, Malek "has taken pains to assure the Jewish community that he realizes his error and that he intended no harm. I believe he is sincere."[23] In 2010, Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Ca.) called Malek "a man of high principle" who "has proved many times over the years his loyalty to the highest principles of freedom, human rights and international tolerance.".[24] On December 15, 2014 Malek received the Anti Defamation League's Achievement award during a ceremony in Washington, DC.[25]
Bush administration[edit]
In September 1989, Malek was appointed by President Bush to coordinate plans for the 1990 economic summit of industrialized nations. The appointment was seen as a test of whether Malek could successfully serve in the administration. Malek had been a deputy chairman of the RNC in charge of the national convention in 1988 and was said to be "on track" for chief of staff in the Bush White House, but resigned to dissasociate the Vice President from negative publicity from the Nixon administration controversy.[26]
Malek served as Director of the 1990 Economic Summit of Industrialized Nations where he was responsible for the preparation and staging of the event.[27]
The appointment proved a success, and in 1992 Bush appointed Fred Malek campaign manager for his re-election. Malek was "responsible for nuts-and-bolts daily management." Malek ran the campaign with fundraiser Robert Mosbacher and pollster Robert Teeter out of a rented office in downtown Washington.[28]
Malek also served as co-chairman of the finance committee for John McCain in 2008,[29] raising $500,000 for his presidential campaign.[30]
American Action Network[edit]
Malek is founder, chairman and one of three primary financial supporters of the American Action Network, a 501(c)(4) center-right think tank established in January 2010 to promote policies based on the principles of freedom, limited government, and strong national security.
Republican Governors Association[edit]
Malek also chairs the Executive roundtable meetings of the Republican Governors Association, an organization supporting the election of Republican governors.[31] In 2012 it was announced that Malek agreed to serve as the Republican Governors Association's Finance Chairman.[32] Before gubernatorial elections in 2013 and 2014, the RGA, under Malek's leadership, outpaced the Democratic Governors Association by about $10 million.[33]
Business career[edit]
Marriott Corp.[edit]
In 1975, Fred Malek joined the board of Bethesda-based Marriott Corp., where he oversaw Marriott's hotel business, its design and construction division, and Sun Line Cruises. He was elected executive vice president of Marriott in March 1978, adding to his duties oversight of Marriott's contract food services group.[34] Under Malek's oversight of the hotel and resort division from 1981 to 1988, earnings increased nearly fourfold, or 18 percent a year, during a period that encompassed a recession, industry overbuilding and profit declines by competitors.[35]
In early 1989, Malek joined the Carlyle Group as a senior adviser. On April 19, 1989, he led a group of investors to purchase the Coldwell Banker Commercial Group, the nation's largest commercial real estate services company, from Sears, Roebuck and Company at a price estimated at $300 million.
Northwest Airlines[edit]
Malek soon joined Los Angeles investor Al Checchi and Marriott's Gary Wilson in a $3.65 billion, all-cash purchase of Northwest Airlines. The investor group, including representatives of the Bass brothers, and Bankers Trust New York Corp. was joined in the leveraged buyout by KLM Royal Dutch Airlines and Elders IXL, which contributed $480 million in equity. Malek and Checchi joined the airline's 10-member board.[36] Checchi named Malek as president to replace president and CEO John Horn, and the two split the chairman duties held by Steven Rothmeier.[37]
In July 1989, Malek and a group of Carlyle investors bought Marriott's leading airline catering division for an estimated price of $650 million.[38] From January 1, 2002 to December 31, 2005, Malek was a member of the Board of Directors of Fannie Mae.[39]
Thayer Lodging Group[edit]
Founded in 1991, Malek and Leland Pilsbury are the two founding partners of Thayer Lodging Group. The US Military Academy at West Point's Thayer Hotel is a 151-room "Historic Hotel of America" property located 50 miles north of New York City on the banks of the Hudson River at 674 Thayer Road in West Point, New York on the campus of the USMA. It is named after Sylvanus Thayer, West Point class of 1808, the "father of the Military Academy." Thayer has a lengthy and successful track record: since forming its first private equity fund in 1991, Thayer has completed 41 hotel investments with a total acquisition cost of approximately $2.4 billion.[40] Thayer’s funds currently own a portfolio of 14 hotels and 3,637 guest rooms and, through its investment in Interstate, have ownership interests in 64 hotels with 11,655 guest rooms.[40] On July 1, 2013 Thayer acquired Ritz Carlton-San Francisco to the delight of Malek, who said, "we hope to replicate the success of our Orlando Grand Lakes Ritz Carlton, one of our highest return investments."[41]
On May 21, 2014, Thayer Lodging Group announced its acquisition by Brookfield Asset Management.[42] Thayer continues to own the hotels it acquired during the years prior to its partnership with Brookfield. Malek continues to be actively involved in Thayer's day-to-day operations.[43]
SEC administrative action[edit]
On August 12, 2003, the SEC filed a civil fraud lawsuit[44] against former Connecticut state Senate Majority Leader William DiBella for participating in a fraudulent scheme to invest $75 million of the state pension funds with Malek's firm, Thayer Capital Partners.[44][45] The SEC said that Thayer failed to disclose payments to DiBella who performed "no meaningful work" and was hired by Thayer at the request of the state treasurer.[46] On May 18, 2007, DiBella and North Cove were found liable for aiding and abetting Silvester's intentional violations of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Thayer was found in negligence of Investment Advisers Act of 1940. Thayer paid a civil penalty of $150,000, and Malek personally paid a fine of $100,000.[47]
Virginia government reform commission[edit]
On May 7, 2010, Virginia Governor Robert McDonnell appointed Malek to chair a 31-member commission to find efficiencies and savings in government.[29] Critics objected to Malek's appointment based on both the BLS and SEC administrative action and McDonnell responded that he did not know of these parts of Malek's past.[21][46][48][49]
American Friends of the Czech Republic[edit]
Malek, of Czech descent, is the Chairman of the American Friends of the Czech Republic.[50] Following the April 17th, 2013 explosion that left West, TX devastated, Malek and the Friends of the Czech Republic donated substantial funds to help put the town of primarily Czech descent back on its feet; the group even sponsored an essay contest for two children to travel on an all expenses paid trip to the Czech Republic.[51][52] Following unprecedented flooding in Prague and nearby villages in early June, 2013, Malek traveled to the city to meet with Ambassador Norm Eisen and local officials to pledge aid and discuss ways to help the region recover.[53]
Major League Baseball[edit]
Malek was a co-owner in the Texas Rangers along with former President George W. Bush and other investors. After selling his stake in the team, Malek earned his money back fivefold.[54]
Malek played a major role in recruiting the Montreal Expos franchise to Washington, D.C.[55] Working alongside city leaders, Malek set up the Washington Baseball Club, an investment group with partners that included Jeff Zients, Steve Porter, Paul Wolff, Frank Raines, Jim Kimsey, Colin Powell, Vernon Jordan and David Bradley.[56]
Other work[edit]
In 2008, Malek was nominated to the Board of Visitors of the United States Military Academy at West Point by the President of the United States at the time, George W. Bush.[57] He was the 2011 Chairman of this board.[58] He has been a philanthropic support of West Point, underwriting the Malek Tennis Center. “Harvard was extraordinarily helpful in teaching me to analyze problems on a purely academic front," Malek has said. "It did more than that, actually. But in terms of overall effect, it was not even close to the U.S. Military Academy in making me who I am. West Point builds the entire structure of the man, the values of the man. It develops you in the whole.”[6]
On Tuesday, May 29, 2012, Marymount University celebrated the formal renaming of its School of Health Professions in honor of Fred and Marlene Malek. Mrs. Marlene Malek graduated from the school in 1979 and is a member of the Marymount Board of Trustees. The School of Health Professions was renamed "Malek School of Health Professions" to honor the Maleks' ongoing commitment to Marymount University.[59]
Fred and Marlene Malek were honored with the Outstanding Philanthropist Award by the Association of Fundraising Professionals’ Washington, DC, Metro Area Chapter at their National Capital Philanthropy Day in 2012.[60]
Personal life[edit]
Malek is married to Marlene A. Malek. They have two children, and reside in McLean, Virginia.[61]
In 1959, at age 22, Malek was arrested along with five other men in Vicary's Park near Peoria, Illinois, after police found their car spattered with blood, and a dog that had been skinned, gutted and spitted over a barbecue pit in the park. Malek and the other men were charged with cruelty to animals, but the charges against Malek were dropped after one of the others confessed to killing the dog and said he acted alone. Malek has claimed that he did not participate in the incident.[45]
Malek is a "fitness fanatic" who has kept up healthy habits since West Point. A skiing accident in the mid-1980s left Malek with an artificial hip, which forced him to switch from running to lifting weights, swimming and bicycling.[35]

The Frederic V. Malek Page


The Frederic V. Malek Page

President Bush's crony, Frederic V. Malek, put him on the board of
directors of a company controlled by The Carlyle Group as a favor to
his father. And in return, according to author Dan Briody, "he sort of
got these favors from the administration in terms of certain FAA
restrictions and things like that for the airline business."
We can figure out the rest. This was at the time that Congress
passed the airline smoking ban. Fred Malek had been a business crony of
anti-smoker Sen. Frank Lautenberg since 1978. He was on the board of
directors of EPA contractor ICF at the time the key chapters of the ETS
report were written via illegal pass-through contracts. He led the
group that took over Northwest Airlines after it banned smoking
(probably with financial inducement from Malek). And, his wife,
Marlene, was on the National Cancer Advisory Board until 1996.
This is how the anti-smokers scored their victories! And the media
have covered it all up.
Malek is the Chairman of Thayer Capital Partners, a merchant bank,
and a past executive vice president of Marriott Corporation. He is a
former Nixon administration official; a longtime business crony of
anti-smoker Sen. Frank Lautenberg; was a director of ICF while it
passed-through its contract for the EPA ETS report, and joined
Northwest Airlines shortly after it instituted its smoking ban. He was
Campaign Manager of the Bush-Quayle campaign in 1992.
"Prior to the formation of Thayer in 1991, Mr. Malek co-led the
buyout of Northwest Airlines and then served as its President and Vice
Chairman, led the buyout of Coldwell Banker Commercial Group, led the
acquisition of the Ritz-Carlton Hotel Company and participated in the
acquisition and ownership of the Texas Rangers baseball team. Before
leading those buyouts, he served as President of Marriott Hotels &
Resorts... Earlier in his career, Mr. Malek was a management
consultant with McKinsey & Co., and in 1967 he co-founded Triangle
Corp., a hand tool manufacturer." (Malek bio, Thayer Capital Partners)
Malek bio /
Thayer Capital Partners
Thayer was "bankrolled by two dozen banks, pension funds and
financial institutions that put up $364 million in capital." Partner
Paul G. Stern was a partner in Forstmann Little & Co. in 1993. "By
then his resume listed stints as chairman of Braun AG in Germany, vice
president for strategic planning and acquisitions of Rockwell
International Corp. and president of Burroughs Corp. He spent four
years as chairman of Canada's Northern Telecom Ltd. before joining
Forstmann... Rick Rickertsen, 38, hooked up with Malek in 1994 after
working at Hancock Park Associates, a Los Angeles venture capital and
buyout firm and Brentwood Associates, the biggest venture capital
investor in Southern California... The principals are backed by a
coterie of apprentice dealmakers -- half a dozen Harvard MBAs -- a
small support staff and a heavyweight advisory board that includes
Washington power lawyer Vernon Jordan; former vice presidential nominee
Jack Kemp; Frank Zarb, chairman of the National Association of
Securities Dealers; Jim Robinson, former chairman of American Express
Co.; and Drew Lewis, former transportation secretary and current
chairman of Union Pacific Corp... Backers include the pension funds of
AT&T Corp., Boeing Co., Textron Inc. and Aluminum Co. of America;
Howard Hughes Medical Institute; Hawaii's Bishop Estate; Travelers
Insurance Co. (now owned by Citigroup); CreditSuisse First Boston; Bank
of Nova Scotia; and Dresdner Bank. There also is one individual
investor -- Roger Penske, the
race car driver turned truck and transportation magnate." (Thayer
Capital Partners - A private equity investment fund where some very big
birds privately nest. By Jerry Knight. Washington Post, June 29, 1998.) Roger S. Penske was a director
of Philip Morris from 1991 to 1998.

Frederic Vincent Malek was the son of a beer salesman in Berwyn,
Illinois. He graduated from U.S. Military Academy in 1959. He served in
Vietnam in the Special Forces, training South Vietnamese
counterinsurgents. He left the Army in 1962 and married Marlene
McArthur of San Francisco, and graduated from the Harvard Graduate
School of Business Administration, and went to work at the management
consultant firm, McKinsey & Co. He and several other consultants
had plans to start their own firm, but one was "drafted by Robert
McNamara to help out at Defense." In 1967, they went into the hand-tool
industry. Malek was personally recruited by HEW Secretary Robert Finch,
"on the advice of a California insurance executive." (Is Health
Planning Too Vital to be Left to MDs? Medical World News, Jul. 31,
1970, pp. 16-18.)

Malek was Chairman of Triangle Corporation, Columbia, SC, from
1967-1969. From 1969 to 1970 he was Deputy Under Secretary of the US
Department of Health, Education and Welfare; Special Assistant to Pres.
Richard Nixon from 1970-73; Deputy Director of the Committee to
Re-Elect the President ("CREEP") in 1972; Deputy Director of the Office
of Management and Budget, 1973-74; Member of the White House Domestic
Council, 1974-75; and in 1975, he left government and became Vice
President of the Marriott Corporation.

"But with the top-level remaining mostly the same, most significant
changes will come at the sub-Cabinet level — the undersecretaries and
assistant deputy secretaries who are really the backbone of the
government. They are the drafters of policy, the innovators, the
nuts-and-bolts men who make the machinery of government churn and who
have caused frustration and anguish to Richard Nixon and all of his
predecessors. He has thought long and hard about how he can make them
more responsive to his wishes. This year, Nixon has served notice that
he is taking unprecedented personal interest in these lower-level
appointments. Whereas in the past a department chairman was able to
arrange his own team, this will no longer be the case. All must have
the approval of the White House and a special office, headed by an
efficiency minded young former business man named Frederic Malek, has
been established to find and approve persons for these posts." Roy L.
Ash replaced Caspar W. Weinberger at the Office of Management and
Budget, while Weinberger took Elliott Richardson's job at Health,
Education and Welfare. (Most Government Shapers Kept During Second
Term. By Eugene V. Risher. Williamsport Sun-Gazette, Dec. 6, 1972.)
Weinberger's 'principal assistant' from 1970 to at least 1973 was William Howard Taft IV
of the Skull & Bones family.

In 1973, Malek's former White House staff assistant for executive
manpower, Barbara
Hackman Franklin, was appointed an original Commissioner and Vice
Chair of the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission. In 1974, the anti-smokers' petitioned the
CPSC to regulate cigarettes.

Roy L. Ash
Malek's boss at the Office of Management and Budget in Aug. 1973 was
Roy L. Ash, for whom the Ash Council was named. The Ash Council created
the Environmental Protection Agency. Until
1972, Ash was the president
of Litton Industries, one of whose numerous divisions, Litton
Bionetics, was in the second year of a $10 million-plus contract to
manage, operate and maintain the National Cancer Institute's Frederick
Cancer Research Center at Fort Detrick, Maryland. (FASEB Newsletter,

Nixon Administration
"The Watergate scandal kept Nixon from fully carrying out his
experiment in control, but his efforts were not forgotten. In fact, E.
Pendleton James, who was in charge of Ronald Reagan's preinaugural
talent search and then became assistant to the president for personnel,
had worked under Fred Malek, Nixon's personnel chief. Malek was the
author of the infamous 'Malek Manual,' a guide to political appointees,
which emphasized a telling message: 'You cannot achieve management,
policy or program control unless you have established political
control.' ...Malek then went on to describe techniques designed to
'skirt around the adverse action proceedings' required to proceed
against civil servants in a legal manner. All were designed 'to remove
undesireable employees from their positions.'" (The President and the
Executive Branch, by Joel D. Aberbach. UCLA Center for American
Politics and Public Policy Occasional Paper Series 9 1-9.) William H.
Taft IV was also a member of the Reagan transition team. (White House

Northwest Airlines
It's a
perfect example of the kind of "free enterprise" practiced by Bush
Republicans (and their Democrat friends): They buy an airline, and then
they don't merely ban smoking on their airline and compete on a level
playing field; no, they use their political connections to ban smoking
on all domestic airlines, so that consumers would have no choice.

"NWA Inc., the parent company of Northwest, was acquired in 1989
(the 'Acquisition') by NWA Corp., a Delaware corporation formed by
Alfred A. Checchi, Gary L. Wilson, Frederic V. Malek, Fosters Brewing
Group Ltd. of Australia ("Fosters"), Bankers Trust New York Corporation
("BTNY"), KLM and
Richard C. Blum & Associates--NWA Partners, L.P. ("Blum") (together
(other than Fosters, which has sold its interest in NWA Corp. to KLM),
the "Original Investors") for the purpose of the Acquisition. As of
July 31, 1996, the Original Investors beneficially owned approximately
46.9% of the common equity representing approximately 46.2% of the
voting equity of NWA Corp." NWA Corp. was originally formed under the
name Wings Holdings Inc. "Seven of the 11 current members of the Board
of Directors are designees under the Stockholders' Agreement: Messrs.
Checchi, Wilson and Malek were designated jointly by the Checchi Family

Malek has been a director of Northwest Airlines since 1989 and was
its president from 1989 to 1990. Thomas L. Kempner of Loeb
Partners, a
nephew of Harvard School of Public Health "benefactor" John L. Loeb,
was on its board from 1989 to 1998, and continues as a Director
Emeritus. Walter F. Mondale, former US Senator from Minnesota, was a
director from 1989 to 1997 and again since 1997. He is also a director
of CNA Financial Corp. (owned by Laurence Tisch's Loews Corp.) and the
Mayo Foundation. Richard C. Blum, a director since 1989, is the husband
of anti-smoker Sen. Dianne
Feinstein, and Kempner is a director of
Richard C. Blum & Associates. The financially-troubled airline
instituted its smoking ban in 1988. Malek contributed money to the
election campaigns of four prominent
national Democrats, including [anti-smoker] Dianne Feinstein, who was
running for the U.S. Senate in Califorinia. "Malek explained that he
made the contributions because these Democrats were his 'friends.'"

Caterair International Inc
"The privately held company, called Caterair International Inc., was
created in 1989 when Marriott Corp. spun off its airline catering
business to investors organized by the Washington investment bank The
Carlyle Group... Carlyle and its investors paid about $570 million for
Marriott's In-Flite Services division, which the hotel wanted sell so
it could concentrate on its core business. The investor group was
headed by Frederic V. Malek, a Carlyle senior advisor who had served as
director of the 1988 Republican convention -- the one that nominated
Vice President George H.W. Bush... It was Malek who suggested that
George W. Bush join
the Caterair board in 1990, according to a 1991
article in the New York Times." (Bush's Fancy Financial Footwork, by
David Ignatius. The Washington Post, Aug. 6, 2002, p. A15.)
Ignatius,
2002 / The Washington Post
(Amy Goodman interview with Dan Briody, author of The Iron Triangle:
Inside the Secret World of the Carlyle Group, July 3, 2003.) AMY
GOODMAN: Can you talk about Fred Malek, who he says came to him when
they were putting the board together of the company, and said, look,
there's a guy who would like to be on the board, he's kind of down on
his luck, needs a job, needs a board position, needs some board
positions, could you put him on the board.
DAN BRIODY: This is a classic kind of cronyism that we see Carlyle
engaging in throughout its history. Fred Malek had a couple pans on the
stove going at one time. At that point in time, he was also chairman of
Northwest Airlines and bear in mind at this point George H.W. Bush was
President of the United States at that time. All these things were
converging at the same time Fred was doing some work for the Carlyle
Group. So he sort of engineered his own personal little triangle trade.
He said he did a favor for George W. Bush to get him on the board of
Caterair after George W. Bush had had some failed business experiences
in the oil industry, which you guys have talked about at length. And so
he put him on the board of Caterair and in return he sort of got these
favors from the administration in terms of certain F.A.A. restrictions
and things like that for the airline business. Those things had nothing
to do with the Carlyle group. Those were personal favors basically for
Fred Malek. And so Fred was able to engineer this brilliant little
triangle trade that it helped -- advantaged him in the sense that it
furthered his airline business and then the airline business was then
able to hire Caterair to do its catering. So it all wraps up very
nicely and Fred Malek of course is the former Nixon aide who was
accused of counting the Jews when Nixon was afraid that the Jews in the
Bureau of Labor & Statistics was undermining him, and that later
came out during George H.W. Bush's campaign for president.
In 1990, Congress banned smoking on all domestic flights.
Dan Briody
interview, July 3, 2003 / Pacifica Radio
Frank Carlucci, a managing director of
the Carlyle Group since 1989,
was an old crony of Malek's from the Nixon days: Carlucci had been
Deputy Director of the Office of Management and Budget from 1970-72,
and Malek held the same post from 1973-74.
J. Willard Marriott Jr.,
President and CEO of the Marriott Corp.
since 1985, joined the board of directors of General Motors in 1989.
Gary L. Wilson
"Gary L. Wilson, the Marriott Corporation's chief financial officer
and
a pioneer in sale-and-leaseback financing, was named executive vice
president and chief financial officer yesterday of Walt Disney
Productions Inc." He was also elected to the Board of Directors of
Disney. "Alfred Checchi, a real estate financing specialist with Bass
Brothers Enterprises who worked with Mr. Wilson for several years at
Marriott, made the initial contact to determine if Mr. Wilson would be
interested in coming to Disney, Mr. Eisner said. Mr. Checchi will
complete six months as a special consultant at Disney later this month,
a Disney spokesman said. The Bass family owns 25 percent of Disney's
stock... Mr. Wilson, who was raised in Alliance, Ohio, was an
executive with a diversified industrial company in Manila, the
Trans-Philippines Investment Corporation, before joining Marriott as
treasurer in 1974... He received an M.B.A. in 1963 from the University
of Pennsylvania and an degree in accounting a year earlier from Duke
University." (Financial Officer Named by Disney. New York Times, Aug.
1, 1985.)
"A co-chairman of Northwest Airlines gave $100,000 to the Republican
Party in August, shortly before the Bush Administration made two
rulings favorable to the financially ailing carrier. The airline
official, Gary L. Wilson, wrote checks on Aug. 18 for $80,000 and
$20,000 to separate accounts maintained by the party, records of the
Federal Election Commission show. The next month, the Administration
approved an agreement with the Netherlands that allows KLM Royal Dutch
Airlines, which owns 49 percent of Northwest's parent company, to fly
to any American market. It was the first such deal with a European
country. Two months after that approval, the Transportation Department
gave preliminary approval to antitrust immunity that Northwest and KLM
needed to merge their services... At Northwest, Mr. Wilson and another
co-chairman, Al Checchi, led a group with KLM that bought the carrier
in 1989, making it private. Mr. Wilson and Mr. Checchi together
invested $40 million, according to public records. The Northwest-KLM
deal briefly surfaced as an issue in the Presidential race because of
Frederick V. Malek, who resigned as the airline's vice chairman to
manage Mr. Bush's campaign... The airline's political action committee
has contributed nearly $160,000 to various Congressional campaigns in
the last two years, twice what it distributed for the 1990 elections.
The airline's board also includes Richard Blum, a San Francisco
investor who gave $25,000 to various Democratic Party committees and
candidates for this year's election, and former Vice President Walter
F. Mondale. 'These guys have both parties covered pretty nicely,' said
Scott Hamilton, an airline analyst." (Airline Ruling Came After
$100,000 Contribution. New York Times, Dec. 6, 1992.)

In 1994, Wilson was caught by X-ray with a small amount of marijuana
and a pipe in his carry-on luggage. He forfeited a $500 bond and paid
$51.50 in court costs on a charge of possession of drug paraphernalia.
A misdemeanor charge of possession of marijuana was dismissed. (Walt
Disney Co. Board Member Settles Pot Case. Orlando Sentinel, Aug 12,
1994.)

"[F]ederal records show that in the years Checchi was at the helm,
Minnesota-based Northwest emerged as one of the most potent political
money machines in the heavily regulated aviation industry, spending
millions to seek tax breaks, win new air routes and obtain relief from
costly proposed federal regulations. From 1991, the earliest year for
which records were readily available, until the spring of 1997, when
Checchi stepped down to seek the Democratic nomination for governor
here, Northwest spent more than $5.6 million lobbying federal lawmakers
and agencies on issues vital to the airline's bottom line, according to
reports filed by the company. During the same period, campaign finance
records show, Northwest's political action committee and its top
executives - including Checchi and his co-chairman, Gary L. Wilson -
donated $1.5 million to politicians, Republicans as well as Democrats,
whose decisions could affect the airline." (High-flying politics
Candidate Al Checchi opposes special interest money, but his airline
paid out plenty. By Lance Williams. San Francisco Examiner, Nov. 30,
1997.)

The entire financial elite of Boston seems to be propping up the
airline: FMR Corp 11.5%, Wellington Management Company 9.0%, State
Street Bank & Trust Company 8.0%; also Marathon Asset Management
Ltd, London 6.0%, and Deutsche Bank AG (the new owners of the Bankers
Trust) 5.7%. Malek was still a director. Anti-smoker former Michigan
governor John Engler has been a director since 2003.

"Wilson said, I am leaving the Board because I believe in term
limits and because my other business interests do not allow me
sufficient time to continue leading the Board. Roy Bostock is a great
leader who will invest the time and energy required to lead the Board
and to help the management team create shareholder value. I have been
associated with Northwest Airlines since 1989 and am extremely proud of
the extraordinary accomplishments of this very resilient organization.
Our industry never fully recovered from the economic impact of 9/11 and

losses that could only be resolved in bankruptcy." (Northwest Airlines

associated propaganda blitz! 
"According to a
study fielded by the National Restaurant Association in January, 1993,

Former Governor William F. Weld of
Massachusetts

The Handbook on Smoking Laws & Regulations for Massachusetts
Communities prepared under Gov. Weld fraudulently claimed that "The
United States EPA states that secondhand smoke is a known cause of lung
cancer." In fact, the EPA report hadn't been approved, it wasn't
official, and preliminary drafts bore little resemblance to the report
that was eventually released a year and a half later. Furthermore,
these drafts were all prominently emblazoned with the words, DO NOT CITE OR QUOTE.

Health. (Handbook on Smoking Laws & Regulations for Massachusetts
Communities. Prepared by Martha C. Wood, Assistant Director, Office for
Nonsmoking and Health. Revised Aug. 1991.)

Marlene and Fred Malek were members of the Weld Committee, which
held a cocktail reception at the home of C. Boyden Gray, Apr. 20, 1993.
A handwritten note gushed that "Bill Weld deserves our support. As
Governor of Massachusetts, a State where just 14% of registered voters
are Republicans, he is proving that Republican principles work."
(Invitation from the Weld Committee to Samuel D. Chilcote of the
Tobacco Institute. The Friends of William F. Weld, Apr. 2, 1993.)

Friends of William F. Weld, 1993 / UCSF (pdf, 9 pp)
William F. Weld, Harvard 1966, was the grandson of Francis Minot White [Harvard
1897], the founder of White, Weld & Company. He married Susan, the
daughter of Quentin Roosevelt.
(Susan Roosevelt Is
Wed on L.I. New York Times, Jun. 8, 1975.) His cousin, Ogden White, also a partner of
White, Weld, & Co., was a director of Liggett & Myers Tobacco
in the 1960s.

Malek in the Tobacco Documents
Malek was designated by Pres. George HW Bush to serve as Director of
the 1990 Houston Economic Summit. They contacted Philip Morris for
donations. According to a May 16, 1990, memo from Jim Dyer of PM to Guy
Smith of PM: "I have been contacted by Fred Malek and his staff, all of
whom are currently planning the 1990 Houston Economic Summit on July 9
thru 11, in Houston. They are soliciting corporate sponsors, donations
of food for their food tent and sponsorship of one of their special
events. In return for sponsorship we would get publicity, free tickets
and the opportunity to show off our products. If we contribute cash, I
would suggest a minimum donation of $25,000. I have taken the liberty
of sharing their food needs with our food company representatives in
D.C." Malek was also campaign manager of the Bush-Quayle campaign in
1992.

Dyer to Smith
Memo, 1990 / UCSF (pdf, 1 p)
The anti-smoking lie-mongers have deliberately inserted their own
words to falsely claim that it "give[s] advice on how to use political
contributions to help head off a tax increase: ' I have been contacted
by Fred Malek (a Bush political advisor) and his staff, all of who
[sic] are currently planning the 1990 Houston Economic Summit on July 9
through 11..." The inserted words, in parentheses, constitute the only
"evidence" of "advice on how to use political contributions to help
head off a tax increase"! This garbage was recited by Timothy L.
Grollmes, who is employed by the Nebraska Health and Human Services
System, Tobacco-Free Nebraska Program. Furthermore, it is cited by link
by two alleged professors of economics at Arizona State University,
Michael Melvin and William Boyes, in their textbook site on the
Houghton Mifflin website. And it is interesting that Robert L.
Friedman, a director of Houghton Mifflin Holdings, was elected a
director of Northwest Airlines in 2002.

Fifth Edition / Houghton Mifflin
Ties to Colin Powell
"Powell's phenomenal popularity with American soldiers, who are good
if fallible judges of military leadership, also suggests that part of
him is, as advertised, the simple soldier. But there is also clearly a
very different side to Powell, that of the superb Washington operator
who rose with breathtaking speed from a White House fellowship through
positions on the Army staff to the very pinnacle of the national
security bureaucracy. Here, as in his more conventional military
career, he had his mentors and friends who helped him along, and it is
instructive to see who they were. Among the earliest was Fred Malek,
Deputy Director of the Office of Management and Budget and one of
President Nixon's 'hatchet men' (as Powell himself puts it). Malek's
ambition, of which Powell clearly approved, 'was to gain control over
the bureaucracy for the White House,' not to pursue any particular
doctrine or policy. From Malek's maneuvering 'emerged one of my rules:
you don't know what you can get away with until you try." (Playing
Powell Politics: The General's Zest for Power, by Eliot A. Cohen.
Foreign Affairs, Nov/Dec 1995.) The disinformation here is that there
is no ideology behind these people. Malek is clearly motivated by
health fascism.
Cohen,
1995 / Foreign Affairs
Ties to Kenneth Lay
Fred Malek was one of the mourners at the funeral of Kenneth Lay,
the former Enron executive who looted
thousands of peoples' pension
funds. Access was granted only to those whose names appeared on the
guest list. (Lay remembered as a giving family man. By Shelby Hodge.
Houston Chronicle, May 10, 2006.)

Marlene A. Malek
Marlene Anne McArthur of Alameda, Cal., married Frederic V. Malek in
1961. Fred's sister, Martha (Marcie) Malek, was junior bridesmaid.
(Justweds First Home in Hawaii. Oakland Tribune, Sep. 8, 1961.)
She is the president of Friends of Cancer
Research. Founded in 1996, its board of directors includes Deborah L.
Dingell, President of the GM Foundation; Sam Donaldson, Chief

The Presidential  historical materials of Frederic V. Malek, White House Special Assistant for Personnel, are in the custody of the National Archives and Records Administration under the provisions of Title I of the Presidential  Recordings and Materials Preservation Act of 1974 (P.L. 93-526, 88 Stat. 1695) and implementing regulations.  In accordance with the act and regulations, archivists reviewed the file group to identify personal and private materials as well as nonhistorical items.  No personal and private materials were identified, but nonhistorical materials have been returned to Malek.
Materials covered by the act have been archivally processed and are described in this register.  Items which are security classified or otherwise restricted under the act and regulations have been removed and placed in a closed file.  A Document Withdrawal Record (GSA Form 7279) with a description of each restricted document has been inserted at the beginning of each folder from which materials have been removed.  A Document Control Record marks the original position of the withdrawn item.
Employees of the National Archives will review periodically the unclassified portions of closed materials for the purpose of opening those which no longer require restriction.  Certain classified documents may be declassified under authority of Executive Order 13526 in response to a Mandatory Review Request (NA Form 14020) submitted by the researcher.

Scope and Content Note
As White House Special Assistant for Personnel during the years 1970 to 1973, Frederic V. Malek became Richard M. Nixon's chief talent scout.  Recruiting highly qualified candidates for Presidential  and other high-level appointive positions, Malek tried to bring "executive suite" personnel practices to the upper echelons of the executive branch.  In his role as chief talent scout, Malek worked closely with the Office of Management and Budget and the White House personnel office.  One of the major goals of Malek's talent search was to locate and to recruit highly qualified Afro-Americans for top managerial posts in the Nixon administration.  Malek left his personnel post on January 10, 1973, to assume the position of Deputy Director of the Office of Management and Budget.
The materials are arranged into one series:

Subject Files

There is a broad topical arrangement which includes specific government offices, agencies, commissions, and boards as well as general areas such as employment, job placements, resume referrals, foreign aid reform, and judgeships.  Most of the information contained in the files pertains to employment recommendations, appointments, and evaluations.
Additional important areas discussed in the subject files are revenue sharing, the summer intern program of the executive branch, executive-congressional relations, State-Federal regulations, and a national strategy to improve the status of the elderly.  Civil Service reform and the implementation of an executive development program within the executive branch were also high priorities for Malek.
In order to facilitate his talent search, Malek corresponded with numerous individuals.  Available correspondence reflects his contacts with corporate executives, business leaders, White House staff members, other high-level government officials, Congressmen, and university officials and professors.  A few of the more prominent correspondents include Chairman Robert E. Hampton of the Civil Service Commission, Senator Margaret Chase Smith, Senator High Scott, Senator Jacob Javits, Rose Mary Woods, and H. R. Haldeman.
