Andria Jokhtaberidze

 




Andria Jokhtaberidze      


Consultant (M&A), Magticom
 

"Coming from a financial background, I have always admired the Graham/Buffet strategies of investing. As I am following the value investing approach for my investments, once I discovered the opportunity to attend Professor Greenwald’s (aka 'guru of all gurus at Wall Street') Value Investing program, I instantly jumped at the opportunity. Having read a plethora of books on value investing, including Professor Greenwald’s, I wanted to challenge and dig further into the concepts and expand my knowledge through discussions.
"All the concepts I learned during the program will be implemented during my investment analysis. The short-term program offered insights and discussions into strategies that will make tremendous difference in my valuations. To site a simple example, during a class, Professor Greenwald convinced the entire auditorium about an investment without even mentioning a simple number but by analyzing business as it stands on its own."







Francisco Errandonea

 




Francisco Errandonea      


Head of Equities, Santander Corredores de Bolsa
 

"In just three days, I learned more on valuation than a couple of years in university, plus more than a decade of work experience."







Thomas Digenan

 




Thomas Digenan      


Head of US Intrinsic Value Equity, UBS Global Asset Management
 

"Professor Greenwald communicates his investing genius in a clear analytical and very entertaining manner. This course should be required for all value investors."







Sheldon Goldman

 




Sheldon Goldman      


CEO & CIO, S Goldman Advisors LLC
 

"Value Investing appeals – who doesn't want to buy $1.00 for $0.50? The trick is learning how to do this and acquiring tools for understanding the difference between "cheaper" and "cheap." Professor Greenwald has wisdom and infinite patience in sharing his tools with us."







Bruce Robertson

 




Bruce Robertson

Investment Capabilities



For more than four decades, Mesirow Financial has provided institutional caliber equity investment strategies. Today we focus exclusively on small cap and small-mid cap investing for institutional investors. Our expertise in this domain gives us confidence that we can deliver superior results with less risk by participating in up markets and protecting capital in down markets.


 Small Cap Solutions
We offer small cap and small-mid cap strategies to institutional investors who utilize them to complete a well-planned asset allocation.


Our Strategies


 Investment Professionals
Our investment professionals have extensive experience in the field of investing. They work together as a team to provide superior results.


Our Team








Competitive Advantages


Alignment of Interests
We are an employee owned enterprise that is deeply committed to providing outstanding service and exceeding our clients’ expectations. All of the investment team members are invested in our small cap value strategy. Our success is closely aligned with our clients’ success.


Disciplined Investment Process
We employ the same investment process for both our strategies. Our buy discipline leads us to purchase attractively valued, higher quality stocks. Our clearly defined sell discipline ensures that we only own stocks where we have high conviction. Both our buy and sell disciplines help us to actively manage and mitigate risk in the portfolio.


Holistic Thought Process
A key differentiator is our use of top down macroeconomic analysis to identify trends that will likely provide tailwinds to stocks that have exposure to specific end markets. The use of a top down overlay in a small cap strategy is very uncommon. We believe it helps us identify better opportunities with a greater chance of investment success.


Institutional Stability
Our strategies are most appropriate for long-term institutional investors who prefer returns that are materially better than the market with substantially less risk than the market. We also appeal to investors who prefer or need to have greater capital preservation in down markets due to expected nonprofit spending policies or retirement benefit payments.








Unique Perspective



Small Cap Perspectives

Our perspective on the small cap market is distinct because we understand the nuances of investing in small cap companies. Please enjoy our Small Cap Perspectives newsletter. It is where we share observations on the global investment environment and how events could influence US equities and in particular, US small cap stocks.

Our Perspective


Quarterly Commentary

On a quarterly basis, we provide our general thoughts and observations on what took place during the quarter and why those events are relevant to investors.

Our Strategies


Investment Philosophy
We believe the key to generating superior investment returns is the selection of investment opportunities that possess attractive valuations and demonstrate identifiable catalysts that are expected to generate accelerating earnings and cash flow growth.
We believe that having an understanding of macroeconomic data and events will help us identify developing themes and trends that may affect end markets, both positively and negatively. We believe that top-down analysis serves as a compass that may lead us to areas of the market that will benefit from the current macroeconomic environment and avoid areas that may struggle under current market conditions.
We believe that this philosophy leads us to investments that will produce attractive risk-adjusted returns that consistently outperform the market with less risk.
Portfolio Strategy
We look for macroeconomic data and events to provide clues that may lead to opportunities across sectors, industries and end markets. Then we apply rigorous bottom-up fundamental analysis on each opportunity, selecting only the best ideas where we have the highest conviction. We place an emphasis on quality and we look for high or improving ROIC, strong financial flexibility and proven management teams. Portfolios are constructed with 70-90 positions and are purposefully diversified by security and sector to help manage and mitigate risk.

The Russell 2000 Index® offers investors access to the small-cap segment of the U.S. equity universe. The Russell 2000 is constructed to provide a comprehensive and unbiased small-cap barometer and is completely reconstituted annually to ensure larger stocks do not distort the performance and characteristics of the true small-cap opportunity set. The Russell 2000 includes the smallest 2000 securities in the Russell 3000 (The Russell 3000® Index measures the performance of the 3,000 largest U.S. companies based on total market capitalization, which represents approximately 98% of the investable U.S. equity market). The Russell 2000 Value Index® offers investors access to the small-cap value segment of the U.S. equity universe. The Russell 2000 Value is constructed to provide a comprehensive and unbiased barometer of the small-cap value market. Based on ongoing empirical research of investment manager behavior, the methodology used to determine value probability approximates the aggregate small-cap value manager’s opportunity set. (Source: Russell).
The Russell 2500 Index measures the performance of the small to mid-cap segment of the U.S. equity universe, commonly referred to as “smid” cap. The Russell 2500 Index is a subset of the Russell 3000® Index. It includes approximately 2500 of the smallest securities based on a combination of their market cap and current index membership. The Russell 2500 Value Index measures the performance of the small to mid-cap value segment of the U.S. equity universe. It includes those Russell 2500 companies with lower price-to-book ratios and lower forecasted growth values. The Russell 2500 Index is constructed to provide a comprehensive and unbiased barometer for the small to mid-cap segment. Both Indices are completely reconstituted annually to ensure large stocks do not distort the performance and characteristics of the true small to mid-cap opportunity set and that the represented companies continue to reflect value characteristics.

Mesirow Financial is an employee-owned financial services company with operations in 17 U.S. states, London and Hong Kong. The firm's investment management division primarily serves institutional investors, offering a range of traditional and alternative investment strategies to meet the diverse needs of corporate clients, pension funds, charitable foundations, and other public- and private-sector institutions. The investment management division also offers wealth management and investment advisory services to individuals and families.
As of Dec. 31, 2015, Mesirow Financial reported $96.8 billion in total worldwide assets under management (AUM). Institutional investment products account for the vast majority of the firm's AUM, including $65.6 billion in its currency management products. Only about 4% of AUM is associated with the firm's wealth advisory and retirement planning business. Apart from its investment management services, Mesirow Financial also offers a range of broker-dealer services, insurance consulting services, investment banking services and other financial services primarily for institutional and corporate clients.
Product Overview
Mesirow Financial's currency management products serve a diverse corporate and institutional clientele across North America, Europe and Australia. The firm offers both passive and active strategies to manage currency risk, and each strategy is ultimately tailored to meet the specific currency exposures and risk objectives of individual clients. The firm has offered customized currency management strategies since 1995 and has deep experience delivering results through diverse market environments and all along the risk-return spectrum. Mesirow Financial's currency management business accounts for nearly 68% of its worldwide AUM.
Mesirow Advanced Strategies, Inc. is a wholly owned subsidiary of Mesirow Financial focused on multimanager hedge fund strategies. The business unit manages $12.9 billion in assets for institutional investors around the world, nearly 14% of its parent's total AUM. Customized portfolio solutions account for nearly two-thirds of the unit's business. Other options include single-strategy solutions such as equity hedge strategies, distressed security strategies and event-driven strategies.
Mesirow Financial's fixed-income team offers a variety of strategies across major bond market sectors. Fixed-income strategies account for $4.5 billion in AUM, making it Mesirow Financial's third-largest investment management unit. Mesirow Financial Private Equity, an operating unit founded in 1982, offers partnership funds with independent U.S. private equity managers in the United States and Europe. The unit specializes in diversified funds that provide coverage across private equity asset classes and geographies. It also offers a co-investment strategy targeting smaller-market buyouts and growth equity financing opportunities. The unit reports $3.7 billion in AUM as of Sept. 30, 2015.
Executive Leadership
Richard S. Price has served as chairman and chief executive officer (CEO) at Mesirow Financial since 2011. He also serves on the board of directors. Price joined the firm in 1972 to assist in the establishment of the firm's insurance services business. In 1982, he was named president of insurance services at the firm. In 2006, Price took on the role of president and chief operating officer (COO).
Michael Miranda is senior managing director and chief investment officer (CIO) for the currency management division at Mesirow Financial. Miranda has served as CIO since 2014.

Miranda completed his undergraduate education at Northwestern University before earning an MBA degree at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business. He holds the chartered financial analyst (CFA) designation.
Tom Macina is CEO of Mesirow Advanced Strategies. He also serves on the Mesirow Financial board of directors.

Andria Jokhtaberidze      


Consultant (M&A), Magticom
 

"Coming from a financial background, I have always admired the Graham/Buffet strategies of investing. As I am following the value investing approach for my investments, once I discovered the opportunity to attend Professor Greenwald’s (aka 'guru of all gurus at Wall Street') Value Investing program, I instantly jumped at the opportunity. Having read a plethora of books on value investing, including Professor Greenwald’s, I wanted to challenge and dig further into the concepts and expand my knowledge through discussions.
"All the concepts I learned during the program will be implemented during my investment analysis. The short-term program offered insights and discussions into strategies that will make tremendous difference in my valuations. To site a simple example, during a class, Professor Greenwald convinced the entire auditorium about an investment without even mentioning a simple number but by analyzing business as it stands on its own."







Francisco Errandonea

"In just three days, I learned more on valuation than a couple of years in university, plus more than a decade of work experience."

"Professor Greenwald communicates his investing genius in a clear analytical and very entertaining manner. This course should be required for all value investors."







Sheldon Goldman

 




Sheldon Goldman      


CEO & CIO, S Goldman Advisors LLC
 

"Value Investing appeals – who doesn't want to buy $1.00 for $0.50? The trick is learning how to do this and acquiring tools for understanding the difference between "cheaper" and "cheap." Professor Greenwald has wisdom and infinite patience in sharing his tools with us."







Bruce Robertson

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".

We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor

Investment Management
Insights, Strategies and Solutions
Our experienced professionals have expertise in a broad spectrum of traditional, alternative and non-financial assets.  We can work with you to develop and manage a portfolio tailored to your needs.






Portfolio Consulting
A collaborative dialogue with your portfolio manager
Your portfolio manager is a key member of your U.S. Trust relationship team and serves as your personal "chief investment officer." He or she will work with you to create an Investment Policy Statement, which serves as a blueprint for your portfolio by documenting your:

Objectives
Risk tolerance
Cash flow needs
 Tax situation
Wealth aspirations

Your portfolio manager's ongoing role is to incorporate our best strategic and tactical thinking, most relevant research analysis, current market insights and appropriate investment solutions into your portfolio. He or she will regularly monitor your portfolio to make sure it conforms to your Investment Policy Statement, which will be updated whenever there are significant changes in your life or goals.
Asset management
A more complete approach to asset allocation1
We analyze a wide range of asset classes, including hedge and private equity funds2 and global investment opportunities, as potential components of an asset allocation. In addition, we believe that true diversification requires managing for cash flows across and within asset classes in various market environments — not simply allocating according to a grid.
Your asset allocation will be based on the long-term expectations established for each asset class by our most senior investment professionals. Over the shorter term, however, your portfolio manager can adjust your portfolio tactically in response to emerging opportunities and risks, and reflecting U.S. Trust insights about trends and themes relevant to you.
How you own your assets — personally or in trusts; in taxable or tax-exempt solutions — can have a material impact on the overall performance of your portfolio. At U.S. Trust we focus on this wealth structuring aspect of your portfolio in conjunction with managing the assets themselves.
Alternative Investments
SOPHISTICATED SOLUTIONS TO MEET YOUR NEEDS2
Alternative investments at U.S. Trust focus on non-traditional assets such as:

Hedge funds
Private equity
Real estate and tangible assets

Because performance is often differentiated from equity and fixed income markets, alternative investments may be an ideal complement to traditional investments. 
Through our access to the industry's premier managers, we are able to offer solutions that provide options for all client segments. And we support you every step of the way with knowledge built on our experience in alternatives, including industry-leading research, rigorous due diligence, and cutting-edge portfolio construction.
Drawing from the experience, resources and expertise of the firm, you and your portfolio manager can explore alternative investments that can help you pursue what matters most to you.
Specialty asset management
Expertise in nonfinancial assets3
Specialty asset management at U.S. Trust focuses on nonfinancial assets such as:

Farm and ranch land
Timberland
Oil and gas properties
Private businesses
Real estate

Our Specialty Asset Management team can work with your portfolio manager and wealth strategist, as appropriate, to integrate these real assets into your overall plan and portfolio.
We can help you realize your objectives with assets you already own, or help you acquire specific assets to take advantage of their capital growth and diversification potential — whether you own these assets outright or they are held in trust.
Our team of specialists can provide complete turnkey services including identifying and purchasing real property and providing ongoing management.
Capital markets
Sophisticated market-linked solutions4
Through our access to the resources of Merrill Lynch, one of the world's leading capital markets participants, we can tailor approaches to risks and opportunities in the foreign exchange, interest rate, commodity and equity markets. Derivative-based transactions target the risks you seek to hedge, and are designed to dovetail with your overall portfolio and wealth management strategies.

1 Asset allocation and diversification do not ensure a profit or protect against loss in declining markets.
2 Alternative Investments such as derivatives, hedge funds, private equity funds, and funds of funds can result in higher return potential but also higher loss potential. Changes in economic conditions or other circumstances may adversely affect your investments. Before you invest in alternative investments, you should consider your overall financial situation, how much money you have to invest, your need for liquidity, and your tolerance for risk. Alternative investments are speculative and involve a high degree of risk.
3 Nonfinancial assets, such as closely-held businesses, real estate, oil, gas and mineral properties, and timber, farm and ranch land, are complex in nature and involve risks including total loss of value.  Special risk considerations include natural events (for example, earthquakes or fires), complex tax considerations, and lack of liquidity.  Nonfinancial assets are not suitable for all investors.  Always consult with your independent attorney, tax advisor, investment manager, and insurance agent for final recommendations and before changing or implementing any financial, tax, or estate planning strategy.
4 Brokerage services are provided by Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated, a registered broker-dealer, Member SIPC and a wholly owned subsidiary of Bank of America Corporation.
Certain U.S. Trust associates are registered representatives with Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated ("MLPF&S") and may assist you with investment products and services provided through MLPF&S and other nonbank investment affiliates. MLPF&S is a registered broker-dealer, member SIPC and a wholly owned subsidiary of Bank of America Corporation ("BofA Corp.").

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
