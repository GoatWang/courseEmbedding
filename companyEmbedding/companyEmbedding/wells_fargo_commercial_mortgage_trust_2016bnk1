August 01, 2016 09:37 AM Eastern Daylight Time

      a)Privately placed pursuant to Rule 144A.
    

      b)Notional amount and interest-only.
    

      c)Vertical credit risk retention interest representing 5.0% of pool 
      balance (as of the closing date).
    

      The expected ratings are based on information provided by the issuer as 
      of Aug. 1, 2016.
    

      The certificates represent the beneficial ownership interest in the 
      trust, primary assets of which are 40 loans secured by 46 commercial 
      properties having an aggregate principal balance of $870,557,680 as of 
      the cut-off date. The loans were contributed to the trust by Wells Fargo 
      Bank, National Association, Bank of America, National Association, and 
      Morgan Stanley Mortgage Capital Holdings LLC.
    

      Fitch reviewed a comprehensive sample of the transaction's collateral, 
      including site inspections on 85.6% of the properties by balance, asset 
      summary reviews on 100.0% of the pool, and cash flow analysis on 88.7% 
      of the pool.
    

      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    

      Lower Fitch Leverage: The pool's leverage statistics are lower than 
      those of other recent Fitch-rated, fixed-rate multiborrower 
      transactions. The pool's Fitch DSCR and Fitch LTV of 1.22x and 100.5%, 
      respectively, are better than the YTD 2016 average Fitch DSCR and Fitch 
      LTV of 1.16x and 107.5%, respectively. Excluding credit-opinion loans, 
      the pool's Fitch DSCR and Fitch LTV is 1.18x and 108.9%, respectively.
    

      Investment-Grade Credit Opinion Loans: The two largest loans in the 
      pool, The Shops at Crystals (9.2% of the pool) and Vertex Pharmaceutical 
      HQ (9.2% of the pool), have investment grade credit opinions. The Shops 
      at Crystals has an investment-grade credit opinion of 'BBB+sf*' on a 
      stand-alone basis. Vertex Pharmaceutical HQ has an investment-grade 
      credit opinion of 'BBB-sf*' on a stand-alone basis. The two loans have a 
      weighted average Fitch DSCR and Fitch LTV of 1.41x and 62.7%, 
      respectively.
    

      Higher Pool Concentration: The top ten loans comprise 58.7% of the pool, 
      which is greater than the YTD 2016 average of 54.6% and 49.3%. The 
      pool's loan concentration index (LCI) is 471, which is above the YTD 
      2016 average of 420. Additionally, the resulting sponsor concentration 
      index (SCI) delta compared to the LCI is 23.4%, which is above the YTD 
      2016 average delta of 16.7%. Simon Property Group, L.P. (rated 'A'/F1') 
      is the sponsor of two of the top 10 loans, representing 13.5% of the 
      pool.
    

      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    

      For this transaction, Fitch's net cash flow (NCF) was 19.6% below the 
      most recent year's net operating income (NOI; for properties for which a 
      full-year NOI was provided, excluding properties that were stabilizing 
      during this period). Unanticipated further declines in property-level 
      NCF could result in higher defaults and loss severities on defaulted 
      loans and in potential rating actions on the certificates.
    

      Fitch evaluated the sensitivity of the ratings assigned to WFCM 
      2016-BNK1 certificates and found that the transaction displays average 
      sensitivity to further declines in NCF. In a scenario in which NCF 
      declined a further 20% from Fitch's NCF, a downgrade of the junior 
      'AAAsf' certificates to 'Asf' could result. In a more severe scenario, 
      in which NCF declined a further 30% from Fitch's NCF, a downgrade of the 
      junior 'AAAsf' certificates to 'BBB+sf' could result. The presale report 
      includes a detailed explanation of additional stresses and sensitivities 
      on page 11.
    

      DUE DILIGENCE USAGE
    

      Fitch was provided with third-party due diligence information from 
      Deloitte & Touche LLP. The third-party due diligence information was 
      provided on Form ABS Due Diligence-15E and focused on a comparison and 
      re-computation of certain characteristics with respect to each of the 
      mortgage loans. Fitch considered this information in its analysis and 
      the findings did not have an impact on the analysis. A copy of the ABS 
      Due Diligence Form-15E received by Fitch in connection with this 
      transaction may be obtained through the link contained on the bottom of 
      the related rating action commentary.

When McCain, who was recently diagnosed with brain cancer, walked onto the Senate floor about 1:30 a.m. and voted “no” with a thumbs-down, the shock was palpable.Collins, McCain and Murkowski: Republican trio who defied party to vote no on health billThe GuardianSen.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.

The expected ratings are based on information provided by the issuer as 
      of Aug. 1, 2016.


                                        








The certificates represent the beneficial ownership interest in the 
      trust, primary assets of which are 40 loans secured by 46 commercial 
      properties having an aggregate principal balance of $870,557,680 as of 
      the cut-off date. The loans were contributed to the trust by Wells Fargo 
      Bank, National Association, Bank of America, National Association, and 
      Morgan Stanley Mortgage Capital Holdings LLC.


                                        








Fitch reviewed a comprehensive sample of the transaction's collateral, 
      including site inspections on 85.6% of the properties by balance, asset 
      summary reviews on 100.0% of the pool, and cash flow analysis on 88.7% 
      of the pool.


                                        








KEY RATING DRIVERS


                                        








Lower Fitch Leverage: The pool's leverage statistics are lower than 
      those of other recent Fitch-rated, fixed-rate multiborrower 
      transactions. The pool's Fitch DSCR and Fitch LTV of 1.22x and 100.5%, 
      respectively, are better than the YTD 2016 average Fitch DSCR and Fitch 
      LTV of 1.16x and 107.5%, respectively. Excluding credit-opinion loans, 
      the pool's Fitch DSCR and Fitch LTV is 1.18x and 108.9%, respectively.


                                        








Investment-Grade Credit Opinion Loans: The two largest loans in the 
      pool, The Shops at Crystals (9.2% of the pool) and Vertex Pharmaceutical 
      HQ (9.2% of the pool), have investment grade credit opinions. The Shops 
      at Crystals has an investment-grade credit opinion of 'BBB+sf*' on a 
      stand-alone basis. Vertex Pharmaceutical HQ has an investment-grade 
      credit opinion of 'BBB-sf*' on a stand-alone basis. The two loans have a 
      weighted average Fitch DSCR and Fitch LTV of 1.41x and 62.7%, 
      respectively.


                                        








Higher Pool Concentration: The top ten loans comprise 58.7% of the pool, 
      which is greater than the YTD 2016 average of 54.6% and 49.3%. The 
      pool's loan concentration index (LCI) is 471, which is above the YTD 
      2016 average of 420. Additionally, the resulting sponsor concentration 
      index (SCI) delta compared to the LCI is 23.4%, which is above the YTD 
      2016 average delta of 16.7%. Simon Property Group, L.P. (rated 'A'/F1') 
      is the sponsor of two of the top 10 loans, representing 13.5% of the 
      pool.


                                        








RATING SENSITIVITIES


                                        








For this transaction, Fitch's net cash flow (NCF) was 19.6% below the 
      most recent year's net operating income (NOI; for properties for which a 
      full-year NOI was provided, excluding properties that were stabilizing 
      during this period). Unanticipated further declines in property-level 
      NCF could result in higher defaults and loss severities on defaulted 
      loans and in potential rating actions on the certificates.


                                        








Fitch evaluated the sensitivity of the ratings assigned to WFCM 
      2016-BNK1 certificates and found that the transaction displays average 
      sensitivity to further declines in NCF. In a scenario in which NCF 
      declined a further 20% from Fitch's NCF, a downgrade of the junior 
      'AAAsf' certificates to 'Asf' could result. In a more severe scenario, 
      in which NCF declined a further 30% from Fitch's NCF, a downgrade of the 
      junior 'AAAsf' certificates to 'BBB+sf' could result. The presale report 
      includes a detailed explanation of additional stresses and sensitivities 
      on page 11.


                                        








DUE DILIGENCE USAGE


                                        








Fitch was provided with third-party due diligence information from 
      Deloitte & Touche LLP. The third-party due diligence information was 
      provided on Form ABS Due Diligence-15E and focused on a comparison and 
      re-computation of certain characteristics with respect to each of the 
      mortgage loans. Fitch considered this information in its analysis and 
      the findings did not have an impact on the analysis. A copy of the ABS 
      Due Diligence Form-15E received by Fitch in connection with this 
      transaction may be obtained through the link contained on the bottom of 
      the related rating action commentary.
