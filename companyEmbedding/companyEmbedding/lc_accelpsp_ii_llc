The Hyundai Accent (Korean: 현대 엑센트), or Hyundai Verna (현대 베르나) in South Korea, is a subcompact car produced by Hyundai. In Australia, the first generation models carried over the Hyundai Excel name used by the Accent's predecessor. The Accent was replaced in 2000 by the Hyundai Verna in South Korea, although most international markets, including the USA, retained the "Accent" name.
The Accent is produced for the Chinese market by Beijing Hyundai Co., a joint venture with Beijing Automotive Industry Corp. For the Russian market it is assembled by the TagAZ plant in Taganrog. In Mexico, the Accent was marketed until 2014 by Chrysler as the Dodge Attitude, previously known as the Verna by Dodge. In Venezuela, Chrysler marketed these models as the Dodge Brisa until 2006. The Brisa was assembled by Mitsubishi Motors at its plant in Barcelona, Venezuela. Since 2002, the Accent had been the longest-running small family car sold in North America. In Puerto Rico, it has been sold as the Hyundai Accent too. In Russia, it is sold as the Hyundai Solaris.
In 2008, Hyundai Accent was named the most dependable sub-compact car by J.D. Power and Associates.[1]

The Hyundai Accent (X3) was introduced as a replacement for the Excel in 1994 for the 1995 model year. It continued to be called Dodge Brisa in Venezuela or Hyundai Excel in some markets, such as the Netherlands, Belgium and Australia. In France, it was called the Hyundai Pony and in China, it was called the Kia Qianlima.
Australian cars were released in November 1994 available in Sprint and GX trims (three-door hatchback) or LX and GLX trims (four-door sedan and five-door hatchback). The upper-specification models (GX and GLX) had full cloth interior (as opposed to vinyl seat backings), height and lumbar support adjustments on the driver's seat, four-speaker sound system (instead of two), passenger vanity mirror, a tachometer, and power antenna as standard. GX three-doors also had a standard rear spoiler, while power steering was standard on all but the Sprint. There were also some special editions—the Classique sedan in 1996 with anti-lock brakes and the Sportz in 1999 and 2000 with alloy wheels and a rear spoiler. The overwhelming majority sold were the Sprint three-door, enticing buyers with free air-conditioning, driveaway pricing and from late 1998, standard power steering.
The facelift arrived in Australia in April 1997 with accompanying trim changes. The engine was a 1.5-liter G4EK SOHC unit with 91 hp (68 kW). From November 1997 onwards, this was upgraded to a twin cam (DOHC) G4FK version with 74 kW (99 hp) at 6000 rpm and torque of 134 N·m (99 lb·ft) at 4000 rpm. A double overhead cam (DOHC) engine was also available in America in the Accent GT but made a more-powerful 105 hp (78 kW) at 6000 rpm instead.[9] X3s with the DOHC engine are badged "Twin Cam".
In Australia, the X3 proved so popular (due to its reliability and low price[10][11][12]) that it was the third best-selling vehicle in the country in both 1996 and 1998. In the latter year, it achieved more than 44,000 sales (a 5.5% share of the total market), a record figure at the time, for an imported car. Between 1994 and 2000, some 200,000 X3s were sold in Australia, making it arguably the most successful imported vehicle in the country's history.
The Accent was sold in saloon (sedan), hatchback, and coupé form in the UK, with a choice of three engines for each: a 1.3 12v (85 hp), 1.5 12v (92 hp) and a 1.5 16v (105 hp) petrol. There was no diesel option. A GSi spec car was the top-specification Accent. The MVi-spec coupé version won particular praise for its handling agility in the UK. Although the Accent was cheap to buy and insure, its engines were quite thirsty; the 1.5-litre returned 33 mpg‑imp (8.6 L/100 km; 27 mpg‑US) average according to list figures.
In the US, although manuals exist for Accents before and after 1999, a manual for 1999 Hyundai Accent has not been published. Additionally, owners of the 1999 model were informed by their dealers that the power output of the 1.5-liter engine was in fact rated at 88 horsepower (66 kW).
In China, the Hyundai Accent was branded as the Kia Qianlima under Dongfeng Yueda Kia. It came with either a 1.3- or 1.6-liter engine. Production ran from December 2002 until November 2006. It had similar styling to the regular Hyundai Accent until it was given a facelift in 2005 featuring a new grille and foglamps. Trim levels included the 1.3 DLX, 1.3L GL (Manual), 1.3L GL (Automatic), 1.6 GLS (Manual) and the 1.6 GLS (Automatic).
Safety[edit]
The 1998 Hyundai Accent was crash-tested by the European New Car Assessment Programme and showed rather poor performance, scoring only 4 points out of 16 for frontal impact.[13] The passenger compartment became unstable in the crash test.[13] It was determined that there was an unacceptable high risk of chest injury during side impact crash, as a result, the car would not meet the minimum legal requirement in 1999.[13] The Swedish insurance company, Folksam, rates the 1st-gen Accent as one of the safest cars in its weight class.[14]

The redesigned 1999 Accent (LC) sported a more angular body and increased dimensions. It received a minor facelift in 2003, and was given the model code LC2. When the Accent sedan underwent a 2006 redesign, the hatchback continued on sale during 2006 only in Canada, since the hatchback skipped the 2006 model year for the United States. But for Korea, it was the first model with the new nameplate: Verna.
The Accent got new 1.5-liter 12-valve SOHC and 16-valve DOHC engines: the 1.3 continued modified with a Helmholtz resonator intake after 2003. A 1.6-liter replaced the 1.5 engine for 2000. This Accent was also the first to get a diesel version, with a 1.5-litre three-cylinder direct injection turbodiesel, which was badged CRDi.
Trim levels were GSi, CDX and MVi: this was standard on most export versions, although some European markets had their own designations with names like DynamicVersion etc. Some markets used LS and GLS.
In North America the Accent was available in GL, GLS and GT trim levels only, with the 1.5-litre engine at first, then the 1.6-litre engine from 2002. The GT version was similar to the MVi version marketed in Europe and Oceania, although the body kit was not as overtly hot hatch styled.
During 2003 in Canada, the hatchback was offered as a GS or GSi with a 1.5 L or 1.6 L engine, respectively.
It was sold in Russia until 2011 as the Hyundai Accent side-by-side with the 3rd generation model which is sold as the Hyundai Verna.
It was launched in India in October 1999 as the "Accent" and was still in production after some minor facelifts;[15] the car was phased out in 2013 for local market.[23] A new variant of the India-made Hyundai Accent. The Accent GLS variant, which now adopts front airbags and ABS to meet the regulations on safety equipment on new vehicles, implies that the Accent could live on until 2017.
The GLS variant also comes with Air conditioning, power windows front and rear, power steering, central locking, Radio-CD-MP3 audio system, and front fog lights. It is the best selling model produce by Hyundai's Chennai plant. It has been restyled twice – in 2004 and 2010 – and is strapped with a 1.5-liter four-cylinder petrol engine matched to a five-speed manual gearbox.
In India, the Accent's was replaced by the Hyundai Xcent, a compact sedan based on the Grand i10 platform. The Accent (LC) has built up a solid reputation for being a reliable and low-maintenance car, giving Hyundai no reason to discontinue it.

Safety[edit]
A pre-2003 model (a three-door hatchback) was crash tested by Australian Australasian New Car Assessment Program (ANCAP) under the rules as adopted by Euro NCAP. It scored 10.76 out of 16 points for frontal offset impact and 10.96 out of 16 in the side impact test.[24]
The same un-restyled model, a four-door sedan (which is still in production in Egypt) had been crash tested by Russian magazine Autoreview in 2005.[25] Test was carried out to the Euro NCAP regulations. Despite the lack of airbags (which are not available in the cheapest version of Accent on the Russian market) it scored 9.9 of 16 for frontal impact.[26]
The 2003 restyled model was tested by ANCAP as well. The three-door hatchback scored 9.19 of 16 points for frontal impact and 9.76 out of 16 in the side impact crash test.[27]

Hyundai introduced a new-generation Accent (MC) at the 2005 New York International Auto Show. A new exterior, larger interior, and CVVT engine are the notable features.
A single trim level, GLS, is available in the US for the sedan. This sedan includes 6 airbags, air conditioning, power steering with tilt, with optional four-wheel disc antilock brakes with electronic brake-force distribution, and a 6-speaker CD stereo. A premium sport package includes air conditioning, 15-inch alloy wheels, power windows and heated mirrors, and remote power door locks. An automatic transmission is also available.
Hyundai began selling the 3-door hatchback in the United States during the spring 2006 as a 2007 model year vehicle. The 3-door is available in two trims – GS and SE. The GS is equipped much like the GLS sedan, with some equipment deleted for a base price of US$10,415. The SE replaces the former Accent GT, offering a sport-tuned suspension, 16 in. alloy wheels, and other sporting features, along with available dealer-installed performance parts such as a cold-air intake and suspension stress bar. The SE is sold as the Verna Sport in Korea. The Hyundai Accent SR is exclusive to Canada and only 500 have been made, this version is like the Accent SE, but in addition has the fender flares, front lip, rear lip, and exhaust tip. Also included with the SR version is the Clarion sound system with, 4channel Amplifier with 400 Watts, 7 speaker Audio System, with 10-inch (250 mm) Subwoofer in a custom made box. Dash also has a Carbon Fiber Trim Kit added to it. For the 2010 model year a "Blue" trim level has been introduced for the Accent with a base price of only US$9,970.[33] The Accent Blue is only available as a 3-door hatchback with a manual transmission, the sole option being air-conditioning which adds $1,000 to the price.
The Accent is presently the third-bestselling subcompact car in the United States, trailing after its rivals the Chevrolet Aveo and Toyota Yaris.[citation needed] In 2010, Forbes named the Accent amongst the ten worst cars for depreciation.[34]
In Europe, this model was heavily promoted by the motoring press, and even Hyundai themselves, as a "stopgap" model – that it was intended merely to plug the gap in Hyundai's range until a brand new small family car was launched in 2007. The new car, the Hyundai i30, replaced both the Accent and the larger Hyundai Elantra. The name change helped to distance the new model from the budget reputation of the Accent, and also to highlight that the new car can truly compete in the small family hatchback sector – something the Accent was slightly too small to do, and the Elantra too large.[citation needed] The Accent continued to be sold in the U.S. in 2008 with an instrument panel overhaul and standard rear cupholders in the SE model.[citation needed]
Engines:

1.4 L I4, 97.3 PS (72 kW; 96 hp) and 127 N·m (94 lb·ft)
1.6 L CVVT Alpha II I4, 112 PS (82 kW; 110 hp) and 145 N·m (107 lb·ft)
1.5 L D I4 turbodiesel, 110 PS (81 kW; 108 hp) and 235 N·m (173 lb·ft), fitted with common rail direct injection and variable geometry turbocharger

In Mexico, this is marketed as the Dodge Attitude: trim levels are 1.4 GL and 1.6 GLS. Hyundai has no official representation in Mexico, so select Hyundai models are rebranded as Dodges under an agreement with Chrysler's Mexican division.
In India, it is marketed as Hyundai Verna. The previous generation remains in production alongside as a cheaper alternative, marketed as the Hyundai Accent.
In Egypt, this generation is sold as the Hyundai New Accent (1.6 GLS only), and the previous model is still locally produced and sold as the Hyundai Verna (1.6 GL and GLS trims)
In 2008, Hyundai Accent received the lowest number of problems per 100 vehicles among compact multi-activity vehicles in the proprietary J.D. Power and Associates 2008 Vehicle Dependability StudySM. Study based on responses from over 52,000 original owners of 2005 model-year vehicles, measuring more than 250 models. Proprietary study results are based on experiences and perceptions of owners surveyed in January to April 2008.[1]
Safety[edit]
In 2006, according to the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, the Accent received an Acceptable overall score in the frontal crash test and a Poor overall score for in the side impact test without its optional side airbags. It didn't perform well even when equipped with side airbags, performance of the car's structure is marginal there would likely be injuries to internal organs, ribs and pelvis.[35][36][37] In 2007, 2006 year model of Hyundai Accent had been tested by ANCAP in June 2007. It scored 3 star in the Occupant Protection, and 2 star in Pedestrian Protection Rating.[38]

Hybrid[edit]
Hyundai debuted a demonstration version of a hybrid (MC/JB) Accent[39] at the 2005 Guangzhou International Automobile Exhibition in Guangzhou, China. It uses a 90 hp (67 kW), 1.4 L engine with continuously variable valve timing and a 16 hp (11.9 kW) electric motor to achieve 44% better fuel economy. Though originally scheduled for production release in the 2006 model year, introduction of the production version has been delayed indefinitely, along with the Kia Rio hybrid.[citation needed]
The hybrid Accent is expected to be introduced at the same time as a hybrid[40] version of the Kia Rio, the Kia twin of the Accent. A concept model of the Kia Rio hybrid was shown at the 2007 Geneva Auto Show.[citation needed]

Marketing[edit]
South Korea[edit]
Hyundai released the Korean version of the Accent (RB series) on November 2010. The new model is offered with the same 1.6-liter engine and 6-speed automatic or 6-speed manual as the fifth-generation (MD) Elantra. The car reverted to the "Accent" name as used in the X3 series.[44] The hatchback version, called Accent WIT, replaces the Getz/Click in South Korea.
China[edit]
In Beijing, China, Hyundai released the China-exclusive version of this model under the "Verna" name on 23 August 2010.[45]
North America[edit]
In January 2011, the sedan had its North American debut and the hatchback had its world debut at the Montreal Auto Show.[46]
There are two new engines matched with the new Accent including a 1.4 with 106 horsepower (79 kW), and a 1.6 with 138 hp (103 kW). Both featuring the latest technology in variable valve timing (1.4 "VVT") and direct fuel injection (1.6 "GDI").
Russia[edit]
In September 2010, Hyundai unveiled its Russian assembly line and presented the "Hyundai Solaris" a production-ready local version of the four-door fourth generation Accent. Hyundai reported that production would commence in January 2011.[47] The Accent badge remained reserved for the second generation Accent, still produced in Taganrog in the TagAZ plant. Hyundai Solaris was available with 1.4 (107 hp) and 1.6 (123 hp) petrol engines, with 6-speed MT or 4-speed AT.[48]
In 2014, the Hyundai Solaris for Russian and CIS (were it sold as Hyundai Accent) market was facelifted. The car got new front fascia and new 6-speed automatic and 6-speed manual gearboxes for 1.6 version.[49]
India[edit]
In May 2011, Hyundai launched the Verna in India with four engine options including 1.4-litre petrol and diesel engines as well as 1.6-litre petrol and diesel engines. The second-generation (LC) continues to be sold in India as the Hyundai Accent with the latest RB version carrying the Verna brand. At the time of launch, the new Verna RB features safety and comfort options that were previously unavailable in the Indian market at this price point including the option of 6 airbags.[50] Hyundai refreshed the Indian lineup of Verna in 2014 without any engine changes.[51]
The 2014 line up changes include a new set of alloy wheels for the top end SX variant, projector headlamps, day time running LED lamps on the exterior. Most importantly, Hyundai has also worked upon the steering and the suspension. The steering being lighter had made high speed driving a difficult task and so did the soft suspensions. Dr. Nano introduced a new Composite Assistive C-Spring Suspension for Hyundai Fluidic Verna for high comfort. Henceforth, all suspension issues were solved. The springs are good not just for city driving, but also at high speed manners. Now, with the steering gaining some weight at high speeds and the better suspensions, the vertical movement of the car has considerably gone down.
The Diesel variant has attracted more attention in India because of its fuel economy - as a result the response in India was overwhelming and Hyundai could not handle all the orders. There are delays expected with 2–3-month waits in most locations and up to 5-month waits in others.
HMIL has launched the Verna with four engine options - 1.4 VTVT Petrol - 107 bhp, 135 Nm torque, 5-Speed manual, 12 kmpl under city conditions; 1.6 VTVT Petrol - 123 bhp, 160 Nm torque, 5-Speed manual/4-Speed Automatic, 10 kmpl / 8 kmpl; 1.4 CRDi Diesel - 90 bhp, 224 Nm torque, 6-Speed manual, 17 kmpl; 1.6 CRDi Diesel - 126 bhp, 260 Nm torque, 6-Speed manual/4-Speed Automatic, 14 kmpl / 12 kmpl.
Hyundai Fluidic Verna Facelift[edit]
Hyundai launched the Verna facelift in the Indian car market on 18 February 2015.[52] The new Verna mid-sized sedan gets changes to both styling and mechanism. The updated Hyundai Verna gets new front fascia. Apart from the same Petrol and Diesel engine versions, the four-speed automatic gearbox is likely to be offered in the upcoming model; however, the maker might also introduce the six-speed automatic gearbox.[53]
According to MotorBeam Hyundai has started testing the fifth generation Verna and the company will launch the new model in the Indian market in the second half of 2017.[54]
Indonesia[edit]
In Indonesia, the Accent hatchback is sold as the Grand Avega. The car made its debut at the 2011 Indonesia International Motor Show and is assembled locally.[55] The Grand Avega is equipped with two engines and three transmissions: a 1.4 L petrol 108ps Gamma engine with 4 a/t or 5 m/t and a 1.4 L petrol 100ps Kappa engine with 6 m/t.
Mexico[edit]
In Mexico it was marketed as Dodge Verna from 2004 a 2005 and as Dodge Attitude from 2006 a 2014 until may 2014 after Hyundai's arrival in the country, forcing Dodge to give the name Attitude to the Mitsubishi Attrage. It is unknown if the car will be reintroduced as the Hyundai Accent in 2015 or until the car's next redesign. In 2017 return with your name true Hyundai Accent as model 2018.
Philippines[edit]
In the Philippines, the third generation (MC sedan) was introduced and made available in 2006 exclusively with a 1.5 litre D4FA common rail direct injection (crdi) turbodiesel with VGT with 110hp and 240nm with a 5 m/t. A number of units saw action in the taxi industry because of fuel efficiency coupled with cheaper diesel fuel costs.
In 2011 came the RB model in both sedan and hatchback platforms. The sedan was powered by a 108ps Gamma engine with a 4 a/t or 5 m/t. Some of first batch of RB models were dogged by knocking issues when using 91 and below octane fuel. A second iteration was introduced in 2014 with a 100ps kappa engine with 6 m/t or 4 a/t and a 1.6 litre D4FB common rail direct injection turbodiesel with 126ps and 260NM in 6MT or 4AT variants. In 2015, the diesel variant comes with an electronic VGT in both 6 m/t and 7 speed dual clutch automatic transmission (DCT). Power outputs are now 136ps and 265nm for the 6 m/t while the DCT model at 136ps and 300nm.
The hatchback model was introduced at 2013 exclusively with a 1.6 D4FB common rail direct injection turbodiesel with VGT. Power output is at 126ps and 260nm. Both the 6 m/t and 4 a/t models came with anti-lock braking systems (ABS) with electronic brake distribution. By 2014, a faceliifted model was introduced with projector type headlamps anly the top end model in 4 a/t had ABS and EBD. By 2015, the engine had the e-vgt upgrade and now comes in 6 m/t and 7 speed DCT. Power outputs are now 136ps and 265nm for the 6 m/t while the DCT model at 136ps and 300nm.

The 2012 Hyundai Accent was tested by the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) and received the following:[57]

Overall Rating: 
Frontal Crash: 
Side Crash: *

Kenneth Eriksson in an Accent WRC at the 2001 Rally Finland


Hyundai's Accent World Rally Car competed in an official capacity, spawning three generations, in the World Rally Championship from 2000 to 2003. After development and testing in 1999, the Hyundai World Rally Team and Motor Sport Developments (MSD) debuted the Accent WRC at the 2000 Swedish Rally.[59] The second evolution, Accent WRC2, featured revised aerodynamics, active front differential, longer suspension travel and improved suspension top mounts, although most of the attention was directed at improving reliability. Like its predecessor's, the car's best result in a WRC event remained a fourth place.[60] The Accent WRC3, featuring new dampers and engine internals among other changes, debuted at the 2002 Tour de Corse.[61] Due to budget constraints, the car's development was virtually halted during the 2003 season. In September, Hyundai announced its withdrawal from the WRC.[62]
The car, though, in such capable hands across its lifespan as the four-time world champion Juha Kankkunen, ex-Subaru rally-winning and former Group A champion Kenneth Eriksson and former British Rally Champion Alister McRae, albeit the former two in the twilight of their careers, was reasonably competitive at times and showed some promise. Belgian Freddy Loix and 1991 Rally Catalunya winner Armin Schwarz were among the other drivers so long synonymous with life in the works-fettled Accents.[citation needed]
Junior Formula series[edit]
In India, Hyundai is the sole engine supplier for Formula LGB Hyundai, built by the Chain and Sprocket giant LGB. The single make series is promoted at grassroots level acting as a launch pad for future Formula One hopefuls. The Accent engine is supplied in Stock form albeit after some engine control unit modifications.[citation needed]
Excel Rally Series[edit]
In Australia, the X3 Accent sold as the Hyundai Excel is used in the Excel Rally Series. There are restrictions on modifications to the vehicle to reduce cost and encourage competition.

The Hyundai Accent (Korean: 현대 엑센트), or Hyundai Verna (현대 베르나) in South Korea, is a subcompact car produced by Hyundai. In Australia, the first generation models carried over the Hyundai Excel name used by the Accent's predecessor. The Accent was replaced in 2000 by the Hyundai Verna in South Korea, although most international markets, including the USA, retained the "Accent" name.
The Accent is produced for the Chinese market by Beijing Hyundai Co., a joint venture with Beijing Automotive Industry Corp. For the Russian market it is assembled by the TagAZ plant in Taganrog. In Mexico, the Accent was marketed until 2014 by Chrysler as the Dodge Attitude, previously known as the Verna by Dodge. In Venezuela, Chrysler marketed these models as the Dodge Brisa until 2006. The Brisa was assembled by Mitsubishi Motors at its plant in Barcelona, Venezuela. Since 2002, the Accent had been the longest-running small family car sold in North America. In Puerto Rico, it has been sold as the Hyundai Accent too. In Russia, it is sold as the Hyundai Solaris.
In 2008, Hyundai Accent was named the most dependable sub-compact car by J.D. Power and Associates.[1]

The Hyundai Accent (X3) was introduced as a replacement for the Excel in 1994 for the 1995 model year. It continued to be called Dodge Brisa in Venezuela or Hyundai Excel in some markets, such as the Netherlands, Belgium and Australia. In France, it was called the Hyundai Pony and in China, it was called the Kia Qianlima.
Australian cars were released in November 1994 available in Sprint and GX trims (three-door hatchback) or LX and GLX trims (four-door sedan and five-door hatchback). The upper-specification models (GX and GLX) had full cloth interior (as opposed to vinyl seat backings), height and lumbar support adjustments on the driver's seat, four-speaker sound system (instead of two), passenger vanity mirror, a tachometer, and power antenna as standard. GX three-doors also had a standard rear spoiler, while power steering was standard on all but the Sprint. There were also some special editions—the Classique sedan in 1996 with anti-lock brakes and the Sportz in 1999 and 2000 with alloy wheels and a rear spoiler. The overwhelming majority sold were the Sprint three-door, enticing buyers with free air-conditioning, driveaway pricing and from late 1998, standard power steering.
The facelift arrived in Australia in April 1997 with accompanying trim changes. The engine was a 1.5-liter G4EK SOHC unit with 91 hp (68 kW). From November 1997 onwards, this was upgraded to a twin cam (DOHC) G4FK version with 74 kW (99 hp) at 6000 rpm and torque of 134 N·m (99 lb·ft) at 4000 rpm. A double overhead cam (DOHC) engine was also available in America in the Accent GT but made a more-powerful 105 hp (78 kW) at 6000 rpm instead.[9] X3s with the DOHC engine are badged "Twin Cam".
In Australia, the X3 proved so popular (due to its reliability and low price[10][11][12]) that it was the third best-selling vehicle in the country in both 1996 and 1998. In the latter year, it achieved more than 44,000 sales (a 5.5% share of the total market), a record figure at the time, for an imported car. Between 1994 and 2000, some 200,000 X3s were sold in Australia, making it arguably the most successful imported vehicle in the country's history.
The Accent was sold in saloon (sedan), hatchback, and coupé form in the UK, with a choice of three engines for each: a 1.3 12v (85 hp), 1.5 12v (92 hp) and a 1.5 16v (105 hp) petrol. There was no diesel option. A GSi spec car was the top-specification Accent. The MVi-spec coupé version won particular praise for its handling agility in the UK. Although the Accent was cheap to buy and insure, its engines were quite thirsty; the 1.5-litre returned 33 mpg‑imp (8.6 L/100 km; 27 mpg‑US) average according to list figures.
In the US, although manuals exist for Accents before and after 1999, a manual for 1999 Hyundai Accent has not been published. Additionally, owners of the 1999 model were informed by their dealers that the power output of the 1.5-liter engine was in fact rated at 88 horsepower (66 kW).
In China, the Hyundai Accent was branded as the Kia Qianlima under Dongfeng Yueda Kia. It came with either a 1.3- or 1.6-liter engine. Production ran from December 2002 until November 2006. It had similar styling to the regular Hyundai Accent until it was given a facelift in 2005 featuring a new grille and foglamps. Trim levels included the 1.3 DLX, 1.3L GL (Manual), 1.3L GL (Automatic), 1.6 GLS (Manual) and the 1.6 GLS (Automatic).
Safety[edit]
The 1998 Hyundai Accent was crash-tested by the European New Car Assessment Programme and showed rather poor performance, scoring only 4 points out of 16 for frontal impact.[13] The passenger compartment became unstable in the crash test.[13] It was determined that there was an unacceptable high risk of chest injury during side impact crash, as a result, the car would not meet the minimum legal requirement in 1999.[13] The Swedish insurance company, Folksam, rates the 1st-gen Accent as one of the safest cars in its weight class.[14]

The redesigned 1999 Accent (LC) sported a more angular body and increased dimensions. It received a minor facelift in 2003, and was given the model code LC2. When the Accent sedan underwent a 2006 redesign, the hatchback continued on sale during 2006 only in Canada, since the hatchback skipped the 2006 model year for the United States. But for Korea, it was the first model with the new nameplate: Verna.
The Accent got new 1.5-liter 12-valve SOHC and 16-valve DOHC engines: the 1.3 continued modified with a Helmholtz resonator intake after 2003. A 1.6-liter replaced the 1.5 engine for 2000. This Accent was also the first to get a diesel version, with a 1.5-litre three-cylinder direct injection turbodiesel, which was badged CRDi.
Trim levels were GSi, CDX and MVi: this was standard on most export versions, although some European markets had their own designations with names like DynamicVersion etc. Some markets used LS and GLS.
In North America the Accent was available in GL, GLS and GT trim levels only, with the 1.5-litre engine at first, then the 1.6-litre engine from 2002. The GT version was similar to the MVi version marketed in Europe and Oceania, although the body kit was not as overtly hot hatch styled.
During 2003 in Canada, the hatchback was offered as a GS or GSi with a 1.5 L or 1.6 L engine, respectively.
It was sold in Russia until 2011 as the Hyundai Accent side-by-side with the 3rd generation model which is sold as the Hyundai Verna.
It was launched in India in October 1999 as the "Accent" and was still in production after some minor facelifts;[15] the car was phased out in 2013 for local market.[23] A new variant of the India-made Hyundai Accent. The Accent GLS variant, which now adopts front airbags and ABS to meet the regulations on safety equipment on new vehicles, implies that the Accent could live on until 2017.
The GLS variant also comes with Air conditioning, power windows front and rear, power steering, central locking, Radio-CD-MP3 audio system, and front fog lights. It is the best selling model produce by Hyundai's Chennai plant. It has been restyled twice – in 2004 and 2010 – and is strapped with a 1.5-liter four-cylinder petrol engine matched to a five-speed manual gearbox.
In India, the Accent's was replaced by the Hyundai Xcent, a compact sedan based on the Grand i10 platform. The Accent (LC) has built up a solid reputation for being a reliable and low-maintenance car, giving Hyundai no reason to discontinue it.

Safety[edit]
A pre-2003 model (a three-door hatchback) was crash tested by Australian Australasian New Car Assessment Program (ANCAP) under the rules as adopted by Euro NCAP. It scored 10.76 out of 16 points for frontal offset impact and 10.96 out of 16 in the side impact test.[24]
The same un-restyled model, a four-door sedan (which is still in production in Egypt) had been crash tested by Russian magazine Autoreview in 2005.[25] Test was carried out to the Euro NCAP regulations. Despite the lack of airbags (which are not available in the cheapest version of Accent on the Russian market) it scored 9.9 of 16 for frontal impact.[26]
The 2003 restyled model was tested by ANCAP as well. The three-door hatchback scored 9.19 of 16 points for frontal impact and 9.76 out of 16 in the side impact crash test.[27]

Hyundai introduced a new-generation Accent (MC) at the 2005 New York International Auto Show. A new exterior, larger interior, and CVVT engine are the notable features.
A single trim level, GLS, is available in the US for the sedan. This sedan includes 6 airbags, air conditioning, power steering with tilt, with optional four-wheel disc antilock brakes with electronic brake-force distribution, and a 6-speaker CD stereo. A premium sport package includes air conditioning, 15-inch alloy wheels, power windows and heated mirrors, and remote power door locks. An automatic transmission is also available.
Hyundai began selling the 3-door hatchback in the United States during the spring 2006 as a 2007 model year vehicle. The 3-door is available in two trims – GS and SE. The GS is equipped much like the GLS sedan, with some equipment deleted for a base price of US$10,415. The SE replaces the former Accent GT, offering a sport-tuned suspension, 16 in. alloy wheels, and other sporting features, along with available dealer-installed performance parts such as a cold-air intake and suspension stress bar. The SE is sold as the Verna Sport in Korea. The Hyundai Accent SR is exclusive to Canada and only 500 have been made, this version is like the Accent SE, but in addition has the fender flares, front lip, rear lip, and exhaust tip. Also included with the SR version is the Clarion sound system with, 4channel Amplifier with 400 Watts, 7 speaker Audio System, with 10-inch (250 mm) Subwoofer in a custom made box. Dash also has a Carbon Fiber Trim Kit added to it. For the 2010 model year a "Blue" trim level has been introduced for the Accent with a base price of only US$9,970.[33] The Accent Blue is only available as a 3-door hatchback with a manual transmission, the sole option being air-conditioning which adds $1,000 to the price.
The Accent is presently the third-bestselling subcompact car in the United States, trailing after its rivals the Chevrolet Aveo and Toyota Yaris.[citation needed] In 2010, Forbes named the Accent amongst the ten worst cars for depreciation.[34]
In Europe, this model was heavily promoted by the motoring press, and even Hyundai themselves, as a "stopgap" model – that it was intended merely to plug the gap in Hyundai's range until a brand new small family car was launched in 2007. The new car, the Hyundai i30, replaced both the Accent and the larger Hyundai Elantra. The name change helped to distance the new model from the budget reputation of the Accent, and also to highlight that the new car can truly compete in the small family hatchback sector – something the Accent was slightly too small to do, and the Elantra too large.[citation needed] The Accent continued to be sold in the U.S. in 2008 with an instrument panel overhaul and standard rear cupholders in the SE model.[citation needed]
Engines:

1.4 L I4, 97.3 PS (72 kW; 96 hp) and 127 N·m (94 lb·ft)
1.6 L CVVT Alpha II I4, 112 PS (82 kW; 110 hp) and 145 N·m (107 lb·ft)
1.5 L D I4 turbodiesel, 110 PS (81 kW; 108 hp) and 235 N·m (173 lb·ft), fitted with common rail direct injection and variable geometry turbocharger

In Mexico, this is marketed as the Dodge Attitude: trim levels are 1.4 GL and 1.6 GLS. Hyundai has no official representation in Mexico, so select Hyundai models are rebranded as Dodges under an agreement with Chrysler's Mexican division.
In India, it is marketed as Hyundai Verna. The previous generation remains in production alongside as a cheaper alternative, marketed as the Hyundai Accent.
In Egypt, this generation is sold as the Hyundai New Accent (1.6 GLS only), and the previous model is still locally produced and sold as the Hyundai Verna (1.6 GL and GLS trims)
In 2008, Hyundai Accent received the lowest number of problems per 100 vehicles among compact multi-activity vehicles in the proprietary J.D. Power and Associates 2008 Vehicle Dependability StudySM. Study based on responses from over 52,000 original owners of 2005 model-year vehicles, measuring more than 250 models. Proprietary study results are based on experiences and perceptions of owners surveyed in January to April 2008.[1]
Safety[edit]
In 2006, according to the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, the Accent received an Acceptable overall score in the frontal crash test and a Poor overall score for in the side impact test without its optional side airbags. It didn't perform well even when equipped with side airbags, performance of the car's structure is marginal there would likely be injuries to internal organs, ribs and pelvis.[35][36][37] In 2007, 2006 year model of Hyundai Accent had been tested by ANCAP in June 2007. It scored 3 star in the Occupant Protection, and 2 star in Pedestrian Protection Rating.[38]

Hybrid[edit]
Hyundai debuted a demonstration version of a hybrid (MC/JB) Accent[39] at the 2005 Guangzhou International Automobile Exhibition in Guangzhou, China. It uses a 90 hp (67 kW), 1.4 L engine with continuously variable valve timing and a 16 hp (11.9 kW) electric motor to achieve 44% better fuel economy. Though originally scheduled for production release in the 2006 model year, introduction of the production version has been delayed indefinitely, along with the Kia Rio hybrid.[citation needed]
The hybrid Accent is expected to be introduced at the same time as a hybrid[40] version of the Kia Rio, the Kia twin of the Accent. A concept model of the Kia Rio hybrid was shown at the 2007 Geneva Auto Show.[citation needed]

Marketing[edit]
South Korea[edit]
Hyundai released the Korean version of the Accent (RB series) on November 2010. The new model is offered with the same 1.6-liter engine and 6-speed automatic or 6-speed manual as the fifth-generation (MD) Elantra. The car reverted to the "Accent" name as used in the X3 series.[44] The hatchback version, called Accent WIT, replaces the Getz/Click in South Korea.
China[edit]
In Beijing, China, Hyundai released the China-exclusive version of this model under the "Verna" name on 23 August 2010.[45]
North America[edit]
In January 2011, the sedan had its North American debut and the hatchback had its world debut at the Montreal Auto Show.[46]
There are two new engines matched with the new Accent including a 1.4 with 106 horsepower (79 kW), and a 1.6 with 138 hp (103 kW). Both featuring the latest technology in variable valve timing (1.4 "VVT") and direct fuel injection (1.6 "GDI").
Russia[edit]
In September 2010, Hyundai unveiled its Russian assembly line and presented the "Hyundai Solaris" a production-ready local version of the four-door fourth generation Accent. Hyundai reported that production would commence in January 2011.[47] The Accent badge remained reserved for the second generation Accent, still produced in Taganrog in the TagAZ plant. Hyundai Solaris was available with 1.4 (107 hp) and 1.6 (123 hp) petrol engines, with 6-speed MT or 4-speed AT.[48]
In 2014, the Hyundai Solaris for Russian and CIS (were it sold as Hyundai Accent) market was facelifted. The car got new front fascia and new 6-speed automatic and 6-speed manual gearboxes for 1.6 version.[49]
India[edit]
In May 2011, Hyundai launched the Verna in India with four engine options including 1.4-litre petrol and diesel engines as well as 1.6-litre petrol and diesel engines. The second-generation (LC) continues to be sold in India as the Hyundai Accent with the latest RB version carrying the Verna brand. At the time of launch, the new Verna RB features safety and comfort options that were previously unavailable in the Indian market at this price point including the option of 6 airbags.[50] Hyundai refreshed the Indian lineup of Verna in 2014 without any engine changes.[51]
The 2014 line up changes include a new set of alloy wheels for the top end SX variant, projector headlamps, day time running LED lamps on the exterior. Most importantly, Hyundai has also worked upon the steering and the suspension. The steering being lighter had made high speed driving a difficult task and so did the soft suspensions. Dr. Nano introduced a new Composite Assistive C-Spring Suspension for Hyundai Fluidic Verna for high comfort. Henceforth, all suspension issues were solved. The springs are good not just for city driving, but also at high speed manners. Now, with the steering gaining some weight at high speeds and the better suspensions, the vertical movement of the car has considerably gone down.
The Diesel variant has attracted more attention in India because of its fuel economy - as a result the response in India was overwhelming and Hyundai could not handle all the orders. There are delays expected with 2–3-month waits in most locations and up to 5-month waits in others.
HMIL has launched the Verna with four engine options - 1.4 VTVT Petrol - 107 bhp, 135 Nm torque, 5-Speed manual, 12 kmpl under city conditions; 1.6 VTVT Petrol - 123 bhp, 160 Nm torque, 5-Speed manual/4-Speed Automatic, 10 kmpl / 8 kmpl; 1.4 CRDi Diesel - 90 bhp, 224 Nm torque, 6-Speed manual, 17 kmpl; 1.6 CRDi Diesel - 126 bhp, 260 Nm torque, 6-Speed manual/4-Speed Automatic, 14 kmpl / 12 kmpl.
Hyundai Fluidic Verna Facelift[edit]
Hyundai launched the Verna facelift in the Indian car market on 18 February 2015.[52] The new Verna mid-sized sedan gets changes to both styling and mechanism. The updated Hyundai Verna gets new front fascia. Apart from the same Petrol and Diesel engine versions, the four-speed automatic gearbox is likely to be offered in the upcoming model; however, the maker might also introduce the six-speed automatic gearbox.[53]
According to MotorBeam Hyundai has started testing the fifth generation Verna and the company will launch the new model in the Indian market in the second half of 2017.[54]
Indonesia[edit]
In Indonesia, the Accent hatchback is sold as the Grand Avega. The car made its debut at the 2011 Indonesia International Motor Show and is assembled locally.[55] The Grand Avega is equipped with two engines and three transmissions: a 1.4 L petrol 108ps Gamma engine with 4 a/t or 5 m/t and a 1.4 L petrol 100ps Kappa engine with 6 m/t.
Mexico[edit]
In Mexico it was marketed as Dodge Verna from 2004 a 2005 and as Dodge Attitude from 2006 a 2014 until may 2014 after Hyundai's arrival in the country, forcing Dodge to give the name Attitude to the Mitsubishi Attrage. It is unknown if the car will be reintroduced as the Hyundai Accent in 2015 or until the car's next redesign. In 2017 return with your name true Hyundai Accent as model 2018.
Philippines[edit]
In the Philippines, the third generation (MC sedan) was introduced and made available in 2006 exclusively with a 1.5 litre D4FA common rail direct injection (crdi) turbodiesel with VGT with 110hp and 240nm with a 5 m/t. A number of units saw action in the taxi industry because of fuel efficiency coupled with cheaper diesel fuel costs.
In 2011 came the RB model in both sedan and hatchback platforms. The sedan was powered by a 108ps Gamma engine with a 4 a/t or 5 m/t. Some of first batch of RB models were dogged by knocking issues when using 91 and below octane fuel. A second iteration was introduced in 2014 with a 100ps kappa engine with 6 m/t or 4 a/t and a 1.6 litre D4FB common rail direct injection turbodiesel with 126ps and 260NM in 6MT or 4AT variants. In 2015, the diesel variant comes with an electronic VGT in both 6 m/t and 7 speed dual clutch automatic transmission (DCT). Power outputs are now 136ps and 265nm for the 6 m/t while the DCT model at 136ps and 300nm.
The hatchback model was introduced at 2013 exclusively with a 1.6 D4FB common rail direct injection turbodiesel with VGT. Power output is at 126ps and 260nm. Both the 6 m/t and 4 a/t models came with anti-lock braking systems (ABS) with electronic brake distribution. By 2014, a faceliifted model was introduced with projector type headlamps anly the top end model in 4 a/t had ABS and EBD. By 2015, the engine had the e-vgt upgrade and now comes in 6 m/t and 7 speed DCT. Power outputs are now 136ps and 265nm for the 6 m/t while the DCT model at 136ps and 300nm.

The 2012 Hyundai Accent was tested by the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) and received the following:[57]

Overall Rating: 
Frontal Crash: 
Side Crash: *

Kenneth Eriksson in an Accent WRC at the 2001 Rally Finland


Hyundai's Accent World Rally Car competed in an official capacity, spawning three generations, in the World Rally Championship from 2000 to 2003. After development and testing in 1999, the Hyundai World Rally Team and Motor Sport Developments (MSD) debuted the Accent WRC at the 2000 Swedish Rally.[59] The second evolution, Accent WRC2, featured revised aerodynamics, active front differential, longer suspension travel and improved suspension top mounts, although most of the attention was directed at improving reliability. Like its predecessor's, the car's best result in a WRC event remained a fourth place.[60] The Accent WRC3, featuring new dampers and engine internals among other changes, debuted at the 2002 Tour de Corse.[61] Due to budget constraints, the car's development was virtually halted during the 2003 season. In September, Hyundai announced its withdrawal from the WRC.[62]
The car, though, in such capable hands across its lifespan as the four-time world champion Juha Kankkunen, ex-Subaru rally-winning and former Group A champion Kenneth Eriksson and former British Rally Champion Alister McRae, albeit the former two in the twilight of their careers, was reasonably competitive at times and showed some promise. Belgian Freddy Loix and 1991 Rally Catalunya winner Armin Schwarz were among the other drivers so long synonymous with life in the works-fettled Accents.[citation needed]
Junior Formula series[edit]
In India, Hyundai is the sole engine supplier for Formula LGB Hyundai, built by the Chain and Sprocket giant LGB. The single make series is promoted at grassroots level acting as a launch pad for future Formula One hopefuls. The Accent engine is supplied in Stock form albeit after some engine control unit modifications.[citation needed]
Excel Rally Series[edit]
In Australia, the X3 Accent sold as the Hyundai Excel is used in the Excel Rally Series. There are restrictions on modifications to the vehicle to reduce cost and encourage competition.

The Hyundai Accent (Korean: 현대 엑센트), or Hyundai Verna (현대 베르나) in South Korea, is a subcompact car produced by Hyundai. In Australia, the first generation models carried over the Hyundai Excel name used by the Accent's predecessor. The Accent was replaced in 2000 by the Hyundai Verna in South Korea, although most international markets, including the USA, retained the "Accent" name.
The Accent is produced for the Chinese market by Beijing Hyundai Co., a joint venture with Beijing Automotive Industry Corp. For the Russian market it is assembled by the TagAZ plant in Taganrog. In Mexico, the Accent was marketed until 2014 by Chrysler as the Dodge Attitude, previously known as the Verna by Dodge. In Venezuela, Chrysler marketed these models as the Dodge Brisa until 2006. The Brisa was assembled by Mitsubishi Motors at its plant in Barcelona, Venezuela. Since 2002, the Accent had been the longest-running small family car sold in North America. In Puerto Rico, it has been sold as the Hyundai Accent too. In Russia, it is sold as the Hyundai Solaris.
In 2008, Hyundai Accent was named the most dependable sub-compact car by J.D. Power and Associates.[1]

The Hyundai Accent (X3) was introduced as a replacement for the Excel in 1994 for the 1995 model year. It continued to be called Dodge Brisa in Venezuela or Hyundai Excel in some markets, such as the Netherlands, Belgium and Australia. In France, it was called the Hyundai Pony and in China, it was called the Kia Qianlima.
Australian cars were released in November 1994 available in Sprint and GX trims (three-door hatchback) or LX and GLX trims (four-door sedan and five-door hatchback). The upper-specification models (GX and GLX) had full cloth interior (as opposed to vinyl seat backings), height and lumbar support adjustments on the driver's seat, four-speaker sound system (instead of two), passenger vanity mirror, a tachometer, and power antenna as standard. GX three-doors also had a standard rear spoiler, while power steering was standard on all but the Sprint. There were also some special editions—the Classique sedan in 1996 with anti-lock brakes and the Sportz in 1999 and 2000 with alloy wheels and a rear spoiler. The overwhelming majority sold were the Sprint three-door, enticing buyers with free air-conditioning, driveaway pricing and from late 1998, standard power steering.
The facelift arrived in Australia in April 1997 with accompanying trim changes. The engine was a 1.5-liter G4EK SOHC unit with 91 hp (68 kW). From November 1997 onwards, this was upgraded to a twin cam (DOHC) G4FK version with 74 kW (99 hp) at 6000 rpm and torque of 134 N·m (99 lb·ft) at 4000 rpm. A double overhead cam (DOHC) engine was also available in America in the Accent GT but made a more-powerful 105 hp (78 kW) at 6000 rpm instead.[9] X3s with the DOHC engine are badged "Twin Cam".
In Australia, the X3 proved so popular (due to its reliability and low price[10][11][12]) that it was the third best-selling vehicle in the country in both 1996 and 1998. In the latter year, it achieved more than 44,000 sales (a 5.5% share of the total market), a record figure at the time, for an imported car. Between 1994 and 2000, some 200,000 X3s were sold in Australia, making it arguably the most successful imported vehicle in the country's history.
The Accent was sold in saloon (sedan), hatchback, and coupé form in the UK, with a choice of three engines for each: a 1.3 12v (85 hp), 1.5 12v (92 hp) and a 1.5 16v (105 hp) petrol. There was no diesel option. A GSi spec car was the top-specification Accent. The MVi-spec coupé version won particular praise for its handling agility in the UK. Although the Accent was cheap to buy and insure, its engines were quite thirsty; the 1.5-litre returned 33 mpg‑imp (8.6 L/100 km; 27 mpg‑US) average according to list figures.
In the US, although manuals exist for Accents before and after 1999, a manual for 1999 Hyundai Accent has not been published. Additionally, owners of the 1999 model were informed by their dealers that the power output of the 1.5-liter engine was in fact rated at 88 horsepower (66 kW).
In China, the Hyundai Accent was branded as the Kia Qianlima under Dongfeng Yueda Kia. It came with either a 1.3- or 1.6-liter engine. Production ran from December 2002 until November 2006. It had similar styling to the regular Hyundai Accent until it was given a facelift in 2005 featuring a new grille and foglamps. Trim levels included the 1.3 DLX, 1.3L GL (Manual), 1.3L GL (Automatic), 1.6 GLS (Manual) and the 1.6 GLS (Automatic).
Safety[edit]
The 1998 Hyundai Accent was crash-tested by the European New Car Assessment Programme and showed rather poor performance, scoring only 4 points out of 16 for frontal impact.[13] The passenger compartment became unstable in the crash test.[13] It was determined that there was an unacceptable high risk of chest injury during side impact crash, as a result, the car would not meet the minimum legal requirement in 1999.[13] The Swedish insurance company, Folksam, rates the 1st-gen Accent as one of the safest cars in its weight class.[14]

The redesigned 1999 Accent (LC) sported a more angular body and increased dimensions. It received a minor facelift in 2003, and was given the model code LC2. When the Accent sedan underwent a 2006 redesign, the hatchback continued on sale during 2006 only in Canada, since the hatchback skipped the 2006 model year for the United States. But for Korea, it was the first model with the new nameplate: Verna.
The Accent got new 1.5-liter 12-valve SOHC and 16-valve DOHC engines: the 1.3 continued modified with a Helmholtz resonator intake after 2003. A 1.6-liter replaced the 1.5 engine for 2000. This Accent was also the first to get a diesel version, with a 1.5-litre three-cylinder direct injection turbodiesel, which was badged CRDi.
Trim levels were GSi, CDX and MVi: this was standard on most export versions, although some European markets had their own designations with names like DynamicVersion etc. Some markets used LS and GLS.
In North America the Accent was available in GL, GLS and GT trim levels only, with the 1.5-litre engine at first, then the 1.6-litre engine from 2002. The GT version was similar to the MVi version marketed in Europe and Oceania, although the body kit was not as overtly hot hatch styled.
During 2003 in Canada, the hatchback was offered as a GS or GSi with a 1.5 L or 1.6 L engine, respectively.
It was sold in Russia until 2011 as the Hyundai Accent side-by-side with the 3rd generation model which is sold as the Hyundai Verna.
It was launched in India in October 1999 as the "Accent" and was still in production after some minor facelifts;[15] the car was phased out in 2013 for local market.[23] A new variant of the India-made Hyundai Accent. The Accent GLS variant, which now adopts front airbags and ABS to meet the regulations on safety equipment on new vehicles, implies that the Accent could live on until 2017.
The GLS variant also comes with Air conditioning, power windows front and rear, power steering, central locking, Radio-CD-MP3 audio system, and front fog lights. It is the best selling model produce by Hyundai's Chennai plant. It has been restyled twice – in 2004 and 2010 – and is strapped with a 1.5-liter four-cylinder petrol engine matched to a five-speed manual gearbox.
In India, the Accent's was replaced by the Hyundai Xcent, a compact sedan based on the Grand i10 platform. The Accent (LC) has built up a solid reputation for being a reliable and low-maintenance car, giving Hyundai no reason to discontinue it.

Safety[edit]
A pre-2003 model (a three-door hatchback) was crash tested by Australian Australasian New Car Assessment Program (ANCAP) under the rules as adopted by Euro NCAP. It scored 10.76 out of 16 points for frontal offset impact and 10.96 out of 16 in the side impact test.[24]
The same un-restyled model, a four-door sedan (which is still in production in Egypt) had been crash tested by Russian magazine Autoreview in 2005.[25] Test was carried out to the Euro NCAP regulations. Despite the lack of airbags (which are not available in the cheapest version of Accent on the Russian market) it scored 9.9 of 16 for frontal impact.[26]
The 2003 restyled model was tested by ANCAP as well. The three-door hatchback scored 9.19 of 16 points for frontal impact and 9.76 out of 16 in the side impact crash test.[27]

Hyundai introduced a new-generation Accent (MC) at the 2005 New York International Auto Show. A new exterior, larger interior, and CVVT engine are the notable features.
A single trim level, GLS, is available in the US for the sedan. This sedan includes 6 airbags, air conditioning, power steering with tilt, with optional four-wheel disc antilock brakes with electronic brake-force distribution, and a 6-speaker CD stereo. A premium sport package includes air conditioning, 15-inch alloy wheels, power windows and heated mirrors, and remote power door locks. An automatic transmission is also available.
Hyundai began selling the 3-door hatchback in the United States during the spring 2006 as a 2007 model year vehicle. The 3-door is available in two trims – GS and SE. The GS is equipped much like the GLS sedan, with some equipment deleted for a base price of US$10,415. The SE replaces the former Accent GT, offering a sport-tuned suspension, 16 in. alloy wheels, and other sporting features, along with available dealer-installed performance parts such as a cold-air intake and suspension stress bar. The SE is sold as the Verna Sport in Korea. The Hyundai Accent SR is exclusive to Canada and only 500 have been made, this version is like the Accent SE, but in addition has the fender flares, front lip, rear lip, and exhaust tip. Also included with the SR version is the Clarion sound system with, 4channel Amplifier with 400 Watts, 7 speaker Audio System, with 10-inch (250 mm) Subwoofer in a custom made box. Dash also has a Carbon Fiber Trim Kit added to it. For the 2010 model year a "Blue" trim level has been introduced for the Accent with a base price of only US$9,970.[33] The Accent Blue is only available as a 3-door hatchback with a manual transmission, the sole option being air-conditioning which adds $1,000 to the price.
The Accent is presently the third-bestselling subcompact car in the United States, trailing after its rivals the Chevrolet Aveo and Toyota Yaris.[citation needed] In 2010, Forbes named the Accent amongst the ten worst cars for depreciation.[34]
In Europe, this model was heavily promoted by the motoring press, and even Hyundai themselves, as a "stopgap" model – that it was intended merely to plug the gap in Hyundai's range until a brand new small family car was launched in 2007. The new car, the Hyundai i30, replaced both the Accent and the larger Hyundai Elantra. The name change helped to distance the new model from the budget reputation of the Accent, and also to highlight that the new car can truly compete in the small family hatchback sector – something the Accent was slightly too small to do, and the Elantra too large.[citation needed] The Accent continued to be sold in the U.S. in 2008 with an instrument panel overhaul and standard rear cupholders in the SE model.[citation needed]
Engines:

1.4 L I4, 97.3 PS (72 kW; 96 hp) and 127 N·m (94 lb·ft)
1.6 L CVVT Alpha II I4, 112 PS (82 kW; 110 hp) and 145 N·m (107 lb·ft)
1.5 L D I4 turbodiesel, 110 PS (81 kW; 108 hp) and 235 N·m (173 lb·ft), fitted with common rail direct injection and variable geometry turbocharger

In Mexico, this is marketed as the Dodge Attitude: trim levels are 1.4 GL and 1.6 GLS. Hyundai has no official representation in Mexico, so select Hyundai models are rebranded as Dodges under an agreement with Chrysler's Mexican division.
In India, it is marketed as Hyundai Verna. The previous generation remains in production alongside as a cheaper alternative, marketed as the Hyundai Accent.
In Egypt, this generation is sold as the Hyundai New Accent (1.6 GLS only), and the previous model is still locally produced and sold as the Hyundai Verna (1.6 GL and GLS trims)
In 2008, Hyundai Accent received the lowest number of problems per 100 vehicles among compact multi-activity vehicles in the proprietary J.D. Power and Associates 2008 Vehicle Dependability StudySM. Study based on responses from over 52,000 original owners of 2005 model-year vehicles, measuring more than 250 models. Proprietary study results are based on experiences and perceptions of owners surveyed in January to April 2008.[1]
Safety[edit]
In 2006, according to the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, the Accent received an Acceptable overall score in the frontal crash test and a Poor overall score for in the side impact test without its optional side airbags. It didn't perform well even when equipped with side airbags, performance of the car's structure is marginal there would likely be injuries to internal organs, ribs and pelvis.[35][36][37] In 2007, 2006 year model of Hyundai Accent had been tested by ANCAP in June 2007. It scored 3 star in the Occupant Protection, and 2 star in Pedestrian Protection Rating.[38]

Hybrid[edit]
Hyundai debuted a demonstration version of a hybrid (MC/JB) Accent[39] at the 2005 Guangzhou International Automobile Exhibition in Guangzhou, China. It uses a 90 hp (67 kW), 1.4 L engine with continuously variable valve timing and a 16 hp (11.9 kW) electric motor to achieve 44% better fuel economy. Though originally scheduled for production release in the 2006 model year, introduction of the production version has been delayed indefinitely, along with the Kia Rio hybrid.[citation needed]
The hybrid Accent is expected to be introduced at the same time as a hybrid[40] version of the Kia Rio, the Kia twin of the Accent. A concept model of the Kia Rio hybrid was shown at the 2007 Geneva Auto Show.[citation needed]

Marketing[edit]
South Korea[edit]
Hyundai released the Korean version of the Accent (RB series) on November 2010. The new model is offered with the same 1.6-liter engine and 6-speed automatic or 6-speed manual as the fifth-generation (MD) Elantra. The car reverted to the "Accent" name as used in the X3 series.[44] The hatchback version, called Accent WIT, replaces the Getz/Click in South Korea.
China[edit]
In Beijing, China, Hyundai released the China-exclusive version of this model under the "Verna" name on 23 August 2010.[45]
North America[edit]
In January 2011, the sedan had its North American debut and the hatchback had its world debut at the Montreal Auto Show.[46]
There are two new engines matched with the new Accent including a 1.4 with 106 horsepower (79 kW), and a 1.6 with 138 hp (103 kW). Both featuring the latest technology in variable valve timing (1.4 "VVT") and direct fuel injection (1.6 "GDI").
Russia[edit]
In September 2010, Hyundai unveiled its Russian assembly line and presented the "Hyundai Solaris" a production-ready local version of the four-door fourth generation Accent. Hyundai reported that production would commence in January 2011.[47] The Accent badge remained reserved for the second generation Accent, still produced in Taganrog in the TagAZ plant. Hyundai Solaris was available with 1.4 (107 hp) and 1.6 (123 hp) petrol engines, with 6-speed MT or 4-speed AT.[48]
In 2014, the Hyundai Solaris for Russian and CIS (were it sold as Hyundai Accent) market was facelifted. The car got new front fascia and new 6-speed automatic and 6-speed manual gearboxes for 1.6 version.[49]
India[edit]
In May 2011, Hyundai launched the Verna in India with four engine options including 1.4-litre petrol and diesel engines as well as 1.6-litre petrol and diesel engines. The second-generation (LC) continues to be sold in India as the Hyundai Accent with the latest RB version carrying the Verna brand. At the time of launch, the new Verna RB features safety and comfort options that were previously unavailable in the Indian market at this price point including the option of 6 airbags.[50] Hyundai refreshed the Indian lineup of Verna in 2014 without any engine changes.[51]
The 2014 line up changes include a new set of alloy wheels for the top end SX variant, projector headlamps, day time running LED lamps on the exterior. Most importantly, Hyundai has also worked upon the steering and the suspension. The steering being lighter had made high speed driving a difficult task and so did the soft suspensions. Dr. Nano introduced a new Composite Assistive C-Spring Suspension for Hyundai Fluidic Verna for high comfort. Henceforth, all suspension issues were solved. The springs are good not just for city driving, but also at high speed manners. Now, with the steering gaining some weight at high speeds and the better suspensions, the vertical movement of the car has considerably gone down.
The Diesel variant has attracted more attention in India because of its fuel economy - as a result the response in India was overwhelming and Hyundai could not handle all the orders. There are delays expected with 2–3-month waits in most locations and up to 5-month waits in others.
HMIL has launched the Verna with four engine options - 1.4 VTVT Petrol - 107 bhp, 135 Nm torque, 5-Speed manual, 12 kmpl under city conditions; 1.6 VTVT Petrol - 123 bhp, 160 Nm torque, 5-Speed manual/4-Speed Automatic, 10 kmpl / 8 kmpl; 1.4 CRDi Diesel - 90 bhp, 224 Nm torque, 6-Speed manual, 17 kmpl; 1.6 CRDi Diesel - 126 bhp, 260 Nm torque, 6-Speed manual/4-Speed Automatic, 14 kmpl / 12 kmpl.
Hyundai Fluidic Verna Facelift[edit]
Hyundai launched the Verna facelift in the Indian car market on 18 February 2015.[52] The new Verna mid-sized sedan gets changes to both styling and mechanism. The updated Hyundai Verna gets new front fascia. Apart from the same Petrol and Diesel engine versions, the four-speed automatic gearbox is likely to be offered in the upcoming model; however, the maker might also introduce the six-speed automatic gearbox.[53]
According to MotorBeam Hyundai has started testing the fifth generation Verna and the company will launch the new model in the Indian market in the second half of 2017.[54]
Indonesia[edit]
In Indonesia, the Accent hatchback is sold as the Grand Avega. The car made its debut at the 2011 Indonesia International Motor Show and is assembled locally.[55] The Grand Avega is equipped with two engines and three transmissions: a 1.4 L petrol 108ps Gamma engine with 4 a/t or 5 m/t and a 1.4 L petrol 100ps Kappa engine with 6 m/t.
Mexico[edit]
In Mexico it was marketed as Dodge Verna from 2004 a 2005 and as Dodge Attitude from 2006 a 2014 until may 2014 after Hyundai's arrival in the country, forcing Dodge to give the name Attitude to the Mitsubishi Attrage. It is unknown if the car will be reintroduced as the Hyundai Accent in 2015 or until the car's next redesign. In 2017 return with your name true Hyundai Accent as model 2018.
Philippines[edit]
In the Philippines, the third generation (MC sedan) was introduced and made available in 2006 exclusively with a 1.5 litre D4FA common rail direct injection (crdi) turbodiesel with VGT with 110hp and 240nm with a 5 m/t. A number of units saw action in the taxi industry because of fuel efficiency coupled with cheaper diesel fuel costs.
In 2011 came the RB model in both sedan and hatchback platforms. The sedan was powered by a 108ps Gamma engine with a 4 a/t or 5 m/t. Some of first batch of RB models were dogged by knocking issues when using 91 and below octane fuel. A second iteration was introduced in 2014 with a 100ps kappa engine with 6 m/t or 4 a/t and a 1.6 litre D4FB common rail direct injection turbodiesel with 126ps and 260NM in 6MT or 4AT variants. In 2015, the diesel variant comes with an electronic VGT in both 6 m/t and 7 speed dual clutch automatic transmission (DCT). Power outputs are now 136ps and 265nm for the 6 m/t while the DCT model at 136ps and 300nm.
The hatchback model was introduced at 2013 exclusively with a 1.6 D4FB common rail direct injection turbodiesel with VGT. Power output is at 126ps and 260nm. Both the 6 m/t and 4 a/t models came with anti-lock braking systems (ABS) with electronic brake distribution. By 2014, a faceliifted model was introduced with projector type headlamps anly the top end model in 4 a/t had ABS and EBD. By 2015, the engine had the e-vgt upgrade and now comes in 6 m/t and 7 speed DCT. Power outputs are now 136ps and 265nm for the 6 m/t while the DCT model at 136ps and 300nm.

The 2012 Hyundai Accent was tested by the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) and received the following:[57]

Overall Rating: 
Frontal Crash: 
Side Crash: *
Rollover: 

The Hyundai Verna was crash-tested by China NCAP in 2011 and scored the maximum possible 5 stars.[58]

WRC[edit]




Kenneth Eriksson in an Accent WRC at the 2001 Rally Finland


Hyundai's Accent World Rally Car competed in an official capacity, spawning three generations, in the World Rally Championship from 2000 to 2003. After development and testing in 1999, the Hyundai World Rally Team and Motor Sport Developments (MSD) debuted the Accent WRC at the 2000 Swedish Rally.[59] The second evolution, Accent WRC2, featured revised aerodynamics, active front differential, longer suspension travel and improved suspension top mounts, although most of the attention was directed at improving reliability. Like its predecessor's, the car's best result in a WRC event remained a fourth place.[60] The Accent WRC3, featuring new dampers and engine internals among other changes, debuted at the 2002 Tour de Corse.[61] Due to budget constraints, the car's development was virtually halted during the 2003 season. In September, Hyundai announced its withdrawal from the WRC.[62]
The car, though, in such capable hands across its lifespan as the four-time world champion Juha Kankkunen, ex-Subaru rally-winning and former Group A champion Kenneth Eriksson and former British Rally Champion Alister McRae, albeit the former two in the twilight of their careers, was reasonably competitive at times and showed some promise. Belgian Freddy Loix and 1991 Rally Catalunya winner Armin Schwarz were among the other drivers so long synonymous with life in the works-fettled Accents.[citation needed]
Junior Formula series[edit]
In India, Hyundai is the sole engine supplier for Formula LGB Hyundai, built by the Chain and Sprocket giant LGB. The single make series is promoted at grassroots level acting as a launch pad for future Formula One hopefuls. The Accent engine is supplied in Stock form albeit after some engine control unit modifications.[citation needed]
Excel Rally Series[edit]
In Australia, the X3 Accent sold as the Hyundai Excel is used in the Excel Rally Series. There are restrictions on modifications to the vehicle to reduce cost and encourage competition.

The Hyundai Accent (Korean: 현대 엑센트), or Hyundai Verna (현대 베르나) in South Korea, is a subcompact car produced by Hyundai. In Australia, the first generation models carried over the Hyundai Excel name used by the Accent's predecessor. The Accent was replaced in 2000 by the Hyundai Verna in South Korea, although most international markets, including the USA, retained the "Accent" name.
The Accent is produced for the Chinese market by Beijing Hyundai Co., a joint venture with Beijing Automotive Industry Corp. For the Russian market it is assembled by the TagAZ plant in Taganrog. In Mexico, the Accent was marketed until 2014 by Chrysler as the Dodge Attitude, previously known as the Verna by Dodge. In Venezuela, Chrysler marketed these models as the Dodge Brisa until 2006. The Brisa was assembled by Mitsubishi Motors at its plant in Barcelona, Venezuela. Since 2002, the Accent had been the longest-running small family car sold in North America. In Puerto Rico, it has been sold as the Hyundai Accent too. In Russia, it is sold as the Hyundai Solaris.
In 2008, Hyundai Accent was named the most dependable sub-compact car by J.D. Power and Associates.[1]

The Hyundai Accent (X3) was introduced as a replacement for the Excel in 1994 for the 1995 model year. It continued to be called Dodge Brisa in Venezuela or Hyundai Excel in some markets, such as the Netherlands, Belgium and Australia. In France, it was called the Hyundai Pony and in China, it was called the Kia Qianlima.
Australian cars were released in November 1994 available in Sprint and GX trims (three-door hatchback) or LX and GLX trims (four-door sedan and five-door hatchback). The upper-specification models (GX and GLX) had full cloth interior (as opposed to vinyl seat backings), height and lumbar support adjustments on the driver's seat, four-speaker sound system (instead of two), passenger vanity mirror, a tachometer, and power antenna as standard. GX three-doors also had a standard rear spoiler, while power steering was standard on all but the Sprint. There were also some special editions—the Classique sedan in 1996 with anti-lock brakes and the Sportz in 1999 and 2000 with alloy wheels and a rear spoiler. The overwhelming majority sold were the Sprint three-door, enticing buyers with free air-conditioning, driveaway pricing and from late 1998, standard power steering.
The facelift arrived in Australia in April 1997 with accompanying trim changes. The engine was a 1.5-liter G4EK SOHC unit with 91 hp (68 kW). From November 1997 onwards, this was upgraded to a twin cam (DOHC) G4FK version with 74 kW (99 hp) at 6000 rpm and torque of 134 N·m (99 lb·ft) at 4000 rpm. A double overhead cam (DOHC) engine was also available in America in the Accent GT but made a more-powerful 105 hp (78 kW) at 6000 rpm instead.[9] X3s with the DOHC engine are badged "Twin Cam".
In Australia, the X3 proved so popular (due to its reliability and low price[10][11][12]) that it was the third best-selling vehicle in the country in both 1996 and 1998. In the latter year, it achieved more than 44,000 sales (a 5.5% share of the total market), a record figure at the time, for an imported car. Between 1994 and 2000, some 200,000 X3s were sold in Australia, making it arguably the most successful imported vehicle in the country's history.
The Accent was sold in saloon (sedan), hatchback, and coupé form in the UK, with a choice of three engines for each: a 1.3 12v (85 hp), 1.5 12v (92 hp) and a 1.5 16v (105 hp) petrol. There was no diesel option. A GSi spec car was the top-specification Accent. The MVi-spec coupé version won particular praise for its handling agility in the UK. Although the Accent was cheap to buy and insure, its engines were quite thirsty; the 1.5-litre returned 33 mpg‑imp (8.6 L/100 km; 27 mpg‑US) average according to list figures.
In the US, although manuals exist for Accents before and after 1999, a manual for 1999 Hyundai Accent has not been published. Additionally, owners of the 1999 model were informed by their dealers that the power output of the 1.5-liter engine was in fact rated at 88 horsepower (66 kW).
In China, the Hyundai Accent was branded as the Kia Qianlima under Dongfeng Yueda Kia. It came with either a 1.3- or 1.6-liter engine. Production ran from December 2002 until November 2006. It had similar styling to the regular Hyundai Accent until it was given a facelift in 2005 featuring a new grille and foglamps. Trim levels included the 1.3 DLX, 1.3L GL (Manual), 1.3L GL (Automatic), 1.6 GLS (Manual) and the 1.6 GLS (Automatic).
Safety[edit]
The 1998 Hyundai Accent was crash-tested by the European New Car Assessment Programme and showed rather poor performance, scoring only 4 points out of 16 for frontal impact.[13] The passenger compartment became unstable in the crash test.[13] It was determined that there was an unacceptable high risk of chest injury during side impact crash, as a result, the car would not meet the minimum legal requirement in 1999.[13] The Swedish insurance company, Folksam, rates the 1st-gen Accent as one of the safest cars in its weight class.[14]

The redesigned 1999 Accent (LC) sported a more angular body and increased dimensions. It received a minor facelift in 2003, and was given the model code LC2. When the Accent sedan underwent a 2006 redesign, the hatchback continued on sale during 2006 only in Canada, since the hatchback skipped the 2006 model year for the United States. But for Korea, it was the first model with the new nameplate: Verna.
The Accent got new 1.5-liter 12-valve SOHC and 16-valve DOHC engines: the 1.3 continued modified with a Helmholtz resonator intake after 2003. A 1.6-liter replaced the 1.5 engine for 2000. This Accent was also the first to get a diesel version, with a 1.5-litre three-cylinder direct injection turbodiesel, which was badged CRDi.
Trim levels were GSi, CDX and MVi: this was standard on most export versions, although some European markets had their own designations with names like DynamicVersion etc. Some markets used LS and GLS.
In North America the Accent was available in GL, GLS and GT trim levels only, with the 1.5-litre engine at first, then the 1.6-litre engine from 2002. The GT version was similar to the MVi version marketed in Europe and Oceania, although the body kit was not as overtly hot hatch styled.
During 2003 in Canada, the hatchback was offered as a GS or GSi with a 1.5 L or 1.6 L engine, respectively.
It was sold in Russia until 2011 as the Hyundai Accent side-by-side with the 3rd generation model which is sold as the Hyundai Verna.
It was launched in India in October 1999 as the "Accent" and was still in production after some minor facelifts;[15] the car was phased out in 2013 for local market.[23] A new variant of the India-made Hyundai Accent. The Accent GLS variant, which now adopts front airbags and ABS to meet the regulations on safety equipment on new vehicles, implies that the Accent could live on until 2017.
The GLS variant also comes with Air conditioning, power windows front and rear, power steering, central locking, Radio-CD-MP3 audio system, and front fog lights. It is the best selling model produce by Hyundai's Chennai plant. It has been restyled twice – in 2004 and 2010 – and is strapped with a 1.5-liter four-cylinder petrol engine matched to a five-speed manual gearbox.
In India, the Accent's was replaced by the Hyundai Xcent, a compact sedan based on the Grand i10 platform. The Accent (LC) has built up a solid reputation for being a reliable and low-maintenance car, giving Hyundai no reason to discontinue it.

Safety[edit]
A pre-2003 model (a three-door hatchback) was crash tested by Australian Australasian New Car Assessment Program (ANCAP) under the rules as adopted by Euro NCAP. It scored 10.76 out of 16 points for frontal offset impact and 10.96 out of 16 in the side impact test.[24]
The same un-restyled model, a four-door sedan (which is still in production in Egypt) had been crash tested by Russian magazine Autoreview in 2005.[25] Test was carried out to the Euro NCAP regulations. Despite the lack of airbags (which are not available in the cheapest version of Accent on the Russian market) it scored 9.9 of 16 for frontal impact.[26]
The 2003 restyled model was tested by ANCAP as well. The three-door hatchback scored 9.19 of 16 points for frontal impact and 9.76 out of 16 in the side impact crash test.[27]

Hatch



Hyundai introduced a new-generation Accent (MC) at the 2005 New York International Auto Show. A new exterior, larger interior, and CVVT engine are the notable features.
A single trim level, GLS, is available in the US for the sedan. This sedan includes 6 airbags, air conditioning, power steering with tilt, with optional four-wheel disc antilock brakes with electronic brake-force distribution, and a 6-speaker CD stereo. A premium sport package includes air conditioning, 15-inch alloy wheels, power windows and heated mirrors, and remote power door locks. An automatic transmission is also available.
Hyundai began selling the 3-door hatchback in the United States during the spring 2006 as a 2007 model year vehicle. The 3-door is available in two trims – GS and SE. The GS is equipped much like the GLS sedan, with some equipment deleted for a base price of US$10,415. The SE replaces the former Accent GT, offering a sport-tuned suspension, 16 in. alloy wheels, and other sporting features, along with available dealer-installed performance parts such as a cold-air intake and suspension stress bar. The SE is sold as the Verna Sport in Korea. The Hyundai Accent SR is exclusive to Canada and only 500 have been made, this version is like the Accent SE, but in addition has the fender flares, front lip, rear lip, and exhaust tip. Also included with the SR version is the Clarion sound system with, 4channel Amplifier with 400 Watts, 7 speaker Audio System, with 10-inch (250 mm) Subwoofer in a custom made box. Dash also has a Carbon Fiber Trim Kit added to it. For the 2010 model year a "Blue" trim level has been introduced for the Accent with a base price of only US$9,970.[33] The Accent Blue is only available as a 3-door hatchback with a manual transmission, the sole option being air-conditioning which adds $1,000 to the price.
The Accent is presently the third-bestselling subcompact car in the United States, trailing after its rivals the Chevrolet Aveo and Toyota Yaris.[citation needed] In 2010, Forbes named the Accent amongst the ten worst cars for depreciation.[34]
In Europe, this model was heavily promoted by the motoring press, and even Hyundai themselves, as a "stopgap" model – that it was intended merely to plug the gap in Hyundai's range until a brand new small family car was launched in 2007. The new car, the Hyundai i30, replaced both the Accent and the larger Hyundai Elantra. The name change helped to distance the new model from the budget reputation of the Accent, and also to highlight that the new car can truly compete in the small family hatchback sector – something the Accent was slightly too small to do, and the Elantra too large.[citation needed] The Accent continued to be sold in the U.S. in 2008 with an instrument panel overhaul and standard rear cupholders in the SE model.[citation needed]
Engines:

1.4 L I4, 97.3 PS (72 kW; 96 hp) and 127 N·m (94 lb·ft)
1.6 L CVVT Alpha II I4, 112 PS (82 kW; 110 hp) and 145 N·m (107 lb·ft)
1.5 L D I4 turbodiesel, 110 PS (81 kW; 108 hp) and 235 N·m (173 lb·ft), fitted with common rail direct injection and variable geometry turbocharger

In Mexico, this is marketed as the Dodge Attitude: trim levels are 1.4 GL and 1.6 GLS. Hyundai has no official representation in Mexico, so select Hyundai models are rebranded as Dodges under an agreement with Chrysler's Mexican division.
In India, it is marketed as Hyundai Verna. The previous generation remains in production alongside as a cheaper alternative, marketed as the Hyundai Accent.
In Egypt, this generation is sold as the Hyundai New Accent (1.6 GLS only), and the previous model is still locally produced and sold as the Hyundai Verna (1.6 GL and GLS trims)
In 2008, Hyundai Accent received the lowest number of problems per 100 vehicles among compact multi-activity vehicles in the proprietary J.D. Power and Associates 2008 Vehicle Dependability StudySM. Study based on responses from over 52,000 original owners of 2005 model-year vehicles, measuring more than 250 models. Proprietary study results are based on experiences and perceptions of owners surveyed in January to April 2008.[1]
Safety[edit]
In 2006, according to the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, the Accent received an Acceptable overall score in the frontal crash test and a Poor overall score for in the side impact test without its optional side airbags. It didn't perform well even when equipped with side airbags, performance of the car's structure is marginal there would likely be injuries to internal organs, ribs and pelvis.[35][36][37] In 2007, 2006 year model of Hyundai Accent had been tested by ANCAP in June 2007. It scored 3 star in the Occupant Protection, and 2 star in Pedestrian Protection Rating.[38]

Hybrid[edit]
Hyundai debuted a demonstration version of a hybrid (MC/JB) Accent[39] at the 2005 Guangzhou International Automobile Exhibition in Guangzhou, China. It uses a 90 hp (67 kW), 1.4 L engine with continuously variable valve timing and a 16 hp (11.9 kW) electric motor to achieve 44% better fuel economy. Though originally scheduled for production release in the 2006 model year, introduction of the production version has been delayed indefinitely, along with the Kia Rio hybrid.[citation needed]
The hybrid Accent is expected to be introduced at the same time as a hybrid[40] version of the Kia Rio, the Kia twin of the Accent. A concept model of the Kia Rio hybrid was shown at the 2007 Geneva Auto Show.[citation needed]

Marketing[edit]
South Korea[edit]
Hyundai released the Korean version of the Accent (RB series) on November 2010. The new model is offered with the same 1.6-liter engine and 6-speed automatic or 6-speed manual as the fifth-generation (MD) Elantra. The car reverted to the "Accent" name as used in the X3 series.[44] The hatchback version, called Accent WIT, replaces the Getz/Click in South Korea.
China[edit]
In Beijing, China, Hyundai released the China-exclusive version of this model under the "Verna" name on 23 August 2010.[45]
North America[edit]
In January 2011, the sedan had its North American debut and the hatchback had its world debut at the Montreal Auto Show.[46]
There are two new engines matched with the new Accent including a 1.4 with 106 horsepower (79 kW), and a 1.6 with 138 hp (103 kW). Both featuring the latest technology in variable valve timing (1.4 "VVT") and direct fuel injection (1.6 "GDI").
Russia[edit]
In September 2010, Hyundai unveiled its Russian assembly line and presented the "Hyundai Solaris" a production-ready local version of the four-door fourth generation Accent. Hyundai reported that production would commence in January 2011.[47] The Accent badge remained reserved for the second generation Accent, still produced in Taganrog in the TagAZ plant. Hyundai Solaris was available with 1.4 (107 hp) and 1.6 (123 hp) petrol engines, with 6-speed MT or 4-speed AT.[48]
In 2014, the Hyundai Solaris for Russian and CIS (were it sold as Hyundai Accent) market was facelifted. The car got new front fascia and new 6-speed automatic and 6-speed manual gearboxes for 1.6 version.[49]
India[edit]
In May 2011, Hyundai launched the Verna in India with four engine options including 1.4-litre petrol and diesel engines as well as 1.6-litre petrol and diesel engines. The second-generation (LC) continues to be sold in India as the Hyundai Accent with the latest RB version carrying the Verna brand. At the time of launch, the new Verna RB features safety and comfort options that were previously unavailable in the Indian market at this price point including the option of 6 airbags.[50] Hyundai refreshed the Indian lineup of Verna in 2014 without any engine changes.[51]
The 2014 line up changes include a new set of alloy wheels for the top end SX variant, projector headlamps, day time running LED lamps on the exterior. Most importantly, Hyundai has also worked upon the steering and the suspension. The steering being lighter had made high speed driving a difficult task and so did the soft suspensions. Dr. Nano introduced a new Composite Assistive C-Spring Suspension for Hyundai Fluidic Verna for high comfort. Henceforth, all suspension issues were solved. The springs are good not just for city driving, but also at high speed manners. Now, with the steering gaining some weight at high speeds and the better suspensions, the vertical movement of the car has considerably gone down.
The Diesel variant has attracted more attention in India because of its fuel economy - as a result the response in India was overwhelming and Hyundai could not handle all the orders. There are delays expected with 2–3-month waits in most locations and up to 5-month waits in others.
HMIL has launched the Verna with four engine options - 1.4 VTVT Petrol - 107 bhp, 135 Nm torque, 5-Speed manual, 12 kmpl under city conditions; 1.6 VTVT Petrol - 123 bhp, 160 Nm torque, 5-Speed manual/4-Speed Automatic, 10 kmpl / 8 kmpl; 1.4 CRDi Diesel - 90 bhp, 224 Nm torque, 6-Speed manual, 17 kmpl; 1.6 CRDi Diesel - 126 bhp, 260 Nm torque, 6-Speed manual/4-Speed Automatic, 14 kmpl / 12 kmpl.
Hyundai Fluidic Verna Facelift[edit]
Hyundai launched the Verna facelift in the Indian car market on 18 February 2015.[52] The new Verna mid-sized sedan gets changes to both styling and mechanism. The updated Hyundai Verna gets new front fascia. Apart from the same Petrol and Diesel engine versions, the four-speed automatic gearbox is likely to be offered in the upcoming model; however, the maker might also introduce the six-speed automatic gearbox.[53]
According to MotorBeam Hyundai has started testing the fifth generation Verna and the company will launch the new model in the Indian market in the second half of 2017.[54]
Indonesia[edit]
In Indonesia, the Accent hatchback is sold as the Grand Avega. The car made its debut at the 2011 Indonesia International Motor Show and is assembled locally.[55] The Grand Avega is equipped with two engines and three transmissions: a 1.4 L petrol 108ps Gamma engine with 4 a/t or 5 m/t and a 1.4 L petrol 100ps Kappa engine with 6 m/t.
Mexico[edit]
In Mexico it was marketed as Dodge Verna from 2004 a 2005 and as Dodge Attitude from 2006 a 2014 until may 2014 after Hyundai's arrival in the country, forcing Dodge to give the name Attitude to the Mitsubishi Attrage. It is unknown if the car will be reintroduced as the Hyundai Accent in 2015 or until the car's next redesign. In 2017 return with your name true Hyundai Accent as model 2018.
Philippines[edit]
In the Philippines, the third generation (MC sedan) was introduced and made available in 2006 exclusively with a 1.5 litre D4FA common rail direct injection (crdi) turbodiesel with VGT with 110hp and 240nm with a 5 m/t. A number of units saw action in the taxi industry because of fuel efficiency coupled with cheaper diesel fuel costs.
In 2011 came the RB model in both sedan and hatchback platforms. The sedan was powered by a 108ps Gamma engine with a 4 a/t or 5 m/t. Some of first batch of RB models were dogged by knocking issues when using 91 and below octane fuel. A second iteration was introduced in 2014 with a 100ps kappa engine with 6 m/t or 4 a/t and a 1.6 litre D4FB common rail direct injection turbodiesel with 126ps and 260NM in 6MT or 4AT variants. In 2015, the diesel variant comes with an electronic VGT in both 6 m/t and 7 speed dual clutch automatic transmission (DCT). Power outputs are now 136ps and 265nm for the 6 m/t while the DCT model at 136ps and 300nm.
The hatchback model was introduced at 2013 exclusively with a 1.6 D4FB common rail direct injection turbodiesel with VGT. Power output is at 126ps and 260nm.

WRC[edit]




Kenneth Eriksson in an Accent WRC at the 2001 Rally Finland


Hyundai's Accent World Rally Car competed in an official capacity, spawning three generations, in the World Rally Championship from 2000 to 2003. After development and testing in 1999, the Hyundai World Rally Team and Motor Sport Developments (MSD) debuted the Accent WRC at the 2000 Swedish Rally.[59] The second evolution, Accent WRC2, featured revised aerodynamics, active front differential, longer suspension travel and improved suspension top mounts, although most of the attention was directed at improving reliability. Like its predecessor's, the car's best result in a WRC event remained a fourth place.[60] The Accent WRC3, featuring new dampers and engine internals among other changes, debuted at the 2002 Tour de Corse.[61] Due to budget constraints, the car's development was virtually halted during the 2003 season. In September, Hyundai announced its withdrawal from the WRC.[62]
The car, though, in such capable hands across its lifespan as the four-time world champion Juha Kankkunen, ex-Subaru rally-winning and former Group A champion Kenneth Eriksson and former British Rally Champion Alister McRae, albeit the former two in the twilight of their careers, was reasonably competitive at times and showed some promise. Belgian Freddy Loix and 1991 Rally Catalunya winner Armin Schwarz were among the other drivers so long synonymous with life in the works-fettled Accents.[citation needed]
Junior Formula series[edit]
In India, Hyundai is the sole engine supplier for Formula LGB Hyundai, built by the Chain and Sprocket giant LGB. The single make series is promoted at grassroots level acting as a launch pad for future Formula One hopefuls. The Accent engine is supplied in Stock form albeit after some engine control unit modifications.[citation needed]
Excel Rally Series[edit]
In Australia, the X3 Accent sold as the Hyundai Excel is used in the Excel Rally Series. There are restrictions on modifications to the vehicle to reduce cost and encourage competition.
