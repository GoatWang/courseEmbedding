Biography[edit]
Vagelos grew up during the Depression as a son of Greek immigrants. He attended Rahway High School in his hometown of Rahway, New Jersey.[2] After winning a partial scholarship, he left his family's small restaurant in Rahway, New Jersey, to become a doctor.[3] He majored in chemistry at the University of Pennsylvania, graduating Phi Beta Kappa in 1950. Vagelos later earned an M.D. from Columbia University in 1954.
Vagelos deferred military service while in medical school, but he was obligated to serve a two-year stint as an Army doctor. As a Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons trained surgeon and biochemist, Vagelos obtained a two-year assignment as a research physician at the National Institutes of Health (1956–1966). For Vagelos, it was a fateful turning point. He was associated with Massachusetts General Hospital, Washington University and the Washington University School of Medicine (1966–1975) before joining Merck, Sharp & Dohme Research Laboratories in Rahway (president 1976–1984).
The author of more than 100 scientific papers, Vagelos has been elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, the National Academy of Sciences and the American Philosophical Society.
Vagelos donated over 15 million dollars to the University of Pennsylvania to create the Roy and Diana Vagelos Laboratories. These funds also made possible the founding the Vagelos Scholars Program In Molecular Life Sciences, an intensive program offered to University of Pennsylvania freshman. In addition, he donated funds to launch the Vagelos Program in Life Sciences and Management, a joint program between the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania and its College of Arts and Sciences. Later, he founded the Vagelos Integrated Program in Energy Research, supporting the necessity of energy research.
In 1995, Vagelos received the NAS Award for Chemistry in Service to Society and was inducted into the Junior Achievement U.S. Business Hall of Fame. In 1999, he became a recipient of both the Bower Award for Business Leadership, as well as the Othmer Gold Medal.[4][5]
In 2010, Vagelos, who had earned his medical degree at Columbia University, and his wife, Diana, an alumna of Barnard College at Columbia University, donated 50 million dollars to the Columbia College of Physicians and Surgeons, towards the construction of a new building. Named the Roy and Diana Vagelos Education Center, it opened in August 2016.[6]
In 2013, Vagelos was invited to speak at the first annual Stony Brook University Research Your Future Symposium.
River Blindness[edit]
In the mid-1980s, Merck & Co. discovered the drug ivermectin, capable of combatting the parasite that causes river blindness. At the time, the World Health Organization and the World Bank were conducting a campaign against the vector-borne disease in West Africa, and ivermectin was the most important drug in their arsenal. But the newly discovered drug was too expensive for those patients or their governments. Vagelos "wanted to see the drug widely used," so he influenced Merck & Co. to "make needed quantities of the drug available to these governments and patients, at no cost to them, for the treatment of onchocerciasis.” Over two decades, beginning in 1986, the drug reached more than 55 million people. The public health campaign was successful, and now river blindness is no longer a major public health issue in the savannah areas of West Africa.[7]

Roy Vagelos





Dr. P. Roy Vagelos, M.D., C'50, earned his B.S. in chemistry from the College of Arts and Sciences at the University of Pennsylvania and his medical degree from the Columbia University School of Medicine.  His career – The Medicine, Science and Merck phenomenon – epitomizes the philosophy behind Penn’s Life Sciences & Management Program.  Upon completion of his internship and residency at the Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, he joined the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, where he served as Senior Surgeon and then Section Head of Comparative Biochemistry from 1956 to 1966.  It was during this time that he started his fundamental research on lipid metabolism and discovered the acyl-carrier protein (ACP), a key factor in this process.  Thereafter, Dr. Vagelos moved from the medical into the academic arena to assume the chairmanship of the Department of Biological Chemistry in Washington University’s School of Medicine, St Louis, MO where he founded and became Director of the University’s Division of Biology and Biomedical Sciences.  In so doing he established an unprecedented model for the fusion of a Medical School with an undergraduate Department of Biology, a model that many other universities were soon to emulate.
It was in 1975 that Dr. Vagelos left academia to join Merck, which he led with great distinction both as a scientist and visionary corporate leader, first as Senior Vice President for Research, and then starting in 1984 as CEO.  In this arena, he is perhaps best known for his role in two major objectives.  Not only was he the lead scientist in Merck’s development of the statin drugs, Lovastatin and Zocor, cardiovascular protective and remediative agents that serve to decrease blood cholesterol levels by inhibiting HMG-CoA reductase, the enzyme that catalyzes the step in which dietary carbon is committed to cholesterol biosynthesis, but he was also the key advocate in Merck’s decision to make Ivermectin freely available to the people of Africa and Central America for the treatment of river blindness, what was a widespread, chronic and debilitating disease disseminated by black flies.  At the peak of his leadership in the 1980s and early 1990s, up until his retirement from his position as CEO and Chairman of the Board in 1994, Merck was considered to be the world’s leader of the pharmaceutical industry. Dr. Vagelos is the author of more than 100 scientific papers and an elected member of the National Academy of Sciences (of which he is also a member of the Institute of Medicine), the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and the American Philosophical Society.  For his seminal work on ACP and leadership of Merck, Dr. Vagelos was awarded the American Chemical Society’s Enzyme Chemistry Award in 1967, the National Academy of Science's Chemistry in Service to Society Award in 1995 and was inducted into the National Business Hall of Fame in 1995.  In 1998, the School of Arts and Sciences bestowed upon him its Distinguished Alumni Award in recognition of his lifetime achievements in the sciences and humanities, and in 1999 he was honored by the Franklin Institute with the Bower Award for Business Leadership for his role in eradicating river blindness.
Dr. Vagelos’s current philanthropic activities are rich and varied and continue to span academia through medicine to industry.  He is chair of the Columbia University School of Physicians and Surgeons Development Campaign and of the board of directors of Regeneron Pharmaceuticals; co-chairman of the New Jersey Performing Arts Center; a trustee of The Danforth Foundation, Inc.; and a director of PepsiCo, Inc., the Prudential Insurance Company of America, The American School of Classical Studies at Athens, the Estee Lauder Companies, Inc.; and a former director of McDonnell Douglas.
At Penn, Dr. Vagelos has served on the board of trustees from 1988 until 1999, of which he was chair from 1995 to 1999, as well as chair of the trustees executive and nominating committees and is a member of the undergraduate financial aid committee and the Agenda for Excellence Council. Upon his retirement from the Board, he was named trustee emeritus.

                           Former Merck Chairman and CEO Roy Vagelos Honored by American Heart Association
                        










                          For his contributions to improving and saving lives, Dr. Vagelos was honored with the American Heart Association’s Inaugural Lifetime Achievement Award for Research and Science
                        









When former Merck Chairman and CEO P. Roy Vagelos arrived at Merck Research Laboratories in 1975, he brought his experience in cholesterol biosynthesis and a fierce determination to change the course of cardiovascular disease.
During his time at Merck, Dr. Vagelos and his colleagues pioneered treatments for heart disease, high cholesterol and hypertension. For this work and other contributions to improving and saving lives, Dr. Vagelos was honored June 8 with the American Heart Association’s Inaugural Lifetime Achievement Award for Research and Science.  Merck Chairman and CEO Ken Frazier presented the award to Dr. Vagelos at the American Heart Association’s event in New York City.
In commenting on his predecessor’s many achievements during his 19 years with the company, Ken noted that Dr. Vagelos had turned Merck “into one of the most powerful and predominant life science companies in the world.”  Ken commended Dr. Vagelos for his “enduring commitment to putting patients first,” adding: “And not just those patients who can afford a high standard of medicine.  That includes the billions of people who live in circumstances where even the basic necessities are hard to obtain.”
In presenting the award to Dr. Vagelos, Ken said, “Roy’s deep compassion and determination to ensure that scientific innovation thrives for the purpose of saving and improving people’s lives is just one of the many reasons why it is my privilege to present Dr. Roy Vagelos with the American Heart Association’s Inaugural Lifetime Achievement Award for Research and Science.”

P. Roy Vagelos

Pindaros Roy Vagelos better known as P. Roy Vagelos or Roy Vagelos (born 1929 in Westfield, New Jersey) was president and chief executive officer (1985) and chairman (1986) of Merck, he was widely admired for attracting top research scientists who developed many major new drugs. His experience gave him an unusual perspective on mastering three leading professions: medicine, science, business and went and become the Chief executive officer of the multinational pharmaceutical giant, Merck

  Biography 
Roy Vagelos grew up during the Depression as a  son of Greek immigrants. Vagelos attended Rahway High School in his hometown.[1] After winning a partial scholarship, he left his family's small restaurant in Rahway, New Jersey to become a doctor.[2] He majored in chemistry at the University of Pennsylvania, graduating Phi Beta Kappa in 1950.  Vagelos later earned an M.D. at Columbia University in 1954.
Vagelos was deferred from military service while in medical school, but he was obligated to serve a two-year stint as an Army doctor. As a Columbia University Medical School trained surgeon and biochemist, Vagelos obtained a two-year assignment as a research physician at the National Institutes of Health (1956-1966). For Vagelos, it was a fateful turning point. He was associated with Massachusetts General Hospital, Washington University and the Washington University School of Medicine (1966-1975) before joining Merck, Sharp & Dohme Research Laboratories in Rahway (president 1976-1984). 
The author of more than 100 scientific papers, Vagelos has been elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, the National Academy of Sciences and the American Philosophical Society.

Roy Vagelos, the corporate chairman."

                           Merck and the pharmaceutical industry are headline news today. Controversies over public safety, prices, and the ability of
                              the industry to develop the new drugs and vaccines that society needs have been covered worldwide. Roy Vagelos, who was head
                              of research and then CEO at Merck from the mid-1970s through the early 1990s, addresses these issues here. Success with targeted
                              research started Merck on a path that would lead to a series of block-buster therapies that carried the firm to the top of
                              the global industry in the 1990s and Vagelos into the top position at the company. Trained as a physician and scientist, he
                              had to learn how to run a successful business while holding to the highest principles of ethical behavior. He was not always
                              successful. He and his co-author explain where and why he failed to achieve his goals and carefully analyze where he succeeded

Pindaros Roy Vagelos, better known as P. Roy Vagelos or Roy Vagelos (born October 8, 1929 in Westfield, New Jersey), is an American physician and business executive, who was president and chief executive officer (1985) and chairman (1986) of the American pharmaceutical company Merck & Co. (known as MSD outside the U.S.). He attracted research scientists who developed many major new drugs.
Since 1995, Vagelos serves as Chairman of the Board of Regeneron pharmaceuticals.
In addition to his business accomplishments, Vagelos is the author of more than 100 scientific papers.[1] He is also on the Board of Trustees of the University of Pennsylvania and has funded three of the university's most elite undergraduate programs: The Vagelos Scholars Program in Molecular Life Sciences (MLS), The Vagelos Program in Life Sciences and Management (LSM) and The Vagelos Integrated Program in Energy Research (VIPER).

Biography[edit]
Vagelos grew up during the Depression as a son of Greek immigrants. He attended Rahway High School in his hometown of Rahway, New Jersey.[2] After winning a partial scholarship, he left his family's small restaurant in Rahway, New Jersey, to become a doctor.[3] He majored in chemistry at the University of Pennsylvania, graduating Phi Beta Kappa in 1950. Vagelos later earned an M.D. from Columbia University in 1954.
Vagelos deferred military service while in medical school, but he was obligated to serve a two-year stint as an Army doctor. As a Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons trained surgeon and biochemist, Vagelos obtained a two-year assignment as a research physician at the National Institutes of Health (1956–1966). For Vagelos, it was a fateful turning point. He was associated with Massachusetts General Hospital, Washington University and the Washington University School of Medicine (1966–1975) before joining Merck, Sharp & Dohme Research Laboratories in Rahway (president 1976–1984).
The author of more than 100 scientific papers, Vagelos has been elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, the National Academy of Sciences and the American Philosophical Society.
Vagelos donated over 15 million dollars to the University of Pennsylvania to create the Roy and Diana Vagelos Laboratories. These funds also made possible the founding the Vagelos Scholars Program In Molecular Life Sciences, an intensive program offered to University of Pennsylvania freshman. In addition, he donated funds to launch the Vagelos Program in Life Sciences and Management, a joint program between the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania and its College of Arts and Sciences. Later, he founded the Vagelos Integrated Program in Energy Research, supporting the necessity of energy research.
In 1995, Vagelos received the NAS Award for Chemistry in Service to Society and was inducted into the Junior Achievement U.S. Business Hall of Fame. In 1999, he became a recipient of both the Bower Award for Business Leadership, as well as the Othmer Gold Medal.[4][5]
In 2010, Vagelos, who had earned his medical degree at Columbia University, and his wife, Diana, an alumna of Barnard College at Columbia University, donated 50 million dollars to the Columbia College of Physicians and Surgeons, towards the construction of a new building. Named the Roy and Diana Vagelos Education Center, it opened in August 2016.[6]
In 2013, Vagelos was invited to speak at the first annual Stony Brook University Research Your Future Symposium.
River Blindness[edit]
In the mid-1980s, Merck & Co. discovered the drug ivermectin, capable of combatting the parasite that causes river blindness. At the time, the World Health Organization and the World Bank were conducting a campaign against the vector-borne disease in West Africa, and ivermectin was the most important drug in their arsenal. But the newly discovered drug was too expensive for those patients or their governments. Vagelos "wanted to see the drug widely used," so he influenced Merck & Co. to "make needed quantities of the drug available to these governments and patients, at no cost to them, for the treatment of onchocerciasis.” Over two decades, beginning in 1986, the drug reached more than 55 million people. The public health campaign was successful, and now river blindness is no longer a major public health issue in the savannah areas of West Africa.[7]

Pindaros Roy Vagelos, better known as P. Roy Vagelos or Roy Vagelos (born October 8, 1929 in Westfield, New Jersey), is an American physician and business executive, who was president and chief executive officer (1985) and chairman (1986) of the American pharmaceutical company Merck & Co. (known as MSD outside the U.S.). He attracted research scientists who developed many major new drugs.
Since 1995, Vagelos serves as Chairman of the Board of Regeneron pharmaceuticals.
In addition to his business accomplishments, Vagelos is the author of more than 100 scientific papers.[1] He is also on the Board of Trustees of the University of Pennsylvania and has funded three of the university's most elite undergraduate programs: The Vagelos Scholars Program in Molecular Life Sciences (MLS), The Vagelos Program in Life Sciences and Management (LSM) and The Vagelos Integrated Program in Energy Research (VIPER).

Biography[edit]
Vagelos grew up during the Depression as a son of Greek immigrants. He attended Rahway High School in his hometown of Rahway, New Jersey.[2] After winning a partial scholarship, he left his family's small restaurant in Rahway, New Jersey, to become a doctor.[3] He majored in chemistry at the University of Pennsylvania, graduating Phi Beta Kappa in 1950. Vagelos later earned an M.D. from Columbia University in 1954.
Vagelos deferred military service while in medical school, but he was obligated to serve a two-year stint as an Army doctor. As a Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons trained surgeon and biochemist, Vagelos obtained a two-year assignment as a research physician at the National Institutes of Health (1956–1966). For Vagelos, it was a fateful turning point. He was associated with Massachusetts General Hospital, Washington University and the Washington University School of Medicine (1966–1975) before joining Merck, Sharp & Dohme Research Laboratories in Rahway (president 1976–1984).
The author of more than 100 scientific papers, Vagelos has been elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, the National Academy of Sciences and the American Philosophical Society.
Vagelos donated over 15 million dollars to the University of Pennsylvania to create the Roy and Diana Vagelos Laboratories. These funds also made possible the founding the Vagelos Scholars Program In Molecular Life Sciences, an intensive program offered to University of Pennsylvania freshman. In addition, he donated funds to launch the Vagelos Program in Life Sciences and Management, a joint program between the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania and its College of Arts and Sciences. Later, he founded the Vagelos Integrated Program in Energy Research, supporting the necessity of energy research.
In 1995, Vagelos received the NAS Award for Chemistry in Service to Society and was inducted into the Junior Achievement U.S. Business Hall of Fame. In 1999, he became a recipient of both the Bower Award for Business Leadership, as well as the Othmer Gold Medal.[4][5]
In 2010, Vagelos, who had earned his medical degree at Columbia University, and his wife, Diana, an alumna of Barnard College at Columbia University, donated 50 million dollars to the Columbia College of Physicians and Surgeons, towards the construction of a new building. Named the Roy and Diana Vagelos Education Center, it opened in August 2016.[6]
In 2013, Vagelos was invited to speak at the first annual Stony Brook University Research Your Future Symposium.
River Blindness[edit]
In the mid-1980s, Merck & Co. discovered the drug ivermectin, capable of combatting the parasite that causes river blindness. At the time, the World Health Organization and the World Bank were conducting a campaign against the vector-borne disease in West Africa, and ivermectin was the most important drug in their arsenal. But the newly discovered drug was too expensive for those patients or their governments. Vagelos "wanted to see the drug widely used," so he influenced Merck & Co. to "make needed quantities of the drug available to these governments and patients, at no cost to them, for the treatment of onchocerciasis.” Over two decades, beginning in 1986, the drug reached more than 55 million people. The public health campaign was successful, and now river blindness is no longer a major public health issue in the savannah areas of West Africa.[7]

Pindaros Roy Vagelos, better known as P. Roy Vagelos or Roy Vagelos (born October 8, 1929 in Westfield, New Jersey), is an American physician and business executive, who was president and chief executive officer (1985) and chairman (1986) of the American pharmaceutical company Merck & Co. (known as MSD outside the U.S.). He attracted research scientists who developed many major new drugs.
Since 1995, Vagelos serves as Chairman of the Board of Regeneron pharmaceuticals.
In addition to his business accomplishments, Vagelos is the author of more than 100 scientific papers.[1] He is also on the Board of Trustees of the University of Pennsylvania and has funded three of the university's most elite undergraduate programs: The Vagelos Scholars Program in Molecular Life Sciences (MLS), The Vagelos Program in Life Sciences and Management (LSM) and The Vagelos Integrated Program in Energy Research (VIPER).

Biography[edit]
Vagelos grew up during the Depression as a son of Greek immigrants. He attended Rahway High School in his hometown of Rahway, New Jersey.[2] After winning a partial scholarship, he left his family's small restaurant in Rahway, New Jersey, to become a doctor.[3] He majored in chemistry at the University of Pennsylvania, graduating Phi Beta Kappa in 1950. Vagelos later earned an M.D. from Columbia University in 1954.
Vagelos deferred military service while in medical school, but he was obligated to serve a two-year stint as an Army doctor. As a Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons trained surgeon and biochemist, Vagelos obtained a two-year assignment as a research physician at the National Institutes of Health (1956–1966). For Vagelos, it was a fateful turning point. He was associated with Massachusetts General Hospital, Washington University and the Washington University School of Medicine (1966–1975) before joining Merck, Sharp & Dohme Research Laboratories in Rahway (president 1976–1984).
The author of more than 100 scientific papers, Vagelos has been elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, the National Academy of Sciences and the American Philosophical Society.
Vagelos donated over 15 million dollars to the University of Pennsylvania to create the Roy and Diana Vagelos Laboratories. These funds also made possible the founding the Vagelos Scholars Program In Molecular Life Sciences, an intensive program offered to University of Pennsylvania freshman. In addition, he donated funds to launch the Vagelos Program in Life Sciences and Management, a joint program between the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania and its College of Arts and Sciences. Later, he founded the Vagelos Integrated Program in Energy Research, supporting the necessity of energy research.
In 1995, Vagelos received the NAS Award for Chemistry in Service to Society and was inducted into the Junior Achievement U.S. Business Hall of Fame. In 1999, he became a recipient of both the Bower Award for Business Leadership, as well as the Othmer Gold Medal.[4][5]
In 2010, Vagelos, who had earned his medical degree at Columbia University, and his wife, Diana, an alumna of Barnard College at Columbia University, donated 50 million dollars to the Columbia College of Physicians and Surgeons, towards the construction of a new building. Named the Roy and Diana Vagelos Education Center, it opened in August 2016.[6]
In 2013, Vagelos was invited to speak at the first annual Stony Brook University Research Your Future Symposium.
River Blindness[edit]
In the mid-1980s, Merck & Co. discovered the drug ivermectin, capable of combatting the parasite that causes river blindness. At the time, the World Health Organization and the World Bank were conducting a campaign against the vector-borne disease in West Africa, and ivermectin was the most important drug in their arsenal. But the newly discovered drug was too expensive for those patients or their governments. Vagelos "wanted to see the drug widely used," so he influenced Merck & Co. to "make needed quantities of the drug available to these governments and patients, at no cost to them, for the treatment of onchocerciasis.” Over two decades, beginning in 1986, the drug reached more than 55 million people. The public health campaign was successful, and now river blindness is no longer a major public health issue in the savannah areas of West Africa.[7]

Social responsibility of business takes center stage in Danforth Lecture Series final installment

For years, the pharmaceutical industry was held in high esteem for its contributions to improvements in human health. But in 2004, a Harris poll found that the industry’s reputation had dropped to the bottom ranks — down with the oil and cigarette industries. The public felt drug prices were exorbitant and that the industry had not responded properly to help reduce the spread of HIV and AIDS.

P. Roy Vagelos, M.D., who led pharmaceutical giant Merck & Co. Inc. during that pivotal era in the industry’s history, will address the issue of corporate leaders’ role in social responsibility at 4 p.m. Monday, Nov. 13, in Graham Chapel.

P. Roy Vagelos
The talk is the final installment of the Danforth Lecture Series, which began with “Medicine and Society” and was followed by “Faith and Politics.”

Vagelos’ lecture, titled “The Social Responsibility of Business,” will explore examples of corporate leaders who connect failure to respond to public concerns with negative changes in their industry.

Under Vagelos’ watch as Merck’s chairman of the board and chief executive officer, the company made unprecedented gains in drug discoveries and became the leader in the industry. Among his accomplishments, Vagelos led Merck Research Laboratories in the pioneering development of statin drugs, which lower cholesterol levels.

In 1966, Vagelos chaired the Department of Biological Chemistry in the School of Medicine. In 1973, he led the effort to found the first-ever Division of Biology and Biomedical Sciences, which helped establish the model for fusing a medical school with an undergraduate biology department. Two years later, he joined Merck Research Laboratories and served as president until 1985, when he became chairman and CEO. He retired from Merck in 1994.

Vagelos is chairman of Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc. and of Theravance Inc., two biotech companies.

The program will include a panel discussion featuring University-associated business experts. Following Vagelos’ address, panelists will add their perspectives and invite discussion from the audience. A reception in Holmes Lounge will follow.

Panelists joining Vagelos onstage are Mahendra R. Gupta, the Geraldine J. and Robert L. Virgil Professor of Accounting and Management and dean of the John M. Olin School of Business; Judi McLean Parks, the Reuben C. and Anne Carpenter Taylor Professor of Organizational Behavior in the Olin School; and Philip Needleman, former chief scientist of Pharmacia Inc. and Monsanto/Searle and former professor and chair of the Department of Pharmacology at the School of Medicine.

The lecture is scheduled to be simulcast on the Medical Campus at the King Center on the seventh floor of Becker Library and on the Danforth Campus at the Gargoyle on the lower level of the Mallinckrodt Student Center.

The Danforth Lecture Series was created as part of the celebration of naming the main campus the Danforth Campus, in honor of the contributions the Danforth family and its foundation have made to the University over the years.

The program is free and open to the public.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:
