Lip-Bu Tan (born 1960 in Malaysia) is an executive and entrepreneur presently the President and CEO of Cadence Design Systems and Chairman of Walden International, a venture capital firm.[2][3][4][5][6][7][8][9]
He was a graduate student in nuclear engineering at Massachusetts Institute of Technology in the 1970s but the Three Mile Island accident caused a sharp reduction in opportunities in that industry, so instead he studied for an MBA from the University of San Francisco, and founded Walden International. He named the firm after the book Walden by Henry David Thoreau because Tan's goal was to be like Thoreau: "contrarian, rather than just following the trend."[10]
In 2017, the analytics firm Relationship Science named him most connected executives in the technology industry garnering a perfect "power score" of 100.[11]
Tan was a member of the 2014-2015 Term Board of Trustees at Carnegie Mellon University.[12]

Mercury News interview: Lip-Bu Tan, president and CEO of Cadence Design Systems


                February 03, 2011
                 






 

With microchips incorporating increasingly tiny components in ever more complex arrangements, the difficulty of making them has grown exponentially in recent years. Cadence Design Systems' electronic design automation simplifies the process by letting chip firms plot out the manufacturing process beforehand on computer.But the recession slammed the San Jose company's business hard. Its 2009 sales of $853 million were a little more than half what they were in 2007. Hundreds of its employees were let go. And in October 2008, CEO Michael Fister quit under pressure from the board.Now the company is rebounding, according to 51-year-old Lip-Bu Tan, a board member since 2004 who was named CEO in January 2009. A fan of basketball and other sports, he has pushed his corporate team to improve customer relations. And Cadence, which has more than 4,600 employees -- with about 30 percent of them in the Bay Area -- now lists dozens of job openings on its website.Tan discussed his efforts to put Cadence on better financial footing during a recent interview, which has been edited for length and clarity.Q What have you emphasized at Cadence since becoming CEO?A Something I feel very passionate about is the culture. I strongly feel that the culture of accountability and integrity is very important. There is also a lot of focus on product quality. And then thirdly, it's very important to make a decision, right or wrong, at least make a decision so this company can move forward. One of my friends -- a very successful CEO -- told me that as long as you make 70 percent of your decisions right, you are a good CEO.Q You have visited a lot with your customers since becoming CEO. Can you talk a little about that?A It's been very telling. Every company I visited, I only talked 10 minutes, then the rest I listened. What went wrong? How can we improve? What are the challenges you have? Can we help you? It's very important to listen to the customers and make sure we have a solution that addresses their challenges, and really focus on the engineering to make sure we have the best product. I encourage my team to work together to win and serve the customer and just be humble. I think at the end of the day people like someone they can trust, and that you listen and you care about their business.Q What are the major challenges your customers face?A Some they face are escalating design costs. And some of their chips are getting more and more complex, take more time. That puts a lot of pressure on the engineers.Q You picked a tough economic period to try to reconnect with your customers.A The best time to help somebody is in a recession. In the glory days if you help them, so what? It's in the worst times that they really need help. I think that is something we accomplished.Q Your predecessor had tried unsuccessfully to buy Cadence's rival Mentor Graphics. Then, in May last year you announced a $315 million cash deal to buy Denali Software, an electronic design automation company in Sunnyvale. Do you see your industry as fertile ground for such mergers?A I think in general industry consolidation is always good. But being a basketball player, I always believe, let the game come to you. Do what you like to do to strengthen your position and when the occasion comes, the opportunity comes, you are prepared to take the right move. Denali is a good example. We are very pleased with that acquisition. They were very profitable and we loved that.Q Although microchip sales last year were dramatically higher than they were in 2009, you have noted that your business often lags behind that of chipmakers. So how is Cadence doing?A It's starting to grow. This year we are looking for it to be a good year. Overall we are excited. We look at our customer engagement in R&D, new projects, and that has substantially increased from last year. That is a good indication. There is a lot of growth in new areas. You look at smart meters, you look at cleantech and power efficiency. And the gaming platform is just humongous. I mention to my team that 2009 was a difficult year to survive. In 2010 we started to walk. This year we're going to run.Contact Steve Johnson at 408-920-5043.LIP-BU TANPosition: President and CEO of Cadence Design SystemsPrevious jobs: Cadence board member since 2004; before that he held management positions at Chappell & Co., EDS Nuclear and Echo EnergyEducation: Master's degree in nuclear engineering from Massachusetts Institute of Technology, master's in business administration from University of San Francisco, bachelor's degree from Nanyang University in SingaporeDate of birth: Nov. 12, 1959Birthplace: Muar, MalaysiaResidence: PiedmontFamily: Married to Ysa Loo; they have two sons, ages 21 and 18five things to know about Lip-Bu Tan1. He had intended to work in the nuclear power industry, but changed his mind after the 1979 Three Mile Island accident stalled construction of new nuclear plants.2. He loves basketball and volleyball -- which he played in college in Singapore -- as well as skiing and fly fishing. He also swims every day and has a 25-meter pool at his home.3. He's on the board of the Bay Area Rescue Mission in Richmond, where he occasionally serves meals to the needy.4. He and his wife provide financial assistance to help educate poor, lower-caste children in India who are referred to as "untouchables" in that country.5. He is an adviser to the deans at MIT, Carnegie Mellon University and UC Berkeley.

The company also provides products that assist with the development of complete hardware and software platforms that support end applications.[3]
History[edit]
Cadence Design Systems was the result of a merger perfected in 1988 of Solomon Design Automation (SDA), co-founded in 1983 by Richard Newton, Alberto Sangiovanni-Vincentelli and James Solomon, and ECAD, co-founded by Glen Antle and Paul Huang in 1982. Joseph Costello was appointed as CEO from 1988–1997, and Cadence became the largest EDA company during his tenure.
Following Costello as CEO were Jack Harding (from 1997-99), Ray Bingham (from 1999-2005), and Mike Fister (from 2005-2008).
Following the resignation of Fister, the board appointed Lip-Bu Tan as acting CEO.[4] In January 2009, the company confirmed Lip-Bu Tan as President and CEO. Tan had been most recently CEO of Walden International, a venture capital firm, and remains chairman of the firm. He has served on the Cadence Board of Directors since 2004, where he served on the Technology Committee for four years.
In 2013, Cadence celebrated its 25th anniversary. In 2015 it was named one of the top 100 places to work by Fortune magazine.[5]
At the end of 2016, the company employed more than 7,100 people and reported 2016 revenues of approximately $1.82 billion.[6] In November 2007 Cadence was named one of the "50 Best Places to Work in Silicon Valley" by San Jose Magazine.[7]
According to Glassdoor, it is the fifth highest-paying company for employees in the United States as of April 2017.[8]

Lawsuits[edit]
Avanti Corporation[edit]
Main article: Cadence Design Systems, Inc. v. Avanti Corp
Cadence was involved in a 6-year-long legal dispute[12] with Avanti Corporation, in which Cadence claimed Avanti stole Cadence code, and Avanti denied it. According to Business Week "The Avanti case is probably the most dramatic tale of white-collar crime in the history of Silicon Valley".[12] The Avanti executives eventually pleaded no contest and Cadence received several hundred million dollars in restitution. Avanti was then purchased by Synopsys, which paid $265 million more to settle the remaining claims.[13] The case resulted in a number of legal precedents.[14]
Mentor Graphics[edit]
The Cadence group Quickturn was also involved in a series of legal events with Mentor Graphics/Aptix. Mentor purchased rights to an Aptix patent, then sued Cadence. In this case, the CEO of Aptix, Amr Mohsen, forged a notebook in order to make the patent case stronger. When suspicions were raised, he staged a break-in of his own car to get rid of the evidence, resulting in charges of obstruction of justice. Trying to avoid this, he attempted to flee the country, only to be caught with an illegal passport and a pile of cash. While in jail for this offense, he was recorded offering money to intimidate witnesses and kill the judge.[15] In order to fight the new charges, he tried to feign psychological problems, but left a trail of evidence of his research into this defense, and how it might be done. He was charged with attempting to delay a federal trial by feigning incompetency,[16] but was convicted anyway.[17] According to the lawyers concerned, the original notebooks were not needed for the trial. The patent filing date, which was not in dispute, would have sufficed.

Denali Software[edit]
Denali Software, Inc. was an American software company, based in Sunnyvale, California, now acquired by Cadence.[31] The company produces electronic design automation (EDA) software, intellectual property (IP) and design cores and platforms for memory, other standard interfaces and system-on-chip (SoC) design and verification. It has its engineering offices in Sunnyvale, Austin and Bangalore. Incorporated in 1996, Denali is headquartered in Sunnyvale, California and serves the global electronics industry with direct sales and support offices in North America, Europe, Japan and Asia.
On May 2010, Cadence Design Systems announced that it would acquire Denali for $315 million.[32]
Valid Logic Systems[edit]
Valid Logic Systems was one of the first commercial electronic design automation (EDA) companies, now acquired by Cadence. It was founded in the early 1980s,[33] along with Daisy Systems Corporation and Mentor Graphics, collectively known as DMV. The engineering founders were L. Curtis Widdoes,[34] Tom McWilliams[35] and Jeff Rubin,[36] all of whom had worked on the S-1 supercomputer project at Livermore Labs.
Valid acquired several companies such as Telesis (PCB layout),[37] Analog Design Tools,[38] and Calma (IC layout). In turn, Valid was acquired by Cadence Design Systems in the early 90s.[39]
Valid built both hardware and software, for schematic capture, logic simulation, static timing analysis, and packaging. Much of the initial software base derived from SCALD ("Structured Computer-Aided Logic Design"), a set of tools developed to support the design of the S-1 supercomputer at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory.[40] Later, Valid expanded into IC design tools and into printed circuit board layout.
At first, Valid ran schematic capture on a proprietary UNIX workstation, the SCALDSystem, with static timing analysis, simulation, and packaging running on a VAX or IBM-compatible mainframe. However, by the mid-1980s, general purpose workstations were powerful enough, significantly cheaper. Companies such as Mentor Graphics and Cadence Design Systems sold software only for such workstations. By 1990, almost all Valid software was also running on workstations, primarily those from Sun Microsystems.

Valid acquired several companies such as Telesis (PCB layout),[37] Analog Design Tools,[38] and Calma (IC layout). In turn, Valid was acquired by Cadence Design Systems in the early 90s.[39]
Valid built both hardware and software, for schematic capture, logic simulation, static timing analysis, and packaging. Much of the initial software base derived from SCALD ("Structured Computer-Aided Logic Design"), a set of tools developed to support the design of the S-1 supercomputer at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory.[40] Later, Valid expanded into IC design tools and into printed circuit board layout.
At first, Valid ran schematic capture on a proprietary UNIX workstation, the SCALDSystem, with static timing analysis, simulation, and packaging running on a VAX or IBM-compatible mainframe. However, by the mid-1980s, general purpose workstations were powerful enough, significantly cheaper. Companies such as Mentor Graphics and Cadence Design Systems sold software only for such workstations. By 1990, almost all Valid software was also running on workstations, primarily those from Sun Microsystems.

Overview[edit]
Cadence Design Systems, headquartered in San Jose, California, is a supplier of electronic design technologies and engineering services in the electronic design automation (EDA) industry. The company develops software used to design chips[1] and printed circuit boards,[2] as well as intellectual properties (IP) covering a broad range of areas, including interfaces, memory, analog, SoC peripherals, dataplane processing units, and verification.
Cadence products primarily target SoC design engineers, and are used to move a design into packaged silicon, with products for custom and analog design, digital design, mixed-signal design, verification, and package/PCB design, as well as a broad selection of IP, and also hardware for emulation and FPGA prototyping.
To help integrate, verify, and implement complex digital SoCs, there are solutions that encompass design IP, timing analysis and signoff, services, and tools and methodologies. The company also provides products that assist with the development of complete hardware and software platforms that support end applications.[3]
History[edit]
Cadence Design Systems was the result of a merger perfected in 1988 of Solomon Design Automation (SDA), co-founded in 1983 by Richard Newton, Alberto Sangiovanni-Vincentelli and James Solomon, and ECAD, co-founded by Glen Antle and Paul Huang in 1982. Joseph Costello was appointed as CEO from 1988–1997, and Cadence became the largest EDA company during his tenure.
Following Costello as CEO were Jack Harding (from 1997-99), Ray Bingham (from 1999-2005), and Mike Fister (from 2005-2008).
Following the resignation of Fister, the board appointed Lip-Bu Tan as acting CEO.[4] In January 2009, the company confirmed Lip-Bu Tan as President and CEO. Tan had been most recently CEO of Walden International, a venture capital firm, and remains chairman of the firm. He has served on the Cadence Board of Directors since 2004, where he served on the Technology Committee for four years.
In 2013, Cadence celebrated its 25th anniversary. In 2015 it was named one of the top 100 places to work by Fortune magazine.[5]
At the end of 2016, the company employed more than 7,100 people and reported 2016 revenues of approximately $1.82 billion.[6] In November 2007 Cadence was named one of the "50 Best Places to Work in Silicon Valley" by San Jose Magazine.[7]
According to Glassdoor, it is the fifth highest-paying company for employees in the United States as of April 2017.[8]
Products[edit]
Cadence's product offerings are targeted at various types of design and verification tasks which include:

Virtuoso Platform - Tools for designing full-custom integrated circuits;[9] includes schematic entry, behavioral modeling (Verilog-AMS), circuit simulation, custom layout, physical verification, extraction and back-annotation. Used mainly for analog, mixed-signal, RF, and standard-cell designs, but also memory and FPGA designs.

Sigrity technologies - Tools for signal and power verification for system-level signoff verification and interface compliance.[11]

In addition to EDA software, Cadence provides contracted methodology and design services as well as silicon design IP, and has a program aimed at making it easier for other EDA software to interoperate with the company's tools.
Lawsuits[edit]
Avanti Corporation[edit]
Main article: Cadence Design Systems, Inc. v. Avanti Corp
Cadence was involved in a 6-year-long legal dispute[12] with Avanti Corporation, in which Cadence claimed Avanti stole Cadence code, and Avanti denied it. According to Business Week "The Avanti case is probably the most dramatic tale of white-collar crime in the history of Silicon Valley".[12] The Avanti executives eventually pleaded no contest and Cadence received several hundred million dollars in restitution. Avanti was then purchased by Synopsys, which paid $265 million more to settle the remaining claims.[13] The case resulted in a number of legal precedents.[14]
Mentor Graphics[edit]
The Cadence group Quickturn was also involved in a series of legal events with Mentor Graphics/Aptix. Mentor purchased rights to an Aptix patent, then sued Cadence. In this case, the CEO of Aptix, Amr Mohsen, forged a notebook in order to make the patent case stronger. When suspicions were raised, he staged a break-in of his own car to get rid of the evidence, resulting in charges of obstruction of justice. Trying to avoid this, he attempted to flee the country, only to be caught with an illegal passport and a pile of cash. While in jail for this offense, he was recorded offering money to intimidate witnesses and kill the judge.[15] In order to fight the new charges, he tried to feign psychological problems, but left a trail of evidence of his research into this defense, and how it might be done. He was charged with attempting to delay a federal trial by feigning incompetency,[16] but was convicted anyway.[17] According to the lawyers concerned, the original notebooks were not needed for the trial. The patent filing date, which was not in dispute, would have sufficed.

Overview[edit]
Cadence Design Systems, headquartered in San Jose, California, is a supplier of electronic design technologies and engineering services in the electronic design automation (EDA) industry. The company develops software used to design chips[1] and printed circuit boards,[2] as well as intellectual properties (IP) covering a broad range of areas, including interfaces, memory, analog, SoC peripherals, dataplane processing units, and verification.
Cadence products primarily target SoC design engineers, and are used to move a design into packaged silicon, with products for custom and analog design, digital design, mixed-signal design, verification, and package/PCB design, as well as a broad selection of IP, and also hardware for emulation and FPGA prototyping.
To help integrate, verify, and implement complex digital SoCs, there are solutions that encompass design IP, timing analysis and signoff, services, and tools and methodologies. The company also provides products that assist with the development of complete hardware and software platforms that support end applications.[3]
History[edit]
Cadence Design Systems was the result of a merger perfected in 1988 of Solomon Design Automation (SDA), co-founded in 1983 by Richard Newton, Alberto Sangiovanni-Vincentelli and James Solomon, and ECAD, co-founded by Glen Antle and Paul Huang in 1982. Joseph Costello was appointed as CEO from 1988–1997, and Cadence became the largest EDA company during his tenure.
Following Costello as CEO were Jack Harding (from 1997-99), Ray Bingham (from 1999-2005), and Mike Fister (from 2005-2008).
Following the resignation of Fister, the board appointed Lip-Bu Tan as acting CEO.[4] In January 2009, the company confirmed Lip-Bu Tan as President and CEO. Tan had been most recently CEO of Walden International, a venture capital firm, and remains chairman of the firm. He has served on the Cadence Board of Directors since 2004, where he served on the Technology Committee for four years.
In 2013, Cadence celebrated its 25th anniversary. In 2015 it was named one of the top 100 places to work by Fortune magazine.[5]
At the end of 2016, the company employed more than 7,100 people and reported 2016 revenues of approximately $1.82 billion.[6] In November 2007 Cadence was named one of the "50 Best Places to Work in Silicon Valley" by San Jose Magazine.[7]
According to Glassdoor, it is the fifth highest-paying company for employees in the United States as of April 2017.[8]

In addition to EDA software, Cadence provides contracted methodology and design services as well as silicon design IP, and has a program aimed at making it easier for other EDA software to interoperate with the company's tools.
Lawsuits[edit]
Avanti Corporation[edit]
Main article: Cadence Design Systems, Inc. v. Avanti Corp
Cadence was involved in a 6-year-long legal dispute[12] with Avanti Corporation, in which Cadence claimed Avanti stole Cadence code, and Avanti denied it. According to Business Week "The Avanti case is probably the most dramatic tale of white-collar crime in the history of Silicon Valley".[12] The Avanti executives eventually pleaded no contest and Cadence received several hundred million dollars in restitution. Avanti was then purchased by Synopsys, which paid $265 million more to settle the remaining claims.[13] The case resulted in a number of legal precedents.[14]
Mentor Graphics[edit]
The Cadence group Quickturn was also involved in a series of legal events with Mentor Graphics/Aptix. Mentor purchased rights to an Aptix patent, then sued Cadence. In this case, the CEO of Aptix, Amr Mohsen, forged a notebook in order to make the patent case stronger. When suspicions were raised, he staged a break-in of his own car to get rid of the evidence, resulting in charges of obstruction of justice. Trying to avoid this, he attempted to flee the country, only to be caught with an illegal passport and a pile of cash. While in jail for this offense, he was recorded offering money to intimidate witnesses and kill the judge.[15] In order to fight the new charges, he tried to feign psychological problems, but left a trail of evidence of his research into this defense, and how it might be done. He was charged with attempting to delay a federal trial by feigning incompetency,[16] but was convicted anyway.[17] According to the lawyers concerned, the original notebooks were not needed for the trial. The patent filing date, which was not in dispute, would have sufficed.

Denali Software[edit]
Denali Software, Inc. was an American software company, based in Sunnyvale, California, now acquired by Cadence.[31] The company produces electronic design automation (EDA) software, intellectual property (IP) and design cores and platforms for memory, other standard interfaces and system-on-chip (SoC) design and verification. It has its engineering offices in Sunnyvale, Austin and Bangalore. Incorporated in 1996, Denali is headquartered in Sunnyvale, California and serves the global electronics industry with direct sales and support offices in North America, Europe, Japan and Asia.
On May 2010, Cadence Design Systems announced that it would acquire Denali for $315 million.[32]
Valid Logic Systems[edit]
Valid Logic Systems was one of the first commercial electronic design automation (EDA) companies, now acquired by Cadence. It was founded in the early 1980s,[33] along with Daisy Systems Corporation and Mentor Graphics, collectively known as DMV. The engineering founders were L. Curtis Widdoes,[34] Tom McWilliams[35] and Jeff Rubin,[36] all of whom had worked on the S-1 supercomputer project at Livermore Labs.
Valid acquired several companies such as Telesis (PCB layout),[37] Analog Design Tools,[38] and Calma (IC layout). In turn, Valid was acquired by Cadence Design Systems in the early 90s.[39]
Valid built both hardware and software, for schematic capture, logic simulation, static timing analysis, and packaging. Much of the initial software base derived from SCALD ("Structured Computer-Aided Logic Design"), a set of tools developed to support the design of the S-1 supercomputer at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory.[40] Later, Valid expanded into IC design tools and into printed circuit board layout.
At first, Valid ran schematic capture on a proprietary UNIX workstation, the SCALDSystem, with static timing analysis, simulation, and packaging running on a VAX or IBM-compatible mainframe. However, by the mid-1980s, general purpose workstations were powerful enough, significantly cheaper. Companies such as Mentor Graphics and Cadence Design Systems sold software only for such workstations. By 1990, almost all Valid software was also running on workstations, primarily those from Sun Microsystems.

Denali Software, Inc. was an American software company, based in Sunnyvale, California, now acquired by Cadence.[31] The company produces electronic design automation (EDA) software, intellectual property (IP) and design cores and platforms for memory, other standard interfaces and system-on-chip (SoC) design and verification. It has its engineering offices in Sunnyvale, Austin and Bangalore. Incorporated in 1996, Denali is headquartered in Sunnyvale, California and serves the global electronics industry with direct sales and support offices in North America, Europe, Japan and Asia.
On May 2010, Cadence Design Systems announced that it would acquire Denali for $315 million.[32]
Valid Logic Systems[edit]
Valid Logic Systems was one of the first commercial electronic design automation (EDA) companies, now acquired by Cadence. It was founded in the early 1980s,[33] along with Daisy Systems Corporation and Mentor Graphics, collectively known as DMV. The engineering founders were L. Curtis Widdoes,[34] Tom McWilliams[35] and Jeff Rubin,[36] all of whom had worked on the S-1 supercomputer project at Livermore Labs.
Valid acquired several companies such as Telesis (PCB layout),[37] Analog Design Tools,[38] and Calma (IC layout). In turn, Valid was acquired by Cadence Design Systems in the early 90s.[39]
Valid built both hardware and software, for schematic capture, logic simulation, static timing analysis, and packaging. Much of the initial software base derived from SCALD ("Structured Computer-Aided Logic Design"), a set of tools developed to support the design of the S-1 supercomputer at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory.[40] Later, Valid expanded into IC design tools and into printed circuit board layout.
At first, Valid ran schematic capture on a proprietary UNIX workstation, the SCALDSystem, with static timing analysis, simulation, and packaging running on a VAX or IBM-compatible mainframe. However, by the mid-1980s, general purpose workstations were powerful enough, significantly cheaper. Companies such as Mentor Graphics and Cadence Design Systems sold software only for such workstations. By 1990, almost all Valid software was also running on workstations, primarily those from Sun Microsystems.

Overview[edit]
Cadence Design Systems, headquartered in San Jose, California, is a supplier of electronic design technologies and engineering services in the electronic design automation (EDA) industry. The company develops software used to design chips[1] and printed circuit boards,[2] as well as intellectual properties (IP) covering a broad range of areas, including interfaces, memory, analog, SoC peripherals, dataplane processing units, and verification.
Cadence products primarily target SoC design engineers, and are used to move a design into packaged silicon, with products for custom and analog design, digital design, mixed-signal design, verification, and package/PCB design, as well as a broad selection of IP, and also hardware for emulation and FPGA prototyping.
To help integrate, verify, and implement complex digital SoCs, there are solutions that encompass design IP, timing analysis and signoff, services, and tools and methodologies. The company also provides products that assist with the development of complete hardware and software platforms that support end applications.[3]
History[edit]
Cadence Design Systems was the result of a merger perfected in 1988 of Solomon Design Automation (SDA), co-founded in 1983 by Richard Newton, Alberto Sangiovanni-Vincentelli and James Solomon, and ECAD, co-founded by Glen Antle and Paul Huang in 1982. Joseph Costello was appointed as CEO from 1988–1997, and Cadence became the largest EDA company during his tenure.
Following Costello as CEO were Jack Harding (from 1997-99), Ray Bingham (from 1999-2005), and Mike Fister (from 2005-2008).
Following the resignation of Fister, the board appointed Lip-Bu Tan as acting CEO.[4] In January 2009, the company confirmed Lip-Bu Tan as President and CEO. Tan had been most recently CEO of Walden International, a venture capital firm, and remains chairman of the firm. He has served on the Cadence Board of Directors since 2004, where he served on the Technology Committee for four years.
In 2013, Cadence celebrated its 25th anniversary. In 2015 it was named one of the top 100 places to work by Fortune magazine.[5]
At the end of 2016, the company employed more than 7,100 people and reported 2016 revenues of approximately $1.82 billion.[6] In November 2007 Cadence was named one of the "50 Best Places to Work in Silicon Valley" by San Jose Magazine.[7]
According to Glassdoor, it is the fifth highest-paying company for employees in the United States as of April 2017.[8]
Products[edit]
Cadence's product offerings are targeted at various types of design and verification tasks which include:

Virtuoso Platform - Tools for designing full-custom integrated circuits;[9] includes schematic entry, behavioral modeling (Verilog-AMS), circuit simulation, custom layout, physical verification, extraction and back-annotation.

In addition to EDA software, Cadence provides contracted methodology and design services as well as silicon design IP, and has a program aimed at making it easier for other EDA software to interoperate with the company's tools.
Lawsuits[edit]
Avanti Corporation[edit]
Main article: Cadence Design Systems, Inc. v. Avanti Corp
Cadence was involved in a 6-year-long legal dispute[12] with Avanti Corporation, in which Cadence claimed Avanti stole Cadence code, and Avanti denied it. According to Business Week "The Avanti case is probably the most dramatic tale of white-collar crime in the history of Silicon Valley".[12] The Avanti executives eventually pleaded no contest and Cadence received several hundred million dollars in restitution. Avanti was then purchased by Synopsys, which paid $265 million more to settle the remaining claims.[13] The case resulted in a number of legal precedents.[14]
Mentor Graphics[edit]
The Cadence group Quickturn was also involved in a series of legal events with Mentor Graphics/Aptix. Mentor purchased rights to an Aptix patent, then sued Cadence. In this case, the CEO of Aptix, Amr Mohsen, forged a notebook in order to make the patent case stronger. When suspicions were raised, he staged a break-in of his own car to get rid of the evidence, resulting in charges of obstruction of justice. Trying to avoid this, he attempted to flee the country, only to be caught with an illegal passport and a pile of cash. While in jail for this offense, he was recorded offering money to intimidate witnesses and kill the judge.[15] In order to fight the new charges, he tried to feign psychological problems, but left a trail of evidence of his research into this defense, and how it might be done. He was charged with attempting to delay a federal trial by feigning incompetency,[16] but was convicted anyway.[17] According to the lawyers concerned, the original notebooks were not needed for the trial. The patent filing date, which was not in dispute, would have sufficed.

Overview[edit]
Cadence Design Systems, headquartered in San Jose, California, is a supplier of electronic design technologies and engineering services in the electronic design automation (EDA) industry. The company develops software used to design chips[1] and printed circuit boards,[2] as well as intellectual properties (IP) covering a broad range of areas, including interfaces, memory, analog, SoC peripherals, dataplane processing units, and verification.
Cadence products primarily target SoC design engineers, and are used to move a design into packaged silicon, with products for custom and analog design, digital design, mixed-signal design, verification, and package/PCB design, as well as a broad selection of IP, and also hardware for emulation and FPGA prototyping.
To help integrate, verify, and implement complex digital SoCs, there are solutions that encompass design IP, timing analysis and signoff, services, and tools and methodologies. The company also provides products that assist with the development of complete hardware and software platforms that support end applications.[3]
History[edit]
Cadence Design Systems was the result of a merger perfected in 1988 of Solomon Design Automation (SDA), co-founded in 1983 by Richard Newton, Alberto Sangiovanni-Vincentelli and James Solomon, and ECAD, co-founded by Glen Antle and Paul Huang in 1982. Joseph Costello was appointed as CEO from 1988–1997, and Cadence became the largest EDA company during his tenure.
Following Costello as CEO were Jack Harding (from 1997-99), Ray Bingham (from 1999-2005), and Mike Fister (from 2005-2008).
Following the resignation of Fister, the board appointed Lip-Bu Tan as acting CEO.[4] In January 2009, the company confirmed Lip-Bu Tan as President and CEO. Tan had been most recently CEO of Walden International, a venture capital firm, and remains chairman of the firm. He has served on the Cadence Board of Directors since 2004, where he served on the Technology Committee for four years.
In 2013, Cadence celebrated its 25th anniversary. In 2015 it was named one of the top 100 places to work by Fortune magazine.[5]
At the end of 2016, the company employed more than 7,100 people and reported 2016 revenues of approximately $1.82 billion.[6] In November 2007 Cadence was named one of the "50 Best Places to Work in Silicon Valley" by San Jose Magazine.[7]
According to Glassdoor, it is the fifth highest-paying company for employees in the United States as of April 2017.[8]

In addition to EDA software, Cadence provides contracted methodology and design services as well as silicon design IP, and has a program aimed at making it easier for other EDA software to interoperate with the company's tools.
Lawsuits[edit]
Avanti Corporation[edit]
Main article: Cadence Design Systems, Inc. v. Avanti Corp
Cadence was involved in a 6-year-long legal dispute[12] with Avanti Corporation, in which Cadence claimed Avanti stole Cadence code, and Avanti denied it. According to Business Week "The Avanti case is probably the most dramatic tale of white-collar crime in the history of Silicon Valley".[12] The Avanti executives eventually pleaded no contest and Cadence received several hundred million dollars in restitution. Avanti was then purchased by Synopsys, which paid $265 million more to settle the remaining claims.[13] The case resulted in a number of legal precedents.[14]
Mentor Graphics[edit]
The Cadence group Quickturn was also involved in a series of legal events with Mentor Graphics/Aptix. Mentor purchased rights to an Aptix patent, then sued Cadence. In this case, the CEO of Aptix, Amr Mohsen, forged a notebook in order to make the patent case stronger. When suspicions were raised, he staged a break-in of his own car to get rid of the evidence, resulting in charges of obstruction of justice. Trying to avoid this, he attempted to flee the country, only to be caught with an illegal passport and a pile of cash. While in jail for this offense, he was recorded offering money to intimidate witnesses and kill the judge.[15] In order to fight the new charges, he tried to feign psychological problems, but left a trail of evidence of his research into this defense, and how it might be done. He was charged with attempting to delay a federal trial by feigning incompetency,[16] but was convicted anyway.[17] According to the lawyers concerned, the original notebooks were not needed for the trial. The patent filing date, which was not in dispute, would have sufficed.

It has its engineering offices in Sunnyvale, Austin and Bangalore. Incorporated in 1996, Denali is headquartered in Sunnyvale, California and serves the global electronics industry with direct sales and support offices in North America, Europe, Japan and Asia.
On May 2010, Cadence Design Systems announced that it would acquire Denali for $315 million.[32]
Valid Logic Systems[edit]
Valid Logic Systems was one of the first commercial electronic design automation (EDA) companies, now acquired by Cadence. It was founded in the early 1980s,[33] along with Daisy Systems Corporation and Mentor Graphics, collectively known as DMV. The engineering founders were L. Curtis Widdoes,[34] Tom McWilliams[35] and Jeff Rubin,[36] all of whom had worked on the S-1 supercomputer project at Livermore Labs.
Valid acquired several companies such as Telesis (PCB layout),[37] Analog Design Tools,[38] and Calma (IC layout). In turn, Valid was acquired by Cadence Design Systems in the early 90s.[39]
Valid built both hardware and software, for schematic capture, logic simulation, static timing analysis, and packaging. Much of the initial software base derived from SCALD ("Structured Computer-Aided Logic Design"), a set of tools developed to support the design of the S-1 supercomputer at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory.[40] Later, Valid expanded into IC design tools and into printed circuit board layout.
At first, Valid ran schematic capture on a proprietary UNIX workstation, the SCALDSystem, with static timing analysis, simulation, and packaging running on a VAX or IBM-compatible mainframe. However, by the mid-1980s, general purpose workstations were powerful enough, significantly cheaper. Companies such as Mentor Graphics and Cadence Design Systems sold software only for such workstations. By 1990, almost all Valid software was also running on workstations, primarily those from Sun Microsystems.
