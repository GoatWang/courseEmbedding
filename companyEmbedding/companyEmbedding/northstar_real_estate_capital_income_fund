Morningstar Ratings1


as of 06/30/2017



Overall





3 Year





5 Year





10 Year







				Morningstar rated the Real Estate Fund among 
230,
230,
201
and 
141
Real Estate
funds for the overall rating and the 3-, 5-, and 10-year periods (as applicable) 
ending 06/30/2017, respectively.


The Overall Morningstar Rating for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance 
figures associated with its three-, five-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. The 
weights are: 100% three-year rating for 36-59 months of total returns, 60% five-year rating/40% three-year 
rating for 60-119 months of total returns, and 50% 10-year rating/30% five-year rating/20% three-year rating 
for 120 or more months of total returns. While the 10-year overall star rating formula seems to give the most 
weight to the 10-year period, the most recent three-year period actually has the greatest impact because it is 
included in all three rating periods.
			

Performance Comparison
as of 
					
						06/30/2017
					
				







							This chart shows the value of a hypothetical $10,000 investment in the fund over the past 10 years or since its inception (for funds lacking 10-year records). The result is compared with benchmarks, which may include a broad-based market index and a peer group average or index. Market indexes do not include expenses, which are deducted from fund returns as well as mutual fund averages and indexes.
						
Benchmark Definitions



1 The Morningstar Rating for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for managed products (including mutual funds, 
variable annuity and variable life subaccounts, exchange-traded funds, closed-end funds, and separate accounts) with at 
least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for 
comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation 
in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent 
performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 
35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. The Overall Morningstar Rating 
for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, 
and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. The weights are: 100% three-year rating for 36-59 months of 
total returns, 60% five-year rating/40% three-year rating for 60-119 months of total returns, and 50% 10-year rating/30% 
five-year rating/20% three-year rating for 120 or more months of total returns. While the 10-year overall star rating 
formula seems to give the most weight to the 10-year period, the most recent three-year period actually has the greatest 
impact because it is included in all three rating periods.

^ The gross expense ratio reflects the fund expenses as stated in the fee table of the fund's 
prospectus prior to the deduction of any waiver or reimbursement. 
The net expense ratio reflects fund expenses after the deduction of any waiver or reimbursement.
If a fund has an active contractual expense ratio limitation, the expiration date is shown below the gross and net
expense ratio values above.  Expense ratios are as of the most recent prospectus.

All mutual funds are subject to market risk, including possible loss of principal.
*Morningstar gives its best ratings of 5 or 4 stars to the top 32.5% of all funds (of the 32.5%, 10% get 5 stars and 22.5% get 4 stars) based on their risk-adjusted returns. The Overall Morningstar Rating™ is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with a fund's 3-, 5-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating™ metrics. As of 6/30/17, 72 of 108 of our rated funds (Investor class only) received an overall rating of 5 or 4 stars.
The Morningstar RatingTM for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for funds with at least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star.

**This chart displays relative risk of each U.S. mutual fund listed using standard deviation of returns. Those values are provided in the bars at the top of the chart.
Methodology: We evaluate the standard deviation and its resulting placement within a specific risk/return category on an annual basis. A fund is generally placed in a risk/return category based on the 10-year standard deviation of its performance. If a fund is less than 10 years old, the actual fund performance history is supplemented with the primary prospectus benchmark history to obtain a full 10-year history, or longest time period available up to 10 years. For an Asset Allocation fund with less than 10 years of performance history, sub-strategy returns are used. When a sub-strategy is less than 10 years old, the actual sub-strategy performance history is supplemented with benchmark history to obtain a full 10-year history, or longest time period available up to 10 years.
Risk return categories overlap; a fund with a standard deviation in the overlap between two categories, denoted by a plus (+), is placed so that its risk categorization is better aligned with anticipated return characteristics an investor may experience going forward at the discretion of T Rowe Price.
When a fund has a cash-like benchmark, denoted by a double plus (++), its standard deviation is estimated using only available fund returns. If the fund is less than 10 years old, benchmark returns are not used to obtain a full 10-year history because they would artificially suppress the volatility estimate.
All investments are subject to market risk, including the possible loss of principal. Standard deviation of returns, a measure of price volatility, is one measure of risk. Please consult the funds’ prospectuses for a more complete discussion of the funds’ risks.

1. Minimum concessions of $19.95 if traded with a Fidelity representative. For U.S Treasury purchases traded with a Fidelity representative, a flat charge of $19.95 per trade applies. A $250 maximum applies to all trades and is reduced to a $50 maximum for bonds maturing in one year or less. Fixed income trading requires a Fidelity brokerage account with a minimum opening balance of $2,500. Rates are for U.S. Dollar denominated bonds, additional fees and minimums apply for non-Dollar bond trades. Other conditions may apply. See Fidelity.com/commissions for details. Please note that concessions may impact the total cost of the transaction and the total, or "effective," yield of your investment. The offering broker, which may be our affiliate National Financial Services LLC, may separately mark up on mark down the price of the security and may realize a trading profit or loss on the transaction.


2. Fidelity commissioned Corporate Insight to study bond pricing, available online, for self-directed retail investors from five brokers that offer corporate and municipal bonds. The study compared online bond prices for over 20,000 municipal and corporate inventory matches between September 2nd and October 6th, 2015. It compared municipal and corporate inventories offered online in quantities of at least $10,000 face or par value. The study found on average that three competitors that bundled their markups or fees into their online bond prices were asking an average of $13.97 more per bond. Corporate Insight determined the average cost differential by calculating the difference between the costs of matching corporate and municipal bond inventory at Fidelity vs. these markup-based firms in the study, then averaging the differences across all of the competitor firms. Hypothetical cost savings of $286 is based on an average size order of $22,000 face or par value bonds and average cost differential of $13 per bond.


          3. For the purposes of FDIC insurance coverage limits, all depository assets of the accountholder at the institution that issued the CD will generally be counted toward the aggregate limit (usually $250,000) for each applicable category of account. FDIC insurance does not cover market losses. All of the new issue brokered CDs Fidelity offers are FDIC insured. In some cases, CDs may be purchased on the secondary market at a price that reflects a premium to their principal value. This premium is ineligible for FDIC insurance. For details on FDIC insurance limits, see www.fdic.gov.
	
    

          4. Fixed annuities available at Fidelity are issued by third-party insurance companies, which are not affiliated with any Fidelity Investments company. These products are distributed by Fidelity Insurance Agency, Inc., and, for certain products, Fidelity Brokerage Services, Member NYSE, SIPC . Some deferred fixed annuities have a market value adjustment (MVA), which generally applies if a client surrenders the contract or withdraws funds in excess of the free withdrawal amount before the end of the guarantee period. The amount the client receives will be adjusted based on interest rate conditions at that time.


Each individual's situation is unique and therefore seeking additional guidance from a tax advisor is suggested. Although deferred fixed annuities offer tax-deferral, if you are considering one to fund a qualified retirement plan or IRA, you should do so for the annuity's features and benefits other than tax deferral. In such cases, tax deferral is not an additional benefit of the deferred fixed annuity.
	
    

          5. A contract's financial guarantees are solely the responsibility of and are subject to the claims-paying ability of the issuing insurance company.


You could lose money by investing in a money market fund. An investment in a money market fund is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. Before investing, always read a money market fund’s prospectus for policies specific to that fund.


          In general, the bond market is volatile, and fixed income securities carry interest rate risk. (As interest rates rise, bond prices usually fall, and vice versa. This effect is usually more pronounced for longer-term securities.) Fixed income securities also carry inflation risk, liquidity risk, call risk, and credit and default risks for both issuers and counterparties. Unlike individual bonds, most bond funds do not have a maturity date, so holding them until maturity to avoid losses caused by price volatility is not possible. Any fixed income security sold or redeemed prior to maturity may be subject to loss.
	
    

High-yield/non-investment-grade bonds involve greater price volatility and risk of default than investment-grade bonds.


          ETFs are subject to market fluctuation and the risks of their underlying investments. ETFs are subject to management fees and other expenses. Unlike mutual funds, ETF shares are bought and sold at market price, which may be higher or lower than their NAV, and are not individually redeemed from the fund.
	
    

          Fidelity makes certain new issue products available without a separate transaction fee. Fidelity may receive compensation from issuers for participating in the offering as a selling group member and/or underwriter. For representative assisted treasury auction orders, a $19.95 transaction fee applies.
	
    

Before investing, consider the funds' investment objectives, risks, charges, and expenses. Contact Fidelity for a prospectus or, if available, a summary prospectus containing this information. Read it carefully.

 Reasons to consider bond funds 

Potential for capital preservation, depending on the fund
Income generation
Diversification for a potential hedge against stock market volatility
Liquidity

Funds are guided by a stated objective, generally focusing on a particular sector, such as corporate or Treasury bonds; a broad category, such as investment grade or high yield securities; or a specific time horizon, such as short-, intermediate-, or long-term bonds.
How Fidelity manages bond funds










Types of bond funds



Investment grade

Invest in high credit quality securities issued by the U.S. Treasury, U.S. government agencies, and U.S. corporations, as well as bonds backed by mortgages or other assets. Learn more about types of investment grade bond funds.

Research municipal bond funds



High yield

Invest primarily in lower credit quality securities, including convertible securities. While these can potentially provide income and total returns higher than those offered by investment grade bond funds, they do have the potential for greater volatility and risk. Learn more about types of high yield bond funds.
Research high yield bond funds



Multisector

Invest in a mix of taxable bonds, including both high yield and investment grade securities issued by the U.S. and by foreign governments, as well as domestic and foreign corporations, giving investors the ability to create a diversified fixed income portfolio through a single fund. Learn more about multisector bond funds.
Research multisector bond funds



International & global

Fidelity fund prices & documents



















Before investing, consider the funds' investment objectives, risks, charges, and expenses. Contact Fidelity for a prospectus or, if available, a summary prospectus containing this information.  Read it carefully.


          In general the bond market is volatile, and fixed income securities carry interest rate risk. (As interest rates rise, bond prices usually fall, and vice versa. This effect is usually more pronounced for longer-term securities.) Fixed income securities also carry inflation risk, liquidity risk, call risk and credit and default risks for both issuers and counterparties. Unlike individual bonds, most bond funds do not have a maturity date, so avoiding losses caused by price volatility by holding them until maturity is not possible.


Foreign investments involve greater risks than U.S. investments, including political and economic risks and the risk of currency fluctuations.
	
    

High-yield/non-investment-grade bonds involve greater price volatility and risk of default than investment-grade bonds.


Investments in mortgage securities are subject to the risk that principal will be repaid prior to maturity.  As a result, when interest rates decline, gains may be reduced, and when interest rates rise, losses may be greater.


          * The municipal market can be affected by adverse tax, legislative or political changes and the financial condition of the issuers of municipal securities. Income exempt from federal income tax may be subject to state or local tax. If a fund investor is resident in the state of issuance of the bonds held by the fund, interest dividends may also be exempt from state and local income taxes. All or a portion of the fund’s income may be subject to the federal alternative minimum tax. Income or fund distributions attributable to capital gains are usually subject to both state and federal income taxes. Generally, tax-exempt municipal securities are not appropriate holdings for tax advantaged accounts such as IRAs and 401(k)s.

Fidelity Fund News & Analysis




Fidelity fund prices & documents



















Before investing, consider the funds' investment objectives, risks, charges, and expenses. Contact Fidelity for a prospectus or, if available, a summary prospectus containing this information.  Read it carefully.


          1.
	
	
	       
					
You could lose money by investing in a money market fund. Although the fund seeks to preserve the value of your investment at $1.00 per share, it cannot guarantee it will do so. An investment in the fund is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. Fidelity Investments and its affiliates, the fund’s sponsor, have no legal obligation to provide financial support to money market funds and you should not expect that the sponsor will provide financial support to the fund at any time.


Fidelity’s government and U.S. Treasury money market funds will not impose a fee upon the sale of your shares, nor temporarily suspend your ability to sell shares if the fund's weekly liquid assets fall below 30% of its total assets because of market conditions or other factors.


          2.
	
	
	       You could lose money by investing in a money market fund. Because the share price of the fund will fluctuate, when you sell your shares they may be worth more or less than what you originally paid for them. The Fund may impose a fee upon the sale of your shares or may temporarily suspend your ability to sell shares if the Fund’s liquidity falls below required minimums because of market conditions or other factors. An investment in the fund is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. Fidelity Investments and its affiliates, the fund’s sponsor, have no legal obligation to provide financial support to the fund, and you should not expect that the sponsor will provide financial support to the fund at any time.

          The municipal market can be affected by adverse tax, legislative or political changes and the financial condition of the issuers of municipal securities. Interest rate increases can cause the price of a money market security to decrease. Municipal funds normally seek to earn income and pay dividends that are expected to be exempt from federal income tax. If a fund investor is resident in the state of issuance of the bonds held by the fund, interest dividends may also be exempt from state and local income taxes. Such interest dividends may be subject to federal and/or state alternative minimum taxes. Certain funds normally seek to invest only in municipal securities generating income exempt from both federal income taxes and the federal alternative minimum tax; however, outcomes cannot be guaranteed, and the funds may sometimes generate income subject to these taxes. Fund shareholders may also receive taxable distributions attributable to a fund's sale of municipal bonds.


Generally, tax-exempt municipal securities are not appropriate holdings for tax advantaged accounts such as IRAs and 401(k)s.
	
    

          * Other fees and expenses applicable to continued investment are described in the fund's current prospectus.

          In general, the bond market is volatile, and fixed income securities carry interest rate risk. (As interest rates rise, bond prices usually fall, and vice versa. This effect is usually more pronounced for longer-term securities.) Fixed income securities also carry inflation risk, liquidity risk, call risk, and credit and default risks for both issuers and counterparties. Unlike individual bonds, most bond funds do not have a maturity date, so holding them until maturity to avoid losses caused by price volatility is not possible. Any fixed income security sold or redeemed prior to maturity may be subject to loss.
	
    

There is an Options Regulatory Fee from $0.04 to $0.06 per contract, which applies to both option buy and sell transactions. The fee is subject to change.


Stock markets are volatile and can fluctuate significantly in response to company, industry, political, regulatory, market, or economic developments. Investing in stock involves risks, including the loss of principal.


Because of their narrow focus, sector investments tend to be more volatile than investments that diversify across many sectors and companies.


System availability and response times may be subject to market conditions.


Before investing in any mutual fund, consider the investment objectives, risks, charges, and expenses. Contact Fidelity for a prospectus or, if available, a summary prospectus containing this information. Read it carefully.

About Us











Who We Are
NorthStar Real Estate Capital Income Master Fund
NorthStar Real Estate Capital Income Master Fund (NorthStar Capital) is an unlisted, closed-end fund registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940. NorthStar Capital intends to primarily invest in commercial real estate (CRE) and real estate-related debt and preferred equity, direct investments in CRE properties, indirect investments through private equity funds and joint ventures, as well as investments in CRE securities. NorthStar Capital seeks to provide shareholders attractive and consistent income through cash distributions, preservation and protection of capital, along with an opportunity for capital appreciation. NorthStar Capital is a master fund, which offers its shares to the public indirectly through feeder funds. There are currently two feeder funds: NorthStar Real Estate Capital Income Fund and NorthStar Real Estate Capital Income Fund-T, which in combination offer four share classes. An investor purchases shares of a feeder fund and each feeder fund purchases shares of NorthStar Capital, which executes the investment strategies described herein and in each Fund’s prospectus. For more information, click here to visit the offering details page.


NorthStar Capital's Investment Objectives






Attractive and Consistent IncomeThrough cash distributions1


 





Preservation of CapitalExposure to institutional quality real estate investments intended to preserve and protect capital


 





Capital AppreciationAn opportunity for capital appreciation and risk-adjusted returns




NorthStar Securities, LLC
NorthStar Securities, LLC (NorthStar Securities) is the broker-dealer affiliate of Colony NorthStar, Inc. and the dealer-manager for NorthStar Capital's public offering. NorthStar Securities strives to assist financial advisors and their clients in making informed investment decisions to meet their financial goals. Based in Denver, NorthStar Securities is registered with the SEC and is a member of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) and the Securities Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC).
*There is no assurance we will achieve any of our investment objectives. 1) There is no guarantee of distributions. Distributions may be paid from sources other than cash flow from operations, including offering proceeds, borrowings or sales of assets, which may reduce an investor’s overall return and may constitute a return of capital. Investors in NorthStar Real Estate Capital Income Fund-T (Fund-T) shares will be subject to a distribution and servicing fee at an annualized rate of 1.0% of the net asset value (NAV) per share in order to compensate the dealer manager and participating broker-dealers and investment representatives for services and expenses related to the marketing, sale and distribution of Fund-T’s shares, which will begin the first month after the completion of the Fund-T offering. Because the distribution and servicing fee is paid out of Fund-T assets on a monthly basis, over time these fees will increase the cost of an investment in Fund-T.

Extremely low volatility could lead to a sharp, but short-lived, decline in stocks

              Millennials are frequently criticized by market experts for the way they invest—or, more accurately, the way they’re not investing—but recent research indicates that at least some young market participants are going about things in a more sophisticated way than they’re typically given credit for.

Dollar struggles at 13-month low as Fed flags sluggish inflation 
              
              A widely watched U.S. dollar gauge languished at a 13-month low Thursday, struggling to shake off the dovish interpretation among investors of the Federal Reserve’s policy statement.

�
Pursuant to the NorthStar Capital Advisory

to the general monitoring of NorthStar Capital, NorthStar Capital-T and NorthStar Master Fund, subject to the oversight of their
respective Boards.
�
E. Existing Affiliated Funds
�
Each of the Existing Affiliated Funds, described
in more detail below, has investment objectives and strategies that are similar to or that overlap with the Regulated Funds�
Objectives and Strategies. To the extent there is an investment that falls within the Objectives and Strategies of one or more
Regulated Funds and the investment objectives and strategies of one or more Affiliated Funds, it is expected that a Regulated Fund
will co-invest with one or more other Regulated Funds and/or one or more Affiliated Funds.
�
Other than NorthStar Secondaries which will
rely on Section 3(c)(7), the Existing Affiliated Funds do not come within the definition of an investment company in Section 3(a)(1)(C)
of the 1940 Act (the �Section 3(a)(1)(C) Funds�) as such Section 3(a)(1)(C) Funds operate through a holding
company structure, conducting their businesses through majority-owned subsidiaries that are not themselves investment companies.
With respect to each Section 3(a)(1)(C) Fund, securities issued by its
subsidiaries that rely on the exception from the definition of investment company in Section 3(c)(1) or 3(c)(7) of the 1940 Act,
together with any other �investment securities� within the meaning of Section 3(a)(2) of the 1940 Act that such Section
3(a)(1)(C) Fund may own directly, may not have a combined value in excess of 40% of the value of such Existing Affiliated Fund�s
total assets on an unconsolidated basis. Most of the subsidiaries of the Section 3(a)(1)(C) Funds will rely on the exception
from the definition of an investment company under Section 3(c)(5)(C) of the 1940 Act.
�
Each of the Existing Affiliated Funds is
managed by an affiliate of NorthStar. Each of the Existing Affiliated Funds and the corresponding Existing Advisers to Affiliated
Funds are set forth in Appendix A hereto. Each of the Existing Advisers to Affiliated Funds is or will be

NSAM D-RECF, LLC serves as the investment co-adviser (the �Co-Adviser�) to NorthStar Capital and
NorthStar Master Fund pursuant to the terms of the NorthStar Capital Co-Advisory Agreement and the NorthStar Master Fund Co-Advisory
Agreement, respectively. The Co-Adviser and NSAM Adviser are both wholly-owned by the operating partnership of NorthStar, NSAM
LP, which is, in turn, 99%-owned by NorthStar. As a result, the Co-Adviser is not included as a party to the Application.
�

�7�
�
�
registered with the Commission as an investment adviser. As
described below, the investment strategies of the Existing Affiliated Funds are similar to those of the Existing Regulated Funds.
�
1.���NorthStar Secondaries
�
NorthStar Secondaries is a recently formed
Delaware limited partnership. NorthStar Secondaries� investment objective is to generate capital appreciation and distributions
primarily through equity investments in real estate-focused private equity fund interests acquired on the secondary market.�
NorthStar Secondaries may invest up to 10% of its capital in non-real estate-focused funds.
�
2.�NorthStar Realty
�
NorthStar Realty was formed as a Delaware
limited partnership on March 9, 2015 and is the operating partnership for NorthStar Realty Finance Corp., a publicly-traded REIT
that held its initial public offering in 2004. As a diversified commercial real estate business, approximately 82% of NorthStar
Realty�s total assets are invested in real estate. NorthStar Realty�s investment objective is to invest in global CRE
property and other real estate assets that it expects will generate attractive risk-adjusted returns and in turn will generate
stable cash flow for distribution purposes. NorthStar Realty invests in multiple asset classes across CRE and such investments
may take the form of acquiring real estate, originating or acquiring senior or subordinate loans, as well as pursuing opportunistic
CRE investments, both in the United States and internationally.
�
3.�NorthStar Income

III. Order Requested 
�
The Applicants request the Order of the
Commission under Sections�17(d) and�57(i) under the�1940 Act, and Rule�17d-l under the�1940 Act to permit,
subject to the terms and conditions set forth below in this Application (the �Conditions�), one or more Regulated
Funds to be able to participate in Co-Investment Transactions with one or more other Regulated Funds and/or one or more Affiliated
Funds.
�
The Regulated Funds and the Affiliated Funds
seek relief to invest in Co-Investment Transactions because such Co-Investment Transactions would otherwise be prohibited by Sections�17(d)
and�57(a)(4) of the�1940 Act and Rule�17d-l under the�1940 Act. This Application seeks relief in order to (i)�enable
the Regulated Funds and the Affiliated Funds to avoid the practical difficulties of trying to structure, negotiate and persuade
counterparties to enter into transactions while awaiting the granting of the relief requested in individual applications with respect
to each Co-Investment Transaction that arises in the future, and (ii)�enable the Regulated Funds and the Affiliated Funds
to avoid the significant legal and other expenses that would be incurred in preparing such individual applications.

A.Section�17(d) and Section�57(a)(4) 
�
Section�17(d) of the�1940 Act
generally prohibits an affiliated person (as defined in Section�2(a)(3) of the�1940 Act), or an affiliated person of
such affiliated person, of a registered closed-end investment company acting as principal, from effecting any transaction in which
the registered closed-end investment company is a joint or a joint and several participant, in contravention of such rules as
the Commission may prescribe for the purpose of limiting or preventing participation by the registered closed-end investment company
on a basis different from or less advantageous than that of such other participant. Rule�17d�1 under the�1940
Act generally prohibits participation by a registered investment company and an affiliated person (as defined in Section�2(a)(3)
of the�1940 Act) or principal underwriter for that investment company, or an affiliated person of such affiliated person
or principal underwriter, in any �joint enterprise or other joint arrangement or profit-sharing plan,� as defined
in the rule, without prior approval by the Commission by order upon application.
�
Similarly, with regard to BDCs, Section�57(a)(4)
of the�1940 Act prohibits certain persons specified in Section�57(b) of the�1940 Act from participating in a joint
transaction with a BDC or a company controlled by a BDC in contravention of rules as prescribed by the Commission. In particular
Section�57(a)(4) of the�1940 Act applies to:
�

�Any director, officer, employee, or member of an advisory board of a BDC, or any person (other than the BDC itself) who is
an affiliated person of the foregoing pursuant to Section�2(a)(3)(C) of the�1940 Act; or
�

�Any investment adviser or promoter of, general partner in, principal underwriter for, or person directly or indirectly either
controlling, controlled by, or under common control with, a BDC,13
or any person who is an affiliated person of any of the foregoing within the meaning of Section�2(a)(3)(C) or (D)�of
the�1940 Act.
�
Section�2(a)(3)(C) of the�1940
Act defines an �affiliated person� of another person to include any person directly or indirectly controlling, controlled
by, or under common control with, such other person. Section�2(a)(9) of the�1940 Act defines �control� as
the power to exercise a controlling influence over the management or policies of a company, unless such power is solely the result
of an official position with that company. Under Section�2(a)(9) of the�1940 Act a person who beneficially owns, either
directly or through one or more controlled companies, more than�25% of the voting securities of a company is presumed to control
such company. The Commission and its staff have indicated on a number of occasions their belief that an investment adviser controls
the fund that it advises, absent compelling evidence to the contrary.14
�
NSAM Adviser serves as the investment adviser
to NorthStar Capital and NorthStar Master Fund, respectively, and an Adviser will be the investment adviser to each of the Future
�

�
�
13
Excluded from this category are the BDC itself and any person who, if it were not directly or indirectly controlled by the BDC,
would not otherwise be under common control with the BDC.
�
14
See, e.g., In re Investment Company Mergers, SEC Rel. No. IC�25259 (Nov. 8, 2001); In re Steadman Security Corp.,
46 S.E.C. 896, 920 n.81 (1977)�(�[T]he investment adviser almost always controls the fund. Only in the very rare case
where the adviser�s role is simply that of advising others who may or may not elect to be guided by his advice�can
the adviser realistically be deemed not in control.�).
�

�10�
�
��
Regulated Funds. NSAM Adviser may be deemed to control the Existing
Regulated Funds, and any other Adviser will be controlling, controlled by, or under common control with NSAM Adviser. In addition,
an Adviser will be the investment adviser to each Affiliated Fund. The Regulated Funds may be deemed to be under common control,
and thus affiliated persons of each other under Section�2(a)(3)(C) of the�1940 Act. In addition, the Affiliated Funds
may be deemed to be under common control with the Regulated Funds, and thus affiliated persons of each Regulated Fund under Section�2(a)(3)(C)
of the�1940 Act. As a result, these relationships might cause a Regulated Fund and one or more other Regulated Funds and/or
one or more Affiliated Funds participating in Co-Investment Transactions to be subject to Sections�17(d) or�57(a)(4)
of the�1940 Act, and thus subject to the provisions of Rule�17d-l of the�1940 Act.
�

B.Rule�17d�1 
�
Rule�17d�l under the�1940
Act generally prohibits participation by a registered investment company and an affiliated person (as defined in Section�2(a)(3)
of the�1940 Act) or principal underwriter for that investment company, or an affiliated person of such affiliated person or
principal underwriter, in any �joint enterprise or other joint arrangement or profit-sharing plan,� as defined in the
rule, without prior approval by the Commission by order upon application.
�
Rule�17d�1 was promulgated by
the Commission pursuant to Section�17(d) of the�1940 Act and made applicable to BDCs by Section�57(i) of the�1940
Act. Section�57(i) of the�1940 Act provides that, until the Commission prescribes rules under Section�57(a)(4) of
the�1940 Act, the Commission�s rules under Section�17(d) of the�1940 Act applicable to registered closed-end
investment companies will be deemed to apply. Because the Commission has not adopted any rules under Section�57(a)(4) of the�1940
Act, Rule�17d�I under the�1940 Act applies.
�
Applicants seek relief pursuant to Rule�17d-l
under the�1940 Act, which permits the Commission to authorize joint transactions upon application. In passing upon applications
filed pursuant to Rule�I7d�l under the�1940 Act, the Commission is directed by Rule�17d�1(b) under the�1940
Act to consider whether the participation of a registered investment company or controlled company thereof in the joint enterprise
or joint arrangement under scrutiny is consistent with provisions, policies and purposes of the�1940 Act and the extent to
which such participation is on a basis different from or less advantageous than that of other participants.
�
The Commission has stated that Section�17(d)
of the�1940 Act, upon which Rule�17d�1 under the�1940 Act is based, and upon which Section�57(a)(4) of
the�1940 Act was modeled, was designed to protect investment companies from self-dealing and overreaching by insiders. The
Commission has also taken notice that there may be transactions subject to these prohibitions that do not present the dangers of
overreaching. See Protecting Investors: A Half-Century of Investment Company Regulation, 1504 Fed. Sec. L. Rep., Extra Edition
(May�29, 1992) at�488 et seq. The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit has enunciated a like rationale for
the purpose behind Section�17(d): �The objective of [Section] 17(d) . . . is to prevent . . . injuring the interest
of stockholders of registered investment companies by causing the company to participate on a basis different from or less advantageous
than that of such other participants.� Securities and Exchange Commission v. Talley Industries. Inc., 399 F.2d�396,
405 (2d Cir. 1968), cert. denied 393 U.S.�1015 (1969). Furthermore, Congress acknowledged that the protective system
established by the enactment of Section�57 is �similar to that applicable to registered investment
�

�11�
�
��
companies under section�17 of the�1940 Act, and rules
thereunder, but is modified to address concerns relating to unique characteristics presented by business development companies.�
H.Rep. No.�96-1341, 96th Cong., 2d Sess. 45 (1980)�reprinted in�1980 U.S.C.C.A.N. 4827.
�
Applicants believe that the terms and conditions
of this Application would ensure that the conflicts of interest that Section�17(d) and Section�57(a)(4) of the�1940
Act were designed to prevent would be addressed and the standards for an order under Rule�17d�1 under the�1940
Act are met.
�

C.Protection Provided by the Proposed Conditions 
�
Applicants believe that the proposed conditions,
as discussed more fully in Section�III.D. of this Application (the �Conditions�), will ensure the protection
of shareholders of the Regulated Funds and compliance with the purposes and policies of the�1940 Act with respect to the Co-Investment
Transactions. In particular, the Conditions, as outlined below, would ensure that each Regulated Fund would only invest in investments
that are appropriate to the interests of shareholders and the investment needs and abilities of that Regulated Fund. In addition,
each Regulated Fund would be able to invest on equal footing with each other Regulated Fund and the Affiliated Funds, including
identical terms, conditions, price, class of securities purchased, settlement date, and registration rights. Each Regulated Fund
would have the ability to engage in Follow-On Investments in a fair manner consistent with the protections of the other conditions.
Each Regulated Fund would have the ability to participate on a proportionate basis, at the same price and on the same terms and
conditions in any sale of a security purchased in a Co-Investment Transaction. Fees and expenses of Co-Investment Transactions
would be borne by the applicable Adviser, or shared pro-rata among the Regulated Funds and Affiliated Funds who participate in
the Co-Investment Transactions. The conditions would also prevent a Regulated Fund from investing in any current investments of
an affiliated person, which eliminates the possibility of a Regulated Fund from being forced to invest in a manner that would benefit
an affiliated person�s existing investment. Also, sufficient records of the transactions would be maintained to permit the
examination staff of the Commission to monitor compliance with the terms of the requested order.
�
The Conditions impose a variety of duties
on the Advisers with respect to Co-Investment Transactions and Potential Co-Investment Transactions by the Regulated Funds. These
duties include determinations regarding investment appropriateness, the appropriate level of investment, and the provision of information
to the Board of any Regulated Fund. In addition, when considering Potential Co-Investment Transactions for any Regulated Fund,
the applicable Adviser will consider only the Objectives and Strategies, investment policies, investment positions, Available Capital
(defined below), and other pertinent factors applicable to that Regulated Fund. Each Adviser, as applicable, undertakes to perform
these duties consistently for each Regulated Fund, as applicable, regardless of which of them serves as investment adviser to these
entities. The participation of a Regulated Fund in a Potential Co-Investment Transaction may only be approved by a required majority,
as defined in Section�57(o) (a �Required Majority�), of the directors of the Board eligible to vote on
that Co-Investment Transaction under Section�57(o) (the �Eligible Directors�).15
�

�
�
15
In the case of a Regulated Fund that is a registered closed-end fund, the Board members that make up the Required Majority will
be determined as if the Regulated Fund were a BDC subject to Section�57(o).
�

�12�
�
��
If an Adviser, its principals, or any
person controlling, controlled by, or under common control with the Adviser or its principals, and the Affiliated Funds (collectively,
the �Holders�) own in the aggregate more than 25 percent of the outstanding voting shares of a Regulated Fund
(the �Shares�), then the Holders will vote such Shares as required under condition 14.
�
Applicants believe that this condition
will ensure that the Independent Directors will act independently in evaluating the Co-Investment Program, because the ability
of the Adviser or its principals to influence the Independent Directors by a suggestion, explicit or implied, that the Independent
Directors can be removed will be limited significantly. The Independent Directors shall evaluate and approve any such voting trust
or proxy adviser, taking into accounts its qualifications, reputation for independence, cost to the Regulated Fund�s shareholders,
and other factors that they deem relevant.
�
The amount of each Regulated Fund�s
capital available for investment (�Available Capital�) will be determined based on the amount of cash on hand,
existing commitments and reserves, if any, the targeted leverage level, targeted asset mix and other investment policies and restrictions
set from time to time by the Board of the applicable Regulated Fund or imposed by applicable laws, rules, regulations or interpretations.
Likewise, an Affiliated Fund�s capital available for investment will be determined based on the amount of cash on hand, existing
commitments and reserves, if any, the targeted leverage level, targeted asset mix and other investment policies and restrictions
set by the Affiliated Fund�s directors, general partners or adviser or imposed by applicable laws, rules, regulations or
interpretations.
�
In sum, the Applicants believe that the
proposed conditions would ensure that each Regulated Fund that participates in a Co-Investment Transaction does not participate
on a basis different from, or less advantageous than, that of such other participants. As a result, the Applicants believe that
the participation of the Regulated Funds in Co-Investment Transactions done in accordance with the Conditions would be consistent
with the provisions, policies, and purposes of the�1940 Act, and would be done in a manner that was not different from, or
less advantageous than, the other participants.
�
With respect to each Wholly-Owned Investment
Sub, such a subsidiary would be prohibited from investing in a Co-Investment Transaction with an Affiliated Fund or Regulated Fund
because it would be a company controlled by its parent Regulated Fund for purposes of Section�57(a)(4) of the�1940 Act
and Rule�17d-l under the�1940 Act. Applicants request that each Wholly-Owned Investment Sub be permitted to participate
in Co-Investment Transactions in lieu of its parent Regulated Fund and that the Wholly-Owned Investment Sub�s participation
in any such transaction be treated, for purposes of the Order, as though the parent Regulated Fund were participating directly.
Applicants represent that this treatment is justified because a Wholly-Owned Investment Sub would have no purpose other than serving
as a holding vehicle for the Regulated Fund�s investments and, therefore, no conflicts of interest could arise between the
Regulated Fund and the Wholly-Owned Investment Sub. The Regulated Fund�s Board would make all relevant determinations under
the conditions with regard to a Wholly-Owned Investment Sub�s participation in a Co-Investment Transaction, and the Regulated
Fund�s Board would be informed of, and take into consideration, any proposed use of a Wholly-Owned Investment Sub in the
Regulated Fund�s place. If the Regulated Fund proposes to participate in the same Co-Investment Transaction with any of its
Wholly-Owned Investment Subs, the Board
�

�13�
�
��
will also be informed of, and take into consideration, the relative
participation of the Regulated Fund and the Wholly-Owned Investment Sub.
�

D.Proposed Conditions 
�
Applicants agree that any Order granting
the requested relief shall be subject to the following Conditions:
�

1.Each time an Adviser considers a Potential Co-Investment Transaction for an Affiliated Fund or another Regulated Fund that
falls within a Regulated Fund�s then-current Objectives and Strategies, the Regulated Fund�s Adviser will make an independent
determination of the appropriateness of the investment for such Regulated Fund in light of the Regulated Fund�s then-current
circumstances.
�

2.(a) If the Adviser deems a Regulated Fund�s participation in any Potential Co-Investment Transaction to be appropriate
for the Regulated Fund, it will then determine an appropriate level of investment for the Regulated Fund.
�
(b) If the aggregate amount recommended by the applicable
Adviser to be invested by the applicable Regulated Fund in the Potential Co-Investment Transaction, together with the amount proposed
to be invested by the other participating Regulated Funds and Affiliated Funds, collectively, in the same transaction, exceeds
the amount of the investment opportunity, the investment opportunity will be allocated among them pro rata based on each participant�s
Available Capital, up to the amount proposed to be invested by each. The applicable Adviser will provide the Eligible Directors
of each participating Regulated Fund with information concerning each participating party�s Available Capital to assist the
Eligible Directors with their review of the Regulated Fund�s investments for compliance with these allocation procedures.
�
(c) After making the determinations required in conditions�1
and�2(a), the applicable Adviser will distribute written information concerning the Potential Co-Investment Transaction (including
the amount proposed to be invested by each participating Regulated Fund and Affiliated Fund) to the Eligible Directors of each
participating Regulated Fund for their consideration. A Regulated Fund will co-invest with one or more other Regulated Funds and/or
one or more Affiliated Funds only if, prior to the Regulated Fund�s participation in the Potential Co-Investment Transaction,
a Required Majority concludes that:
�
(i) the terms of the Potential Co-Investment Transaction,
including the consideration to be paid, are reasonable and fair to the Regulated Fund and its shareholders and do not involve overreaching
in respect of the Regulated Fund or its shareholders on the part of any person concerned;
�
(ii) the Potential Co-Investment Transaction is consistent
with:
�
(A) the interests of the shareholders
of the Regulated Fund; and
�
(B) the Regulated Fund�s then-current
Objectives and Strategies;
�
(iii) the investment by any other Regulated Funds or
Affiliated Funds would not disadvantage the Regulated Fund, and participation by the Regulated Fund would not be on a basis different
from or less advantageous than that of other Regulated
�

�14�
�
��
Funds or Affiliated Funds; provided that, if
any other Regulated Fund or Affiliated Fund, but not the Regulated Fund itself, gains the right to nominate a director for election
to a portfolio company�s board of directors or the right to have a board observer or any similar right to participate in
the governance or management of the portfolio company, such event shall not be interpreted to prohibit the Required Majority from
reaching the conclusions required by this condition (2)(c)(iii), if:
�
(A) the Eligible Directors will
have the right to ratify the selection of such director or board observer, if any;
�
(B) the applicable Adviser agrees
to, and does, provide periodic reports to the Regulated Fund�s Board with respect to the actions of such director or the
information received by such board observer or obtained through the exercise of any similar right to participate in the governance
or management of the portfolio company; and
�
(C) any fees or other compensation
that any Affiliated Fund or any Regulated Fund or any affiliated person of any Affiliated Fund or any Regulated Fund receives in
connection with the right of the Affiliated Fund or a Regulated Fund to nominate a director or appoint a board observer or otherwise
to participate in the governance or management of the portfolio company will be shared proportionately among the participating
Affiliated Funds (who each may, in turn, share its portion with its affiliated persons) and the participating Regulated Funds in
accordance with the amount of each party�s investment; and
�

(iv)��the proposed investment by the Regulated Fund will not benefit the Advisers, the Affiliated Funds or the other
Regulated Funds or any affiliated person of any of them (other than the parties to the Co-Investment Transaction), except (A)�to
the extent permitted by condition�13, (B)�to the extent permitted by Section�17(e) or�57(k) of the�1940
Act, as applicable, (C)�indirectly, as a result of an interest in the securities issued by one of the parties to the Co-Investment
Transaction, or (D)�in the case of fees or other compensation described in condition�2(c)(iii)(C).
�

3.Each Regulated Fund has the right to decline to participate in any Potential Co-Investment Transaction or to invest less than
the amount proposed.
�

4.The applicable Adviser will present to the Board of each Regulated Fund, on a quarterly basis, a record of all investments
in Potential Co-Investment Transactions made by any of the other Regulated Funds or Affiliated Funds during the preceding quarter
that fell within the Regulated Fund�s then-current Objectives and Strategies that were not made available to the Regulated
Fund, and an explanation of why the investment opportunities were not offered to the Regulated Fund. All information presented
to the Board pursuant to this condition will be kept for the life of the Regulated Fund and at least two years thereafter, and
will be subject to examination by the Commission and its staff.
�

�15�
�
��

5.Except for Follow-On Investments made in accordance with condition�8,16
a Regulated Fund will not invest in reliance on the Order in any issuer in which another Regulated Fund, Affiliated Fund, or any
affiliated person of another Regulated Fund or Affiliated Fund is an existing investor.
�

6.A Regulated Fund will not participate in any Potential Co-Investment Transaction unless the terms, conditions, price, class
of securities to be purchased, settlement date, and registration rights will be the same for each participating Regulated Fund
and Affiliated Fund. The grant to an Affiliated Fund or another Regulated Fund, but not the Regulated Fund, of the right to nominate
a director for election to a portfolio company�s board of directors, the right to have an observer on the board of directors
or similar rights to participate in the governance or management of the portfolio company will not be interpreted so as to violate
this condition�6, if conditions�2(c)(iii)(A), (B)�and (C)�are met.
�

7.(a) If any Affiliated Fund or any Regulated Fund elects to sell, exchange or otherwise dispose of an interest in a security
that was acquired in a Co-Investment Transaction, the applicable Advisers will:
�
(i) notify each Regulated Fund
that participated in the Co-Investment Transaction of the proposed disposition at the earliest practical time; and
�
(ii) formulate a recommendation
as to participation by each Regulated Fund in the disposition.
�

(b) Each Regulated Fund will have the right to participate in such disposition on a proportionate basis, at the same price
and on the same terms and conditions as those applicable to the participating Affiliated Funds and Regulated Funds.
�

(c) A Regulated Fund may participate in such disposition without obtaining prior approval of the Required Majority if: (i)�the
proposed participation of each Regulated Fund and each Affiliated Fund in such disposition is proportionate to its outstanding
investments in the issuer immediately preceding the disposition; (ii)�the Board of the Regulated Fund has approved as being
in the best interests of the Regulated Fund the ability to participate in such dispositions on a pro rata basis (as described in
greater detail in this application); and (iii)�the Board of the Regulated Fund is provided on a quarterly basis with a list
of all dispositions made in accordance with this condition. In all other cases, the Adviser will provide its written recommendation
as to the Regulated Fund�s participation to the Eligible Directors, and the Regulated Fund will participate in such disposition
solely to the extent that a Required Majority determines that it is in the Regulated Fund�s best interests.
�

(d) Each Affiliated Fund and each Regulated Fund will bear its own expenses in connection with any such disposition.
�

8.(a) If any Affiliated Fund or any Regulated Fund desires to make a Follow-On Investment in a portfolio company whose securities
were acquired in a Co-Investment Transaction, the applicable Advisers will:
�

�
�
16
This exception applies only to Follow-On Investments by a Regulated Fund in issuers in which the Regulated Fund already holds investments.
�

�16�
�
��
(i) notify each Regulated Fund
that participated in the Co-Investment Transaction of the proposed transaction at the earliest practical time; and
�
(ii) formulate a recommendation
as to the proposed participation, including the amount of the proposed Follow-On Investment, by each Regulated Fund.
�

(b) A Regulated Fund may participate in such Follow-On Investment without obtaining prior approval of the Required Majority
if: (i)�the proposed participation of each Regulated Fund and each Affiliated Fund in such investment is proportionate to
its outstanding investments in the issuer immediately preceding the Follow-On Investment; and (ii)�the Board of the Regulated
Fund has approved as being in the best interests of the Regulated Fund the ability to participate in Follow-On Investments on a
pro rata basis (as described in greater detail in this application). In all other cases, the Adviser will provide its written recommendation
as to the Regulated Fund�s participation to the Eligible Directors, and the Regulated Fund will participate in such Follow-On
Investment solely to the extent that a Required Majority determines that it is in the Regulated Fund�s best interests.
�
(c) If, with respect to any Follow-On Investment:
�
(i) the amount of the opportunity
is not based on the Regulated Funds� and the Affiliated Funds� outstanding investments immediately preceding the Follow-On
Investment; and
�
(ii) the aggregate amount recommended
by the applicable Adviser to be invested by the applicable Regulated Fund in the Follow-On Investment, together with the amount
proposed to be invested by the other participating Regulated Funds and Affiliated Funds, collectively, in the same transaction,
exceeds the amount of the investment opportunity, then the investment opportunity will be allocated among them pro rata based on
each participant�s Available Capital, up to the maximum amount proposed to be invested by each.
�

(d) The acquisition of Follow-On Investments as permitted by this condition will be considered a Co-Investment Transaction
for all purposes and subject to the other conditions set forth in this application.
�

9.The Non-Interested Directors of each Regulated Fund will be provided quarterly for review all information concerning Potential
Co-Investment Transactions and Co-Investment Transactions, including investments made by other Regulated Funds or Affiliated Funds
that the Regulated Fund considered but declined to participate in, so that the Non-Interested Directors may determine whether all
investments made during the preceding quarter, including those investments that the Regulated Fund considered but declined to participate
in, comply with the conditions of the Order. In addition, the Non-Interested Directors will consider at least annually the continued
appropriateness for the Regulated Fund of participating in new and existing Co-Investment Transactions.
�

10.Each Regulated Fund will maintain the records required by Section�57(f)(3) of the�1940 Act as if each of the Regulated
Funds were a BDC and each of the investments permitted under these conditions were approved by the Required Majority under Section�57(f)
of the�1940 Act.
�

�17�
�
��

11.No Non-Interested Director of a Regulated Fund will also be a director, general partner, managing member or principal, or otherwise
an �affiliated person� (as defined in the�1940 Act) of an Affiliated Fund.
�

12.The expenses, if any, associated with acquiring, holding or disposing of any securities acquired in a Co-Investment Transaction
(including, without limitation, the expenses of the distribution of any such securities registered for sale under the�1933
Act) will, to the extent not payable by the Advisers under their respective investment advisory agreements with Affiliated Funds
and the Regulated Funds, be shared by the Regulated Funds and the Affiliated Funds in proportion to the relative amounts of the
securities held or to be acquired or disposed of, as the case may be.
�

13.Any transaction fee (including break-up or commitment fees but excluding broker�s fees contemplated Section�17(e)
or�57(k) of the�1940 Act, as applicable), received in connection with a Co-Investment Transaction will be distributed
to the participating Regulated Funds and Affiliated Funds on a pro rata basis based on the amounts they invested or committed,
as the case may be, in such Co-Investment Transaction. If any transaction fee is to be held by an Adviser pending consummation
of the transaction, the fee will be deposited into an account maintained by such Adviser at a bank or banks having the qualifications
prescribed in Section�26(a)(1) of the�1940 Act, and the account will earn a competitive rate of interest that will also
be divided pro rata among the participating Regulated Funds and Affiliated Funds based on the amounts they invest in such Co-Investment
Transaction. None of the Affiliated Funds, the Advisers, the other Regulated Funds or any affiliated person of the Regulated Funds
or Affiliated Funds will receive additional compensation or remuneration of any kind as a result of or in connection with a Co-Investment
Transaction (other than (a)�in the case of the Regulated Funds and the Affiliated Funds, the pro rata transaction fees described
above and fees or other compensation described in condition�2(c)(iii)(C); and (b)�in the case of an Adviser, investment
advisory fees paid in accordance with the agreement between the Adviser and the Regulated Fund or Affiliated Fund.
�

14.If the Holders own in the aggregate more than 25 percent of the Shares of a Regulated Fund, then the Holders will vote such
Shares as directed by an independent third party (such as the trustee of a voting trust or a proxy adviser) when voting on (1)
the election of directors; (2) the removal of one or more directors; or (3) any matters requiring approval by the vote of a majority
of the outstanding voting securities, as defined in section 2(a)(42) of the 1940 Act.
�
IV. Statement in Support of Relief Requested 
�
Applicants submit that allowing the Co-Investment
Transactions described by this Application is justified on the basis of (i)�the potential benefits to the Regulated Funds
and the shareholders thereof and (ii)�the protections found in the terms and conditions set forth in this Application.
�

A.Potential Benefits 
�
In the absence of the relief sought hereby,
in some circumstances the Regulated Funds would be limited in their ability to participate in attractive and appropriate investment
opportunities. Section�17(d) and Section�57(a)(4) of the�1940 Act and Rule�17d�1 under the�1940
�

�18�
�
��
Act should not prevent BDCs and registered closed�end
investment companies from making investments that are in the best interests of their shareholders.
�
In cases where the Advisers identify investment
opportunities requiring larger capital commitments, they must seek the participation of other entities with similar investment
styles. The ability to participate in Co-Investment Transactions that involve committing larger amounts of financing would enable
each Regulated Fund to participate with one or more of the Affiliated Funds and the other Regulated Funds in larger financing commitments,
which would, in turn, be expected to obtain discounted prices and increase income, expand investment opportunities and provide
better access to due diligence information for the Regulated Funds. Indeed, each Regulated Fund�s inability to co-invest
with one or more of the Affiliated Funds and the other Regulated Funds could potentially result in the loss of beneficial investment
opportunities for such Regulated Fund and, in turn, adversely affect such Regulated Fund�s shareholders. For example, a Regulated
Fund may lose investment opportunities if the Adviser cannot provide �one-stop� financing to a potential portfolio
company. Portfolio companies may reject an offer of funding arranged by an Adviser due to a Regulated Fund�s inability to
commit the full amount of financing required by the portfolio company in a timely manner (i.e., without the delay that typically
would be associated with obtaining single-transaction exemptive relief from the Commission). The Regulated Fund Advisers expect
that any portfolio company that is an appropriate investment for a Regulated Fund should also be an appropriate investment for
one or more other Regulated Funds and/or one or more Affiliated Funds, with certain exceptions based on available capital or diversification.
The Regulated Funds, however, will not be obligated to invest, or co-invest, when investment opportunities are referred to them.
�
Each Regulated Fund and its shareholders
will benefit from the ability to participate in Co-Investment Transactions. The Board of each Regulated Fund, including the Non-Interested
Directors, has (or will have prior to relying on the requested Order) determined that it is in the best interests of the Regulated
Fund to participate in Co-Investment Transactions because, among other matters, (i)�the Regulated Fund will be able to participate
in a larger number and greater variety of transactions; (ii)�the Regulated Fund will be able to participate in larger transactions;
(iii)�the Regulated Fund will be able to participate in all opportunities approved by a Required Majority or otherwise permissible
under the Order rather than risk underperformance through rotational allocation of opportunities among the Regulated Funds; (iv)�the
Regulated Fund and any other Regulated Funds participating in the proposed investment will have greater bargaining power, more
control over the investment and less need to bring in other external investors or structure investments to satisfy the different
needs of external investors; (v)�the Regulated Fund will be able to obtain greater attention and better deal flow from investment
bankers and others who act as sources of investments; and (vi)�the general terms and conditions of the proposed Order are
fair to the Regulated Funds and their shareholders. The Company�s Board, including the Non-Interested Directors, also determined
that it is in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders to obtain the Order at the earliest possible time and instructed
the officers of the Company, the Advisers and counsel to use all appropriate efforts to accomplish such goal. For these reasons,
the Board has determined (or will have prior to relying on the requested Order) that is proper and desirable for the Company to
participate in Co-Investment Transactions with the other Regulated Funds and/or one more Affiliated Funds.
�

�19�
�
��

B.Protective Representations and Conditions 
�
The terms and conditions set forth in this
application ensure that the proposed Co-Investment Transactions are consistent with the protection of each Regulated Fund�s
shareholders and with the purposes intended by the policies and provisions of the�1940 Act. Specifically, the Conditions incorporate
the following critical protections: (i)�in each Co-Investment Transaction, all Regulated Funds and Affiliated Funds participating
in the Co-Investment Transactions will invest at the same time for the same price and with the same terms, conditions, class, registration
rights and any other rights, so that none of them receives terms more favorable than any other; (ii)�a Required Majority of
each Regulated Fund must approve various investment decisions with respect to such Regulated Fund in accordance with the Conditions;
and (iii)�the Regulated Funds are required to retain and maintain certain records.
�
Other than pro rata dispositions and Follow-On
Investments as provided in conditions�7 and�8, and after making the determinations required in conditions�1 and�2(a),
the Adviser will present each Potential Co-Investment Transaction and the proposed allocation to the Eligible Directors, and the
Required Majority will approve each Co-Investment Transaction prior to any investment by the participating Regulated Fund. With
respect to the pro rata dispositions and Follow-On Investments provided in conditions�7 and�8, a Regulated Fund may
participate in a pro rata disposition or Follow-On Investment without obtaining prior approval of the Required Majority if, among
other things: (i)�the proposed participation of each Regulated Fund and Affiliated Fund in such disposition is proportionate
to its outstanding investments in the issuer immediately preceding the disposition or Follow-On Investment, as the case may be;
and (ii)�the Board of the Regulated Fund has approved that Regulated Fund�s participation in pro rata dispositions
and Follow-On Investments as being in the best interests of the Regulated Fund. If the Board does not so approve, any such disposition
or Follow-On Investment will be submitted to the Regulated Fund�s Eligible Directors. The Board of any Regulated Fund may
at any time rescind, suspend or qualify its approval of pro rata dispositions and Follow-On Investments with the result that all
dispositions and/or Follow-On Investments must be submitted to the Eligible Directors.
�
The Applicants believe that participation
by the Regulated Funds in pro rata dispositions and Follow-On Investments, as provided in conditions�7 and�8, is consistent
with the provisions, policies and purposes of the�1940 Act and will not be made on a basis different from or less advantageous
than that of other participants. A formulaic approach, such as pro rata dispositions and Follow-On Investments, eliminates the
discretionary ability to make allocation determinations, and in turn eliminates the possibility for overreaching and promotes fairness.
The Applicants note that the Commission has adopted a similar pro rata approach in the context of Rule�23c-2 under the�1940
Act, which relates to the redemption by a closed-end investment company of less than all of a class of its securities, indicating
the general fairness and lack of overreaching that such approach provides.
�
The foregoing analysis applies equally where
a Wholly-Owned Investment Sub is involved in a Co-Investment Transaction as each Wholly-Owned Investment Sub will be treated as
one company with its parent for purposes of this Application.
�
V. Precedents 
�

permitting certain investment companies subject to regulation under the�1940 Act and their affiliated persons to co-invest
in Private

Morningstar Ratings1


as of 06/30/2017



Overall





3 Year





5 Year





10 Year







				Morningstar rated the Real Estate Fund among 
230,
230,
201
and 
141
Real Estate
funds for the overall rating and the 3-, 5-, and 10-year periods (as applicable) 
ending 06/30/2017, respectively.


The Overall Morningstar Rating for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance 
figures associated with its three-, five-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. The 
weights are: 100% three-year rating for 36-59 months of total returns, 60% five-year rating/40% three-year 
rating for 60-119 months of total returns, and 50% 10-year rating/30% five-year rating/20% three-year rating 
for 120 or more months of total returns. While the 10-year overall star rating formula seems to give the most 
weight to the 10-year period, the most recent three-year period actually has the greatest impact because it is 
included in all three rating periods.
			

Performance Comparison
as of 
					
						06/30/2017
					
				







							This chart shows the value of a hypothetical $10,000 investment in the fund over the past 10 years or since its inception (for funds lacking 10-year records). The result is compared with benchmarks, which may include a broad-based market index and a peer group average or index. Market indexes do not include expenses, which are deducted from fund returns as well as mutual fund averages and indexes.
						
Benchmark Definitions



1 The Morningstar Rating for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for managed products (including mutual funds, 
variable annuity and variable life subaccounts, exchange-traded funds, closed-end funds, and separate accounts) with at 
least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for 
comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation 
in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent 
performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 
35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. The Overall Morningstar Rating 
for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, 
and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. The weights are: 100% three-year rating for 36-59 months of 
total returns, 60% five-year rating/40% three-year rating for 60-119 months of total returns, and 50% 10-year rating/30% 
five-year rating/20% three-year rating for 120 or more months of total returns. While the 10-year overall star rating 
formula seems to give the most weight to the 10-year period, the most recent three-year period actually has the greatest 
impact because it is included in all three rating periods.

^ The gross expense ratio reflects the fund expenses as stated in the fee table of the fund's 
prospectus prior to the deduction of any waiver or reimbursement. 
The net expense ratio reflects fund expenses after the deduction of any waiver or reimbursement.
If a fund has an active contractual expense ratio limitation, the expiration date is shown below the gross and net
expense ratio values above.  Expense ratios are as of the most recent prospectus.

Many of our mutual funds earn Morningstar’s highest ratings
Morningstar 4- and 5-Star Rated Funds







Because of our disciplined approach to investing, Morningstar, a leader in independent investment research, recognizes many of our mutual funds with its highest ratings in the funds' respective categories.

Over 70 of our funds have earned 4- or 5-star Overall Morningstar Ratings as of 6/30/17.*

Only the top 32.5% of all funds (of the 32.5%, 10% get 5 stars and 22.5% get 4 stars) are awarded Morningstar's 4- or 5-star rating. By comparison, as of 6/30/17, 72 of 108 of our rated funds (Investor Class only) received an overall rating of 5 or 4 stars.​ Past performance cannot guarantee future results.

All mutual funds are subject to market risk, including possible loss of principal.
*Morningstar gives its best ratings of 5 or 4 stars to the top 32.5% of all funds (of the 32.5%, 10% get 5 stars and 22.5% get 4 stars) based on their risk-adjusted returns. The Overall Morningstar Rating™ is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with a fund's 3-, 5-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating™ metrics. As of 6/30/17, 72 of 108 of our rated funds (Investor class only) received an overall rating of 5 or 4 stars.
The Morningstar RatingTM for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for funds with at least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star.

**This chart displays relative risk of each U.S. mutual fund listed using standard deviation of returns. Those values are provided in the bars at the top of the chart.
Methodology: We evaluate the standard deviation and its resulting placement within a specific risk/return category on an annual basis. A fund is generally placed in a risk/return category based on the 10-year standard deviation of its performance. If a fund is less than 10 years old, the actual fund performance history is supplemented with the primary prospectus benchmark history to obtain a full 10-year history, or longest time period available up to 10 years. For an Asset Allocation fund with less than 10 years of performance history, sub-strategy returns are used. When a sub-strategy is less than 10 years old, the actual sub-strategy performance history is supplemented with benchmark history to obtain a full 10-year history, or longest time period available up to 10 years.
Risk return categories overlap; a fund with a standard deviation in the overlap between two categories, denoted by a plus (+), is placed so that its risk categorization is better aligned with anticipated return characteristics an investor may experience going forward at the discretion of T Rowe Price.
When a fund has a cash-like benchmark, denoted by a double plus (++), its standard deviation is estimated using only available fund returns. If the fund is less than 10 years old, benchmark returns are not used to obtain a full 10-year history because they would artificially suppress the volatility estimate.
All investments are subject to market risk, including the possible loss of principal. Standard deviation of returns, a measure of price volatility, is one measure of risk. Please consult the funds’ prospectuses for a more complete discussion of the funds’ risks.

Individual Bonds


Bonds make interest payments and repay the principal on a fixed schedule. Interest and principal payments are subject to the creditworthiness of the issuer.

Fixed Income ETFs

Certificates of Deposit (CDs)


CDs offer FDIC insurance,3 providing a guarantee of the invested principal up to certain limits.






Money Market Funds


Money market funds are managed to help preserve your principal by investing in lower-risk debt securities with shorter maturities.

1. Minimum concessions of $19.95 if traded with a Fidelity representative. For U.S Treasury purchases traded with a Fidelity representative, a flat charge of $19.95 per trade applies. A $250 maximum applies to all trades and is reduced to a $50 maximum for bonds maturing in one year or less. Fixed income trading requires a Fidelity brokerage account with a minimum opening balance of $2,500. Rates are for U.S. Dollar denominated bonds, additional fees and minimums apply for non-Dollar bond trades. Other conditions may apply. See Fidelity.com/commissions for details. Please note that concessions may impact the total cost of the transaction and the total, or "effective," yield of your investment. The offering broker, which may be our affiliate National Financial Services LLC, may separately mark up on mark down the price of the security and may realize a trading profit or loss on the transaction.


2. Fidelity commissioned Corporate Insight to study bond pricing, available online, for self-directed retail investors from five brokers that offer corporate and municipal bonds. The study compared online bond prices for over 20,000 municipal and corporate inventory matches between September 2nd and October 6th, 2015. It compared municipal and corporate inventories offered online in quantities of at least $10,000 face or par value. The study found on average that three competitors that bundled their markups or fees into their online bond prices were asking an average of $13.97 more per bond. Corporate Insight determined the average cost differential by calculating the difference between the costs of matching corporate and municipal bond inventory at Fidelity vs. these markup-based firms in the study, then averaging the differences across all of the competitor firms. Hypothetical cost savings of $286 is based on an average size order of $22,000 face or par value bonds and average cost differential of $13 per bond.


          3. For the purposes of FDIC insurance coverage limits, all depository assets of the accountholder at the institution that issued the CD will generally be counted toward the aggregate limit (usually $250,000) for each applicable category of account. FDIC insurance does not cover market losses. All of the new issue brokered CDs Fidelity offers are FDIC insured. In some cases, CDs may be purchased on the secondary market at a price that reflects a premium to their principal value. This premium is ineligible for FDIC insurance. For details on FDIC insurance limits, see www.fdic.gov.
	
    

          4. Fixed annuities available at Fidelity are issued by third-party insurance companies, which are not affiliated with any Fidelity Investments company. These products are distributed by Fidelity Insurance Agency, Inc., and, for certain products, Fidelity Brokerage Services, Member NYSE, SIPC . Some deferred fixed annuities have a market value adjustment (MVA), which generally applies if a client surrenders the contract or withdraws funds in excess of the free withdrawal amount before the end of the guarantee period. The amount the client receives will be adjusted based on interest rate conditions at that time.


Each individual's situation is unique and therefore seeking additional guidance from a tax advisor is suggested. Although deferred fixed annuities offer tax-deferral, if you are considering one to fund a qualified retirement plan or IRA, you should do so for the annuity's features and benefits other than tax deferral. In such cases, tax deferral is not an additional benefit of the deferred fixed annuity.
	
    

          5. A contract's financial guarantees are solely the responsibility of and are subject to the claims-paying ability of the issuing insurance company.


You could lose money by investing in a money market fund. An investment in a money market fund is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. Before investing, always read a money market fund’s prospectus for policies specific to that fund.


          In general, the bond market is volatile, and fixed income securities carry interest rate risk. (As interest rates rise, bond prices usually fall, and vice versa. This effect is usually more pronounced for longer-term securities.) Fixed income securities also carry inflation risk, liquidity risk, call risk, and credit and default risks for both issuers and counterparties. Unlike individual bonds, most bond funds do not have a maturity date, so holding them until maturity to avoid losses caused by price volatility is not possible. Any fixed income security sold or redeemed prior to maturity may be subject to loss.
	
    

High-yield/non-investment-grade bonds involve greater price volatility and risk of default than investment-grade bonds.


          ETFs are subject to market fluctuation and the risks of their underlying investments. ETFs are subject to management fees and other expenses. Unlike mutual funds, ETF shares are bought and sold at market price, which may be higher or lower than their NAV, and are not individually redeemed from the fund.
	
    

          Fidelity makes certain new issue products available without a separate transaction fee. Fidelity may receive compensation from issuers for participating in the offering as a selling group member and/or underwriter. For representative assisted treasury auction orders, a $19.95 transaction fee applies.
	
    

Before investing, consider the funds' investment objectives, risks, charges, and expenses. Contact Fidelity for a prospectus or, if available, a summary prospectus containing this information. Read it carefully.

 Reasons to consider bond funds 

Potential for capital preservation, depending on the fund
Income generation
Diversification for a potential hedge against stock market volatility
Liquidity

Funds are guided by a stated objective, generally focusing on a particular sector, such as corporate or Treasury bonds; a broad category, such as investment grade or high yield securities; or a specific time horizon, such as short-, intermediate-, or long-term bonds.
How Fidelity manages bond funds










Types of bond funds



Investment grade

Invest in high credit quality securities issued by the U.S. Treasury, U.S. government agencies, and U.S. corporations, as well as bonds backed by mortgages or other assets. Learn more about types of investment grade bond funds.
Research investment grade bond funds



Municipal

Invest in bonds issued by state governments and municipalities. While they tend to offer lower yields, the income they generate is generally free from federal income taxes.* Learn more about types of municipal bond funds.
Research municipal bond funds



High yield

Invest primarily in lower credit quality securities, including convertible securities. While these can potentially provide income and total returns higher than those offered by investment grade bond funds, they do have the potential for greater volatility and risk. Learn more about types of high yield bond funds.
Research high yield bond funds



Multisector

Invest in a mix of taxable bonds, including both high yield and investment grade securities issued by the U.S. and by foreign governments, as well as domestic and foreign corporations, giving investors the ability to create a diversified fixed income portfolio through a single fund. Learn more about multisector bond funds.
Research multisector bond funds



International & global

International bond funds invest in a range of taxable bonds issued by foreign governments and corporations. Global bond funds invest in bonds from around the world, including bonds issued by U.S. government agencies and corporations. Learn more about types of international and global bond funds.

Fidelity Fund News & Analysis




Fidelity fund prices & documents



















Before investing, consider the funds' investment objectives, risks, charges, and expenses. Contact Fidelity for a prospectus or, if available, a summary prospectus containing this information.  Read it carefully.


          In general the bond market is volatile, and fixed income securities carry interest rate risk. (As interest rates rise, bond prices usually fall, and vice versa. This effect is usually more pronounced for longer-term securities.) Fixed income securities also carry inflation risk, liquidity risk, call risk and credit and default risks for both issuers and counterparties. Unlike individual bonds, most bond funds do not have a maturity date, so avoiding losses caused by price volatility by holding them until maturity is not possible.


Foreign investments involve greater risks than U.S. investments, including political and economic risks and the risk of currency fluctuations.
	
    

High-yield/non-investment-grade bonds involve greater price volatility and risk of default than investment-grade bonds.


Investments in mortgage securities are subject to the risk that principal will be repaid prior to maturity.  As a result, when interest rates decline, gains may be reduced, and when interest rates rise, losses may be greater.


          * The municipal market can be affected by adverse tax, legislative or political changes and the financial condition of the issuers of municipal securities. Income exempt from federal income tax may be subject to state or local tax. If a fund investor is resident in the state of issuance of the bonds held by the fund, interest dividends may also be exempt from state and local income taxes. All or a portion of the fund’s income may be subject to the federal alternative minimum tax. Income or fund distributions attributable to capital gains are usually subject to both state and federal income taxes. Generally, tax-exempt municipal securities are not appropriate holdings for tax advantaged accounts such as IRAs and 401(k)s.

You could lose money by investing in a money market fund. Although the fund seeks to preserve the value of your investment at $1.00 per share, it cannot guarantee it will do so. An investment in the fund is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. Fidelity Investments and its affiliates, the fund’s sponsor, have no legal obligation to provide financial support to money market funds and you should not expect that the sponsor will provide financial support to the fund at any time.


Fidelity’s government and U.S. Treasury money market funds will not impose a fee upon the sale of your shares, nor temporarily suspend your ability to sell shares if the fund's weekly liquid assets fall below 30% of its total assets because of market conditions or other factors.

	       You could lose money by investing in a money market fund. Because the share price of the fund will fluctuate, when you sell your shares they may be worth more or less than what you originally paid for them. The Fund may impose a fee upon the sale of your shares or may temporarily suspend your ability to sell shares if the Fund’s liquidity falls below required minimums because of market conditions or other factors. An investment in the fund is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. Fidelity Investments and its affiliates, the fund’s sponsor, have no legal obligation to provide financial support to the fund, and you should not expect that the sponsor will provide financial support to the fund at any time.

          The municipal market can be affected by adverse tax, legislative or political changes and the financial condition of the issuers of municipal securities. Interest rate increases can cause the price of a money market security to decrease. Municipal funds normally seek to earn income and pay dividends that are expected to be exempt from federal income tax. If a fund investor is resident in the state of issuance of the bonds held by the fund, interest dividends may also be exempt from state and local income taxes. Such interest dividends may be subject to federal and/or state alternative minimum taxes. Certain funds normally seek to invest only in municipal securities generating income exempt from both federal income taxes and the federal alternative minimum tax; however, outcomes cannot be guaranteed, and the funds may sometimes generate income subject to these taxes. Fund shareholders may also receive taxable distributions attributable to a fund's sale of municipal bonds.


Generally, tax-exempt municipal securities are not appropriate holdings for tax advantaged accounts such as IRAs and 401(k)s.
	
    

          * Other fees and expenses applicable to continued investment are described in the fund's current prospectus.

          In general, the bond market is volatile, and fixed income securities carry interest rate risk. (As interest rates rise, bond prices usually fall, and vice versa. This effect is usually more pronounced for longer-term securities.) Fixed income securities also carry inflation risk, liquidity risk, call risk, and credit and default risks for both issuers and counterparties. Unlike individual bonds, most bond funds do not have a maturity date, so holding them until maturity to avoid losses caused by price volatility is not possible. Any fixed income security sold or redeemed prior to maturity may be subject to loss.
	
    

There is an Options Regulatory Fee from $0.04 to $0.06 per contract, which applies to both option buy and sell transactions. The fee is subject to change.


Stock markets are volatile and can fluctuate significantly in response to company, industry, political, regulatory, market, or economic developments. Investing in stock involves risks, including the loss of principal.


Because of their narrow focus, sector investments tend to be more volatile than investments that diversify across many sectors and companies.


System availability and response times may be subject to market conditions.


Before investing in any mutual fund, consider the investment objectives, risks, charges, and expenses. Contact Fidelity for a prospectus or, if available, a summary prospectus containing this information. Read it carefully.
