History[edit]
The company was established in 2007 when Publishing & Broadcasting Limited (PBL) divested its gaming assets to Crown Limited. PBL was renamed Consolidated Media Holdings, retaining all of the remaining assets.[5]
In December 2007, Australian gaming company Crown Limited agreed to buy CCR for $1.75 billion.[6] The agreement was ended in March 2009, however, with Crown instead buying a 24.5 percent stake in the company for $370 million, and paying a $50 million termination fee.[6]
In 2008, Crown attempted to enter the Las Vegas gambling market by acquiring a 19.6 per cent stake in Fontainebleau Resorts for US$250 million, which resulted in a total loss the following year when other investors withdrew US$800 million financing, resulting in bankruptcy applications.[7] This was one of a succession of similar major losses in Gateway Casinos, Harrah's Entertainment and Station Casinos from which a total of $547.5 million was written off.[8]
In September 2013, the Sri Lankan government gave approval to Crown's chairman and largest shareholder, James Packer, to invest in Crown Sri Lanka in the heart of the Sri Lankan capital Colombo. The project was to be completed by 2015. However, when a new government took office, President Maithripala Sirisena canceled all three casino licenses awarded by the previous administration; including the Crown Resorts project.[9] Ground broke in 2015 and will open in 2017.
In August 2014 Betfair completed the sale of their 50% stake in Betfair Australia to venture partner Crown Resorts, one of Australia's largest gaming and entertainment groups.[10]
In August 2014, Crown bought the site of the New Frontier Hotel and Casino on the Las Vegas Strip with the intent to build a new hotel beginning in 2015.[11]
In December 2014, James Packer signed a deal with Matthew Tripp, which gained Packer control over Tripp’s online betting platform BetEasy.[12]
On 26 June 2015, Crown officially announced that the new hotel, called Alon Las Vegas, will be located in the former New Frontier site.[13] Crown announced in December 2016 that it was halting the project and seeking to sell its investment.[14]
In 2016, ground broke on Crown Sydney and will open in 2020.[citation needed]
In Feb 2017,Barry Felstead replaced Rowen Craigie as CEO Crown Resorts Melbourne.

Philanthropy[edit]
The company's Crown Resorts Foundation makes grants to the arts, community welfare, education, health care and the environment. In July 2014 Crown's chairman and largest shareholder James Packer launched a new initiative, the National Philanthropic Fund, to which his family foundation, and the Crown foundation would each contribute $100 million over ten years to support community projects in Australia.[20]
Controversies[edit]
Illegal advertising[edit]
In April 2016, the company's joint venture with Matthew Tripp, CrownBet pleaded guilty to five counts of breaching laws by publishing illegal betting advertising that offered inducements for NSW residents to gamble.[21][22][23][24][25] According to NSW Department of Justice, CrownBet "sought to have the matters finalised without conviction in Downing Centre Local Court yesterday but Magistrate Joanne Keogh said convictions were necessary for general deterrence to others in the industry and to protect the vulnerable. CrownBet was convicted of the five offences and ordered to pay a total of $10,500 in fines and also ordered to pay L&GNSW legal costs of $10,000."[21][23]

History[edit]
The company was established in 2007 when Publishing & Broadcasting Limited (PBL) divested its gaming assets to Crown Limited. PBL was renamed Consolidated Media Holdings, retaining all of the remaining assets.[5]
In December 2007, Australian gaming company Crown Limited agreed to buy CCR for $1.75 billion.[6] The agreement was ended in March 2009, however, with Crown instead buying a 24.5 percent stake in the company for $370 million, and paying a $50 million termination fee.[6]
In 2008, Crown attempted to enter the Las Vegas gambling market by acquiring a 19.6 per cent stake in Fontainebleau Resorts for US$250 million, which resulted in a total loss the following year when other investors withdrew US$800 million financing, resulting in bankruptcy applications.[7] This was one of a succession of similar major losses in Gateway Casinos, Harrah's Entertainment and Station Casinos from which a total of $547.5 million was written off.[8]
In September 2013, the Sri Lankan government gave approval to Crown's chairman and largest shareholder, James Packer, to invest in Crown Sri Lanka in the heart of the Sri Lankan capital Colombo. The project was to be completed by 2015. However, when a new government took office, President Maithripala Sirisena canceled all three casino licenses awarded by the previous administration; including the Crown Resorts project.[9] Ground broke in 2015 and will open in 2017.
In August 2014 Betfair completed the sale of their 50% stake in Betfair Australia to venture partner Crown Resorts, one of Australia's largest gaming and entertainment groups.[10]
In August 2014, Crown bought the site of the New Frontier Hotel and Casino on the Las Vegas Strip with the intent to build a new hotel beginning in 2015.[11]
In December 2014, James Packer signed a deal with Matthew Tripp, which gained Packer control over Tripp’s online betting platform BetEasy.[12]
On 26 June 2015, Crown officially announced that the new hotel, called Alon Las Vegas, will be located in the former New Frontier site.[13] Crown announced in December 2016 that it was halting the project and seeking to sell its investment.[14]
In 2016, ground broke on Crown Sydney and will open in 2020.[citation needed]
In Feb 2017,Barry Felstead replaced Rowen Craigie as CEO Crown Resorts Melbourne.

Philanthropy[edit]
The company's Crown Resorts Foundation makes grants to the arts, community welfare, education, health care and the environment. In July 2014 Crown's chairman and largest shareholder James Packer launched a new initiative, the National Philanthropic Fund, to which his family foundation, and the Crown foundation would each contribute $100 million over ten years to support community projects in Australia.[20]
Controversies[edit]
Illegal advertising[edit]
In April 2016, the company's joint venture with Matthew Tripp, CrownBet pleaded guilty to five counts of breaching laws by publishing illegal betting advertising that offered inducements for NSW residents to gamble.[21][22][23][24][25] According to NSW Department of Justice, CrownBet "sought to have the matters finalised without conviction in Downing Centre Local Court yesterday but Magistrate Joanne Keogh said convictions were necessary for general deterrence to others in the industry and to protect the vulnerable. CrownBet was convicted of the five offences and ordered to pay a total of $10,500 in fines and also ordered to pay L&GNSW legal costs of $10,000."[21][23]

History[edit]
The company was established in 2007 when Publishing & Broadcasting Limited (PBL) divested its gaming assets to Crown Limited. PBL was renamed Consolidated Media Holdings, retaining all of the remaining assets.[5]
In December 2007, Australian gaming company Crown Limited agreed to buy CCR for $1.75 billion.[6] The agreement was ended in March 2009, however, with Crown instead buying a 24.5 percent stake in the company for $370 million, and paying a $50 million termination fee.[6]
In 2008, Crown attempted to enter the Las Vegas gambling market by acquiring a 19.6 per cent stake in Fontainebleau Resorts for US$250 million, which resulted in a total loss the following year when other investors withdrew US$800 million financing, resulting in bankruptcy applications.[7] This was one of a succession of similar major losses in Gateway Casinos, Harrah's Entertainment and Station Casinos from which a total of $547.5 million was written off.[8]
In September 2013, the Sri Lankan government gave approval to Crown's chairman and largest shareholder, James Packer, to invest in Crown Sri Lanka in the heart of the Sri Lankan capital Colombo. The project was to be completed by 2015. However, when a new government took office, President Maithripala Sirisena canceled all three casino licenses awarded by the previous administration; including the Crown Resorts project.[9] Ground broke in 2015 and will open in 2017.
In August 2014 Betfair completed the sale of their 50% stake in Betfair Australia to venture partner Crown Resorts, one of Australia's largest gaming and entertainment groups.[10]
In August 2014, Crown bought the site of the New Frontier Hotel and Casino on the Las Vegas Strip with the intent to build a new hotel beginning in 2015.[11]
In December 2014, James Packer signed a deal with Matthew Tripp, which gained Packer control over Tripp’s online betting platform BetEasy.[12]
On 26 June 2015, Crown officially announced that the new hotel, called Alon Las Vegas, will be located in the former New Frontier site.[13] Crown announced in December 2016 that it was halting the project and seeking to sell its investment.[14]
In 2016, ground broke on Crown Sydney and will open in 2020.[citation needed]
In Feb 2017,Barry Felstead replaced Rowen Craigie as CEO Crown Resorts Melbourne.

Philanthropy[edit]
The company's Crown Resorts Foundation makes grants to the arts, community welfare, education, health care and the environment. In July 2014 Crown's chairman and largest shareholder James Packer launched a new initiative, the National Philanthropic Fund, to which his family foundation, and the Crown foundation would each contribute $100 million over ten years to support community projects in Australia.[20]
Controversies[edit]
Illegal advertising[edit]
In April 2016, the company's joint venture with Matthew Tripp, CrownBet pleaded guilty to five counts of breaching laws by publishing illegal betting advertising that offered inducements for NSW residents to gamble.[21][22][23][24][25] According to NSW Department of Justice, CrownBet "sought to have the matters finalised without conviction in Downing Centre Local Court yesterday but Magistrate Joanne Keogh said convictions were necessary for general deterrence to others in the industry and to protect the vulnerable. CrownBet was convicted of the five offences and ordered to pay a total of $10,500 in fines and also ordered to pay L&GNSW legal costs of $10,000."[21][23]

Overview of Operations[edit]
OM Group employs approximately 6,000 people and has locations in Canada, China, D.R. Congo, France, Finland, Germany, India, Japan, Malaysia, Singapore, Taiwan, the United Kingdom and the United States.[3]
OMG has six business units:

Advanced Organics
Advanced Materials
Electronic Chemicals
Compugraphics
Ultra Pure Chemicals
Battery Technologies

Of these six units, its three main business platforms are: magnetic technologies, battery technologies and speciality chemicals.
OM Group supplies more than 4,000 customers, serving more than 50 industries worldwide, including automotive systems, electronic devices, aerospace, industrial and renewable energy.
History[edit]
The roots of the company date back to the 1940s when the company’s predecessor Mooney Chemical Company was founded in 1946 in Cleveland by namesake James Mooney and his partner Carl A. Reusser. Forging strong ties with copper and nickel miners in Zaire and Zambia, Mooney quickly became key supplier of the metals, helping maintain some of the highest levels of productivity in the cobalt specialty-chemicals industry. In the mid-1990s, for example, OM Group's sales per employee were more than double the industry average, at $850,000 compared with less than $300,000.[4]
In the 1970s James Mooney’s seventh son, James P. Mooney joined the firm at the age of just 23, joining three of his brothers in the executive office. Despite a reluctance to incur debt and therefore infrequent acquisitions, the brothers expanded the firm’s product line through the purchases of Mobil Oil’s subsidiary in Pennsylvania, Chicago's Lauder Chemical, and Cleveland's Harshaw Chemical in the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s. By 1984, the company's 40 employees generated about $2 million in annual sales.[4]
After more than four decades of family ownership, numerous members of the Mooney family decided to sell their stakes in the business and in 1991, President James Mooney started to seek buyers.[4]
OM Group Inc was established in 1993 as a result of the merger between the American company Mooney Chemicals, the Finnish firm Kokkola Chemicals Oy, and France’s Vasset SA.[4] Initially named Outokumpu Metals Group when the merger went ahead in 1991, after which the company operated as a subsidiary of the Finnish firm, Kokkola spun off its 96 percent share in the company in 1993, leading to the establishment of the OM Group. Mooney continued to own a 4% share.[4]
In the mid-nineties, the firm’s geographical reach was dramatically expanded as a result of the merger and foreign sales increased by more than 50 percent. In 1994, the company invested $19.7 million in a physical plant, increasing its capacity to produce specialty chemicals.[4]
In 1995, OM Group and Dainippon Ink & Chemicals created a Japan-based joint venture. OM hoped that its cooperative enterprise would capture 15 percent of the $470 million Japanese market for cobalt-nickel inorganic compounds by the turn of the century. Later in the year, OM entered the chemical recycling industry through the acquisition of Hecla Mining Co.'s Apex mining division in Utah.[4]
Recent news[edit]
On 10 August 2007, OM Group Incorporated acquired the electronics business of Rockwood Holdings Inc..[citation needed] The Rockwood Electronics businesses consist of printed circuit board (PCB) chemicals, ultra pure chemicals (UPC) and photomasks.
In October 2014, OM Group acquired Ener-Tek International, a designer, developer and manufacturer of high-performance lithium-ion and silver-zinc cells and batteries for niche applications in defence and aerospace markets, for a fee of $24 million.[5]
As a result of dwindling sales as a result of the slowdown in industrial activity in Europe in the preceding two years, in June 2015 OM Group agreed to be privatized by Apollo Global Management who made an offer of around $1.03 billion in cash.[6]
On November 23, 2015, the company announced its name change to Vectra and said it was moving its headquarters to St. Louis, Missouri.[7]

Philanthropy[edit]
The company's Crown Resorts Foundation makes grants to the arts, community welfare, education, health care and the environment. In July 2014 Crown's chairman and largest shareholder James Packer launched a new initiative, the National Philanthropic Fund, to which his family foundation, and the Crown foundation would each contribute $100 million over ten years to support community projects in Australia.[20]
Controversies[edit]
Illegal advertising[edit]
In April 2016, the company's joint venture with Matthew Tripp, CrownBet pleaded guilty to five counts of breaching laws by publishing illegal betting advertising that offered inducements for NSW residents to gamble.[21][22][23][24][25] According to NSW Department of Justice, CrownBet "sought to have the matters finalised without conviction in Downing Centre Local Court yesterday but Magistrate Joanne Keogh said convictions were necessary for general deterrence to others in the industry and to protect the vulnerable. CrownBet was convicted of the five offences and ordered to pay a total of $10,500 in fines and also ordered to pay L&GNSW legal costs of $10,000."[21][23]

Filings


Filing dateFormDescriptionQuarterYear

    Page:  
     1 





Form 10-K
A 10-K is a comprehensive summary report of a company's performance that must be submitted annually to the Securities and Exchange Commission. Typically, the 10-K contains much more detail than the annual report. It includes information such as company history, organizational structure, equity, holdings, earnings per share, subsidiaries, etc. 

The 10-K must be filed within 60 days (it used to be 90 days) after the end of the fiscal year.
Form 10-K/A
Amended Form 10-K
Form 10-Q
The SEC form 10-Q is a comprehensive report of a company's performance that must be submitted quarterly by all public companies to the Securities and Exchange Commission. In the 10-Q, firms are required to disclose relevant information regarding their financial position. The form must be submitted on time, and the information should be available to all interested parties. 

The 10-Q is due 35 days (it used to be 45 days) after each of the first three fiscal quarters. There is no filing after the fourth quarter because that is when the 10-K is filed.
Form 10-Q/A
Amended Form 10-Q
Form 3
A document that must be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) by an insider affiliated with a public company's operation or by any investor owning 10% or more of the company's outstanding shares

This document must be filed with the SEC no later than 10 days after an insider becomes affiliated with a company, and it must be filed for each company in which a person is an insider, regardless of whether or not the insider has an equity position in the company at that time.
Form 3/A
Amended Form 3
Form 4
A Form 4 is a document that must be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) whenever there is a material change in the holdings of company insiders. Insiders required to submit a Form 4 include directors and officers of the company as well as any shareholders owning 10% or more of the company's outstanding stock.

This two-page document covers any buy-and-sell orders on the open market as well as the exercise of company stock options. A Form 4 is mandatory within two business days starting from the end of the day the material transaction occurred. This filing is related to Form 3 and the Form 5, which also cover changes to the company insider holdings.
Form 4/A
Amended Form 4
Form 5
The annual statement of beneficial ownership of securities.
Form 5/A
Amended Form 5
Form 8-K
An 8-K is a report of unscheduled material events or corporate changes at a company that could be of importance to the shareholders or the Securities and Exchange Commission. 

Examples of events reported on an 8-K include acquisition, bankruptcy, resignation of directors, or a change in the fiscal year. Also known as Form 8k.
Form D
A filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) required for companies that are selling securities in reliance on a Regulation D exemption or Section 4(6) exemption provisions. 

Form D is a brief notice of a company's executive officers and stock promoters, in lieu of the regular reports required when no exemption under Regulation D exists. 

Form D must be filed no later than 15 days after the first sale of securities.

Form D is also known as the Notice of Sale of Securities and is a requirement under Regulation D, Section 4(6) and/or the Uniform Limited Offering Exemption of the Securities Exchange Act of 1933. 

This act, often referred to as the "truth in securities" law, requires that these registration forms, providing essential facts, are filed to disclose important information upon registration of a company's securities. This helps the SEC achieve the objectives of this act - requiring investors to receive significant information regarding securities offered and prohibiting fraud in the sale of the offered securities.
Form D/A
Amended Form D
Form DEF 14A
A filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that must be filed by or on behalf of a registrant when a shareholder vote is required. SEC Form DEF 14A is most commonly used in conjunction with an annual meeting proxy. The form should provide security holders with sufficient information to allow them to make an informed vote at an upcoming security holders' meeting or to authorize a proxy to vote on their behalf. It includes information about the date, time and place of the meeting of security holders; revocability of proxy; dissenter's right of appraisal; persons making the solicitation; direct or indirect interest of certain persons in matters to be acted upon; modification or exchange of securities; financial statements; voting procedures; and other details. 

All other filed by non-management definitive proxy statements - typically an annual meeting proxy.

Form DEF 14A, which is also known as "definitive proxy statement", is required under Section 14(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. This form is filed with the SEC when a definitive proxy statement is given to shareholders and helps the SEC ensure that shareholders' rights are upheld.
Form S-1
The SEC form S-1 is the initial registration form for new securities required by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for public companies. Any security that meets the criteria must have an S-1 filing before shares can be listed on a national exchange. 

Form S-1 requires companies to provide information on the planned use of capital proceeds, detail the current business model and competition, as well provide a a brief prospectus of the planned security itself, offering price methodology, and any dilution that will occur to other listed securities. The SEC also requires the disclosure of any material business dealings between the company and its directors and outside counsel. 

Form S-1 is also known as the "Registration Statement Under the Securities Exchange Act of 1933". 

Investors can view S-1 filings online to perform due diligence on new offerings prior to their issue. The form is sometimes amended as material information changes or general market conditions cause a delay in the offering. 

The Securities Exchange Act of 1933, often referred to as the "truth in securities" law, requires that these registration forms are filed to disclose important information upon registration of a company's securities. This helps the SEC achieve the objectives of this act, which is requiring investors to receive significant information regarding securities offered, and to prohibit fraud in the sale of the offered securities. 

A less rigid registration form is the S-3, which is for companies that don't have the same ongoing reporting requirements.

VIRGIN FESTIVAL BY VIRGIN MOBILE EXPANDS TO TWO DAYS FEATURING THE POLICE, THE SMASHING PUMPKINS AND BEASTI...
VIRGIN FESTIVAL BY VIRGIN MOBILE EXPANDS TO TWO DAYS FEATURING THE POLICE, THE SMASHING PUMPKINS AND BEASTIE BOYS

AUGUST 4-5, 2007 AT PIMLICO RACE COURSE IN BALTIMORE, MD
www.virginfestival****

Virgin Group Founder and Chairman Sir Richard Branson, creator of the world renowned UK based V Festival, announced today that the U.S. Virgin Festival By
Virgin Mobile will be held August 4-5, 2007 at Pimlico Race Course in Baltimore, Maryland, adding a second full day of music in its second year.

On behalf of partnering hosts Virgin Mobile USA and Virgin USA, Branson announced the first three acts to be confirmed: The Police, The Smashing Pumpkins and Beastie Boys. On-sale dates for tickets, the rest of the very diverse two day line up and additional information about the Festival will be announced in the coming weeks.

Everybody had an incredible time at last year's inaugural Virgin Festival, so we are going to double the fun this summer with two days of great music, said Sir Richard, whose legendary music heritage is the inspiration behind Virgin's music festivals. With our unbelievable headliners and terrific festival vibe, Virgin Festival will be the hottest destination for live music this summer.

The three bands have chosen the Virgin Festival By Virgin Mobile to make rare live appearances. The Police are on tour for the first time in 21 years, giving lifelong fans a long-awaited opportunity to see this legendary band. The Smashing Pumpkins are reuniting for their first US performance since going on hiatus in 2000. And Beastie Boys will make their first east coast appearance in two years.

The first U.S. Virgin Festival By Virgin Mobile was held September 23, 2006 and featured 20 bands performing for more than 45,000 people across two stages and a giant dance tent. This year, the site will again provide all kinds of entertainment and activity, with high quality concessions, a diverse array of vendors and non-profit organizations, art installations, performance art and more.

Branson also highlighted that the Festival will be as eco friendly an event as feasible this year in an effort to limit its carbon impact, supporting Virgin Groups ongoing commitment to attacking the causes of global warming. We are exploring numerous ways to minimize the impact of the festival on the environment.

Virgin Mobile USA is the leading wireless youth network with more than 4.6 million customers enjoying wireless service without long term contracts. Our customers share many things, and a passion for music is one at the very core of who Virgin Mobile is, said Dan Schulman, chief executive officer of Virgin Mobile USA. We are not only producing the most dynamic music festival this summer, we are creating a special setting for people to experience music and art, hang with friends, text and talk and network, interact with diverse communities, learn about issues and enjoy themselves.

Virgin is one of the most exciting brands in the world, offering hip, fresh, innovative products and services that resonate with the young at heart, said Frances Farrow, chief executive officer of Virgin USA. Virgin Festival embodies the best of the brand and gives music fans of all ages the chance to experience for themselves what Virgin is really about.

Part of repeating and surpassing the success of the first Virgin Festival By Virgin Mobile is the return of producers I.M.F., a company formed by the principals of I.M.P., one of the countrys leading independent concert promoters and owners of Washington, D.C.s famed 9:30 Club. We had such a blast at last years show; we cant wait to get back. Right now Im putting together the lineup that will just be A list from start to finish, on both stages and in the dance tent, said promoter Seth Hurwitz. Hold the dates...August 4th and 5th...we will be here to entertain & amaze.

On behalf of the City of Baltimore, Id like to say thank you to Mr. Branson and Virgin for bringing this world class event back to our city, said Mayor Sheila Dixon who added, We are excited and proud to, once again, host the Virgin Festival By Virgin Mobile and some of the music industrys biggest talent.

Historic Pimlico Race Course in Baltimore, MD is the home of the world famous Preakness Stakes, the Middle Jewel of Thoroughbred Horse Racings storied Triple Crown. More information about Virgin Festival By Virgin Mobile can be found at www.virginfestival****.

OM Group Incorporated is a metal-based chemistry firm based in Cleveland, Ohio, United States. It is a provider of speciality chemicals, advanced materials and technologies.[2] The company was listed on the New York Stock Exchange prior to being privatized by Apollo Global Management in June 2015.

Overview of Operations[edit]
OM Group employs approximately 6,000 people and has locations in Canada, China, D.R. Congo, France, Finland, Germany, India, Japan, Malaysia, Singapore, Taiwan, the United Kingdom and the United States.[3]
OMG has six business units:

Advanced Organics
Advanced Materials
Electronic Chemicals
Compugraphics
Ultra Pure Chemicals
Battery Technologies

Of these six units, its three main business platforms are: magnetic technologies, battery technologies and speciality chemicals.
OM Group supplies more than 4,000 customers, serving more than 50 industries worldwide, including automotive systems, electronic devices, aerospace, industrial and renewable energy.
History[edit]
The roots of the company date back to the 1940s when the company’s predecessor Mooney Chemical Company was founded in 1946 in Cleveland by namesake James Mooney and his partner Carl A. Reusser. Forging strong ties with copper and nickel miners in Zaire and Zambia, Mooney quickly became key supplier of the metals, helping maintain some of the highest levels of productivity in the cobalt specialty-chemicals industry. In the mid-1990s, for example, OM Group's sales per employee were more than double the industry average, at $850,000 compared with less than $300,000.[4]
In the 1970s James Mooney’s seventh son, James P. Mooney joined the firm at the age of just 23, joining three of his brothers in the executive office. Despite a reluctance to incur debt and therefore infrequent acquisitions, the brothers expanded the firm’s product line through the purchases of Mobil Oil’s subsidiary in Pennsylvania, Chicago's Lauder Chemical, and Cleveland's Harshaw Chemical in the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s. By 1984, the company's 40 employees generated about $2 million in annual sales.[4]
After more than four decades of family ownership, numerous members of the Mooney family decided to sell their stakes in the business and in 1991, President James Mooney started to seek buyers.[4]
OM Group Inc was established in 1993 as a result of the merger between the American company Mooney Chemicals, the Finnish firm Kokkola Chemicals Oy, and France’s Vasset SA.[4] Initially named Outokumpu Metals Group when the merger went ahead in 1991, after which the company operated as a subsidiary of the Finnish firm, Kokkola spun off its 96 percent share in the company in 1993, leading to the establishment of the OM Group. Mooney continued to own a 4% share.[4]
In the mid-nineties, the firm’s geographical reach was dramatically expanded as a result of the merger and foreign sales increased by more than 50 percent. In 1994, the company invested $19.7 million in a physical plant, increasing its capacity to produce specialty chemicals.[4]
In 1995, OM Group and Dainippon Ink & Chemicals created a Japan-based joint venture. OM hoped that its cooperative enterprise would capture 15 percent of the $470 million Japanese market for cobalt-nickel inorganic compounds by the turn of the century. Later in the year, OM entered the chemical recycling industry through the acquisition of Hecla Mining Co.'s Apex mining division in Utah.[4]
Recent news[edit]
On 10 August 2007, OM Group Incorporated acquired the electronics business of Rockwood Holdings Inc..[citation needed] The Rockwood Electronics businesses consist of printed circuit board (PCB) chemicals, ultra pure chemicals (UPC) and photomasks.
In October 2014, OM Group acquired Ener-Tek International, a designer, developer and manufacturer of high-performance lithium-ion and silver-zinc cells and batteries for niche applications in defence and aerospace markets, for a fee of $24 million.[5]
As a result of dwindling sales as a result of the slowdown in industrial activity in Europe in the preceding two years, in June 2015 OM Group agreed to be privatized by Apollo Global Management who made an offer of around $1.03 billion in cash.[6]
On November 23, 2015, the company announced its name change to Vectra and said it was moving its headquarters to St. Louis, Missouri.[7]

History[edit]
The roots of the company date back to the 1940s when the company’s predecessor Mooney Chemical Company was founded in 1946 in Cleveland by namesake James Mooney and his partner Carl A. Reusser. Forging strong ties with copper and nickel miners in Zaire and Zambia, Mooney quickly became key supplier of the metals, helping maintain some of the highest levels of productivity in the cobalt specialty-chemicals industry. In the mid-1990s, for example, OM Group's sales per employee were more than double the industry average, at $850,000 compared with less than $300,000.[4]
In the 1970s James Mooney’s seventh son, James P. Mooney joined the firm at the age of just 23, joining three of his brothers in the executive office. Despite a reluctance to incur debt and therefore infrequent acquisitions, the brothers expanded the firm’s product line through the purchases of Mobil Oil’s subsidiary in Pennsylvania, Chicago's Lauder Chemical, and Cleveland's Harshaw Chemical in the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s. By 1984, the company's 40 employees generated about $2 million in annual sales.[4]
After more than four decades of family ownership, numerous members of the Mooney family decided to sell their stakes in the business and in 1991, President James Mooney started to seek buyers.[4]
OM Group Inc was established in 1993 as a result of the merger between the American company Mooney Chemicals, the Finnish firm Kokkola Chemicals Oy, and France’s Vasset SA.[4] Initially named Outokumpu Metals Group when the merger went ahead in 1991, after which the company operated as a subsidiary of the Finnish firm, Kokkola spun off its 96 percent share in the company in 1993, leading to the establishment of the OM Group. Mooney continued to own a 4% share.[4]
In the mid-nineties, the firm’s geographical reach was dramatically expanded as a result of the merger and foreign sales increased by more than 50 percent. In 1994, the company invested $19.7 million in a physical plant, increasing its capacity to produce specialty chemicals.[4]
In 1995, OM Group and Dainippon Ink & Chemicals created a Japan-based joint venture. OM hoped that its cooperative enterprise would capture 15 percent of the $470 million Japanese market for cobalt-nickel inorganic compounds by the turn of the century. Later in the year, OM entered the chemical recycling industry through the acquisition of Hecla Mining Co.'s Apex mining division in Utah.[4]
Recent news[edit]
On 10 August 2007, OM Group Incorporated acquired the electronics business of Rockwood Holdings Inc..[citation needed] The Rockwood Electronics businesses consist of printed circuit board (PCB) chemicals, ultra pure chemicals (UPC) and photomasks.
In October 2014, OM Group acquired Ener-Tek International, a designer, developer and manufacturer of high-performance lithium-ion and silver-zinc cells and batteries for niche applications in defence and aerospace markets, for a fee of $24 million.[5]
As a result of dwindling sales as a result of the slowdown in industrial activity in Europe in the preceding two years, in June 2015 OM Group agreed to be privatized by Apollo Global Management who made an offer of around $1.03 billion in cash.[6]
On November 23, 2015, the company announced its name change to Vectra and said it was moving its headquarters to St. Louis, Missouri.[7]

Agency's cost realism analysis of proposals and determination of most probable cost which focuses on realism of labor rates is reasonable. Is sufficient to meet any agency obligation to assess performance risk associated with proposals. 3. Where cost and mission suitability factors are equal. Warner/Osborn alleges that NASA's award determination is flawed for a number of reasons including NASA's failure to follow either its own regulations or the RFP's evaluation criteria with regard to conducting a cost realism evaluation. Award was to be made to the responsible offeror whose conforming proposal would be most advantageous to the government. Mission suitability and cost were described as the most important of the evaluation factors. 











Matter of:           The Warner/Osborn/G&T Joint Venture File:                B-256641.2 Date:                August 23, 1994    DIGEST Attorneys   DECISION  We deny the protest.   The RFP sought proposals for engineering, construction, and environmental services for rehabilitation, modification, and construction of research and institutional facilities and systems.  The RFP contemplated award of a level-of-effort, cost-plus-award-fee contract for a base period of 2 years with three 1-year options.  Award was to be made to the responsible offeror whose conforming proposal would be most advantageous to the government, cost and other factors considered.   The RFP called for offerors to submit their proposals in three parts:  a business management proposal with cost and pricing data; a business management proposal with information other than cost or pricing data (e.g., past performance and experience, financial statements, plan to achieve culturally diverse work force, and award fee plan);[1] and a technical proposal demonstrating the offeror's thorough understanding of the requirements of the statement of work (SOW) and three sample problems including a logical plan for providing the required services.  The RFP provided offerors with the government's assumption of the 5-year levels of effort:  maximum, 69 personnel, 717,600 hours and minimum, 26 personnel, 270,400 hours.  The RFP also provided for the addition of optional increments of 14,000 hours to increase the level of effort. With the addition of all increments, the maximum level of effort would be 1,067,600 hours.   Section M of the RFP identified four evaluation factors:  (1) mission suitability, (2) cost, (3) relevant experience and past performance, and (4) other considerations.  Mission suitability and cost were described as the most important of the evaluation factors, and were weighted approximately equal in importance.  The last two evaluation factors-- relevant experience/past performance, and other considerations--were described as having "somewhat less importance" and "considerably less importance," respectively, than the first two factors and were to be evaluated adjectivally.  Cost was not scored or rated, while mission suitability was weighted and scored, as follows: (1) Understanding the Requirements and Approach to Sample Problems[2] (450 points); (2) Management Plan (250 points); (3) Key Personnel and Key Positions (150 points); and (4) Corporate Resources (150 points), for a total of 1,000 points.   Eight firms, including Warner/Osborn and Madison, submitted proposals by the August 31, 1993, closing date.  The proposals were evaluated by a source evaluation board (SEB) which identified the strengths and weaknesses in each proposal.  Based upon the initial evaluation, the contracting officer and chairman of the SEB established a competitive range of five proposals including those of Warner/Osborn and Madison. NASA then conducted written and oral discussions with each offeror and the SEB evaluated the revised proposals.  NASA issued model contracts to the competitive range offerors and solicited best and final offers (BAFOs) from them.   As part of its cost evaluation, NASA obtained audits from the Defense Contract Audit Agency (DCAA) for each cost proposal submitted.  DCAA's audits included a review of proposed wage rates, overhead, general and administrative (G&A) costs, and other direct costs.  DCAA and NASA cost evaluators identified various deficiencies and issues in each cost proposal and requested revisions during discussions.  In the evaluation of BAFOs, NASA found that all proposals in the competitive range required adjustment to account for incumbent employee labor rates.[3]  As a result, Warner/Osborn's proposal was adjusted upward by $.8 million and Madison's was adjusted upward by $2.6 million.  As finally adjusted for cost realism, Warner/Osborn's BAFO ranged from $45.1 million for the contract without increments to $61.3 million with increments.  Madison's BAFO, as adjusted, ranged from $40.4 million to $54.8 million.  The government estimate for the maximum level of effort was $60 million.   In the final evaluation, Warner/Osborn's proposal received a mission suitability score of 918 points and Madison's proposal received a score of 724 points.  With regard to relevant experience/past performance, Warner/Osborn was rated "very good+" and Madison was rated "excellent." For the other considerations factor, the offerors' proposals were rated as follows:   (rated form omitted)   The SEB's written report and presentation to the source selection official (SSO) included the evaluation scores, ratings, strengths, weaknesses, and adjusted costs of all the competitive range offerors, but did not recommend any proposal as most advantageous to NASA.  Concluding that all competitive range offerors could successfully perform the contract work load, the SSO considered whether selection of a higher-scored proposal would justify the payment of a substantial price premium.  He concluded that it did not and selected engineering design group (EDG), a lower-cost proposal, for award.  EDG was subsequently determined to be ineligible for award, whereupon, the SEB made another presentation to the SSO, again without recommending an awardee, and the SSO again concluded that all offerors could successfully perform the contract and that the technical superiority of Warner/Osborn and another offeror were insufficient to justify the payment of the concomitant cost premiums.  The cost difference between Warner/Osborn and Madison ranged from $4.7 million to $6.5 million or approximately 10 percent.  Upon receiving notice of the award, Warner/Osborn filed this protest.   THE COST ANALYSIS   Warner/Osborn contends that NASA's cost realism analysis was either nonexistent or flawed because it did not include sufficient in-depth analysis or review of proposed costs. Specifically, the protester complains that NASA relied "blindly" on the DCAA audits and failed to adjust Madison's costs upward to account for its "inferior" approach.  We have reviewed NASA's cost analysis and find it unobjectionable.   When a cost-reimbursement contract is to be awarded, a cost realism analysis must first be performed by the agency.  See Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Secs. 15.801, 15.805.  The purpose of a cost realism analysis by an agency under a level-of-effort, cost-type contract is to determine the extent to which the offeror's proposed labor rates are realistic and reasonable.  ERC Envtl. and Energy Servs. Co., Inc., B-241549, Feb. 12, 1991, 91-1 CPD Para. 155.  In this regard, an agency is not required to conduct an in-depth cost analysis or to verify each and every item in conducting its cost realism analysis.  Rather, the evaluation of competing cost proposals requires the exercise of informed judgment by the contracting agency involved, since it is in the best position to assess "realism" of cost and technical approaches and must bear the difficulties or additional expenses resulting from a defective cost analysis.  Since the cost realism analysis is a judgment function on the part of the contracting agency, our review is limited to a determination of whether an agency's cost evaluation was reasonably based and not arbitrary.  General Research Corp., 70 Comp.Gen. 279 (1991), 91-1 CPD Para. 183; Science Applications Int'l Corp., B-238136.2, June 1, 1990, 90-1 CPD Para. 517.   Warner/Osborn contends that the agency improperly relied on a DCAA audit as a substitute for a cost realism analysis because the contracting officer alone is responsible for the cost realism determination.  See Purvis Sys. Inc., 71 Comp.  Gen. 203 (1992), 92-1 CPD Para. 132.  In fact, the record establishes that NASA did not rely "blindly" on the results of the audits; rather, NASA conducted a detailed cost analysis of Madison's proposal.   In accordance with the RFP, Madison's cost proposal included summaries of minimum and maximum costs as well as cost and pricing data for all proposed direct and indirect cost elements including the award fee.  The SEB cost committee used this information in its initial evaluation to identify cost issues and concerns which formed the basis for cost questions for Madison during discussions.  The SEB questioned various aspects of Madison's costs including the accuracy of estimates and inclusions under other direct costs, and sought clarifications of certain markup items. NASA also had DCAA perform audits on the cost proposals of Madison and its subcontractors, identifying concerns and making recommendations for cost adjustments.  DCAA questioned certain aspects of Madison's direct and incremental costs.  In response, Madison provided detailed clarifications of all questioned costs and made significant downward adjustments to its cost proposal including the areas of labor and material overhead and G&A rates.  With each round of discussions and revised proposals, Madison furnished an updated cost summary along with reconciliation data for all cost adjustments.   At the time BAFOs were submitted, the SEB again reviewed Madison's cost proposals.  Based on a comparison of proposed direct labor rates with published surveys of corresponding average prevailing labor rates for the geographical area in question, the SEB concluded that Madison's proposed labor rates were reasonable.  Based on questions by the technical evaluator, the SEB also adjusted Madison's proposed labor rates for the incumbent employees and, as appropriate, adjusted related costs such as fee based on the labor rate adjustment.  The SEB noted that Madison and its subcontractors accepted all of the DCAA recommendations and had proposed labor, G&A, and material overhead and burden rate ceilings, all of which were incorporated as special provisions in Madison's model contract.   It is plain from the foregoing that DCAA's audit information simply formed a part of NASA's cost analysis and that it was NASA's analysis, not DCAA's, that resulted in NASA's conclusions regarding cost realism. The role that DCAA's advice played here was entirely proper.  See Delta Research Assocs., Inc., B-254006.2, Nov. 22, 1993, 94-1 CPD Para. 47.[4]   We also find that NASA's cost analysis constituted a reasonable and complete evaluation of Madison's cost proposal, and resulted in a realistic estimate of its probable cost.  This is a level-of-effort contract in which the RFP set the number of hours and annual escalation percentage, materials costs, and relocation estimates. Thus, the agency's primary inquiry was reasonably focused on the accuracy and reasonableness of labor rates.  ERC Envtl.  and Energy Servs. Co., Inc., supra.  To this end, the agency ensured that Madison's labor rates were consistent with prevailing rates, had Madison make adjustments based on NASA and DCAA recommendations, and adjusted Madison's costs to account for the proper incumbent labor rates.  Although the protester argues that NASA should have adjusted Madison's costs upward to account for Madison's "inferior" proposal, the protester fails to identify any "inferior" approach which would warrant an adjustment, or to specify any costs which should be adjusted.  Under the circumstances, we have no basis to conclude that there was any aspect of Madison's technical proposal which required NASA to adjust Madison's costs upward.   In a related argument, Warner/Osborn contends that the agency failed to follow certain provisions of the NASA Source Evaluation Board Handbook, NASA Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement, 48 C.F.R. Sec. 1870.303, Appendix I (hereinafter, Handbook).  For example, because costs "may be significant" in indicating an offeror's understanding of the human and material resources required for contract performance, technical personnel "may be given access" to the cost proposals.  Handbook, Sec. 301 1.a.(1).  In addition, evaluators are to consider proposal risk and discuss it in the SEB report.  Handbook, Sec. 301-1.f.(1), (4).  When the SEB report is prepared and presented to the SSO, it should discuss the effects of proposed cost on the management and technical effort and the final cost evaluation chart should include the evaluators' confidence in the costs reflected there.  Handbook, App. C, II, Sec. C.3.b.(2)(e). Since these items are not specifically recorded in the SEB report, the protester argues that the cost evaluation was flawed.  We disagree.   First, the technical evaluators did review the cost proposals.  From their review, they raised concerns about proposed total compensation plans, identified a labor rate concern with all proposals in the competitive range, and questioned the direct costs of some offerors. Second, with regard to risk, the agency explains that based on Madison's "very good" mission suitability rating and score, as well as its high rating on the remaining factors, there never was any question about its technical competence to perform. While there is no specific reference to risk in the SEB report, the evaluators identified the various strengths and weaknesses of the offerors' proposals, including Madison's proposal. In view of the agency's assessment that Madison's lower-scored proposal provided no indication of technical inability and the agency's satisfaction with its probable cost, the record makes it clear that the evaluators did not perceive any significant risk associated with Madison's proposal.   Third, with regard to discussion of these matters in the report to the SSO, since there was no apparent negative technical impact on cost, we fail to see how the evaluators' decision not to advise the SSO of the absence of technical risk and the lack of any cost impact had any meaningful consequence here since the absence of that information obviously had no effect on the award decision or otherwise prejudiced Warner/Osborn.  In the absence of prejudice, we will not disturb a contract award.  American Mutual Protective Bureau, Inc., B-229967, Jan. 22, 1988, 88-1 CPD Para. 65.   THE COST/TECHNICAL TRADE-OFF   Warner/Osborn next contends that NASA's award decision is flawed because NASA ignored the technical superiority of the Warner/Osborn proposal and effectively made the award on the basis of low cost and technical acceptability.  To the extent NASA made a cost/technical trade-off, Warner/Osborn argues that the agency failed to properly document its award decision.  In a negotiated procurement, agency selection officials have broad discretion in determining the manner and extent to which they will make use of the technical and cost evaluation results. Cost/technical trade-offs may be made; the extent to which one may be sacrificed for the other is governed by the test of rationality and consistency with the established evaluation factors.  General Servs. Eng'g, Inc., B-245458, Jan. 9, 1992, 92-1 CPD Para. 44.  An agency may award to an offeror with a lower-cost, lower-scored proposal if it determines that the cost premium involved in awarding to a higher-rated, higher-priced offeror is not justified.  Dayton T. Brown, Inc., B-229664, Mar. 30, 1988, 88-1 CPD Para. 321.   While the selection official's judgment must be documented in sufficient detail to show it is not arbitrary, KMS Fusion, Inc., B-242529, May 8, 1991, 91-1 CPD Para. 447, an SSO's failure to specifically discuss the cost/technical trade-off in the selection decision document does not affect the validity of the decision if the record shows that the agency reasonably determined that a higher technically scored proposal is not worth the additional cost associated with that proposal.  McShade Gov't Contracting Servs., B-232977, Feb. 6, 1989, 89-1 CPD Para. 118.   The RFP provided that award would be made to the offeror whose proposal is most advantageous to the government considering cost and other factors, here, mission suitability, relevant experience/past performance, and other considerations (financial condition, SOW exceptions, etc.). The SSO determined that the technical advantage of Warner/ Osborn's proposal did not justify its relatively higher cost.  The agency states that prior to making this determination there was considerable discussion at the source selection presentation regarding the strengths and weaknesses of the offerors, the point differential in the mission suitability scores, the cost differential among the offerors, and whether it was to the government's advantage to select a higher-scored, higher-priced offeror. The record supports the SSO's trade-off decision.[5]   Although Warner/Osborn's proposal's mission suitability score was higher than Madison's, Madison's technical proposal was better than average. With regard to mission suitability, Warner/Osborn's proposal was viewed as containing 11 major strengths, 6 minor strengths, and no weaknesses, and was rated overall "excellent"; Madison's proposal was seen as having four major strengths, five minor strengths, two minor weaknesses, and was rated overall "very good."[6]  While the protester's proposal score was higher than Madison's in most subfactors, Madison's proposal score was higher on the approach to sample problems subfactor which was the highest weighted subfactor (300 points).  The protester emphasizes its higher mission suitability score; however, mission suitability and cost were approximately equal in value.  Madison's proposal, with most probable costs of $4.7 to $6.5 million less than the protester's, represented a significant cost advantage over Warner/ Osborn's.  In the next most important factor, relevant experience, Madison's "excellent" rating was greater than Warner/Osborn's "very good+" rating.  In the least important factor, other considerations, Warner/Osborn generally had better ratings.   The record shows that the SSO considered mission suitability and cost approximately equal in weight, took into consideration Madison's "excellent" relevant experience rating and acceptable ratings for other considerations, and carefully weighed whether selection of a higher-scored proposal would result in sufficient added value to the government to justify the payment of a substantial price premium.  In our view, since neither proposal represented a clear advantage over the other under the two most important evaluation factors, and Madison was rated higher in the next most important factor, the record supports the SSO's trade-off determination.  See McShade Gov't Contracting Servs., supra; KMS Fusion, supra.   The protest is denied.     1. The RFP provided that the amount of the award fee should be "sufficient to motivate the offeror towards the attainment of superior performance with respect to quality of technical performance, management of cost and timeliness of deliverables."   2. The first subfactor was scored in two separate elements:  overall comprehension (150 points) and approach to problems (300 points).  While the other subfactors were evaluated on the basis of various elements, these were not separately scored.   3. The RFP required offerors to include 25 incumbent employees in their proposals.   4. Warner/Osborn also notes that DCAA qualified its audit of Madison based on its lack of technical information regarding proposed employees and labor rates.  However, DCAA also concluded that Madison's proposal was acceptable as a basis for negotiating a fair and reasonable price. In the absence of any evidence that Madison's labor rates are inaccurate, the DCAA qualification does not adversely impact the agency's cost realism analysis.   5. While viewed in whole, the record supports the selection official's judgment, we believe the better practice here would have been to document the "considerable discussion" of strengths, weaknesses, point and cost differentials, and ultimately, the specific rationale for the cost/technical trade-off. See KMS Fusion, Inc., supra.   6."Excellent" was defined as a "comprehensive and thorough proposal of exceptional merit with one or more major strengths."  "Very good" was defined as a "proposal which demonstrates overall competence.  One or more major strengths have been found, and strengths outbalance any weaknesses that exist."

VIRGIN FESTIVAL BY VIRGIN MOBILE EXPANDS TO TWO DAYS FEATURING THE POLICE, THE SMASHING PUMPKINS AND BEASTI...
VIRGIN FESTIVAL BY VIRGIN MOBILE EXPANDS TO TWO DAYS FEATURING THE POLICE, THE SMASHING PUMPKINS AND BEASTIE BOYS

AUGUST 4-5, 2007 AT PIMLICO RACE COURSE IN BALTIMORE, MD
www.virginfestival****

Virgin Group Founder and Chairman Sir Richard Branson, creator of the world renowned UK based V Festival, announced today that the U.S. Virgin Festival By
Virgin Mobile will be held August 4-5, 2007 at Pimlico Race Course in Baltimore, Maryland, adding a second full day of music in its second year.

On behalf of partnering hosts Virgin Mobile USA and Virgin USA, Branson announced the first three acts to be confirmed: The Police, The Smashing Pumpkins and Beastie Boys. On-sale dates for tickets, the rest of the very diverse two day line up and additional information about the Festival will be announced in the coming weeks.

Everybody had an incredible time at last year's inaugural Virgin Festival, so we are going to double the fun this summer with two days of great music, said Sir Richard, whose legendary music heritage is the inspiration behind Virgin's music festivals. With our unbelievable headliners and terrific festival vibe, Virgin Festival will be the hottest destination for live music this summer.

The three bands have chosen the Virgin Festival By Virgin Mobile to make rare live appearances. The Police are on tour for the first time in 21 years, giving lifelong fans a long-awaited opportunity to see this legendary band. The Smashing Pumpkins are reuniting for their first US performance since going on hiatus in 2000. And Beastie Boys will make their first east coast appearance in two years.

The first U.S. Virgin Festival By Virgin Mobile was held September 23, 2006 and featured 20 bands performing for more than 45,000 people across two stages and a giant dance tent. This year, the site will again provide all kinds of entertainment and activity, with high quality concessions, a diverse array of vendors and non-profit organizations, art installations, performance art and more.

Branson also highlighted that the Festival will be as eco friendly an event as feasible this year in an effort to limit its carbon impact, supporting Virgin Groups ongoing commitment to attacking the causes of global warming. We are exploring numerous ways to minimize the impact of the festival on the environment.

Virgin Mobile USA is the leading wireless youth network with more than 4.6 million customers enjoying wireless service without long term contracts. Our customers share many things, and a passion for music is one at the very core of who Virgin Mobile is, said Dan Schulman, chief executive officer of Virgin Mobile USA. We are not only producing the most dynamic music festival this summer, we are creating a special setting for people to experience music and art, hang with friends, text and talk and network, interact with diverse communities, learn about issues and enjoy themselves.

Virgin is one of the most exciting brands in the world, offering hip, fresh, innovative products and services that resonate with the young at heart, said Frances Farrow, chief executive officer of Virgin USA. Virgin Festival embodies the best of the brand and gives music fans of all ages the chance to experience for themselves what Virgin is really about.

Part of repeating and surpassing the success of the first Virgin Festival By Virgin Mobile is the return of producers I.M.F., a company formed by the principals of I.M.P., one of the countrys leading independent concert promoters and owners of Washington, D.C.s famed 9:30 Club. We had such a blast at last years show; we cant wait to get back. Right now Im putting together the lineup that will just be A list from start to finish, on both stages and in the dance tent, said promoter Seth Hurwitz. Hold the dates...August 4th and 5th...we will be here to entertain & amaze.

On behalf of the City of Baltimore, Id like to say thank you to Mr. Branson and Virgin for bringing this world class event back to our city, said Mayor Sheila Dixon who added, We are excited and proud to, once again, host the Virgin Festival By Virgin Mobile and some of the music industrys biggest talent.

Historic Pimlico Race Course in Baltimore, MD is the home of the world famous Preakness Stakes, the Middle Jewel of Thoroughbred Horse Racings storied Triple Crown. More information about Virgin Festival By Virgin Mobile can be found at www.virginfestival****.
