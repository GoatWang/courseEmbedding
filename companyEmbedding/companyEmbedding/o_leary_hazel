Early life and education[edit]
Hazel Reid was born in Newport News, Virginia. Hazel's parents, Dr. Russel E. Reid and Dr. Hazel Reid were both physicians.[2] They when she was 18 months old. Her father and step-mother Mattie, a teacher, raised Hazel and her older sister Edna Reid.[2][3]:506 Both of the parents were successful medical doctors around the 1930s, and her step-mother was a teacher.[4][5] Hazel attended school in a segregated school system in Newport News for eight years.[2][3]:506 Hazel and her sister were then sent to live with an aunt in Essex County, New Jersey and attend Arts Hight School, an integrated school.[2][3]:506 She earned a bachelor's degree at Fisk University in Nashville in 1959.[3]:506 She then married Carl Rollins and had a son before returning to school and earning her Bachelor of Laws degree from Rutgers School of Law in 1966.[3]:506
Career[edit]
O'Leary worked as a prosecutor in New Jersey prosecuting organized crime cases.[5] Next she became an assistant attorney general.[3]:507 O'Leary got a divorce and in 1969 moved to Washington, D.C. where she joined the consulting/accounting firm of Coopers & Lybrand.[2][3]:507 During the Carter Administration, O'Leary was appointed assistant administrator of the Federal Energy Administration, general counsel of the Community Services Administration, and administrator of the Economic Regulatory Administration at the newly created Department of Energy. At the Department of Energy, Hazel met her third husband, Jack, O'Leary.[5]
In 1981, O'Leary and her husband established the consulting firm of O'Leary & Associates in Morristown, New Jersey, where she served as vice president and general counsel.[6] After Jack died of cancer, Hazel moved to Minnesota.[5] From 1989 to 1993, she worked as an executive vice president of the Northern States Power Company, a Minnesota based public utilities company which served approximately 1.6 million customers.[6][7]
Secretary of Energy[edit]

In 1992, then President-elect Bill Clinton announced he would nominate O'Leary as Secretary of Energy.[8] Clinton officially made the nomination on January 20, 1993, and the Senate confirmed O'Leary by unanimous consent the next day.[5][9] O'Leary became the first woman to serve as Secretary of Energy.[10] At the time she led the Department of Energy, the department had an annual budget of $18 million.[11]
In this position, O'Leary won plaudits for declassifying Cold War-era records, which showed the U.S. Government had used American citizens as guinea pigs in human radiation experiments, as had long been rumored. President Clinton issued Executive Order 12891, which created the Advisory Committee on Human Radiation Experiments (ACHRE) to prevent such abuses of power.[12] O'Leary also pushed to end nuclear testing in the United States.[10] She announced a "zero tolerance" policy, prohibiting retaliation against whistle blowers at nuclear plants.
During O'Leary's service, she was criticized in a Government Accountability Office audit of traveling too frequently and spending too much on accommodations.[13][14] She apologized to Congressional committees in 1996 for spending which exceeded limits on the funds appropriated to the agency for travel, and resigned in January 1997.
In 1997 Johnny Chung, a Democratic political donor, claimed that O'Leary met with Chinese oil officials after he gave $25,000 to O'Leary's favorite charity Africare in 1995. FBI director Louis Freeh urged an independent investigation. Attorney General Janet Reno determined there was "no evidence" of wrongdoing by O'Leary.[15] Some observes, including a lawyer for the Government Accountability Project, saw some fault in O'Leary's conduct but also saw racism and sexism in the manner in way O'Leary was treated.[5]
Fisk University[edit]
In 2004, O'Leary was selected as President of her undergraduate alma mater, Fisk University, a historically black college in Nashville, Tennessee. As president, O'Leary has helped the university recapture its place in competing for top students and financial support, and has attracted outstanding faculty. While she accomplished major fundraising, the university continued to struggle to build its endowment.[16]




O'Leary speaks on September 24, 2013, at the Minorities in Energy Initiative Launch.


One way O'Leary tried to help the school improve its finances was through the sale of a portion of the University's Alfred Stieglitz Collection.[17] The collection was bequeathed to Fisk by his widow and fellow artist Georgia O'Keeffe on the condition that it never be sold. Fisk received proposal from a museum in Arkansas to purchase a half-share.
Fisk appealed to the Chancery Court to be released from the condition prohibiting sale. The court directed the State Attorney General to develop an alternative plan to keep the collection in Nashville and the state. In September 2010 Attorney General Bob D. Cooper proposed the collection be transferred to the Tennessee Arts Commission and housed at the Frist Center for the Visual Arts in Nashville. It would be identified as the "Alfred Stieglitz Collection at Fisk University". The proposal is a joint state, city and museum project.[18][dead link]
In 2012 she announced that she would retire at the end of the calendar year.[19] She was succeeded at Fisk by H. James Williams.[20]
Other affiliations[edit]
O'Lear serves as a Director for Alchemix Corp. and CAMAC International Corporation. She also serves on the Board of Directors for non-profit organizations such as Nashville Alliance for Public Education, Nashville Business Community for the Arts, and Arms Control Association as well as a Trustee on boards of the World Wildlife Fund, Morehouse College, and The Andrew Young Center of International Development.[1]
Marriage and family[edit]
Reid married Carl G. Rollins, Jr., with whom she had a son, also named Carl.[21] They later divorced. Her second marriage to ABC News anchorman Max Robinson did not last long.[2] In 1977 she met John F. O'Leary, then Deputy Secretary of Energy.[2] The pair married on April 24, 1980[citation needed] and remained married until his death from cancer.[2]

Early life and education[edit]
Hazel Reid was born in Newport News, Virginia. Hazel's parents, Dr. Russel E. Reid and Dr. Hazel Reid were both physicians.[2] They when she was 18 months old. Her father and step-mother Mattie, a teacher, raised Hazel and her older sister Edna Reid.[2][3]:506 Both of the parents were successful medical doctors around the 1930s, and her step-mother was a teacher.[4][5] Hazel attended school in a segregated school system in Newport News for eight years.[2][3]:506 Hazel and her sister were then sent to live with an aunt in Essex County, New Jersey and attend Arts Hight School, an integrated school.[2][3]:506 She earned a bachelor's degree at Fisk University in Nashville in 1959.[3]:506 She then married Carl Rollins and had a son before returning to school and earning her Bachelor of Laws degree from Rutgers School of Law in 1966.[3]:506
Career[edit]
O'Leary worked as a prosecutor in New Jersey prosecuting organized crime cases.[5] Next she became an assistant attorney general.[3]:507 O'Leary got a divorce and in 1969 moved to Washington, D.C. where she joined the consulting/accounting firm of Coopers & Lybrand.[2][3]:507 During the Carter Administration, O'Leary was appointed assistant administrator of the Federal Energy Administration, general counsel of the Community Services Administration, and administrator of the Economic Regulatory Administration at the newly created Department of Energy. At the Department of Energy, Hazel met her third husband, Jack, O'Leary.[5]
In 1981, O'Leary and her husband established the consulting firm of O'Leary & Associates in Morristown, New Jersey, where she served as vice president and general counsel.[6] After Jack died of cancer, Hazel moved to Minnesota.[5] From 1989 to 1993, she worked as an executive vice president of the Northern States Power Company, a Minnesota based public utilities company which served approximately 1.6 million customers.[6][7]
Secretary of Energy[edit]

In 1992, then President-elect Bill Clinton announced he would nominate O'Leary as Secretary of Energy.[8] Clinton officially made the nomination on January 20, 1993, and the Senate confirmed O'Leary by unanimous consent the next day.[5][9] O'Leary became the first woman to serve as Secretary of Energy.[10] At the time she led the Department of Energy, the department had an annual budget of $18 million.[11]
In this position, O'Leary won plaudits for declassifying Cold War-era records, which showed the U.S. Government had used American citizens as guinea pigs in human radiation experiments, as had long been rumored. President Clinton issued Executive Order 12891, which created the Advisory Committee on Human Radiation Experiments (ACHRE) to prevent such abuses of power.[12] O'Leary also pushed to end nuclear testing in the United States.[10] She announced a "zero tolerance" policy, prohibiting retaliation against whistle blowers at nuclear plants.
During O'Leary's service, she was criticized in a Government Accountability Office audit of traveling too frequently and spending too much on accommodations.[13][14] She apologized to Congressional committees in 1996 for spending which exceeded limits on the funds appropriated to the agency for travel, and resigned in January 1997.
In 1997 Johnny Chung, a Democratic political donor, claimed that O'Leary met with Chinese oil officials after he gave $25,000 to O'Leary's favorite charity Africare in 1995. FBI director Louis Freeh urged an independent investigation. Attorney General Janet Reno determined there was "no evidence" of wrongdoing by O'Leary.[15] Some observes, including a lawyer for the Government Accountability Project, saw some fault in O'Leary's conduct but also saw racism and sexism in the manner in way O'Leary was treated.[5]
Fisk University[edit]
In 2004, O'Leary was selected as President of her undergraduate alma mater, Fisk University, a historically black college in Nashville, Tennessee. As president, O'Leary has helped the university recapture its place in competing for top students and financial support, and has attracted outstanding faculty. While she accomplished major fundraising, the university continued to struggle to build its endowment.[16]




O'Leary speaks on September 24, 2013, at the Minorities in Energy Initiative Launch.


One way O'Leary tried to help the school improve its finances was through the sale of a portion of the University's Alfred Stieglitz Collection.[17] The collection was bequeathed to Fisk by his widow and fellow artist Georgia O'Keeffe on the condition that it never be sold. Fisk received proposal from a museum in Arkansas to purchase a half-share.
Fisk appealed to the Chancery Court to be released from the condition prohibiting sale. The court directed the State Attorney General to develop an alternative plan to keep the collection in Nashville and the state. In September 2010 Attorney General Bob D. Cooper proposed the collection be transferred to the Tennessee Arts Commission and housed at the Frist Center for the Visual Arts in Nashville. It would be identified as the "Alfred Stieglitz Collection at Fisk University". The proposal is a joint state, city and museum project.[18][dead link]
In 2012 she announced that she would retire at the end of the calendar year.[19] She was succeeded at Fisk by H. James Williams.[20]
Other affiliations[edit]
O'Lear serves as a Director for Alchemix Corp. and CAMAC International Corporation. She also serves on the Board of Directors for non-profit organizations such as Nashville Alliance for Public Education, Nashville Business Community for the Arts, and Arms Control Association as well as a Trustee on boards of the World Wildlife Fund, Morehouse College, and The Andrew Young Center of International Development.[1]
Marriage and family[edit]
Reid married Carl G. Rollins, Jr., with whom she had a son, also named Carl.[21] They later divorced. Her second marriage to ABC News anchorman Max Robinson did not last long.[2] In 1977 she met John F. O'Leary, then Deputy Secretary of Energy.[2] The pair married on April 24, 1980[citation needed] and remained married until his death from cancer.[2]

Early life and education[edit]
Hazel Reid was born in Newport News, Virginia. Hazel's parents, Dr. Russel E. Reid and Dr. Hazel Reid were both physicians.[2] They when she was 18 months old. Her father and step-mother Mattie, a teacher, raised Hazel and her older sister Edna Reid.[2][3]:506 Both of the parents were successful medical doctors around the 1930s, and her step-mother was a teacher.[4][5] Hazel attended school in a segregated school system in Newport News for eight years.[2][3]:506 Hazel and her sister were then sent to live with an aunt in Essex County, New Jersey and attend Arts Hight School, an integrated school.[2][3]:506 She earned a bachelor's degree at Fisk University in Nashville in 1959.[3]:506 She then married Carl Rollins and had a son before returning to school and earning her Bachelor of Laws degree from Rutgers School of Law in 1966.[3]:506
Career[edit]
O'Leary worked as a prosecutor in New Jersey prosecuting organized crime cases.[5] Next she became an assistant attorney general.[3]:507 O'Leary got a divorce and in 1969 moved to Washington, D.C. where she joined the consulting/accounting firm of Coopers & Lybrand.[2][3]:507 During the Carter Administration, O'Leary was appointed assistant administrator of the Federal Energy Administration, general counsel of the Community Services Administration, and administrator of the Economic Regulatory Administration at the newly created Department of Energy. At the Department of Energy, Hazel met her third husband, Jack, O'Leary.[5]
In 1981, O'Leary and her husband established the consulting firm of O'Leary & Associates in Morristown, New Jersey, where she served as vice president and general counsel.[6] After Jack died of cancer, Hazel moved to Minnesota.[5] From 1989 to 1993, she worked as an executive vice president of the Northern States Power Company, a Minnesota based public utilities company which served approximately 1.6 million customers.[6][7]
Secretary of Energy[edit]

In 1992, then President-elect Bill Clinton announced he would nominate O'Leary as Secretary of Energy.[8] Clinton officially made the nomination on January 20, 1993, and the Senate confirmed O'Leary by unanimous consent the next day.[5][9] O'Leary became the first woman to serve as Secretary of Energy.[10] At the time she led the Department of Energy, the department had an annual budget of $18 million.[11]
In this position, O'Leary won plaudits for declassifying Cold War-era records, which showed the U.S. Government had used American citizens as guinea pigs in human radiation experiments, as had long been rumored. President Clinton issued Executive Order 12891, which created the Advisory Committee on Human Radiation Experiments (ACHRE) to prevent such abuses of power.[12] O'Leary also pushed to end nuclear testing in the United States.[10] She announced a "zero tolerance" policy, prohibiting retaliation against whistle blowers at nuclear plants.
During O'Leary's service, she was criticized in a Government Accountability Office audit of traveling too frequently and spending too much on accommodations.[13][14] She apologized to Congressional committees in 1996 for spending which exceeded limits on the funds appropriated to the agency for travel, and resigned in January 1997.
In 1997 Johnny Chung, a Democratic political donor, claimed that O'Leary met with Chinese oil officials after he gave $25,000 to O'Leary's favorite charity Africare in 1995. FBI director Louis Freeh urged an independent investigation. Attorney General Janet Reno determined there was "no evidence" of wrongdoing by O'Leary.[15] Some observes, including a lawyer for the Government Accountability Project, saw some fault in O'Leary's conduct but also saw racism and sexism in the manner in way O'Leary was treated.[5]
Fisk University[edit]
In 2004, O'Leary was selected as President of her undergraduate alma mater, Fisk University, a historically black college in Nashville, Tennessee. As president, O'Leary has helped the university recapture its place in competing for top students and financial support, and has attracted outstanding faculty. While she accomplished major fundraising, the university continued to struggle to build its endowment.[16]




O'Leary speaks on September 24, 2013, at the Minorities in Energy Initiative Launch.


One way O'Leary tried to help the school improve its finances was through the sale of a portion of the University's Alfred Stieglitz Collection.[17] The collection was bequeathed to Fisk by his widow and fellow artist Georgia O'Keeffe on the condition that it never be sold. Fisk received proposal from a museum in Arkansas to purchase a half-share.
Fisk appealed to the Chancery Court to be released from the condition prohibiting sale. The court directed the State Attorney General to develop an alternative plan to keep the collection in Nashville and the state. In September 2010 Attorney General Bob D. Cooper proposed the collection be transferred to the Tennessee Arts Commission and housed at the Frist Center for the Visual Arts in Nashville. It would be identified as the "Alfred Stieglitz Collection at Fisk University". The proposal is a joint state, city and museum project.[18][dead link]
In 2012 she announced that she would retire at the end of the calendar year.[19] She was succeeded at Fisk by H. James Williams.[20]
Other affiliations[edit]
O'Lear serves as a Director for Alchemix Corp. and CAMAC International Corporation. She also serves on the Board of Directors for non-profit organizations such as Nashville Alliance for Public Education, Nashville Business Community for the Arts, and Arms Control Association as well as a Trustee on boards of the World Wildlife Fund, Morehouse College, and The Andrew Young Center of International Development.[1]
Marriage and family[edit]
Reid married Carl G. Rollins, Jr., with whom she had a son, also named Carl.[21] They later divorced. Her second marriage to ABC News anchorman Max Robinson did not last long.[2] In 1977 she met John F. O'Leary, then Deputy Secretary of Energy.[2] The pair married on April 24, 1980[citation needed] and remained married until his death from cancer.[2]

From 1989 to 1993, she worked as an executive vice president of the Northern States Power Company. Also O'Leary was nominated to be Secretary of Energy in 1993 by President Bill Clinton. 
During this time, she was often accused of traveling too frequently and spending lavishly on her accommodations. She apologized to Congressional committees in 1996 for spending which exceeded limits on the funds appropriated for travel and resigned in January 1997. It was later revealed that Chinagate scandal figure Johnny Chung claimed that O'Leary met with Chinese oil officials after Chung had donated $25,000 to O'Leary's favorite charity Africare.  
Currently, O'Leary serves as President of Fisk University in Nashville.
Her honors and affiliations have included: Board of directors, UAL Corp. (parent company of United Airlines), Alchemix Corp., Scottish Re Ltd., AES Corp. and World Wildlife Fund; Board of Trustees and co-chair, The Campaign for a New Century, Morehouse College; Phi Beta Kappa O'Leary is widowed. She has one son, Carl Rollins, 43, an attorney in Washington, D.C.

That's exactly my favorite shade for winter/autumn; stylish and chic instead of downright vampy as many nail colors in that range tend to be. A big plus is that the color doesn't get blacker and blacker with every extra application (Sole Mate I'm looking at you!). Ease of use is also great as always. Had to take a lippie down though because in 3 days I have to reapply, top-coat or not.

I love the dark plum-burgundy color, it is just beautiful in all lights.  I would rate this polish a 5, but the formula is a little more difficult for me than some of my other OPI's.  The first coat is crazy streaky and the second coat is better, but I find that I have to give it a little more time between coats to prevent it from pulling.  Still, one of my favorites that I wish OPI would add to their permanent collection!

It seems to have a purple tint in the photo on here, but the color is more of a dark red. It goes on easy, dries well, and looks fantastic when it's done! This is the nail polish that turned me into a fan of OPI nail products.		     Report Abuse  1 of 1 people found this helpful.

Love it! Great for a pedicure color. Like I've said in other reviews I don't stick to season rules I wear this year round when the mood strikes. Love it.

Its so vampy and sexy and perfect if you want that trendy, wine coloured nail.  Its dark, and makes a statement, and is an alternative to black because it still makes you feel sexy and kickass.  Lovely for fall/winter and looks good on every skin tone!  My friends and sister and mother are constantly stealing this one because it looks hot on everybody!  This is a must have for any nailpolish freak like me.  Haha.

Glossy with Poshe or Seche vite topcoat (my favorites). Most posters are likening this to a deep wine. Which is true. However---barbeque sauce--comes to mind. Get it? Mrs.O'Leary's cow started the Chicago fire.That's why it is part of the collection.Cute and fun change from my pinks, coral, and purples.		     Report Abuse           				HauntedMoonlight				   on  12/3/2007 11:30:00 PM   More reviews by HauntedMoonlight    Age: 19-24 Skin: Combination, Fair-Medium, Not Sure Hair: Brown, Other, Other Eyes: Hazel     			I love this color. It's a gorgeous deep burgandy. Many brands have burgandy polishes, but Mrs. O'Leary's BBQ is the best. Like all OPI polishes, the quality is very good. It lasts a long time without chipping and looks shiny even without a top coat. It took two coats to get the color to show up nice and dark. The only little problem with this polish is that it seems to take longer to dry than my other OPI's. Maybe I should try one of those fast drying top coats with it.

Enter MOLBBQ! Another reviewer said it looked like black cherries, and I agree. With two coats, it's definitely dark with a burgundy undertone, but in a classy sort of way, nothing goth. It really compliments my pale skin and was a great way to break out of a french pedi rut. Highly recommend!		     Report Abuse           				noradar				   on  11/28/2006 6:32:00 AM   More reviews by noradar    Age: 44-55 Skin: Normal, Medium, Not Sure Hair: Brown, Other, Other Eyes: Hazel     			BBQ is such a lovely muted, brown-based, reddish, plumwine shade - but imo, it's just not very lovely w/my skintone - for reference, I'm currently wearing 1 Warm in Aromaleigh Voile foundation. A base coat, 2 color coats, and a clear top coat gave me the same color that I see in the bottle. I guess I just prefer the clear, less muted shades like Marooned on the Mag Mile, 25 Again, Romeo and Joliet, etc. I gave it 5 lippies anyway because worn against the right skintone, I'm sure it's wonderful. Funny thing though - I wore it to a holiday gathering and I received 4 compliments on it (3 from women and 1 from a guy) - so I guess other people do like it on me.  		     Report Abuse           				Cat1104				   on  10/11/2005 1:19:00 PM   More reviews by Cat1104    Age: Unknown Skin: Sensitive, Fair, Neutral Hair: Brunette, Wavy, Medium Eyes: Hazel     			On me Mrs. O'Leary's BBQ is a very dark plum burgundy creme that's tinged with blackened red. To me it looks almost identical to A Man in Every Port-ugal, except that it has a slightly stonger plum undercurrent and no blue flash. It's a great color for fall and winter, but it's nothing  unique in my opinion. 		     Report Abuse  1 of 1 people found this helpful.

Department of Energy 



The first and only woman to hold the position of U.S. Secretary of Energy, Hazel Rollins Reid was born May 17, 1937 in Newport News, Virginia.  During this time of public school segregation, Reid’s parents, hoping for better schooling opportunities, sent their daughter to live with an aunt in New Jersey. There Reid attended a school for artistically gifted students.

Reid entered Fisk University in Nashville, Tennessee in 1955 and graduated with honors four years later. She was elected to Phi Beta Kappa National Honor Society at Fisk.  Seven years later she received a law degree from Rutgers University and soon became an attorney in the New Jersey State Attorney General’s Office. 

By the early 1970s Reid moved to Washington, D.C., where she became a partner at Coopers and Lybrand, an accounting firm. Soon she joined the Gerald Ford Administration as general counsel to the Community Services Administration which administered most of the federal government’s anti-poverty programs.  President Ford later appointed Reid director of the Federal Energy Administration’s Office of Consumer Affairs. In this position she became well known as a representative of the concerns of consumers who challenged the power and influence of the major energy producers. 

In 1977, President Jimmy Carter appointed Reid to head the Department of Energy’s Economic Regulatory Administration. Her agency included more than 2,000 employees who enforced price controls on numerous forms of energy. At this time she successfully lobbied Congress to pass the Fuel Use Act, which decreased the demand for natural gas and developed conservation programs that assisted low-income residents. 

While working for the Carter Administration, Reid met her future husband, John F. O’Leary, who was at the time the nation’s deputy energy secretary. The two married in 1980 and together left the department to establish and manage their own energy-consulting firm, O’Leary Associates.

In 1989, following the death of her husband, Hazel O’Leary went to work for Northern State Power Company, a Minnesota utility, as executive vice president for environmental and public affairs and then president of its natural gas division.  In 1992 President-elect Bill Clinton announced that he would nominate O’Leary to be Secretary of the U.S. Department of Energy. She would become the second woman and third African American nominated to the Clinton Cabinet.

On January 22, 1993, Hazel Rollins Reid O’Leary became the seventh U.S. Secretary of Energy. She would direct the 20,000 employees of the agency and be the principal architect of the Clinton energy policy which emphasized both conservation and innovation. 

While in office O’Leary led the effort to find safer ways to dispose of atomic waste.  She gained Congressional approval to convert one of three national nuclear weapons design laboratories into a research facility to study technologically advanced environmental cleanup practices.  O’Leary also opposed increases in energy taxes.

Since 2002, Hazel O’Leary has served as President of Fisk University, her alma mater.  She remains an avid supporter of environmentalism. She works with a variety of non-profit organizations including the World Wildlife Fund, Morehouse College and The Andrew Young Center of International Development.

Fisk University President Hazel R. O’Leary to Retire in December
February 20, 2012 | 
: 











Tweet

















by Reginald StuartHazel R. O’Leary, the embattled president of financially strapped Fisk University, will retire from her post in December, the school said in a surprise announcement issued late Friday.
 
News of O’Leary departure comes as the school manages to maintain a small, solid academic program while continuing to lose enrollment and thirst for a huge infusion of money to keep its door open. O’Leary was appointed president of Fisk in August, 2004.
 
A member of the university’s board of trustees says the search for a successor to O’Leary would begin immediately.
 
In recent years, the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools (SACS) increasingly expressed concern about the university’s long term viability, sending one signal after another. It placed the historic institution on warning status then, last December, placed Fisk on probation. 
 
Fisk has been given until this fall to file its fourth monitoring report to the SACS Commission on Colleges (COC) demonstrating sufficient financial footing to ensure its long-term financial prospects and evidence that it has a qualified leadership team in place to run the school.
 
Some critics have pointed to O’Leary and her board of trustees as key reasons for the school’s troubles. 
 
SACS says it will decide at its December 2012 meeting, whether the school has made a case for removal from probation or if harsher sanctions are in order. The person selected to succeed O’Leary is likely to weigh heavily on the minds of SACS’ decision makers in reaching their conclusions next fall. 
 
“President O’Leary stands as one of the most accomplished American women of her generation,” Robert W. Norton, chairman of the Fisk Board of Trustees is quoted as saying in a statement released by the university.
 
“She served at Fisk during a difficult time in its history, including cuts in student loans, a tightening of credit markets and a decline in new student enrollment,” Norton is quoted as saying. “For eight years she has brought the needed vision, leadership and stability to enhance Fisk’s position as a highly ranked liberal arts university,” Norton says.
 
Andrew Patterson, vice chairman of the Fisk Board of Trustees and chairman of its presidential search committee, was quoted as saying a search for a successor to O’Leary would “begin immediately to ensure a smooth transition.”
 
Early response to the announcement of O’Leary’s departure was largely mute. There was no comment from the school’s alumni association. It has been increasingly called upon by O’Leary to bring more funds to the university as other sources of money have dried up.
 
There was no comment from Fisk’s faculty senate. It never took a formal vote of confidence supporting or criticizing her leadership, although some of its members have complained privately over the years as the school’s other key leadership roles – provost, chief financial officer and chief of development – have churned several times since O’Leary assumed the presidency.
 
The Fisk statement offered a shopping list of “accomplishments” at Fisk under O’Leary’s tenure, ranging from receipt of increased amounts of research grant funding and impressive standings of its academic programs among liberal arts schools to boosting student retention efforts.
 
Aside from Norton’s mention of the decline in new student enrollment, the Fisk statement did not address the school’s precarious financial condition or the contentious 5-year court battle the school has waged with various parties and the State of Tennessee over the university’s proposed sale of half ownership in its treasured Alfred Stieglitz Collection of art and photographs. The collection of original paintings was given the school half a century ago by the late artist Georgia O’Keeffe, with strict written covenants barring the sale of the collection.
 
O’Leary, who inherited a school in debt and was never able to devise a successful plan for turning it around, quickly embraced the school’s effort to raise money quickly by selling ownership interest in the Stieglitz art and photograph collection.
 
Despite early setbacks, she eventually championed a plan to sell half its ownership and partial control of the collection for $30 million to the new Crystal Bridges Museum in Arkansas. That plan remains mired in the state’s courts, with the Tennessee attorney general Robert Cooper asserting Fisk must be required to honor the intent of the donor. 
 
For more than a year, a splinter group of legacy alumni, upset over the proposed sale, has advocated O’Leary’s firing and the resignation of some trustees, asserting the art sale idea is wrongheaded and little else has been done during her tenure to raise significant amounts of money or reverse the school’s enrollment decline.
 
The alumni splinter group had no initial comment, although one member echoed others interviewed in asserting O’Leary should have made her departure immediate as a way of helping Fisk ready itself for the next round of SACS scrutiny.
 
“In my opinion, the board of trustees must intervene now in the executive and management activities of the University…by immediately hiring competent compliance executives as other schools have done to turn things around to ensure a successful outcome in December,” says Fisk alum and attorney Cassandra Teague Walker. “This must be the first order of business by the trustees before anything else is done. They too, take responsibility for their lack of oversight,” says Walker, noting the Fisk problems “…didn’t just happen overnight.”
 
While alumni giving is up in recent years, many alumni have stopped giving to the school in protest of the art sale proposal and other potential big donors have privately moved to the sidelines pending the outcome of the art collection dispute while stating publicly the lingering poor economy has curbed their giving appetite.
 
Outside observers and Fisk insiders say O’Leary, a Fisk graduate, who earned her law degree at Rutgers, has been a generous personal donor to Fisk and its students in need. By the same token, what they describe as O’Leary’s aversion to “begging” for money explains, in large part, why the university has been only marginally successful in bringing in money when compared with presidents of other schools with comparable impressive histories.
 
Several higher education observers familiar with the Fisk story of the past decade say it will be hard for the university to attract the kind of president it needs to restore Fisk to its `Black Ivy League’ school standing, given the institution’s plight.
 
“A lot of people will look at the prize (the Fisk brand name), but when they open the box,” says one former Fisk administrator familiar with the school’s situation, referring to the daunting challenges that would face O’Leary’s successor.
 
“You’re stepping into a sea of debt,” the observer says. “Even if you turn that art sale around (as in get it finally approved by the courts), you can’t get that money in the system that fast. I hope our new president has a honeymoon,’ ” the observer adds.
 
In making its case nearly two years ago for monetizing the Stieglitz Collection of photographs and art, Fisk officials told a Tennessee court the institution was essentially running on empty. It had mortgaged all of its property, used much of its endowment before O’Leary became president and was running annual deficits of $2 million. The school has not updated that assertion since that disclosure, nor has it reported raising any significant amounts of money to address those major issues.
 
The school says it needs some $100 million to appropriately position itself for the future and says the $30 million from the art collection ownership sharing agreement could serve as seed money. A long promised capital campaign has yet to materialize.  
 
In the Fisk statement announcing O’Leary’s retirement, she is quoted as saying Fisk “…is in better shape than when I arrived and it will continue to enjoy a long and distinguished legacy.”



			One Response to Fisk University President Hazel R. O’Leary to Retire in December 





Wonderful article! My hopes is that the new president will consider using that 5 million to invest in a stronger athletic program for Fisk, including new construction or facility renovations, collaborative partnerships with Vandy & TSU athletic-wise and bringing the big money maker back–FOOTBALL!
