Yogabed Announces Addition of Three New Products
Nov 1 16
Yogabed has announced the addition of three new products, expanding its already broadest product assortment among online mattress and sleep brands. Introducing the Yogababy™ Crib Mattress, Yogapet™ Pet Bed and Yoga-Adjustable™ Base, Yogabed is reinventing the way consumers shop for everything they need for a great night's sleep for themselves and the entire family. Ffor those who need the health and comfort benefits of an adjustable base, the Yoga-Adjustable base can be used with any Yogabed mattress, and like all other Yogabed products, can be ordered online at Yogabed.com and shipped to directly to the shopper's doorstep. YogababyTM Crib Mattress is designed to meet all crib mattress regulations to fit crib furniture perfectly. The two-layer YogaFoamTM design creates the perfect sleep surface for a peaceful nap or to sleep through the night. The Yogababy two-sided design provides a firm side for their first 6 months and a softer side until they're ready for their first Yogabed.  The soft, knit Zip-n-Wash removable, washable cover protects baby's bed from leaks and spills while keeping baby cozy, cool and comfortable. The Yogapet pet bed provides pets with the same comfortable and supportive sleep experience that their humans enjoy with the Yogabed family of brands. Every Yogapet bed comes with a Zip-n-Wash removable cover that can be machine-washed and reassembled quickly and easily. Designed in three sizes to fit most small, medium and large crates, The two-layer YogaFoamTM design creates the perfect sleep surface to let Fido or Fluffy get a great catnap or deep sleep. The Yoga-Adjustable base can be used with any Yogabed mattress, designed to give users the ultimate bedroom experience for those who like to read, write, and watch TV in bed, and for those who may receive health benefits from an adjustable sleep system. The Yoga-Adjustable base can be placed in dozens of positions by raising the head or the foot. Yoga-Adjustable hand-held remotes are designed to be simple to operate to achieve the perfect position quickly and quietly. Because the base can be installed with or without the legs, it can fit in virtually all bedroom furniture or as a stand-alone foundation.  The included retainer bars ensure the mattress is perfectly positioned. The Yoga-Adjustable base, starting at $999, and Yogapet pet beds, starting at $119, are available now at Yogabed.com. The Yogababy crib mattress, at $299, will be available on Yogabed.com starting December, 2016.


Yogabed Expands its Product Assortment with Three New Premium Sleep Accessories
Mar 22 16
Yogabed announced that it is expanding its product assortment with three new premium sleep accessories, designed to make it easier than ever to enjoy a great night's sleep with no hassle. The new suite of products includes an all-in one solution for consumers who need a bed frame and foundation. And because the Yogabed All In-One Frame/Foundation is shipped direct to consumers in a box roughly 40" x 40" x 6", it's easy to maneuver around tight corners or staircases, solving the problem of unwieldy box springs. Yogabed All-In-One Frame/Foundation: This custom-designed base is the perfect cost-effective solution for a first-time bed buyer or anyone who needs a frame and foundation. The Yogabed All-In-One Frame/Foundation has built in legs like a traditional bed set, raising the mattress 14 inches off the floor and providing easy-access under-bed storage. The modern-design, removable cover is washable, so it'll stay fresh and looking great. Assembly is easy and tool-free, and the Frame/Foundation folds up for easy maneuverability and storage when needed. Yogabed 600 Thread Luxury Sheet Sets: Yogabed Sheets are made from a premium ultra-soft cotton-blend fiber, with wrinkle-free technology to keep them looking great and feeling comfortable. Yogabed fitted sheets' 18-inch pocket design guarantees a perfect fit that holds tight to any mattress, no matter how deep. Yogabed Luxury Smooth Top Waterproof Mattress Protector: Made to fit atop the removable Yogabed Zip-n-Wash Cover, the Yogabed Mattress Protector's smooth high-tech surface provides an added layer of protection against stains and spills, allergens and dust mites.

Why is this contact information displayed? [Close]
The USPTO makes this data available for search by the public so that individuals can locate ownership information for intellectual property, much the same way a county might make real estate property ownership information available.
Since our website is synchronized with the USPTO data, we recommend making any data changes with the USPTO directly. Our website will auto-update when the USPTO data is updated.
You may also contact Trademarkia to make a request for the removal of your personally identifiable information or trademark data.  Such requests must be made in writing and will be subject to verification of ownership.  This policy allows verified trademark owners to specify: (A) that their identifiable information be masked, or (B) that their trademark pages permanently deleted from Trademarkia.com.  
                                                Requests may be made directly to customer.service@trademarkia.com and every effort will be made to honor them within 48 hours.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
