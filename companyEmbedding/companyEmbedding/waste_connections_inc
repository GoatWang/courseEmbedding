Services
Collection
Solid waste services typically originate with waste collection, 
				whether at a single or multi-family residence, a commercial customer, 
				an industrial location, a construction location or a special event.  
				We operate a fleet of approximately 3,000 vehicles from almost 150 
				locations across 27 states.  We deploy route optimization software, retrofit 
				existing fleet and utilize alternative fuels to reduce fuel consumption and 
				emissions, lowering our overall carbon footprint.back to top



Special Waste
Read More and submit your profile.
                Special waste is any waste material which, because of its physical, chemical or 
                biological characteristics requires special handling procedures, or poses an unusual 
                threat to the environment, equipment, property, and the public health, welfare and 
                safety.back to top



Composting
The composting and reuse of green or yard waste and food waste are critical 
				components for any community's march to a Zero Waste goal. We continue to increase 
				our composting efforts through investments to expand capacity at existing operations 
				and through the acquisition of new facilities.back to top



Disposal
Municipal solid waste landfills and construction/demolition landfills represent 
				the most cost effective, environmentally safe methodology for the ultimate disposal 
				of solid waste available today. We generally own solid waste landfills to achieve 
				vertical integration in markets where the economic and regulatory environments 
				make landfill ownership attractive.  We own or operate approximately 44 active 
				landfills, 42 of which are municipal solid waste landfills and two which only 
				accept construction and demolition waste. back to top



Intermodal
Intermodal logistics is the movement of containers using two or 
				more modes of transportation, usually including a rail or truck segment. 
				We provide intermodal services for the movement of cargo and solid waste 
				containers in the Pacific Northwest through a network of six intermodal 
				facilities.back to top



Renewable Energy

Solid waste landfills over time generate a greenhouse gas, methane, 
				which can be converted into a valuable source of clean energy. We deploy 
				gas recovery systems to collect methane which is then used to generate 
				electricity for local households, fuel local industrial plants, power 
				alternative fueled vehicles, or qualify for carbon emission credits.back to top


RecycleBank
Through our partnership with RecycleBank, we have introduced a loyalty and 
				rewards program in certain markets to efforts. With RecycleBank, customers earn 
				points based on the weight of their recycled waste stream that can be redeemed 
				for meaningful rewards. The rewards are obvious: waste minimization; savings to 
				participating customers for monthly trash service, groceries, restaurants, etc.; 
				and increased support of local merchants.back to top



Recycling
Recycling has been a well established component of the municipal solid waste 
				system on the West Coast for over 20 years.  In fact, we recycle over 50% of our 
				collected waste volumes on the West Coast, in some cases over 70%.  We are 
				proactively deploying this recycling expertise in many markets off the West 
				Coast, often for the first time, to further encourage materials resuse and 
				waste minimization.  We own or operate almost 40 recycling processing facilities 
				(MRF's) and sell other collected recyclable materials to third parties for 
				processing before resale.back to top



Transfer
We own or operate approximately 55 solid waste transfer stations.  Solid 
				waste transfer station operations represent an efficient, environmentally 
				friendly methodology to receive, process, compact and transfer solid waste 
				to larger vehicles for transport via truck, rail or barge to Company owned/or 
				operated landfills, as well as third party landfills.back to top

About Us
Waste Connections, Inc.
Waste Connections, Inc. is an integrated solid waste services company that provides waste collection, transfer, disposal and recycling services in 
                mostly exclusive and secondary markets in the U.S. and Canada. Through its R360 Environmental Solutions subsidiary, the Company is also a leading 
                provider of non-hazardous oilfield waste treatment, recovery and disposal services in several of the most active natural resource producing areas in 
                the United States, including the Permian, Bakken and Eagle Ford Basins. Waste Connections serves more than six million residential, commercial, 
                industrial, and exploration and production customers from a network of operations in 39 states, six provinces and the District of Columbia. The 
                Company also provides intermodal services for the movement of cargo and solid waste containers in the Pacific Northwest.

Our corporate strategy targets secondary and suburban markets that have strong demographic growth trends and where competitive barriers to entry
                can be developed. We seek to avoid highly competitive, large urban markets and target markets where we can provide either non-integrated or 
                integrated solid waste services under exclusive arrangements, or markets where we can be integrated and attain high market share. We are a leading
                provider of solid waste services in most of our markets, and approximately 50% of our revenues are derived from market areas where we have 
                franchise or exclusive rights to provide our waste services.
We seek to avoid highly competitive, large urban markets and instead target markets where we can attain high market share either through 
                exclusive contracts, vertical integration or asset positioning. We also target niche markets, like exploration and production, or E&P, waste 
                treatment and disposal services, with similar characteristics and, we believe, higher comparative growth potential. We are a leading provider of 
                waste services in most of our markets, and the key components of our operating strategy, which are tailored to the competitive and regulatory 
                factors that affect our markets, are as follows:
Target Secondary and Rural Markets. By targeting secondary and rural markets,
                we believe that we are able to garner a higher local market share than attainable in more competitive urban markets, which reduces our exposure to
                customer churn and improves financial returns. In certain niche markets, like E&P waste treatment and disposal, early mover advantage in certain 
                rural basins may improve market positioning and financial returns given the limited availability of existing third party-owned waste disposal 
                alternatives.
Control the Waste Stream. In markets where waste collection services are 
                provided under exclusive arrangements, or where waste disposal is municipally owned or funded or available at multiple sources, we believe that 
                controlling the waste stream through the provision of collection services is often more important to our profitability and growth than owning or 
                operating landfills. In addition, in certain E&P markets with “no pit” rules or other regulations that prohibit on-site storage or treatment of 
                waste, control of the waste stream allows us to generate additional service revenue from the transportation of waste, as well as the waste 
                treatment and disposal, thus increasing the overall scope and value of the services provided.
Optimize Asset Positioning. We believe that the location of disposal sites 
                within competitive markets is a critical success factor in both solid waste and E&P waste services. Given the importance and costs associated with
                the transportation of waste to treatment and disposal sites, having disposal capacity proximate to the waste stream may provide a competitive 
                advantage and serve as a barrier to entry.
Provide Vertically Integrated Services. In markets where we believe that 
                owning landfills is a strategic element to a collection operation because of competitive and regulatory factors, we generally focus on providing 
                integrated services, from collection through disposal of solid waste in landfills that we own or operate. Similarly, we see this strategic 
                advantage in E&P waste services where we offer closed loop systems for liquid and solid waste storage, transportation, treatment, and disposal.
Manage on a Decentralized Basis. We manage our operations on a decentralized 
                basis. This places decision-making authority close to the customer, enabling us to identify and address customers’ needs quickly in a 
                cost-effective manner. We believe that decentralization provides a low-overhead, highly efficient operational structure that allows us to expand 
                into geographically contiguous markets and operate in relatively small communities that larger competitors may not find attractive. We believe that
                this structure gives us a strategic competitive advantage, given the relatively rural nature of many of the markets in which we operate, and makes
                us an attractive buyer to many potential acquisition candidates.
We believe the solid waste service business is a local business managed by professionals living and working in the communities we serve. We 
                strive to provide service excellence for those communities that place their trust in our company and are always dedicated to putting our customers
                first.

TORONTO, Jan. 3, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Waste Connections, Inc. (TSX/NYSE:    WCN) ("Waste Connections" or the "Company") today announced that it has acquired Groot Industries, Inc. ("Groot").  Founded over a century ago in 1914, Groot is the largest privately-owned solid waste services company in Illinois with total annual revenue of approximately $200 million.  Groot serves approximately 300,000 customers primarily in northern Illinois from a network of six collection operations, six transfer stations and two recycling facilities.








"Groot is one of the most respected and best in class companies in our industry.  With a majority of its operations contiguous to the Rock River assets we acquired in November 2015, Groot solidifies our leading position in these markets, increases potential internalization benefits of their disposal volumes into our existing landfills, and further expands our platform for additional growth opportunities," said Ronald J. Mittelstaedt, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman. "We are extremely pleased that Jon Groot and Ryan Brandsma will continue to lead Groot, and we expect that Groot's support and commitments to its employees, customers, and the communities it serves throughout four generations of family ownership will be further strengthened under our stewardship."
Messrs. Groot and Brandsma added, "We look forward to joining the Waste Connections family and carrying on the Groot name within our markets.  We believe Waste Connections' leadership team, culture, decentralized operating philosophy and growth focus are the best fit for Groot.  We previously had looked to acquire Rock River given the obvious merits of such a combination, and are excited to be together under Waste Connections."

The company was founded in 1997, by a dedicated group of professionals in Washington and Idaho with industry related experience.

In December 2011, the company announced that it would be moving its headquarters from Folsom, CA to The Woodlands, Texas, a suburb of Houston. Chief Executive Officer, Ron Mittelstaedt, cited California's high taxes and dysfunctional legislature as key reasons for the move.[1]

Ronald J. Mittelstaedt, CEO and Chairman
Steven F. Bouck, President

Waste Connection owns Northwest Container Services, a logistics and transportation services company based in the Pacific Northwest.

Progressive Waste Solutions completed a merger with Waste Connections Inc. in June, 2016.  PWS continues to operate as the Canadian division of Waste Connections.

After the move the IT staff at the corporate office will continue to provide guidance for small IT groups at other company locations throughout the country. The Northwest Container Services division and Colorado sites have their own IT executives.

The September 2012 headquarters relocation is presenting the IT department with an opportunity to spend significant funds in 2012 and 2013 on numerous projects and upgrades. They involve data centers, mobility, and payment solutions.

The main priority is a twin data center relocation effort. The company is relocating its main data center from California to Texas for proximity to the new headquarters, and the backup data center will likely move from Arizona to California. The centers will be outfitted with new hardware.

Waste Connections is also in the process of expanding its mobility options for employees. The company wants to offer more BYOD options and support as well as more choices of corporate-issued devices.

Finally, the company is rolling out a new electronic bill presentment and payment solution in 2012.

History[edit]
The company was founded in 1997, by a dedicated group of professionals in Washington and Idaho with industry related experience. Waste Connections, Inc. expanded very quickly; within about a year of its founding the company decided to go public, launching its IPO in May 1998. The company then slowly expanded into California and the western United States and now has operations in 32 of the 50 U.S states. In December 2011, the company announced that it would be moving its headquarters from Folsom, CA to The Woodlands, Texas, a suburb of Houston. Chief Executive Officer, Ron Mittelstaedt, cited California's high taxes and dysfunctional legislature as key reasons for the move.[1]
Corporate structure and leadership[edit]
Waste Connections’ senior leadership is structured as follows:
Ronald J. Mittelstaedt, CEO and Chairman
Steven F. Bouck, President
Darrell W. Chambliss, Executive Vice President and COO
Worthing F. Jackman, Executive Vice President and CFO

Waste Connections, Inc. expanded very quickly; within about a year of its founding the company decided to go public, launching its IPO in May 1998. The company then slowly expanded into California and the western United States and now has operations in 32 of the 50 U.S states. In December 2011, the company announced that it would be moving its headquarters from Folsom, CA to The Woodlands, Texas, a suburb of Houston. Chief Executive Officer, Ron Mittelstaedt, cited California's high taxes and dysfunctional legislature as key reasons for the move.[1]
Corporate structure and leadership[edit]
Waste Connections’ senior leadership is structured as follows:
Ronald J. Mittelstaedt, CEO and Chairman
Steven F. Bouck, President
Darrell W. Chambliss, Executive Vice President and COO
Worthing F. Jackman, Executive Vice President and CFO

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)
language_code

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
