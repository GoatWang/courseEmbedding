			Opportunistic
		




CIM’s Opportunistic Strategy is focused on making equity and debt investments in repositioning and development of retail, residential, office, parking, hotel, signage and other asset types in established and/or emerging urban neighborhoods located in communities that meet CIM’s qualification criteria. CIM's opportunistic investments require significant development or repositioning efforts, possible entitlement changes, new construction, substantial development or adaptive re-use, and/or full lease-up activities, providing the potential for appropriately high returns. Since 1994, CIM has made more than 100 opportunistic investments in approximately 45 of its qualified communities.


One of CIM’s most successful opportunistic investments is the Hollywood & Highland® Center in the Hollywood Entertainment District. In 2004, CIM acquired the property and saw an opportunity to improve the performance of the asset by addressing some key design flaws. CIM made sweeping changes to the Center to address the needs of the community, including attracting new tenants that were well-suited to the project. Today, Hollywood & Highland® is a 632,000-square-foot, five-story outdoor retail and entertainment center featuring shopping, dining, and entertainment, including the Dolby Theatre that hosts the annual Academy Awards® ceremony.
