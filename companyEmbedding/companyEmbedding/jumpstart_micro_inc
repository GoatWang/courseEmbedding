Building Strong Communities Through Micro-Lending






The JumpStart Fund Mission

The JumpStart Fund, a non-profit microenterprise development program, was formed by the Refugee Resettlement Office in 2003 with funding from the federal Office of Refugee Resettlement (for more information about RRO click here). Since then, JumpStart has provided over $550,000 in micro-loans to Puget Sound area refugees and asylees. We've given loans and business technical assistance to more than 200 refugee entrepreneurs from Somalia, Ethiopia, Cameroon, Ukraine, Russia, Bosnia & Herzegovina, Trinidad, Azerbaijan, Iran and Nepal. We're fulfilling our mission: To help refugees and asylees achieve self-sufficiency through business ownership so that they can contribute to the economic development of their communities. We've assisted hundreds of entrepreneurs in starting, strengthening or expanding these types of viable enterprises in the Puget Sound area: 




Towncar/ Limo Service 
Commercial Driving School 
Hair Salon 
Coffee Shop 
Retail Clothing Store 
Construction Company 
Child Care 
Security Company 
Sign Company 
Medical Staffing Agency 
Adult Home Care 

and many more!

  Seattle and King county continue to attract more and more refugees and immigrants every year. Our micro-loans allow these talented newcomers to make a positive transition into life in the United States. By helping these entrepreneurs achieve self-sufficiency, JumpStart Fund positively affects the economy of the entire Puget Sound region. ATTENTION BUSINESS OWNERS!

You may not use this compiler for commercial development. For commercial code development, please purchase JumpStart C for Cortex-M STD or PRO license.
 
Supported platforms: Windows XP through Windows 10
Everything you need to start programming the powerful Cortex®-M in C immediately:


STM32 Cortex-M4 Nucleo board from ST with ST-LINK/V2 debug pod.

 “JumpStart API allows you to focus on the application coding and not ARM coding. In a few minutes I had a configured and working skeleton for my hardware.”  – M. Barber
Hardware:
The hardware provides everything you need to get started with ARM® Cortex®-M programming. The ST Nucleo board is Arduino form-factor compatible with a powerful Cortex®-M chip and the ST-LINK/V2 debug pod on board.
The Arduino Compatible Education (ACE™) Shield uses all the major peripherals of the powerful Cortex®-M microcontrollers, including: GPIO, timers, PWM, USART, SPI, I2C, ADC and DAC.
Software:
The JumpStarter C compiler includes an easy-to-use, fast Integrated Development Environment (IDE) and a friendly debugger (separate license required for the debugger). The JumpStart API allows you to get started writing applications without getting bogged down in the tedium of system and peripheral setup.
Examples:
Start programming the Cortex®-M devices in C immediately by downloading one of the ready-to-run example programs. Complete source code and projects with tutorials included. Learn C by modifying existing projects and following the tutorials.
eBook: 
A textbook-style tutorial reference ebook “C for Everyone: The JumpStart Guide to C”, written by authors with 30+ years of experience in writing C compilers and providing user support, contains all the information you need to become an effective C programmer.

In May of 2016,  Jumpstart Micro was one of the first SEC registered equity crowdfunding portals to go live under the Title III JOBS Act.  These new regulations brought an exciting new change to the world of raising capital and investing. While previously reserved for high-net worth (more than $1M excluding primary residence) individuals, now everyone is able to make investments in startup companies (as little as a few hundred dollars), support innovation, and gain ownership in return.
Raising capital can be a huge challenge for startup companies, as there is a severe lack of funding available to them.  The Jumpstart Micro crowd investing concept is to facilitate funding for promising ventures with many small investments from people who like you interested in helping entrepreneurs and driving industries forward. This is an exciting time for you to invest in ventures that interest you, while participating as a shareholder, and maybe even as a customer or brand ambassador.
Why Jumpstart Micro?
As one of the few SEC registered equity crowdfunding platforms, Jumpstart Micro's mission is to help young companies get started and to provide average investors - not only accredited ones - opportunities to invest and drive innovation. 
We don't focus on just one industry or type of venture either. Our agnostic approach means we're able to provide you, our investors, a wide variety of investment opportunities that may interest you - whether that be technology, travel, gaming, restaurants, or real estate.
Why Join?



You can be part of something new and really exciting! 
It's simple and free.
Get weekly or monthly updates on new ventures coming to the site.
Make small investments based on your interest.
Help entrepreneurs launch ventures, create jobs and find new innovations.
Be the first to see cool products, apps, service and new innovations.
Become a customer of ventures you invest in - maybe even one of the first.  Many discounts to their investors






What's the Process?
Joining is easy and free.  Complete a quick profile which includes a brief section that will help determine how much you can invest each year under the SEC regulations.  Once you've done that, you can check out the listing page of interesting ventures. Each venture will clearly display the terms of the investment, business plan, management profile, past and future financials and more. If you find one of interest, you're able to ask questions and get to know the entrepreneur.  If you like what you see, click "Invest Now" and make your investment.  When you invest, your investment goes into a bank escrow account until the deadline.  The minimum target amount must be reached or your investment is returned.
        Jumpstart Micro does not endorse any venture.  We act as an intermediary to present investors with early stage ventures from committed Entrepreneurs.

	The American JOBS ACT has created a new opportunity which we are excited to bring to you.  Whether you are an Entrepreneur, future Entrepreneur, Investor or vendor with a service to offer, we welcome you to a unique community.  The JOBS ACT opens the door for 58 million Americans to now invest in startup companies.  Previously, this was restricted to only “accredited investors” which are high net worth individuals with $1,000,000 net worth or $200,000 in annual income.  Collectively the 58 million new investors represents more than $200 Billion in new possible investments.  This has the potential to be a massive stimulus package for small businesses.


Having been entrepreneurs we understand what it takes to move an idea from a concept to a successful business and have created what we believe is an environment conducive to foster success.  The JOBS ACT is designed to create JOBS and stimulate the U.S. economy with innovation.  We are thrilled to be a part of this revolution.  Both to help create new jobs and more importantly to see what new innovation may be created.  Who knows, we might just uncover the next big thing. 


	Thank you for joining us!


		The Jumpstart Micro Team

I'm an entrepreneur
I have a great business concept or startup but I really need funding to make it happen.








What do you need to start a business?
Three simple things: know your product better than anyone, know your customer and have a burning desire to succeed.





Common Questions




What kind of businesses can get funded on Jumpstart Micro?


                            All types.  Anything from a high tech startup, interesting new product to a local franchise or restaurant.  This is one of the great benefits of the new title III JOBS ACT.  We can bring back community based investing.  In the old days if you wanted to start a restaurant, you got the community to invest and they became your best customers and advocates.
                        

What are the requirements for a company to raise money using Jumpstart Micro?



You can join for free and start building your business plan.
To raise money, you need to be a U.S. legal entity which is a C-Corp, S-Corp or LLC.  If you don’t have this already we can help to get you setup.
You also need to disclose information about anyone who owns more than 20% of your business and provide financial information such as tax returns and financial statements for the lesser of 2 years or the start of your company.
You will also need a business plan and financial projections.  Once you join we walk you through all of the steps.



What are the requirements for an Investor?



Anyone can join as an Investor to see all types of opportunities
You provide your income and net worth, either as a single person or jointly with a spouse.
We calculate your annual investment allowance based on the JOBS ACT requirements
Minimum for anyone is $2,200 annually
If you make less than $107,000 we multiple 5% times the lesser of your income or net worth. Ex: If that is $107,000, you can invest up to $5,000 per year
If you make more than $107,000 then we multiple 10% times the lesser of you income or net worth. . Ex: If that is $200,000, you can invest up to $20,000 per year



Can I raise debt or equity and how is the valuation determined?

Yes, as the entrepreneur, you can decide if you want to offer debt or equity and what the terms of the offering are.  We can provide some guidance and best practices.  Regarding valuation, you determine the valuation and justification.  This might be based on comparisons to other companies in your industry or the history of your company.  Investors are smart and they tend of have a good sense of what something is worth and it’s potential.  Be reasonable, and your chances of success increase.
                        

Is it expensive to raise money on Jumpstart Micro?


                            No, we keep the costs low.  You can join for free and build your plans over time. When you are ready, you submit your plan for review.  Before you go live there is a small listing fee and if you are successful there is a success fee at the end.  We also help you from beginning to end to keep legal and other costs low.  Investors are charged a very small transaction fee with their investment to cover the bank processing costs.
                            
                            A listing fee of $1,000 - $1,500 is charged to cover setup costs and bank escrow costs depending on the amount of money being raised. In addition, a success fee which is found in the disclosure statement.
                            
                            Investors are charged a small transaction fee of $12
                        

What’s local investing all about?


                            The goal of the American JOBS ACT is to help create jobs, and innovation.  To accomplish this, Title III has opened the door for people to make small investments in promising companies.  It’s not always about the next big tech company with a high valuation.  Sometimes, it’s about investing in a local business, supporting your neighbor, helping your community and being able to effect the success of a business.   If you invest in a local business, you will likely become a customer, tell your friends and help to make it a success.
                        





How does Jumpstart Micro help me as an Entrepreneur?


                            We give you a place to effectively tell your story.  The story includes your service or product, business plans, financials, management team, and future.  We provide a step by step process to walk you through everything and to make your investment pitch.  This includes guides and best practices on how to create awareness for your venture, video, graphics presentations and more.  On the site you can respond to investor questions and interact, which we highly encourage.
                        

How does Jumpstart Micro help me as an Investor?


                            The rules have changed and now anyone can consider making small investments in startup companies. Until now, this was limited to high net worth people, and other groups such as venture capital firms.  This is not without risk.  These are private companies and you should only consider investing what you can afford to lose.  We don’t recommend or endorse any of the companies on our portal.  Our job is to provide a place where investors can see opportunities, evaluate them and make investment decisions.  We also ask questions about your interest and will send you periodic opportunities which we think may interest you. Click here to see a list of disclosures.


What happens if a company doesn’t reach its goal? 


                            Companies can set a minimum and maximum target goal.  Investors review everything and if they decide to invest, it’s as simple as clicking Invest Now and providing payment information.  All investments go directly to a Bank Escrow Account within a short period of time. At no times does Jumpstart Micro handle any funds.  The Escrow agreement tells the bank to hold the funds collected until the end of the fund raising which is when the maximum target or deadline is met.  If the minimum is never met, all funds collected are returned to the investors.
                        

Can I register as both an Entrepreneur and Investor?


                            Yes, you can, but you need to register using two different email addresses.
                        

What’s a good strategy for a Company to raise money?


There is a misconception in the market that startups need to raise lots of money at high valuations. It wasn’t always this way, but a lack of capital available for startups has forced them to think big to attract venture capital.
Raise what you need to operate your business and reach milestones. Remember, you can raise up to $1,070,000 each year under Title III and raise more than once each year. For example, you might raise $100,000 to get to a prototype of your product at $2.00 per share. Then raise $250,000 6 months later at $4.00 per share. With each round and proof of reaching milestones and achieving success your business value has increased and you can raise more at a high valuation with less dilution on the current shareholders.

Disclosures





All members of the Jumpstart Micro Community should read this disclosure carefully


Jumpstart
Micro Disclosure


	All members of the Jumpstart
Micro Community should read this disclosure carefully.  You will be
asked to acknowledge your understanding before making an Investment
or offering securities. These items are all designed to foster a
positive environment and protect the rights of all members. They also
define what you should expect when using Jumpstart Micro.


There
are two types of Jumpstart Micro (JSM) members:


Investors


	These
are individuals, corporate entities and trusts who are reviewing
investment opportunities and making investments.  It should be clear
that Jumpstart Micro is a Funding Portal and we offer no advice or
recommendations to Investors.  The decision to invest is purely made
by Investors and their advisors.  Investors must also consent to
receiving all communications by email. JSM cannot be held responsible
in any way.


Issuers


	An
issuer is a company who is selling securities to raise capital for
their business.  Through the JSM Funding Portal they present the
project to Investors for consideration and are available to answer
any questions by issuers in a public forum.  Issuers are required to
provide specific detail on the investment opportunity as outlined
below.





The
process for the offer, purchase and issuance of securities through
the Funding Portal


Offering – Issuers use the Funding Portal tools to create a listing page of pertinent information for Investors to review and consider. Investors have the ability to ask questions in a public forum with other Investors to gain more insight. An offer may be debt with repayment terms and interest or equity (stock) where the Issuer sells shares in their company to Investors.


Purchase – Investors can purchase the securities offered by an Issuer by selecting the “Invest Now” button. An Investor can then review the investment details and risk disclosures which they are also asked to acknowledge. On the page, they can process a secure payment. An email will be sent to confirm the details of the investment and include the amount being invested and the share price. The investments always go into an Escrow Account with a bank to be held until the target amount being raised is met. If the target amount is not met by the closing date the investment is return by the bank. Jumpstart Micro does not hold any investor funds. There is also a right to cancel defined below.
In many cases there is a rolling close once the minimum investment is reached. For example, if the minimum is $50,000 and maximum is $200,000 the Issuer can close on the first $50,000 and then
continue to raise up to the maximum of $200,000 with periodic closes. This is disclosed on the listing page and in the Offering Statement filed with the SEC.


Issuance – Once the transaction is completed, the Issuer is responsible for issuing the security documents or shares to the Investors. If held by a Transfer Agent this is an electronic acknowledgement. If not, it will be a paper stock certificate or document sent. Additional notifications and annual reports are also required and defined below.


Refund – If an issuer did not complete an offering, for example, because the target was not reached or the issuer decided to terminate the offering, JSM will, within five business days send to each investor who had made an investment commitment a notification disclosing the cancellation of the offering, the reason for the cancelation, and the refund amount that the investor should expect to receive. This notification, like other notifications is by email.



The
risks associated with investing in securities offered and sold in
reliance on Regulation Crowdfunding


Risk
of Investing - The purchase of stock or debt in early stage companies
is only suitable for persons or entities that can afford the risk of
losing their entire investment.  The Issuers business, financial
condition and operating results could be adversely affected by any of
a number of factors, and you could lose part or all of your
investment.  The risks and uncertainties described by Issuers are not
the only ones that the company may face.  Additional risks and
uncertainties not currently known, or that are currently thought of
as immaterial, may also impair business operations.  Jumpstart Micro,
Inc only provides a portal to present investment opportunities and
does not evaluate or recommend any investments.  Investors and
Issuers agree to hold jumpstart micro, Inc. harmless.


An
additional risk relates to minority ownership by Investors. 
Depending on the security an Investor may or may not have voting
rights and collectively with the other investors may have a minority
interest in the Issuer Company.  Having a minority interest limits an
Investors ability to make any decisions and all investors should
consider this risk and assess their confidence in the management team
to make prudent decisions in the interest of all stakeholders.


Types
of Securities offered by Issuers


Issuers
can offer Equity (stock) or Debt securities.  An Equity investment
gives the Investor ownership in the Company and does not get paid
back for their investment or receive any type of payments.  The
exception to this is if the company is profitable and management
decides to issue a cash dividend to the shareholders.  In most cases
you are buying the stock in belief that over time the value will grow
and the company will either sell the business to a larger company or
take action to create liquidity for the shareholders such as going
public or bringing in a larger investor who can offer to buy back the
shares owned by Investors.  There are common stock and preferred
stock in a corporation.  Preferred is a higher class of stock.  A
Company may also be a Limited Liability Company (LLC).  Please see
Learn More for details.


Debt
is an agreement to repay your investment with interest over a defined
period of time.  An example is to raise $300,000 and pay it back at
an interest rate of 10% annually over 5 years.  The monthly payments
will be defined in the agreement.  Debt is inherently less risky.  In
Bankruptcy, a debt holder is paid back before any equity holders
receive any benefit.


Read
any provisions carefully.  Issuers may offer other features that must
be disclosed such as buy back rights, or in the case of debt it might
be interest only with a balloon payment of the principal at the end. 
These will be clearly defined.


The
restrictions on the resale of securities offered and sold


The
securities being purchased are private securities; meaning there is
no public market where you can sell the securities.  At a minimum you
cannot transfer or sell any securities purchased for 12 months.  
Even after 12 months there may not be a market for the securities. 
It is best to consider any investment through the Crowdfunding
process to be one where you are investing on the long term future of
the company.  During the first 12 months these transfer exceptions
are allowed: 1) to the issuer of the securities; (2) to an accredited
investor; (3) as part of an offering registered with the Commission;
or (4) to a member of the family of the purchaser or the equivalent,
to a trust controlled by the purchaser, to a trust created for the
benefit of a member of the family of the purchaser or the equivalent,
or in connection with the death or divorce of the purchaser or other
similar circumstance.


Types
of information that an issuer is required to provide in annual
reports, the frequency of the delivery of that information, and the
possibility that the issuer’s obligation to file annual reports may
terminate in the future


An
issuer is required to identify a location on their website where
Annual Reports will be filed each year.  They must post these for
Investors within 120 days from the end of their corporate fiscal year
end (when they filed their corporate taxes.  Typically 12/31, but not
always). An investor may not continually have current financial information about the issuer as described below.





The
			annual report will contain financial statements certified by the
			principal executive officer of the issuer to be true and complete
			in all material respects. If Issuer has financial statements that
			have been reviewed or audited by an independent certified public
			accountant they will be provided. 




The
			annual report should include the information filed in the offering
			statement* and disclose information about the company and its
			financial condition, as required in connection with the offer and
			sale of the securities. 





*Offering
	Statement is filed with the Securities Exchange Commission prior to
	offering securities to Investors. On the right sidebar of every listing page there is a link to the SEC website to view all filings by the Issuer and a link to their Offering Statement relating to the crowdfunding offering. All investors should obtain a copy and read it carefully.




Issuer
			must post the annual report on its website and make them available
			to investors.  The final rules do not require delivery of a
			physical copy of the annual report. 




Termination
			of reporting my occur if the following conditions are met:
                                   


The
	issuer has filed at least one annual report and has fewer than 300
	holders of record;




The
	issuer has filed at least three annual reports and has total assets
	that do not exceed $10 million;




(Sales
	of the business) The issuer or another party purchases or
	repurchases all of the securities  including any payment in full of
	debt securities or any complete redemption of redeemable securities;
	or




The
	issuer liquidates or dissolves in accordance with state law.










The
limits on the amounts investors may invest


The
new Crowdfunding Rules limit the amount an Investor may invest in all
crowdfunding offerings in any 12-month period.




If
	you have an annual income or net
	worth of less than $107,000 you are only permitted to invest up to
	the greater of (1) $2,200 and (2) 5 percent of the lesser of your
	annual income or net worth.




If
	you have an annual income and net
	worth greater than or equal to $107,000, you may invest up to 10
	percent of the lesser of your annual income or net worth.




Regardless
	of above no investor is permitted to purchase more than $107,000
	worth of securities in any 12-month period.




Holders
	of securities sold in a crowdfunding offerings will generally be
	required to hold all securities purchased for a least one year
	before engaging in sales.




The
circumstances in which the issuer may cancel an investment commitment


Issuers
can cancel an Investors investment under these circumstances:




Issuers
	are required to report all material changes while selling
	securities.  Investors are notified of the change and have 5 days to
	reconfirm their investment or it is cancelled. The offering is also
	extended an additional 5 days. A notice will be sent out to the investor with the reason for the cancellation and the investment will be refunded if funds were collected.  All communications will be by email to the Investors registered email address on the portal. 




If
	the target investment is not met, the investment is cancelled and
	returned to the Investor.




The
	escrow agent bank will perform and Anti-Money Laundering check which
	is standard practice at a bank.  Should this come back negative the
	Investor funds will be returned. 




The
limitations on an investor’s right to cancel an investment
commitment


Investors
have a right to cancel their investment in these circumstances




Once
	the Issuer has met its target investment amount the site will
	reflect that it has reach the target and is no longer accepting
	investments.  A notice from Jumpstart Micro will go to Investors to
	inform them and Investors will be given 48 hours to cancel their
	investment.  If not cancelled, Investors are required to make their
	committed investment if he was not already made. 




Investors
	are notified of any material changes and given 5 days to reconfirm
	their investment before it is cancelled. 




The
need for the investor to consider whether investing in a security
offered and sold is appropriate for him or her


This
disclosure identifies a number of risks for investors which include
the potential loss of investment, lack of control as a minority
shareholder, the unpredictable future of the Company and potentially
long term nature of investing in early stage companies.  Each
Investor should consider these risks seriously and seek any advice
needed before making an investment.


Following completion of an offering, there may or may not be any
ongoing relationship between the issuer and Jumpstart Micro.


Jumpstart
Micro is a Crowdfunding Portal to bring Issuers and Investors
together.  Once an Issuer has completed their offering there may or
may not be an on-going relationship between Jumpstart Micro and the
Issuer.  Investors will own securities in the Issuer and will have a
direct relationship with them regarding the securities.  Jumpstart
Micro will be available should the Issuer choose to offer additional
securities (Issuers can offer up to $1,070,000 each year) and may in the
future offer other services to help with annual reports and
consulting.  Investors should understand this change to working
directly with the Issuer once the transaction is complete.

offering and issuers will answer.  All questions and answers are
available for public viewing in an effort to help all investors
assess the opportunity.  Investors can also post reviews and issuers
can provide periodic updates on their progress. All
communications shall be based on principles of fair dealing and good
faith.

Code
of Conduct


The Jumpstart Micro funding portal is designed to bring investors and issuers together and facilitate communications. It is expected that all parties conduct themselves in a professional, respectful manner. No communication may make any false, exaggerated, unwarranted or misleading statement or claim. No communications may be disparaging, or contain any type of foul, sexist or racist comments. We encourage our members to report any concerns of abuse and reserve the right to terminate any persons membership without recourse should we determine any inappropriate behavior.
