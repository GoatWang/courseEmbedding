          What I appreciated most from Sheila was that she quietly advised regarding ea product she was applying to my face and why.  She gave me a thorough analysis of my skin.  Plus she gave me an amazing facial.

FTP is the sponsor of the First Trust series of unit investment trusts. For FTP's unit investment trusts, FTA monitors the portfolios to ensure they maintain sound investment character. For a limited number of UIT portfolios, FTA utilizes the services of affiliated sub-portfolio supervisors. FTA determines the valuation of each security in each trust's portfolio on a daily basis. This allows the trustee to calculate the trusts' daily net asset value. For the portfolios, FTA evaluates domestic and foreign equity securities, preferred securities, corporate bonds, municipal bonds, US government bonds, US government agency securities, REITs, MLPs, ADRs, closed-end fund shares and ETF shares.^The firm also provides discretionary investment management services to institutional and individual clients. Their institutional clients primarily include open and closed-end mutual funds, ETFs, and variable annuity sub-accounts. Investment management services are offered to individual clients through separate managed accounts, either directly or through wrap fee programs sponsored by unaffiliated investment advisors. In managing portfolios, FTA utilizes various types of securities including domestic and foreign equity securities; domestic and foreign fixed income securities (both investment grade and non-investment grade); US government and foreign sovereign fixed income securities, municipal securities, preferred securities, REITs, MLPs, CEFs, ETFs, ADRs, and senior loans. Investment strategies involve one or more equity or balanced strategies. FTA does not offer any SMA strategies investing principally in fixed income securities. They do offer strategies investing principally in fixed income CEFs and/or ETFs.

Fund Advisor

                                    Current                


Confluence Investment Management LLC


                  Confluence Investment Management's investment philosophy is based upon independent, fundamental research that integrates evaluation of market cycles, macroeconomics and geopolitical analysis with a value-driven approach. The firm employs fundamental, technical and cyclical security analysis methods, which vary by the type of portfolio strategy provided. The firm's equity strategies, which are comprised of specific company securities, utilize a bottom-up, fundamental approach whereas their asset allocation strategies, which are implemented using ETFs, utilize a top-down, technical and cyclical approach. Their equity strategies include All Cap Value, Equity Income, Global Hard Assets, Increasing Dividend Equity Account (IDEA), Large Cap Value, REITs, and Utilities. Confluence's Global Hard Assets strategy, which is primarily comprised of common stock securities with a small portion of ETFs, is a combination of the above two approaches. The firm's Global Macro strategy is comprised solely of ETFs and is analyzed and managed similarly to the asset allocation strategies. Confluence also manages sector specific strategies (e.g., Business Development Companies (BDCs), Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs) and Utilities) that utilize both top-down and bottom-up approaches.For the Increasing Dividend Equity Account (IDEA) Plus strategy, which is an equity strategy combined with a covered call option strategy on the S&P 500 Index, Confluence analyzes option securities for their strike price, premium, volatility and term. Seventy-five percent of the portfolio is the IDEA portfolio in which the stock selection utilizes qualitative analyses in an attempt to identify high quality companies with long track records of distributing earnings to shareholders through dividends. The remaining 25% consists of an ETF position in the S&P 500 Index with a corresponding covered call position, although this allocation can range at times from 15% to 40% of the portfolio.
