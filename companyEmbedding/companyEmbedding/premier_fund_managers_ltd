What are analysts saying about American Eagle Outfitters stock?

Here are some recent quotes from research analysts about American Eagle Outfitters stock: 
1. UBS AG analysts commented, "Last week we hosted investor meeting with AEO (CFO Bob Madore, President of aerie Jennifer Foyle, IR Judy Meehan), with subsequent tour of aerie's pop-up SoHo store. While pricing wars in teen are heating up (both AEO and ANF talked about being promotional this Spring as traffic challenges accelerate, ARO still around), AEO is outperforming, with strength in women's apparel (accelerating over Holiday, driven especially by tops) and aerie emerging as a viable growth vehicle (seven quarters of comps up high-teens/20s); fixing men's (~40% of sales) big opportunity ahead. Tweaking estimates to reflect guide; AEO guided 1Q17 comps in line with current run-rate, which suggests potential upside as tax refunds catch up; risk/return looks interesting with 3-4% dividend/7% FCF yield, teen space volatility keeps us on sidelines." (3/6/2017)
2. BMO Capital Markets analysts commented, "4Q adjusted EPS of $0.39 was slightly above the consensus $0.38 estimate. The company issued light 1Q guidance of $0.15-0.17, which is consistent with broader retail weakness indicated in February across the industry. Nonetheless, our long-term thesis remains intact as we believe that the immediate competitive environment headwinds are likely to dissipate in the coming year - especially compared to last year. Further, we believe guidance does not consider any improvement in March/April from QTD trends. We maintain our Outperform rating and highlight current valuation as a favorable entry point." (3/2/2017)
3. Mizuho analysts commented, "We are lowering our estimates and PT to $15 (from $16) following a disappointing 1Q guide that may point to muted margin improvement and challenging topline growth in FY17. While we were encouraged by the relative strength of Aerie and the women's assortment at core AE, we question the strategy to invest behind AUC and unit growth in order to gain market share, especially with increased AUR pressure from competition and the face of difficult stacked compares. As such, we believe AE may continue to trade at a discounted multiple of ~12x." (3/1/2017)
4. According to Zacks Investment Research, "American Eagle’s shares have outperformed the Zacks categorized industry on a year to date basis. The company posted solid third-quarter fiscal 2016 results, wherein both top and bottom lines met our estimates and rose year-over-year. This marked the company’s ninth straight quarter of profit growth. Results gained from constant efforts toward upgrading its digital business, product enhancement and focus on enriching consumer experience. Also, continued strength in its AE and aerie brands fuelled results. However, management issued a soft fourth quarter outlook, where it expects flat to low single digit comps growth with earnings forecast also being muted. The drab view also hurt estimates. Additionally, currency risks stemming from global expansion, poses threats. Nonetheless, the company’s store rationalization plans, diligent inventory management and cost-control efforts bode well." (12/22/2016)

What are analysts saying about American Eagle Outfitters stock?

Here are some recent quotes from research analysts about American Eagle Outfitters stock: 
1. UBS AG analysts commented, "Last week we hosted investor meeting with AEO (CFO Bob Madore, President of aerie Jennifer Foyle, IR Judy Meehan), with subsequent tour of aerie's pop-up SoHo store. While pricing wars in teen are heating up (both AEO and ANF talked about being promotional this Spring as traffic challenges accelerate, ARO still around), AEO is outperforming, with strength in women's apparel (accelerating over Holiday, driven especially by tops) and aerie emerging as a viable growth vehicle (seven quarters of comps up high-teens/20s); fixing men's (~40% of sales) big opportunity ahead. Tweaking estimates to reflect guide; AEO guided 1Q17 comps in line with current run-rate, which suggests potential upside as tax refunds catch up; risk/return looks interesting with 3-4% dividend/7% FCF yield, teen space volatility keeps us on sidelines." (3/6/2017)
2. BMO Capital Markets analysts commented, "4Q adjusted EPS of $0.39 was slightly above the consensus $0.38 estimate. The company issued light 1Q guidance of $0.15-0.17, which is consistent with broader retail weakness indicated in February across the industry. Nonetheless, our long-term thesis remains intact as we believe that the immediate competitive environment headwinds are likely to dissipate in the coming year - especially compared to last year. Further, we believe guidance does not consider any improvement in March/April from QTD trends. We maintain our Outperform rating and highlight current valuation as a favorable entry point." (3/2/2017)
3. Mizuho analysts commented, "We are lowering our estimates and PT to $15 (from $16) following a disappointing 1Q guide that may point to muted margin improvement and challenging topline growth in FY17. While we were encouraged by the relative strength of Aerie and the women's assortment at core AE, we question the strategy to invest behind AUC and unit growth in order to gain market share, especially with increased AUR pressure from competition and the face of difficult stacked compares. As such, we believe AE may continue to trade at a discounted multiple of ~12x." (3/1/2017)
4. According to Zacks Investment Research, "American Eagle’s shares have outperformed the Zacks categorized industry on a year to date basis. The company posted solid third-quarter fiscal 2016 results, wherein both top and bottom lines met our estimates and rose year-over-year. This marked the company’s ninth straight quarter of profit growth. Results gained from constant efforts toward upgrading its digital business, product enhancement and focus on enriching consumer experience. Also, continued strength in its AE and aerie brands fuelled results. However, management issued a soft fourth quarter outlook, where it expects flat to low single digit comps growth with earnings forecast also being muted. The drab view also hurt estimates. Additionally, currency risks stemming from global expansion, poses threats. Nonetheless, the company’s store rationalization plans, diligent inventory management and cost-control efforts bode well." (12/22/2016)
