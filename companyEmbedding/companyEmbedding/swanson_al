All One


All One believes that nutrients should be consumed in a powder or liquid form to ensure maximum absorption and nutrition. This family-owned company dates back to 1936 when James Ingoldsby created the first 100 mg vitamin C formula. Father and son (Doug Ingoldsby) worked together to start Nutritech in 1972, and in 1984 Doug started All One. Their formulas replace the handful of pills you might otherwise be taking while offering the same benefits. Their multiple vitamin plus mineral formulas offer complete nutrition, and they’ve created gluten free and vegan products for people with specific health needs.

 Do your own hunting for loss product
 "Swanson has sunk to the new low.  I had to push to give it a 2 rating I hope someone gets to read this before it is taken down with their app that destroys bad reviews.  I ordered vitamins 2 separate shipments.  They put the old address not used in over 4 years.  I got the emaill product delivered.  I looked . no product.  I informed swanson they sent to an old old address.  they immediately stated it was not their fault.  they took the address given by the paypal.  I use paypal frequently and have never had anything shipped to other address except where living.  Then they proceded to inform me for me to go find the boxes or get the house to send back the packages.  In other words, we messed up but you need to fix our mess up and forget you paid shipping charges and go find the boxes..  Beware when ordering from this company."

 Reliable and economical
 "I have bee a Swanson customer for many years. Prices are good to begin with, and it isn't hard to find discounts. The product selection is more than adequate, although not every single item I want can be had there. I usually order enough items that shipping is free. I cannot recall any problems with them. I truly am a bit puzzled by so many negative reviews. "

 Swanson has free shipping, I just placed an order. 
 "I have used them for years. The 20% order with the perfect food by Garden of Life around $40. I never had any shipping problems as there is a Middletown Pa. Warehouse. Regarding the shipping -the items ship fast and free shipping above $40   the money back guarantees if your not satisfied some of the best in the business.My experience with Swanson Vitamins is complete opposite of what people here post and I am happy with this company. Hope this helps,  God bless. "

 Swanson? Never again!
 "I placed my order around 4 April 2017. It was ok but then I received mail asking for my authorization code or else my order would be canceled. After I got it from my bank I passed it on. My "pending" order has been "confirmed".  Then I received tracking notice for my package. According to that, my shipment arrived at the destination country 16 April and will be  delivered shortly but as of 20 April it hasn't. So I called the delivery company and was told I can only expect my package around 4 May. This is ridiculous and stressful. Funny thing is we buy supplements for good health but the experience is detrimental to my health.Comparably, I am a loyal iHerb customer and I receive my packages within 4 to 5 days. I need not take the trouble to liaise with my bank after I place my orders. Cost I pay for speedy delivery is like half what I am paying Swanson for "snail-mail". Wallah, am I am yet to test the efficacy of their products. Even before that, my gut feeling is "never again" insofar as this company is concerned. Never again!"

 Runaround Rap
 "On Dec. 15th I ordered Avocado oil from Swanson for $12.98. They informed me that theywere out of stock. So they sent me a refund check for $12.98. I deposited it in my bank onlyto find out that the check that they sent me, bounced. I called them about it only to find outthat they told me that it was cashed, and that I was to check with my bank. The bank told methat the check brand, or holder was not honored, and that I was to go back to Swanson for acheck reissue. When I called Swanson, they told me that it was cashed.I told them that they are liers, and rip off artists. I never saw the $12.98 It took two monthsto try and resolve this issue, which it still is unsolved.This was a very bad experience for me. I now do business with Nutrition Express.New Swanson customers beware!"

 Failed some  tests at consumer testing lab. Some products contaminated with lead.....
 "Before purchasing from them, I would look at how many of their products failed at the consumer testing labs.  I have ordered from them before seeing this myself.  I had no problems with the product I ordered, but now these results do give me pause.https://www.consumerlab.com/Search/Swanson-Review"

 More Expensive than Puritan's Pride but better quality
 "You get what you pay for. They are a bit pricier than NBTY and Puritan Pride but I swear the quality is better. But then again who really knows with Vitamins. "

 "Swanson proudly declares on a screen pop-up "We ship to you" with a UK flag displayed. Nothing is stated there about UK customs charges, only a "learn more" button, no clue about where that leads. The standard shipping charge itself is modest, but when your item fails to arrive and you contact them, only then do you learn that UK customs is hold the shipment, demanding about 50% of the purchase price in duty and taxes.  I asked them to refund the purchase price and customs charges but they flatly refused, stating "every single website that ships internationally, and it is the customer's responsibility to read the terms and conditions that apply to them," even comparing it to reading the fine print on car insurance policies. They couldn't care less about customer service or loyalty. A rip off. Don't order from Swanson, find a UK supplier or one that does not hide these charges.   "

 "Swanson is notorious for charging excess fees (aka "shipping costs") to get their products to you faster.  How much do they charge?  $7.98, outrageous.  Vitacost does this for FREE.  Swanson "customer DISservice" people are quick to apologize for the cheap, deceptive practices used to delay your order by as much as four to five business days.  I will now purchase exclusively from Vitacost, and so should you.  No B.S., no delays, great prices and REAL customer service."

 "i have used some swanson products for several years and am pleased with them.  my complaint is i believe prices could be lowered or postage be free IF the catalog would be published less often.  i know i could do away with getting catalog except i like better than on line shopping.  also buy 1 get 1 is never on the products i would use.

 "I've ordered from swanson for years. I like their products, and I've tolerated the gradually increasing shipping times. Shipping used to be around 2 days, now its often closer to 2 weeks, but I just order early and I'm thankful for free shipping even if it takes a while.Last order, they didn't bother shipping it. I got a shipping confirmation & tracking number, which I kept checking and FedEx never received the package. Even followed up with FedEx on the phone, they said they had no record of my package.After a week, I emailed swanson to find out what was up. After several days of frustration with standard, pre-written email responses that didn't address my problem, I got an email that said they just checked my tracking and it's on its way; there's no problem. I check the tracking - they mailed it out this morning! - 11 days after my order, 9 days after the shipping "confirmation". BS. I order vitamins about 8-10 times a year. Business is going elsewhere now.If they took any responsibility for the error, this probably wouldn't have bothered me."

                        Swanson Health Products, Inc. has received 3.86 out of 5 stars based on 15 Customer Reviews and a BBB Rating of A+.
                        






                            Comprised of 67% BBB Rating and 33% Customer Review Rating.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating represents the customer's opinion of the business. The Customer Review
                            Rating percentages are based on the total number of positive, neutral, and negative reviews posted.
                        

                            The BBB letter grade represents the BBB's opinion of how the business is likely to interact with its customers.
                            The BBB grade is based on BBB file information about the business.
                            In some cases, a business' grade may be lowered if the BBB does not have sufficient
                            information about the business despite BBB's requests for that information from the business.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating plus the BBB Rating is not a guarantee of a business'
                            reliability or performance. BBB recommends that consumers consider a business'
                            BBB Rating and Customer Review Rating in addition to all other available information
                            about the business.

Swanson Health Products (SHP) is a natural health catalog and Internet marketing company headquartered in Fargo, North Dakota. The company sells natural health and wellness products, including health foods, dietary supplements such as vitamins, minerals, herbs, as well as natural personal care products direct to consumers through mail-order catalogs and an e-commerce website. Swanson Health Products is The United States' largest privately held vitamin catalog retailer and is one of Fargo’s major employers with an estimated workforce of 500 employees.[1]

History[edit]
Swanson Health Products was started in 1969 in Fargo by Leland Swanson Sr. A self-taught natural health enthusiast, Swanson was heavily influenced by Dr. Linus Pauling, Dr. Irwin Stone, Dr. Roger J. Williams, Paul Bragg, and Adelle Davis, all pioneers in the natural health and nutraceutical movement.
Swanson’s personal supplementation regimen began with vitamin E, which he ordered from one of the first health supplement outlets in the country, Sturdee Health Products,[2] the nation’s oldest mail order vitamin supplier at the time. By 1968 he was a regular user of several vitamins and supplements and began ordering them in bulk to maintain his own supply. Not long after he decided to test the market himself and ordered 5,000 vitamin E capsules from a manufacturer in Ohio, purchased an advertisement in Capper’s Weekly Magazine and began selling supplements through the mail. Shortly thereafter, he was putting together small catalogs of his own to mail out to potential customers.
By 1980, SHP was operating with about 10 employees out of a storefront in downtown Fargo, ND. In 1982 the company moved its mail order manufacturing and shipping operations to a 15,000 sq ft (1,400 m2) facility. In the 1990s, the development of the SHP website, swansonvitamins.com, opened another sales channel for the company. SHP moved into a new 120,000 sq ft (11,000 m2) facility in 2001, finally housing its call center, customer care center, marketing, manufacturing, storage and shipping operations all under one roof, while still maintaining the original storefront in downtown Fargo.
In 2009, SHP announced a $10 million, 100,000-square-foot (9,300 m2) addition to the company’s headquarters in Fargo, as well as the acquisition of a 50,000-square-foot (4,600 m2) order fulfillment center in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania,[3] to improve shipping times to east coast customers. That facility opened in May 2010, while the Fargo expansion was completed in August 2010. The Harrisburg facility relocated to nearby Middletown, PA, in 2014.
In April 2011, SHP announced the opening of a second regional distribution center. The 52,500-square-foot facility,[4] located in the Spanish Springs Business Center of Sparks, NV, allows for one- or two-day delivery times to customers on the west coast.
Also in 2011, the Swanson Health Products’ retail store acquired the business space adjacent to its location in downtown Fargo, ND.[5] Final renovations and remodeling, completed in the fall of 2011, have doubled its retail space and now includes more freezer and refrigeration space for healthy foods.
With all sites now completed and operational, the company employs over 500 people.
In January 2016, Leland Swanson, Jr. retired and SHP was acquired by Swander Pace Capital,[6] a private equity firm specializing in investments in growth-oriented, middle-market consumer products companies. Leland Swanson, Jr. remains involved as a consultant for SHP new product development.
Products and quality control[edit]
Swanson Health Products carries over 26,000 products, ranging from vitamins and supplements to "eco-friendly" home cleaning products. The company has more than 20 Swanson-branded lines that cover the full spectrum of natural health products, as well as some OTC drugs and organic foods. Since 2001, SHP has voluntarily participated in independent third-party Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) audits to maintain high-quality finished products. SHP regularly submits its dietary supplements to ConsumerLab.com testing for a thorough, third-party review of product safety and efficacy. Consumer lab has tested only 25 of Swanson's 26,000+ supplements as of 9/8/2016. In yearly surveys of over 10,000 supplement users, Swanson Health Products was voted America’s #1 rated catalog/Internet brand based on customer satisfaction (2012, 2014, 2015) and #1 rated catalog/Internet merchant (2011, 2013, 2014, 2015).[7]
FDA actions[edit]
Swanson Health Products has had a few encounters with the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which oversees the natural health industry’s marketing and labeling of dietary supplements to ensure they are not labeled as unapproved drugs. Most recently, in 2007 SHP received a warning letter from the FDA stating that the company was selling an unapproved version of the prescription cholesterol drug called Mevacor.[8] FDA laboratory analysis determined that two of SHP’s red yeast rice supplements contained significant amounts of lovastatin, the active ingredient in Mevacor and its generic counterparts. The FDA letter stated, “Because Red Yeast Rice and Red Yeast Rice/Policosanol Complex contain red yeast rice with enhanced or added lovastatin and bear claims about lipid control and other cardiovascular benefits supplied by this ingredient, they cannot be marketed as dietary supplements.”

Swanson Health Products was started in 1969 in Fargo by Leland Swanson Sr. A self-taught natural health enthusiast, Swanson was heavily influenced by Dr. Linus Pauling, Dr. Irwin Stone, Dr. Roger J. Williams, Paul Bragg, and Adelle Davis, all pioneers in the natural health and nutraceutical movement.
Swanson’s personal supplementation regimen began with vitamin E, which he ordered from one of the first health supplement outlets in the country, Sturdee Health Products,[2] the nation’s oldest mail order vitamin supplier at the time. By 1968 he was a regular user of several vitamins and supplements and began ordering them in bulk to maintain his own supply. Not long after he decided to test the market himself and ordered 5,000 vitamin E capsules from a manufacturer in Ohio, purchased an advertisement in Capper’s Weekly Magazine and began selling supplements through the mail. Shortly thereafter, he was putting together small catalogs of his own to mail out to potential customers.
By 1980, SHP was operating with about 10 employees out of a storefront in downtown Fargo, ND. In 1982 the company moved its mail order manufacturing and shipping operations to a 15,000 sq ft (1,400 m2) facility. In the 1990s, the development of the SHP website, swansonvitamins.com, opened another sales channel for the company. SHP moved into a new 120,000 sq ft (11,000 m2) facility in 2001, finally housing its call center, customer care center, marketing, manufacturing, storage and shipping operations all under one roof, while still maintaining the original storefront in downtown Fargo.
In 2009, SHP announced a $10 million, 100,000-square-foot (9,300 m2) addition to the company’s headquarters in Fargo, as well as the acquisition of a 50,000-square-foot (4,600 m2) order fulfillment center in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania,[3] to improve shipping times to east coast customers. That facility opened in May 2010, while the Fargo expansion was completed in August 2010. The Harrisburg facility relocated to nearby Middletown, PA, in 2014.
In April 2011, SHP announced the opening of a second regional distribution center. The 52,500-square-foot facility,[4] located in the Spanish Springs Business Center of Sparks, NV, allows for one- or two-day delivery times to customers on the west coast.
Also in 2011, the Swanson Health Products’ retail store acquired the business space adjacent to its location in downtown Fargo, ND.[5] Final renovations and remodeling, completed in the fall of 2011, have doubled its retail space and now includes more freezer and refrigeration space for healthy foods.
With all sites now completed and operational, the company employs over 500 people.
In January 2016, Leland Swanson, Jr. retired and SHP was acquired by Swander Pace Capital,[6] a private equity firm specializing in investments in growth-oriented, middle-market consumer products companies. Leland Swanson, Jr. remains involved as a consultant for SHP new product development.
Products and quality control[edit]
Swanson Health Products carries over 26,000 products, ranging from vitamins and supplements to "eco-friendly" home cleaning products. The company has more than 20 Swanson-branded lines that cover the full spectrum of natural health products, as well as some OTC drugs and organic foods. Since 2001, SHP has voluntarily participated in independent third-party Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) audits to maintain high-quality finished products. SHP regularly submits its dietary supplements to ConsumerLab.com testing for a thorough, third-party review of product safety and efficacy. Consumer lab has tested only 25 of Swanson's 26,000+ supplements as of 9/8/2016. In yearly surveys of over 10,000 supplement users, Swanson Health Products was voted America’s #1 rated catalog/Internet brand based on customer satisfaction (2012, 2014, 2015) and #1 rated catalog/Internet merchant (2011, 2013, 2014, 2015).[7]
FDA actions[edit]
Swanson Health Products has had a few encounters with the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which oversees the natural health industry’s marketing and labeling of dietary supplements to ensure they are not labeled as unapproved drugs. Most recently, in 2007 SHP received a warning letter from the FDA stating that the company was selling an unapproved version of the prescription cholesterol drug called Mevacor.[8] FDA laboratory analysis determined that two of SHP’s red yeast rice supplements contained significant amounts of lovastatin, the active ingredient in Mevacor and its generic counterparts. The FDA letter stated, “Because Red Yeast Rice and Red Yeast Rice/Policosanol Complex contain red yeast rice with enhanced or added lovastatin and bear claims about lipid control and other cardiovascular benefits supplied by this ingredient, they cannot be marketed as dietary supplements.”

CAN WE TRUST TRUSTPILOT?  Is TP being duped by swanson competitors?


                I WANT TO KNOW WHO IS POSTING ALL THE NEGATIVE REVIEWS ON TRUSTPILOT?  I HAVE USED SWANSONSVITAMINS.COM FOR OVER 10 YEARS.  **I HAVE NEVER HAD  SLOW DELIVERY OR BEEN OVERCHARGED FOR SHIPPING. PEOPLE HERE COMPLAIN OVER AND OVER ABOUT SLOW POOR SERVICE!   THIS IS UNBELIEVEABLE !!I always found the shipping to be fast!  I never needed expedited shipping as all my orders arrived in a few days only.  I owe Swansons nothing and have used puritans pride lately. HOWEVER, it looks to me like someone is posting LIES about Swanson's here!  If over 10 years I NEVER had an issue how can so many "names" posted her claim all these problems?  -- I would like to see TrustPilot evaluate this issue and let us users know if someone has been paying off posters to make Swanson look bad. Also their Customer service was Always Excellent. THANK YOU FOR YOUR INTEREST TRUSTPILOT....  Dr Joe Ross

                    Hi there Jim!Oh shoot! I'm sorry to hear the carrier cannot make up their mind on an exact delivery date. We always want to make sure our customer's receive their packages! If you don't get your order within the allowed business days for the Shipment Method selected, we will always take immediate action in filling an investigation with the carrier and getting you your order as quickly as possible. As it sounds like you still have not received your order and it's possibly been past the business days we allow, I certainly welcome you to contact our Customer Care Department to settle this matter. Email Address: customercare@swansonvitamins.com Phone Number: 1-800-437-4148I'm looking forward to a resolution. Nicole

Called to get some background …


                Called to get some background information on Swanson Vitamins inulin product. Yesterday I had an informative conversation with Katie in the product information department. I wanted to make note of some of the information that she cited. I was in the car, told her that I would call her back today when I would be able to write it down. Today I have gotten a complete rebuff. I was told that contractually they cannot provide that information to their customers. Update: a supervisor reached out and answered my questions. He expressed concern that I had already posted a negative review. Worth noting that Swanson responds when the threat of a review is on the table.

Extremely Slow Delivery


                I have ordered various products from Swanson over the years, and have generally been satisfied.  But from now on, I will try to avoid Swanson.  I ordered my products on a Monday, and did not receive my order until a week from the following Friday (12 days, including the day of the order).  That included a weekend and Memorial Day.  They promise to deliver within 5 to 8 business days.  From PA to NC took 9 business days.  What you will find is that the pick up is by Fed Ex.  Fed Ex then delivers the product to the US Postal Service (which was done by Friday), and the Postal Service delivers the product.  This is way too long for an order to be delivered.  And the gel caps got so hot during delivery that they were melted into a big chunk.  I had to pick them apart.  Delivery from PA to NC should have been much quicker.  And your product sitting around in hot trucks for such a long time will only decrease their potency.  So, if you want your products quickly, don't order from Swanson.  They only have their eyes on the financial bottom line.  I have also found that some of their supplements are not standardized at all, and are just ground up herbs, which gives you very little useful value.**I contacted Swanson as suggested in their reply that they 'want to make this right'.  I was told that they would give me a $5 credit on my next order for my trouble.  When I did not accept this generous offer, I got a snappy e-mail on how I should count the shipping days.  Avoid this company if at all possible!  They are poison, and their products are of very poor quality.

Swanson Vitamins short amount of vitamins in each bottle....


                I ordered some vitamins from Swanson which were suppose to have 100 vitamins in each bottle. 2 of the bottles looked almost empty. I opened them and counted the vitamins inside. One bottle had 26 pills and the other bottle had 56 pills. I called Swanson and they said they would send out 2 more bottles with the correct amount for no charge. Then they turn around and charged my Paypal account an additional $8.95. I am now disputing this charge with Paypal and I do not know how they took more money out of my Paypal account without my authorization. I will not be buying Vitamins from swanson vitamins again.

Got my first order today


                Got my first order today. I am being trusting of the quality of the ingredients, there would be no way for me to know if it is of good quality. I guess we shall see how my joints feel after a I start my boswellia & curcumin and turmeric & ginger routine.Very fast shipping. The price is great.I hope to do more business with you, Swanson Vitamins

I've read through the reviews and …


                Not sure what other people are talking about, I have never had a problem with shipping and I've used their services close to 50 times. Also check out a website called LABDOOR, they third party test well known companies vitamins.

Company decline


                The two stars are for the past customer service being good and the quality and prices of the products.The three missing stars is due to the decline in customer service, less sales promotions & coupons, and prices sometimes being different in the incognito window than a regular one. I've ordered from this company for many years now. I began ordering from them back when they had a mail catalog prior to internet ordering. They've always had quality products at great prices. Their shipping used to be slightly faster but it is still reasonable. Their customer service used to be very nice and accommodating.I've though had a few issues with this company over the last few years. Maybe it's due to increased competition or outsourcing, I'm unsure.The online chat is a joke. Their workers know no more about the products than is posted in the description of each one so why even bother to have the live chat?They also throw in similar products when searching for something specific. I don't know why, maybe an attempt at a bait & switch. One time they sent me the wrong item and I complained. Their customer service rep had the nerve to tell me that they had software which could tell what the customers were shopping for/clicking on/whatever, suggesting that I was lying. If it was a product I wanted then I wouldn't have complained. I informed the company. I almost never ordered from them again. They though apologized and offered a coupon to cover the shipping of a future order. I conceded that we all have bad days and again ordered from the company. I hadn't had any more issues until very recently when a promised promotion wouldn't apply on a Sunday. I was assured via live chat that it would be applied to my account and I kept a copy of the chat. I was sent an invoice for the full price. I complained. They corrected it and said that the worker would be better briefed on how to handle such a situation. I overreacted but this company used to have such better service.They're promotions and coupons have also seemed to have lessened throughout the years. I will probably try them again, well one more time but that is it if any more issues arise.We don't need any Swanson Vitamins' reps answering each of these complaints. What we need is for the company to put those people to better use at making an overall better company. Apologies don't matter if mistakes are repeated over and over again.

Good quality vitamins


                Good quality vitamins, never had a problem with ordering but the new arrivals could come up a little quicker. It does not seem to be updated all that frequently.

Second Order Takes Forever to Deliver!!! Frustrating


                My order #58125035 takes forever to be delivered. Now on third week of waiting and was told that they can only investigate by 12 May, when ordering only took place last 26 March! This is frustrating because during check-out DHL priority was paid and chosen and delivery time states 7 days and they already took the payment from my debit card.Expect more negative reviews, Swanson.

Ordering for years!!! HAPPY


                I have been ordering from Swanson for years!!! 14 years+. I heard about them from my dad who was a Swanson believer. My family has always leaned toward natural products and vitamins and we have always been satisfied with them. I started out just buying the name brands I liked- Now, Myers, alba to name a few. I slowly stared ordering the Swanson product label and have been impressed. I trust their label a lot. Now that I'm in my mid 30s and social media has exploded with other health sites and food discount offerings like thrive that seem more trendy I still go to Swanson bc I know I can get a great deal and QUALITY. A few times shampoos and or body washes have come broken, but I called and they took care of it immediately. Friendly too! I never like to make those phone calls and they were very kind and understanding. They do have good packaging and do everything possible to make sure things don't spill. For example tape on the lids and seacuring in individual bags. Shipping is slow to where I am. But I really don't mind. A week is ok to wait- it's free. Sign up for emails as that's when I get a little extra off so I like to get a little more. All in all I will always shop with Swanson as long as they are around. They are a well established USA company. Thank you!!!Healthy Millennial

Good shopping experience every time.


                The site is easy-to-use. An excellent variety of product choices is offered. Items I want have always been in stock, and the prices are often lower than elsewhere. I've found that some of their prices are higher than Pure Formulas, and they do require a $50 minimum purchase to get free shipping. (No minimum needed for free shipping at Pure Formulas.) Shipping is fast within the U.S. Packages are well-packed. Items are super fresh. Their own brand of supplements are of superior quality and very reasonably priced. The ones I've bought have been even better than I hoped. I think a lot of care goes into the manufacturing process for the quality to be so consistently outstanding. My most recent order was at the end of November 2016. All my orders have been filled without any glitches. Customer service is responsive if you have questions.

Great site to discover new products.


                Swanson Vitamins is a great site for your personal food and cosmetics. They promptly refund money for the products you are dissatisfied. I discovered lot of new products which I would have never found otherwise. Their own brands of products are also good like the Blue Cream and their teeth whitening toothpaste, etc. I skipped the 5th star rating for the pricing, else everything is fine here.

Good prices and very fast shipping in USA but . . .


                Pros-they have good prices, especially if you agree to get their coupon and sale e-mails (often it's up to 20% off). They have a lot of good brands, although not that many professional brands (note: most if not all of the professional brands are not discounted). For those in the USA, it's easy to qualify for free shipping and if you don't, it is still low cost compared to many places. The free USA shipping was really fast when we were there (western USA), often just two days after ordering, but hardly ever more than a week.  They have a generous return policy in the USA if a product you buy is not satisfactory.  They have their own product lines. If you like them, you can save a lot of money. Several of these products we really like (such as the Himalayan salt & liquid magnesium oil) but others have a lot of fillers we don't like, so read the labels if you care about that. Cons-They really want you to post product reviews, but when we tried to post a less than good review on a product we bought from them,  (because it seemed to contain a high amount of heavy metal) they blocked it. We rewrote it to be less specific several times but it was not accepted. It seems very difficult to post a negative review on something they sell, which makes their entire collection of good reviews very suspect. That product still had only positive excellent reviews last time we checked; it feels fraudulent. We wonder how many other negative reviews they have rejected for that product (and others).  This one really bugs us. The more you order, the less generous the coupon offers become through time. Because we ordered a lot in 2015,  now we have to spend twice as much (for example $150 versus $75) to get the same 20% discount as friends and family who made just a few small orders in 2015. A really nice way to reward your better customers. Not! Because of this marketing tactic, we have shifted a lot of our business to Vitacost, Pure Formulas, My Health-Store and others. Still, recommend them. Just watch for the better sale coupons, read the labels if you are buying their brands and care about not-healthy flllers, and don't put too much stock in all the positive reviews of products on their site. For more honest feedback about individual products, go to Amazon, Yelp, or a place where the reviews are not selectively chosen and controlled by Swanson.

Deceptive Shipping Practices and Fees


                When ordering from Swanson, you are given several choices for shipping fees and times.....$4.99,  $7.99,  etc.  I chose the $7.99 'expedited' shipping for my last order and guess what,  it was shipped within the exact same time frame and using the exact same shipping method as their standard $4.99 shipping.  The only difference was the extra shipping charge!  This is dishonest and a deceptive tactic by Swanson, and i will never use them again.  Back to iHerb!

I brought that to attention several times and looks that there is very slow reaction to fix quickly, sometimes it takes  a week to be operational fully.Delivery offered by Landmark is slow and takes longer time then estimated and expected.Swansonvitamins  is not very operative regarding this matter but instead offers another courier which is more expensive.That should not be a solution but rather finding another yet low cost courier who is working diligently and keep own estimate time of delivery scheduled. Therefore Swansonvitamins is not working effectively towards own customers but rather choosing somewhat arrogant approach and trying to ignore complains on delivery time by only offering other more expensive courier.

                    Hello Richard. This is Nicole at Swanson Health Products. I certainly hear what you are saying and I value your opinion. Thank you for your review. This is definitely an opportunity to improve our shipping timeframes.

Poor Service, Incredibly Slow Shipping


                I have been a customer for several years and the customer service, processing and shipping of orders has continually gone downhill to the point of ridiculousness. This is the 21st century for goodness sake and it seems they have regressed to having their orders shipped by pony express!  The last 4 orders I placed took over 2 weeks to process and ship and arrive and that was with me paying extra for expedited shipping!!  Do not order from them if you need anything in a timely manner.My last order was placed 4 days ago and is still "processing". It hasn't even been packed up to ship or acknowledged (I've yet to receive an email confirmation for my order although the website shows I have an order "processing") - the order is just sitting in cyberspace (or the warehouse) or somewhere although no one can explain why.  I've called customer service and have spoken to 3 different "reps" which has been just like a scene from "Who's on First?". They are all powerless to explain or to fix the problem and just pass the buck to the warehouse. The magical warehouse  is apparently an island unto itself and I've been told by the "reps" that they cannot contact the warehouse.. So we are at the mercy of "the warehouse" which has no phone and is unreachable? Do the owners of the company know that? Do they care?  How ridiculous is that? I say the company should take back control!  I am tired of their lame excuses. This time one rep said it was because of Black Friday (although it was not Black Friday when I placed my order and even if it had been, it's the SAME time each year, they run sales HOPING for lots of orders, so they should be PREPARED for those orders!) One said their system had a glitch, and one even had the courage to say I shouldn't expect quick service from them any longer! She had received several calls from others about the same problem.  Swanson is clearly NOT listening to its customers and obviously doesn't care.   There are plenty of other companies who are more than eager for our business and our dollars and who care about their customers.  Until Swanson gets its act together, I will be utilizing those other companies. I really hope they will get back to being the company they were a few years ago.

Great experience


                It does take a bit for delivery. It took my order a week to come to Georgia, which I don't think is bad since I paid for standard delivery. Everything was in my order and I didn't have any problems. They have a vast selection and their prices are GREAT compared to other sites I've seen.

Not competitive any longer


                I am a long time Swanson client and as of the last year I see the prices increasing exponentially at Swanson's versus the competition as much as 10-30%.  Yes they offer 'discounts' like 15%, 20% BOGO but still after the discount their prices are still way higher than the competition.  I recommend to compare prices against Piping Rock, Vitacost, Puritan Pride and other supplement sellers before buying from them even with a 20% discount.  Don't fall for gimmick sales like BOGOs, $15 off $75, 20% off etc. Those are only to throw you off.  Simply calculate what you are getting for your money in (cents per  milligram) value and you will see the bottom line you are paying.  You will find that the competition offers better pricing and value.  I keep buying less and less from them and more from the competitors over the last year or so.  If this price increase continues going forward I will not buy anything from Swanson's anymore.   That's one way to price yourself out of the competition!

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
