Separation Strategy















Symantec to Separate Into Two Focused, Industry-Leading Technology Companies








































































Share:






On August 11, 2015 – Symantec announced that it has entered into a definitive agreement to sell its Veritas information management business to The Carlyle Group, a global investment firm with a strong track record of growing businesses. Upon completion of the sale, expected to close at the end of the year, Veritas will become a privately held company. This development will give both Symantec and the Veritas business the financial wherewithal to accelerate the execution of their respective strategies and bring innovation to market sooner for our partners and customers.
 
"Taking this decisive step forward will enable each business to maximize its potential. Both businesses will have substantial operational and financial scale to thrive."
–Michael A. Brown
