Our Philosophy 






















Pettyjohn, Wood & White, Inc.Trusted Investment Portfolio Management Advisors
Our Philosophy
National D-Day Memorial – Bedford, VA
Pettyjohn, Wood & White, Inc. seeks to provide our clients with a high level of service and customization by limiting our total number of client relationships.  Portfolios are tailored to each individual client’s unique risk profile and objectives.  
The Firm manages advisory accounts on a discretionary basis.  With individually managed accounts, portfolios typically include direct ownership of individual equities and investment grade fixed income securities. For other accounts, which may be smaller in size, client portfolios may consist of mutual funds or exchange traded funds in the interest of cost efficiency and diversification.
Our team-based investment process is grounded in a commitment to quality in our security selection and an unwavering adherence to our strict risk management disciplines.  This process breeds a culture of accountability and responsibility in how each relationship is managed.

Supporting Lynchburg Kids & Pros Camp
Pettyjohn, Wood & White joined several local businesses as a sponsor for this camp held at E.C. Glass High School. The camp is free to children and is being attended by a large number of youngsters from the Boys & Girls Club and the Jubilee Family Development Center. The camp teaches football fundamentals but is also heavy on life lessons and responsibility. Below, are two notes of thanks from parents who valued this unique camp experience.
2014 Lynchburg Camp

Our boys participated in the Lynchburg Kids N Pros for the first time last year. My husband and I were so impressed by not only the athletic professionalism, but also the life lesson messages conveyed by the pros. It was so consistent with the ones we have been delivering; to have it supported by the pros made it so much more of an impact to our boys. This camp continues to be an amazing “not-to-be-missed” experience for our boys and we will continue to look forward to it for years to come. Thank you for making it available to the Lynchburg area!
– Beth France, 6/24/14


The Kids N Pros camp is a very good way to teach our young children the fundamentals of football while incorporating the emphasis of staying safe. I thoroughly enjoyed the session of Heads Up with speakers Dr. Diminick and the representative from Riddell. The testimonial speech by one of the football players helps give the children the desire and inspiration to achieve great things in life. I have nothing negative to say about this camp. I will be one of the first people to sign my children up next year if there is another camp.
– Shirley Johnson, 6/24/14
