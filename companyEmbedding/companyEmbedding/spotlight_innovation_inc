ZIKA VIRUS INFECTION
Click the image above to watch Prof. Tang and his team discuss their small molecule screening program
Spotlight Innovation has obtained from the Florida State University Research Foundation exclusive, worldwide rights to develop and commercialize certain compounds for the treatment of viral infections, including Zika virus (ZIKV) infection. Included among the licensed compounds are those identified in a study co-authored by Florida State University Professor Hengli Tang that was published in Nature Medicine on August 29, 2016. The study reported two classes of compounds: one that protects Zika virus-infected neural cells from programmed cell death (“apoptosis”) and another that directly inhibits Zika virus replication. According to the study, when used in combination, compounds from the two classes enhanced the neuroprotective effect. In March 2016, Prof. Tang co-authored a study published in Cell Stem Cell that demonstrated for the first time the ability of ZIKV to target human embryonic cortical neural progenitor cells. Prof. Tang and his research team collaborate with Spotlight Innovation as part of an existing sponsored research agreement (SRA), and he is a member of the Company’s Scientific Advisory Board.

SPINAL MUSCULAR ATROPHY
Spotlight Innovation has obtained an exclusive, worldwide license from Indiana University Research and Technology Corp. to commercialize STL-182, an orally-available small molecule that may have therapeutic potential for treating Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA). SMA is an autosomal recessive disorder that is a leading genetic cause of death in infants and toddlers. Spinal Muscular Atrophy affects between 1 in 6,000 and 1 in 10,000 newborns. Approximately 1 in 40 to 1 in 50 adults have only a single intact spinal motor neuron 1 (SMN1) gene, which encodes a protein (SMN) required for proper neuromuscular function. An infant who inherits no intact SMN1 gene from either parent may develop SMA and lose the ability to sit, stand, walk, swallow, and/or breathe. In about 60% of cases, patients with SMA die by age two.
