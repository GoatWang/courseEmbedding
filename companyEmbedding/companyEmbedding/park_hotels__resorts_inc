MCLEAN, Va.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--As Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc. (NYSE: HLT) (“Hilton”) prepares to 
      spin off the bulk of its real estate and timeshare businesses into two 
      separate publicly traded companies, the company is proud to introduce 
      the expected members of the Board of Directors of Park Hotels & Resorts 
      Inc. ("Park"). After a comprehensive review of personal and professional 
      qualifications, directors were chosen based upon the specific needs of 
      Park.
    

      Upon completion of the spin-off, expected at or around year-end, Park 
      will be one of the largest lodging real estate companies, with a diverse 
      portfolio of iconic and market-leading hotels and resorts with 
      significant underlying real estate value. The portfolio will consist of 
      67 premium-branded hotels and resorts with over 35,000 rooms located in 
      prime U.S. and international markets with high barriers to entry.
    

      Hilton will continue to be led by the current president and chief 
      executive officer (CEO), Christopher J. Nassetta. At this time, there 
      are no planned changes to the Hilton Board of Directors as a result of 
      the spin-off.
    

      Thomas J. Baltimore, Jr., who was appointed to the position of president 
      and CEO in April 2016, will lead Park and is expected to serve as 
      chairman of the Board of Directors. The Park Board will go into effect 
      upon completion of the spin-off.
    

      Following the previously 
      announced equity investment by HNA Group in Hilton, HNA Group will 
      maintain both its stockholders agreement and equity in Park upon 
      completion of the transaction, which is expected to close in the first 
      quarter of 2017.
    

      “The Board of Directors for Park Hotels & Resorts will comprise industry 
      leaders with complementary experience who understand how to govern a 
      public company,” said Christopher J. Nassetta, president and CEO, 
      Hilton. “I am thrilled with the caliber of individuals selected, and I 
      believe they will help position Park for success as an independent 
      organization.”
    

      “This is an important milestone for Park Hotels & Resorts as we prepare 
      to spin-off from Hilton,” added Thomas J. Baltimore, Jr., president and 
      CEO, Park Hotels & Resorts. “The assembled directors have the business 
      acumen and significant experience necessary to support Park’s long-term 
      strategy. I look forward to working with the Board to deliver long-term 
      value to our shareholders.”
    

      The Park Hotels & Resorts Board of Directors is expected to include:
    

Thomas J. Baltimore, Jr.


      Baltimore will be the chairman, president and chief executive officer of 
      Park Hotels & Resorts Inc. Baltimore most recently served as the 
      president and chief executive officer of RLJ Lodging Trust and as a 
      member of its board of trustees from January 2011 to May 2016. Prior to 
      that, Baltimore co-founded RLJ Development and served as its president 
      from 2000 to 2011. Previously, Baltimore served as vice president of 
      gaming acquisitions of Hilton Hotels Corporation and later as vice 
      president of development and finance. Baltimore also worked previously 
      in various management positions with Marriott Corporation and Host 
      Marriott Services Corporation. Baltimore serves as a director of 
      Prudential Financial, Inc. and Duke Realty Corporation.

      Bedient is the retired executive vice president and chief financial 
      officer of Weyerhaeuser Co., one of the world’s largest integrated 
      forest products companies. Bedient joined Weyerhauser in 2003, and 
      served in various roles including senior vice president, finance and 
      strategic planning during her tenure. Prior to joining Weyerhauser,

Hilton's Real Estate Spinoff Creates Park Hotels & Resorts – Skift

Hilton’s Real Estate Spinoff Creates Park Hotels & Resorts

Skift Take

No doubt Hilton’s shareholders, especially its largest one Blackstone, are pretty happy about this.

Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc. said the planned spinoff of its real estate will create a company, to be called Park Hotels & Resorts, that will be the second-largest publicly traded real estate investment trust in the lodgings industry.
The newly formed entity, which will contain most of Hilton’s properties, will have earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization of as much as $825 million in 2016, Hilton said in a statement on Thursday. In 2015, the unit had adjusted EBITDA of $817 million.
Hilton said in February it will spin off its lodging properties and timeshare business to create three separate, publicly traded companies in order to boost shareholder value as the hotel operator faces increased competition. One-time cash uses connected to the spinoffs will include a $250 million transaction expense, $200 million for a special dividend and $200 million for a tax acceleration.
“As a result of the proposed transactions, we expect to unlock growth opportunities that are embedded within the three businesses and take advantage of capital market and tax efficiencies,” Hilton Chief Executive Officer Chris Nassetta said in the statement.
On a stand-alone basis, Hilton’s pro-forma adjusted EBITDA for 2016 will be as much as $1.8 billion. The company will continue to pay out a dividend of 30 percent to 40 percent of recurring cash flow. Remaining free cash will be returned to shareholders and Hilton plans a share buyback once the spinoffs are completed.
Tax Free
The spinoffs of Park Hotels and Hilton’s time share business — named Hilton Grand Vacations — will be tax-free, according to the statement. Hilton’s main business of managing and franchising hotels will continue to exist under its current name. Hilton shareholders will own shares in all three entities once the deal is completed by the end of the year.
Hilton Grand Vacations, the timeshare unit, will have adjusted pro-forma EBITDA of as much as $390 million in 2016, the company said.
Hilton, based in McLean, Virginia, said it filed Form 10 registration statements with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for its timeshare and the bulk of its real state business on Thursday.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

Buy Park And Don't Pass Go - Park Hotels & Resorts Inc. (NYSE:PK) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»Buy Park And Don't Pass GoApr.18.17 | About: Park Hotels (PK) Brad Thomas Dividend growth investing, REITs, newsletter provider, valueMarketplaceREIT BeatSummaryStrong corporate earnings growth indicates that the current cycle hasn't reached the end of the road.I am seeking to invest in Lodging REITs, where I see significant upside.Park Hotels & Resorts also has the highest FFO growth forecasted.Its balance sheet and operating platform are well positioned to execute these larger transactions.The Lodging REIT sector is one of the most volatile REIT sectors, and as a result, REITs have historically underperformed the overall REIT market. The hotel REIT sector typically outperforms the REIT index (substantially) during periods of rising rates, but according to Floris van Dijkum, REIT analyst with Boenning & Scattergood, "that script hasn’t worked out so far this year." According to van Dijkum: Business demand that typically accounts for 75% of high-quality hotel demand should increase in 2017 due to stronger corporate profitability. Yet we forecast marginal sector earnings growth over the next two years given a more cautious outlook on demand combined with supply growth. During the past 3-year and 5-year periods, hotels underperformed the RMS by 17.2% and 8.7% respectively. During the last 1-year period, however, hotel REITs have outperformed RMS by 14.7%. 

 Strong corporate earnings growth indicates that the current cycle hasn't reached the end of the road. Corporate profits typically drive business demand, which is the largest demand driver for hotels at approximately 75%. 


 For high-quality hotels, approximately two-thirds of the business demand in U.S. hotels comes from transient (not booked under group rate), while group represents approximately a quarter of total hotel demand. REITs own around 17,000 hotels and 35,000 rooms, representing approximately 7% of the total number of rooms in the U.S. While this suggests that Lodging REITs have considerable opportunity to consolidate (and produce economies of scale), the limited liquidity in the sector is cause for enhanced volatility. Due to the choppy landscape surrounding the Lodging REIT sector (and limited liquidity attributes), I am maintaining a more cautious positioning. Specifically, I am seeking to invest in Lodging REITs where I see significant upside - a combination of high-quality and reliable dividend growth potential. Today, I am adding a new REIT to my "Intelligent REIT Lab," and as the title to my article suggests - Buy Park And Don't Pass Go - I am also adding this new REIT to my Durable Income Portfolio.

 Buy Park And Don't Pass Go Based in McLean, Virginia, Park Hotels & Resorts (NYSE:PK) was formed when Hilton Worldwide (NYSE:HLT) spun off most of its owned real estate into a separate public REIT. Park Hotels is the latest entrant into a sector long dominated by Host Hotels & Resorts Inc. (NYSE:HST), which still dwarfs all other stock exchange-listed hotel REITs in terms of size. Park Hotels had a market capitalization of nearly $5.3 billion (in early February), while Host's market cap was more than $13 billion at the time. 


 In a REIT.com article, Patrick Scholes, a lodging analyst at SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, said: Your typical hotel REIT tends to have a market capitalization of anywhere from $1 billion to $2 billion. Prior to the formation of Park Hotels, if you were a large-cap investor who needed liquidity, there was only one name in which you could invest, Host. Park Hotels owns a $9 billion portfolio of 67 large-scale, high-end hotels, including iconic properties stretching from coast to coast. Its trophy properties include the New York Hilton, which spans an entire city block in Midtown Manhattan; the landmark, 1,544-room Hilton Chicago Downtown, boasting nearly 200,000 square feet of meeting space; and the oceanfront, 2,860-room Hilton Hawaiian Village in Honolulu. 

 There is strong potential in the 35,000-room portfolio of upper-upscale and luxury hotels, and Park Hotels through acquisitions of like properties in leading hotel and resort markets, already has holdings in 14 of the top 25 U.S. hotel markets. 

 Park is one-brand concentrated right now, but the company says it "seeks brand and operator diversity over time." This is similar to what happened in 1993, after Marriott International (NYSE:MAR) spun off what is now Host Hotels. 


 The pictures below illustrate Park's diversified exposure to attractive markets: 

 Around 74% of Hotel EBITDA comes from coastal markets, and 91% of Hotel EBITDA is from Top 25 Markets and resort destinations: 

 While Park lacks diversified brand affiliations, the company mitigates the risk by owning such a diversified portfolio: 

 Its portfolio's strong group positioning increases visibility into forward bookings and reduces operating volatility by enhancing the stability and predictability of revenue throughout the lodging cycle. Top 25 Hotels: Group/Transient Mix: 31% / 63%. Park's strategy will be to "Group Up" and drive that mix up another 400bp to 35% Group demand. The portfolio contains 26 properties with over 25,000 sq. ft. of meeting space and 6 properties with over 125,000 sq. ft. of meeting space in top convention markets, generating robust corporate meeting and group business. Supply and demand trends favor large, group-oriented hotels for the foreseeable future. 


 Size and Scale of Park Creates Competitive Advantage  Park is the second-largest publicly traded Lodging REIT: 

 It Ranks Among the Top 25 Largest REITs 

 Iconic Assets Valued at Well Below Replacement Cost Park's assets are currently valued at a significant discount to replacement cost: 

 Growth through Disciplined Allocation The REIT's focus is on building a portfolio of Upper Upscale and Luxury branded assets in Top 25 markets and premium resort destinations. It pursues larger-scale deals (assets and portfolios) that offer significant value-add opportunities. The company seeks to diversify its brand (beyond Hilton) and operator mix to include other global manager / franchisors. Park will opportunistically recycle capital, selling out of slower-growth, non-core assets and reinvest in higher-growth markets. Less competition exists on larger transactions, as only a limited number of investors have access to the equity needed to pursue $250+ million single assets. 


 Consequently, the share of deals pre-empted and executed off-market increases in conjunction with deal size, thereby enhancing the price negotiation leverage for an eligible buyer. Park's balance sheet and operating platform are well positioned to execute these larger transactions. 

 The company intends to focus on owning hotels and resorts in the Luxury and Upper Upscale segments. Park focuses on recognizable products compared to independent hotels struggling to differentiate their offerings. Loyalty programs help to drive recurring sales, while lowering new customer acquisition costs. Hilton (~60 million members) and Marriott, including Starwood (NYSE:STWD) (~100 million members), have ~50% of sales stemming from customers within their loyalty programs. Park has the ability to achieve increased direct-to-consumer sales, minimizing OTA / wholesale commissions and increasing revenue to the company. This means significantly lower distribution costs for the OTA business, given the negotiating power of brands. Park can more effective compete against Airbnb (Private:AIRB), particularly with respect to frequent travelers, who appreciate the reliability and security of branded hotels. 

 Active Asset Management: Hands-on Approach Hilton continues to manage the vast majority of Park's properties it spun off. Oversight of operations under Park creates a system of checks and balances that should eventually translate into higher profits.
 Hilton, like most brand owners, doesn't have corporate oversight of property-level management to make sure they are maximizing profits for the owner. Park is able to maximize each asset's full potential through a focused approach on revenue management and cost containment initiatives, while purposefully addressing capital needs, including ROI opportunities. 

 CapEx: Over $1.3 Billion Has Been Reinvested in Park's Hotels Park has invested heavily to drive market share and ensure strong competitive positioning of its portfolio. The company continues to consistently renovate to adapt to evolving customer preferences and the latest technology. Renovations have been focused on guestroom design, open and activated lobby areas, food and beverage and public spaces, and modernized meeting spaces. Park creates value through repositioning select hotels across brands or chain scale segments, and exploring adaptive reuse opportunities for highest and best use. (No major deferred maintenance.) 

 The Balance Sheet  Park is extremely well capitalized with $214 million of unconsolidated JV debt (pro rata). The company is targeting an investment grade leverage profile over time. It has a healthy fixed versus floating mix: 74% fixed / 26% floating. Park has ample liquidity, with $183 million of unrestricted cash available as of 12/31/16 following the E&P dividend (cash portion of $110 million). In addition to cash, it has access to a $1 billion revolving credit facility, with minimal debt maturities.
 

 The REIT's absolute debt-to-EBITDA is at 3.6x, which is higher than the peer average (second-highest). Park is expected to refinance its largely CMBS debt to more traditional unsecured notes, as CMBS debt tends to be less flexible. Buy Park And Don't Pass Go  I have provided my initial review of Park Hotels & Resorts, and I have concluded that the company is attractive. I am initiating an immediate Buy recommendation. PK trades below the sector average FFO multiple of 10.3x, based on 2017 estimates (its peers include HST, Pebblebrook Hotel Trust (NYSE:PEB), and LaSalle Hotel Properties (NYSE:LHO)). 

 Here's a snapshot of Park's dividend yield compared with that of the peer group: 

 As you can see, it has an attractive dividend yield and also a modest AFFO payout ratio: 

 On January 9th, Park Hotels & Resorts declared a special dividend of $2.79 per share (the "E&P Dividend"), or approximately $551 million. The stock/cash component is expected to be split 80%/20%. On February 27th, the company declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.43/share, equating to a 6.5% dividend yield. Assuming a 65-70% FFO payout ratio and the mid-point of FFO guidance for 2017, the potential yield could be 7.1%, or 220bp above the Lodging REIT peers.
 Do you see why I am now suggesting to Buy Park And Don’t Pass Go? But wait, it also has the highest FFO growth forecasted, as illustrated below: 

 Similar to Realty Income (NYSE:O) in the Net Lease REIT sector, Park enjoys a similar size advantage (in the Lodging sector), as the company is able to enhance price negotiations by flexing its size and financial muscle. Its balance sheet and operating platform are well positioned to execute these larger transactions, and the company should be able to benefit from the continued consolidation within the lodging sector.

Worldwide Hotel Finder: Top Hotel Destinations
Popular Hotel Destinations in the Western U.S
When you book with Travelocity, the West Coast is your oyster. Enjoy the razzle and dazzle of fast-paced life in one of the big coastal cities, or pack up your ski equipment for the adventure of a lifetime. We offer a wide variety of accommodations to suit your tastes; rest in the penthouse suite of a five-star resort, or enjoy a home-cooked meal in a charming bed and breakfast. No matter where – or when – you want to get away, Travelocity is here to help you land the best deals swiftly and painlessly. Stop putting off that trip – adventure awaits.
The celebrities, the sports, the shopping… yes, you’ve heard stories of “Tinsel Town.” Isn’t it time for you to see if the tales are true? Check out Southern California’s allure for yourself when you book  hotels in Los Angeles.
Friend, they don’t call it “Sin City” for nothing. Cruise through the casinos, take a gondola ride, then rest up in Las Vegas hotels to do it all again in the morning. Or evening. Whatever suits you. 
Mark Twain once said the coldest winter he ever spent was a summer in San Francisco. You’ll have to judge the truth of that for yourself – and try the famous clam chowder at Pier 39 while you’re at it – when you book a night in our San Francisco hotels.
Next up, glide down the California coastline to the other city by the bay. No matter when you reserve San Diego hotels, you’ll enjoy year-round sunshine, beautiful beaches, and yes, those famous burritos. 
Move inland toward Colorado and relax in the capital city – our hotels in Denver will take care of all your worries. Book that ski trip, sample craft brews, or just find new ways to get elevated in the “Mile-High City.”

Book Hotel Rooms on the East Coast
The East Coast of the United States has much to offer the discerning traveler hungry for adventure and a delicious meal. From sky-high suites with stunning views to delightful hospitality and fresh-squeezed orange juice at a bed and breakfast, we have accommodation for all tastes. As for the food, well, your new city has plenty in store for you. 
Take a seat at a raw bar on the Boston waterfront and partake of refreshing oysters straight from the sea – the terroir of Cape Cod Bay is spectacular. Encounter living history on the Freedom Trail, or rendezvous with Rembrandt and Monet at the Museum of Fine Arts. Rest assured that Boston hotels will always be ready with a soft pillow where you can lay your head and dream of tomorrow’s plans. 
Journey west to hotels in New York City and discover the treasures of America’s most spectacular metropolis. From the morning sun shining on the Statue of Liberty to the sparkling lights of the skyline at night, there is nothing like the Big Apple. As Sinatra said, if you can make it here, you can make it anywhere. 
The great William Smith once extolled the virtues of another celebrated East Coast city: Philadelphia. Travelocity’s hotels in Philadelphia are the perfect place to relax after a day spent dining on signature cheesesteak and reveling in America’s most important historical landmarks. 
Philly may be the site of politics past, but Washington, D.C. hotels are where today’s mavens meet and mingle. Travelocity will have you keeping company with the nation’s brass and taking in some of the world’s greatest museums before you can say “Let’s do brunch.” 
If you’re looking for a different kind of charm, perhaps it’s Charlotte hotels you seek. Settle in with a homemade sweet tea and enjoy the Southern hospitality. Later, venture downtown and find a darkened lounge brimming over with sultry blues music. Your East Coast vacation is complete.

Top Hotels in America's Midwest
The Midwest is home to some of America’s most vibrant cities, with world-class attractions and mouthwatering treats for all tastes. When you book with Travelocity, you’ll spend less time searching and more time dreaming of ice skating on a winter’s eve or a warm, cheesy slice of deep-dish pizza. Whatever your desires, the Midwest is a must-see stop for any traveler. 
Let’s begin our journey in the birthplace of that delectable deep-dish pizza we mentioned. Chicago hotels are about much more than tempting tidbits. Promenade along Navy Pier for waterfront tableaus or take yourself upward, to the top of the Willis Tower for sweeping skyline views. 
Hotels in Detroit offer up a whole new world of attractions, from lovely strolls in the gorgeous Belle Isle Park to perusing masterpieces at the Institute of Arts. Of course, you can always simply immerse yourself in the sultry tunes of Motown. 
Yearning for a summer frolic through gardens of modern sculpture? Or a winter’s afternoon spent gliding along a frozen lake followed by a steaming cup of hot chocolate? Hotels in Minneapolis are your home away from home for year-round outdoor adventure – plus so much quintessential Midwestern charm, you’ll never want to leave. 
Slip south to hotels in St. Louis to dine on the city’s renowned smoky barbecue and melt-in-your-mouth gooey butter cake. Then cross state lines to Malcolm Martin Memorial Park in Illinois for a million-dollar view of the Gateway Arch. 
If you like to spend your getaways wandering amongst quaint village enclaves with nary an itinerary in sight, Columbus hotels are your ideal match. Amble through historic architecture and urban gardens in the German Village neighborhood, then let butterflies alight on your shoulders at the Franklin Park Conservatory. In America’s Midwest, no dream goes unfulfilled – and no treasures go undiscovered when you let Travelocity be your guide.

Hotel Deals in Southern United States
Where do you find your travel inspiration? Is it in the enticing flavors of a new and exciting cuisine? Or in the beautiful sights and sounds of historic districts and vintage theatres? Whatever it is that fuels your appetite for adventure, the American South has it. Brimming with vibrant culture, savory dishes and year-round warmth, it’s always the ideal place for your next getaway. 
Many a traveler has felt the pull of the “Sunshine State”— after all, it’s difficult to resist more than a thousand miles of coastline and 250 days of bright skies. If you’re drawn to the allure of Miami hotels, recline in comfort on the famous sands of South Beach, then trade in your sandals and dress up for a festive soiree. Further north, America’s most well-known theme parks are at your doorstep with hotels in Orlando; along with world-class entertainment and dining outside the parks as well. 
For another city where the days are sunny and the nights are merry, explore Travelocity’s hotels in Atlanta. Spend an afternoon enveloped in the smells of hydrangeas and camellia as you wander the paths of the Atlanta Botanical Gardens in search of peaceful meditation spot. By night, stroll through the Fox Theatre Historic District and immerse yourself in the sights and sounds of outstanding ballet, symphony, and theatre productions. 
If you envision a vacation that boasts quintessential Southern charm and plenty of delectable morsels, a trip to Texas just may be in your future. Yearning to tempt your taste buds with juicy brisket that melts in your mouth, slaw, and whiskey cake? You’re in search of Dallas hotels, wise wanderer. However, no Texas tour is complete without a visit to the home of NASA, “Space City,” or the impressive Museum of Fine Arts, one of America’s largest. Travelocity’s hotels in Houston will certainly have you saying “The eagle has landed.”

Best International Hotel Accommodation
You’re a worldly sort, not the type to let those travel guidebooks gather dust, and your globe provides inspiration as much as decoration. But where to go next? From the cosmopolitan cities of Canada to the timeless destinations of Europe, there is no shortage of new places to explore. Delve into Travelocity’s incredible selection of international hotel accommodation and prepare for your next adventure. 
One of the world’s finest international destinations is close to home: Your northern neighbor. Canada has much more on its plate than poutine, the famous French fry and cheese curd combination. Reserve  Montreal hotels to experience its historic Old Port, glimpse the towering Notre-Dame Basilica, and stroll through one of the world’s largest botanical gardens. To the southwest, Toronto hotels stand ready to introduce you to this quirky, charming city. Home to the expansive, Frank Gehry-designed Art Gallery of Ontario and vibrant neighborhoods like Kensington Market and the Distillery District, Toronto is perfect for those savvy travelers who like something a little different. 
If your travel desires lie farther afield, you may need a trip to Europe. London hotels are the ideal destination for wise wanderers who seek extraordinary architecture, a thriving theatre scene— and of course, classic, wood-paneled pubs where you can sip a pint. Or, look into our hotels in Rome and travel even further back in time, to antiquity itself. Gaze up at the massive Colosseum and you’ll soon understand why its name so closely resembles “colossal.” Peruse artworks by the great masters at the Galleria Borghese and then bask in the sunshine in the adjoining park as you daydream. Continue your art tour of Europe with Paris hotels and traverse through the Louvre in pursuit of da Vinci and Michelangelo. Wherever your travels take you, go confidently: Travelocity is always here to help you find a comfortable place to rest your head.

Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!

About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
