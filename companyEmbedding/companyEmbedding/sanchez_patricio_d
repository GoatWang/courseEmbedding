"Pat has been instrumental in the development and implementation of the Partnership's midstream strategy," said Gerry Willinger, Chief Executive Officer of the general partner of SPP.  "Among his accomplishments, Pat played a key role in the financing of the Partnership's October 2015 acquisition of the Western Catarina Midstream system, a transaction that allowed us to initiate distributions beginning in the fourth quarter 2015.  I look forward to continuing to work with Pat as we work to realize value from our midstream assets, which are strategically located in South Texas and well-positioned to accommodate the growth plans of Sanchez Energy."
