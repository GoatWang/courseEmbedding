"The successful fundraising underscores both the strength of our team and our investors' enthusiasm for our investment approach.

W Capital Partners | Providing liquidity alternatives in direct private equity

































Shareholder liquidity requires the right  partnership.







“At a time when our business was at an exciting growth point, W Capital provided an exit opportunity to shareholders who had been with us for 10+ years. We’re excited for W Capital to support our expansion and provide a fresh perspective (no pun intended!).” 


                    Jason Ackerman, Founder & CEO                








 “W Capital acquired equity that our former lenders received in a restructuring. Their purchases consolidated our fragmented shareholder base, and they’re now one of our two lead investors. W Capital provides World Kitchen with valued leadership and capital markets expertise – and has supported our growth with acquisition capital.”


                    Carl Warschausky, President & CEO                








“W Capital provided us with valuable primary capital that accelerated our growth in addition to offering an exit to certain shareholders. W Capital has been a great partner to work with and continues to bring expertise and meaningful relationships into our board room.” 


                    Andre Durand, CEO                








“After successfully growing Prodigy for four years, we sold control of the company but retained a minority stake to capture additional upside. Two years later, W Capital paid a premium to the sale price for our minority stake, enabling us to take our remaining profits, exit the business and transfer our board seat into capable hands.”


                    Tim Hall, CI Capital                








“W Capital helped us achieve the ideal outcome: partial liquidity for our shareholders, additional growth capital for our company and a clear strategy toward an exit.  W is a quality organization with great, smart enterprising people who have made a big impact on our business.  Our relationship with W has become a true partnership."


                    James Tuton, Founder and CEO                








“W Capital led our last financing round as a private company, working with us to provide liquidity to founders and angel investors who had supported our growth for over a decade.  They were pros at managing the complicated tender offer process, and quickly became a strong resource in our boardroom and valuable partners in our run up to IPO.” 


                    Rick Stollmeyer, Founder and CEO                








“W Capital provided us with a partial realization on an investment that was too large relative to our fund size. We recycled our proceeds from the sale to support the growth of another portfolio company. They were a terrific co-investor and partner, and the deal was a success for our firm and theirs.” 


                    GP at a sector focused buyout fund                








“In providing liquidity to our largest shareholder, W Capital thinks that they picked our company for investment.  What they don’t know is that we actually picked them!  They have a strong reputation and are an ideal partner for these kinds of transactions.”


                    John Joyce, CFO of Kony, former CFO of IBM and Partner at SilverLake

Our Approach to Direct Secondaries



Growth Equity Secondaries

Growth equity stage companies typically have several rounds of institutional capital and are supported by a number of distinct shareholders and board members. Each investor has its own exit timeframe, cost basis and return objectives. By offering liquidity to a single shareholder – directly or in conjunction with a company-sponsored private liquidity event— W Capital better aligns the shareholder base and ultimately empowers management to continue executing on its growth objectives. Early monetization allows sellers to lock-in gains, return cash to limited partners and reallocate resources. Once shareholders, we actively support our portfolio companies by providing access to our broad network of relationships, board involvement and expansion capital to finance growth and acquisitions.


These objectives can be achieved through a shareholder’s full or partial sale of its equity ownership. W Capital works with many of the world’s leading venture capital and private equity firms to deliver these solutions.
We can acquire equity in a single company or in an entire portfolio of direct investments. By selling investments in older funds, well-performing GPs and corporate investors can reduce monitoring and administrative costs, reallocate resources and increase distributions. W Capital enters new investments ready to contribute the time and resources necessary to further develop and grow the portfolio companies.

Buyout Minority Secondaries

Buyout deals often include a number of minority shareholders such as co-investors, mezzanine lenders, founders and prior owners who rolled a portion of their equity.  Over time each investor may have a different time horizon, return objective or risk tolerance than the controlling investor. Our solutions allow these minority shareholders to monetize their investment with the full support of the control sponsor. We also work directly with many control sponsors who seek to continue growing a well performing company but would like to sell down a minority position to capture a gain, reduce the time pressure for a full exit and bring on a minority partner with equity reserves for potential future expansion capital. 











“W Capital acquired equity that our former lenders received in a restructuring. Their purchases consolidated our fragmented shareholder base, and they’re now one of our two lead investors. W Capital provides World Kitchen with valued leadership and capital markets expertise – and has supported our growth with acquisition capital.”

NEWS RELEASE - Commercial real estate venture gets funded for $250K from funded.com's funding provider. Comment: I was very pleased with the speed and professional attitude of the site. I will recommend this to anyone in the future.

"Funded.com has been great and my project is in the final stages of being funded by an investor I found on here. I was surprized at the quick process and how fast investors funded my project. Website was a big help!"

Let me first start by saying I believe your site is THE BEST there is for connecting Entrepreneurs and Investors.  It is the site I've had most success with.  I had about 6 Investors either respond back or contact me because of your site with an interest in investing in my company. Thank you very much!  I love your site and will recommend it to any of my Colleagues.  I love the fact that we are able to contact the Investors directly (which many of the sites joining Entrepreneurs and Investors don't allow).  It looks like I'm about to go into contract with an Investor because of your site.  Thank you again.

I am grateful I had the opportunity to access your network of investors. I am reasonably confident that the current negotiations with one of your investors will go through for our film production. I will be back for my next production.
