Partnership Basics




Learn more about the simplest business structure for companies with more than one owner.

A partnership is a business with more than one owner that has not filed papers with the state to become a corporation or LLC (limited liability company). There are two basic types of partnerships -- general partnerships and limited partnerships. The general partnership is the simplest and least expensive co-owned business structure to create and maintain. However, there are a few important facts you should know about the personal liability of general partners.
By definition, a partnership is a business with more than one owner that has not filed papers with the state to become a corporation or LLC (limited liability company). There are two basic types of partnerships: general partnerships and limited partnerships. This article discusses general partnerships, the more common structure in which every partner has a hand in managing the business.
The partnership is the simplest and least expensive co-owned business structure to create and maintain. However, there are a few important facts you should know before you begin.
Personal Liability for All Owners
First, partners are personally liable for all business debts and obligations, including court judgments. This means that if the business itself can't pay a creditor, such as a supplier, lender, or landlord, the creditor can legally come after any partner's house, car, or other possessions.
There are a few exceptions to this personal liability. Some of the partners can have limited personal liability if the partnership is set up as a limited partnership. This is a partnership in which only the general partner, who runs the business, has personal liability, while the limited partners, who are basically passive investors, can lose no more than their stake in the partnership. Also, some states allow special limited liability partnerships (LLPs). More commonly, though, businesspeople who are particularly concerned about personal liability choose to incorporate their business or operate as a limited liability company (LLC). For more information, see Nolo's articles on corporations  and  limited liability companies.
Joint Authority
In addition, any individual partner can usually bind the whole business to a contract or other business deal. For instance, if your partner signs a year-long contract with a supplier to buy inventory at a price your business can't afford, you can be held personally responsible for the money owed under the contract.
There are just a few limits on a partner's ability to commit the partnership to a deal -- for instance, one partner can't bind the partnership to a sale of all of the partnership's assets. But generally, unless an outsider has reason to know of any limits the partners have placed on each other's authority in their partnership agreement, any partner can bind the others to a deal.
Joint Liability
Each individual partner can be sued for -- and required to pay -- the full amount of any business debt. If this happens, an individual partner's only recourse may be to sue the other partners for their shares of the debt.
Because of this combination of personal liability for all partnership debt and the authority of each partner to bind the partnership, it's critical that you trust the people with whom you start your business.
Partnership Taxes
A partnership is not a separate tax entity from its owners; instead, it's what the IRS calls a "pass-through entity." This means the partnership itself does not pay any income taxes on profits. Business income simply "passes through" the business to the partners, who report their share of profits (or losses) on their individual income tax returns. In addition, each partner must make quarterly estimated tax payments to the IRS each year.
While the partnership itself doesn't pay taxes, it must file IRS Form 1065, an informational return, each year. This form sets out each partner's share of the partnership profits (or losses), which the IRS reviews to make sure the partners are reporting their income correctly.
For more information on reporting and paying partnership taxes, see How Partnerships Are Taxed.
Creating a Partnership
You don't have to file any paperwork to establish an ordinary partnership -- just agreeing to go into business with another person will get you started.
Of course, partnerships must  meet the same local registration requirements as any new business. Most cities and counties require businesses to register with them and pay at least a minimum tax. You may also have to obtain an employer identification number from the IRS, a seller's license from your state, and a zoning permit from your local planning board.
In addition, your partnership may have to register a fictitious or assumed business name. If your business name doesn't contain all of the partners' last names (for instance, you want to use "London Landscapes" instead of "Harper & Reed Landscapes"), you usually must register that name -- known as a fictitious or assumed business name -- with your county clerk. For more information on fictitious business names, see Registering Your Business Name.
While the owners of a partnership are not legally required to have a written partnership agreement, it makes good sense to put the details of ownership, including the partners' rights and responsibilities and their share of profits, into a written agreement. For more about why partnership agreements are so important, read Creating a Partnership Agreement.
Ending a Partnership
One disadvantage of partnerships is that when one partner wants to leave the company, the partnership generally dissolves. In that case, the partners must fulfill any remaining business obligations, pay off all debts, and divide any assets and profits among themselves.
If you want to prevent this kind of ending for your business, you should create a buy-sell agreement, or buyout agreement, which can be included as part of your partnership agreement. A buy-sell/buyout agreement helps partners decide and plan for what will happen when one partner retires, dies, becomes disabled, or leaves the partnership to pursue other interests. For example, such an agreement might allow the partners to buy out a departing partner's interest, so business can continue as usual. For more information, see Plan Ahead for Changes in Partnership Ownership.
For more information on the legal and practical issues involved in forming a business partnership, see Form a Partnership: The Complete Legal Guide, by Ralph Warner and Denis Clifford (Nolo). Or, to create a "business prenup" that will protect a business if someone leaves, seeBusiness Buyout Agreements: A Step-by-Step Guide for Co-Owners, by Bethany Laurence and Anthony Mancuso (Nolo).

Strategic partnership - Wikipedia





















 






Strategic partnership

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


					Jump to:					navigation, 					search

A strategic partnership (also see strategic alliance) is a relationship between two commercial enterprises, usually formalized by one or more business contracts. A strategic partnership will usually fall short of a legal partnership entity, agency, or corporate affiliate relationship. Strategic partnerships can take on various forms from shake hand agreements, contractual cooperations all the way to equity alliances, either the formation of a Joint venture or cross-holdings in each other.
Typically, two companies form a strategic partnership when each possesses one or more business assets or have expertise that will help the other by enhancing their businesses. Strategic partnerships can develop in outsourcing relationships where the parties desire to achieve long-term “win-win” benefits and innovation based on mutually desired outcomes.
One common strategic partnership involves one company providing engineering, manufacturing or product development services, partnering with a smaller, entrepreneurial firm or inventor to create a specialized new product. Typically, the larger firm supplies capital, and the necessary product development, marketing, manufacturing, and distribution capabilities, while the smaller firm supplies specialized technical or creative expertise.
Another common strategic partnership involves a supplier/manufacturer partnering with a distributor or wholesale consumer. Rather than approach the transactions between the companies as a simple link in the product or service supply chain, the two companies form a closer relationship where they mutually participate in advertising, marketing, branding, product development, and other business functions. As examples, an automotive manufacturer may form strategic partnerships with its parts suppliers, or a music distributor with record labels.
Strategic partnerships also have emerged to solve many company business problems. The book Vested: How P&G, McDonald’s and Microsoft are Redefining Winning in Business Relationships [1] profiles strategic partnerships in large scale business process outsourcing relationships, public-private infrastructure projects, facilities management and supply chain relationships. Contemporary strategic sourcing and procurement processes enable organizations to use Performance-Based or Vested sourcing business models for establishing strategic supplier relationships.[2]
There can be many advantages to creating strategic partnerships. As Robert M. Grant states in his book Contemporary Strategy Analysis, "For complete strategies, as opposed to individual projects, creating option value means positioning the firm such that a wide array of opportunities become available".[3] Firms taking advantage of strategic partnerships can utilize other company's strengths to make both firms stronger in the long run.
Strategic partnerships raise questions concerning co-inventorship and other intellectual property ownership, technology transfer, exclusivity, competition, hiring away of employees, rights to business opportunities created in the course of the partnership, splitting of profits and expenses, duration and termination of the relationship, and many other business issues. The relationships are often complex as a result, and can be subject to extensive negotiation. The University of Tennessee has done significant research into strategic partnerships, especially in the area of strategic outsourcing relationships.[4]

Creating a Partnership Agreement




Put the terms of your partnership in writing to protect your business.


By Beth Laurence, J.D.




Share on Google Plus





Share on Facebook













 





If you and your partners don't spell out your rights and responsibilities in a written partnership agreement, you'll be ill-equipped to settle conflicts when they arise, and minor misunderstandings may erupt into full-blown disputes. In addition, without a written agreement saying otherwise, your state's laws will control many aspects of your business.
How a Partnership Agreement Helps Your Business
A partnership agreement allows you to structure your relationship with your partners in a way that suits your business. You and your partners can establish the shares of profits (or losses) each partner will take, the responsibilities of each partner, what will happen to the business if a partner leaves, and other important guidelines.

The Uniform Partnership Act
Each state (with the exception of Louisiana) has its own laws governing partnerships, contained in what's usually called "The Uniform Partnership Act" or "The Revised Uniform Partnership Act" (or the "UPA" or "Revised UPA"). These statutes establish the basic legal rules that apply to partnerships and will control many aspects of your partnership's life unless you set out different rules in a written partnership agreement. (To find your state's partnership statutes, see Nolo's State Law Resources Legal Research page.)
Don't be tempted to leave the terms of your partnership up to these state laws. Because they were designed as one-size-fits-all fallback rules, they may not be helpful in your particular situation. It's much better to have an agreement in which you and your partners state the rules that will apply to your business.

What to Include in Your Partnership Agreement
Here's a list of the major areas that most partnership agreements cover. You and your partners-to-be should consider these issues before you put the terms in writing:

Name of the partnership. One of the first things you must do is agree on a name for your partnership. You can use your own last names, such as Smith & Wesson, or you can adopt and register a fictitious business name, such as Westside Home Repairs. If you choose a fictitious name, you must make sure that the name isn't already in use and then file a fictitious business name statement with your county clerk. For more information, see Nolo's article Registering Your Business Name.
Contributions to the partnership. It's critical that you and your partners work out and record who's going to contribute cash, property, or services to the business before it opens -- and what ownership percentage each partner will have. Disagreements over contributions have doomed many promising businesses.
Allocation of profits, losses, and draws. Will profits and losses be allocated in proportion to a partner's percentage interest in the business? Will each partner be entitled to a regular draw (a withdrawal of allocated profits from the business) or will all profits be distributed at the end of each year? You and your partners may have different financial needs and different ideas about how the money should be divided up and distributed, so this is an area to which you should pay particular attention.
Partners' authority. Without an agreement to the contrary, any partner can bind the partnership (to a contract or debt, for example) without the consent of the other partners. If you want one or all of the partners to obtain the others' consent before obligating the partnership, you must make this clear in your partnership agreement.
Partnership decision making. Although there's no magic formula or language for making decisions among partners, you'll head off a lot of trouble if you try to work it out beforehand. You may, for example, want to require a unanimous vote of all the partners for every business decision. Or if that leaves you feeling fettered, you can require a unanimous vote for major decisions and allow individual partners to make minor decisions on their own. In that case, your partnership agreement will have to describe what constitutes a major or minor decision. You should carefully think through issues like these before you and your partners have to make important decisions.


Management duties. You might not want to make ironclad rules about every management detail, but you'd be wise to work out some guidelines in advance. For example, who will keep the books? Who will deal with customers? Supervise employees? Negotiate with suppliers? Think through the management needs of your partnership and be sure you've got everything covered.
Admitting new partners. Eventually, you may want to expand the business and bring in new partners. Agreeing on a procedure for admitting new partners will make your lives a lot easier when this issue comes up.
Withdrawal or death of a partner. At least as important as the rules for admitting new partners to the business are the rules for handling the departure of an owner. You should set up a reasonable buyout scheme in your partnership agreement. To learn more about this issue, read Nolo's article Plan Ahead for Changes in Partnership Ownership.
Resolving disputes. If you and your partners become deadlocked on an issue, do you want to go straight to court? It might benefit everyone involved if your partnership agreement provides for alternative dispute resolution, such as mediation or arbitration.

Next Steps
As you can see, there are many issues to consider before you and your partners open for business -- and you shouldn't wait for a conflict to arise before hammering out some sound rules and procedures. A good self-help book, such as Form a Partnership: The Complete Legal Guide, by Denis Clifford and Ralph Warner (Nolo), can help you think through the details and put them in writing.

PARTNERSHIP AGREEMENT

This PARTNERSHIP AGREEMENT  is made on ____________, 20__ between
__________________________________________ and __________________________________________. 
1. NAME AND BUSINESS. The parties hereby form a partnership under the
name of __________________________________________ to conduct a __________________________________________. The principal office of
the business shall be in _______________________. 
2. TERM. The partnership shall begin on ________________, 20____, and shall
continue until terminated as herein provided. 
3. CAPITAL. The capital of the partnership shall be contributed in
cash by the partners as follows: A separate capital account shall be maintained for each
partner. Neither partner shall withdraw any part of his capital account. Upon the demand
of either partner, the capital accounts of the partners shall be maintained at all times
in the proportions in which the partners share in the profits and losses of the
partnership. 
4. PROFIT AND LOSS. The net profits of the partnership shall be
divided equally between the partners and the net losses shall be borne equally by them. A
separate income account shall be maintained for each partner. Partnership profits and
losses shall be charged or credited to the separate income account of each partner. If a
partner has no credit balance in his income account, losses shall be charged to his
capital account. 
5. SALARIES AND DRAWINGS. Neither partner shall receive any salary for
services rendered to the partnership. Each partner may, from time to time, withdraw the
credit balance in his income account. 
6. INTEREST. No interest shall be paid on the initial contributions to
the capital of the partnership or on any subsequent contributions of capital. 
7. MANAGEMENT DUTIES AND RESTRICTIONS. The partners shall have equal
rights in the management of the partnership business, and each partner shall devote his
entire time to the conduct of the business. Without the consent of the other partner
neither partner shall on behalf of the partnership borrow or lend money, or make, deliver,
or accept any commercial paper, or execute any mortgage, security agreement, bond, or
lease, or purchase or contract to purchase, or sell or contract to sell any property for
or of the partnership other than the type of property bought and sold in the regular
course of its business. 
8. BANKING. All funds of the partnership shall be deposited in its
name in such checking account or accounts as shall be designated by the partners. All
withdrawals are to be made upon checks signed by either partner. 
9. BOOKS. The partnership books shall be maintained at the principal
office of the partnership, and each partner shall at all times have access thereto. The
books shall be kept on a fiscal year basis, commencing _____________________ and ending _____________________, and
shall be closed and balanced at the end of each fiscal year. An audit shall be made as of
the closing date. 
10. VOLUNTARY TERMINATION. The partnership may be dissolved at any
time by agreement of the partners, in which event the partners shall proceed with
reasonable promptness to liquidate the business of the partnership. The partnership name
shall be sold with the other assets of the business. The assets of the partnership
business shall be used and distributed in the following order: (a) to pay or provide for
the payment of all partnership liabilities and liquidating expenses and obligations; (b)
to equalize the income accounts of the partners; (c) to discharge the balance of the
income accounts of the partners; (d) to equalize the capital accounts of the partners; and
(e) to discharge the balance of the capital accounts of the partners. 
11. DEATH. Upon the death of either partner, the surviving partner
shall have the right either to purchase the interest of the decedent in the partnership or
to terminate and liquidate the partnership business. If the surviving partner elects to
purchase the decedent's interest, he shall serve notice in writing of such election,
within three months after the death of the decedent, upon the executor or administrator of
the decedent, or, if at the time of such election no legal representative has been
appointed, upon any one of the known legal heirs of the decedent at the last-known address
of such heir. (a) If the surviving partner elects to purchase the interest of the decedent
in the partnership, the purchase price shall be equal to the decedent's capital account as
at the date of his death plus the decedent's income account as at the end of the prior
fiscal year, increased by his share of partnership profits or decreased by his share of
partnership losses for the period from the beginning of the fiscal year in which his death
occurred until the end of the calendar month in which his death occurred, and decreased by
withdrawals charged to his income account during such period. No allowance shall be made
for goodwill, trade name, patents, or other intangible assets, except as those assets have
been reflected on the partnership books immediately prior to the decedent's death; but the
survivor shall nevertheless be entitled to use the trade name of the partnership. (b)
Except as herein otherwise stated, the procedure as to liquidation and distribution of the
assets of the partnership business shall be the same as stated in paragraph 10 with
reference to voluntary termination. 
12. ARBITRATION. Any controversy or claim arising out of or relating
to this Agreement, or the breach hereof, shall be settled by arbitration in accordance

PARTNERSHIP AGREEMENT - GENERAL
 
THIS AGREEMENT is made and
          entered into at ______________________________, this ________ day of
          ______________, _________, by and between _____________________
          ____________________________________________________ (Name And
          Address) and _____________________________________________________
          (Name And Address) (hereafter collectively referred to as the
          "Partners").
1. Partnership Name and
          Purpose. The parties form a Partnership under the name of
          _______________________________________________ (hereafter referred to
          as "the Partnership") to own real property, develop real
          property, and thereafter to manage, operate, develop, mortgage, lease
          or sell real property and do all other lawful things as further
          business of the partnership and as may be necessary, incidental, or

2. Place of Business. The
          principal place of business of the Partnership shall be
          ___________________________________________________ (Location and
          Address) or such other place in the State of ________________ as the
          Partnership may from time to time determine.
3. Term. The Partnership
          shall commence as of the date of the execution of this Agreement and
          shall continue thereafter for a term of __________ years, unless
          sooner dissolved and terminated by agreement of the Partners;
          provided, however, that the Partnership shall not be terminated by the
          bankruptcy, insolvency, appointment of trustee for the benefit of
          creditors, death, incapacity, or withdrawal of any Partner, but the
          remaining Partners shall have the rights and options as set forth
          below.
4. Capital Contributions.
          Each Partner shall contribute to the Partnership, an initial
          contribution of capital and each Partner shall share in the net annual
          operating profits or losses of the Partnership in the following ratio
          unless adjusted as hereinafter provided:
(partner names and
          contribution amounts)
The capital of the
          Partnership shall be the aggregate amount of capital contributions
          made to it by the Partners. The initial capital to be contributed by
          each Partner shall be in cash. No Partner shall be required to make
          any additional contribution to the Partnership but shall make such
          additional contributions as agreed upon by a ________ percentage of
          the partners. 
If any Partner fails to
          contribute the additional capital required of him within thirty (30)
          days after written call for contribution, the other Partners shall be
          given the opportunity to contribute amounts that will equal the
          assessment in default. The allocation of profits or losses among all
          the Partners shall be adjusted according to the change in capital
          contributions by the partners.
Contributions to the
          capital of the Partnership shall not bear interest. However, any
          advance of money to the Partnership by any Partner in excess of the
          amounts provided for in this Agreement or subsequently agreed to as a
          Capital Contribution shall not be deemed a Capital Contribution to the
          Partnership, but a debt due from the Partnership, and shall be repaid
          with interest at such rates and times as determined by a ________
          percentage of the Partners.
5. Capital Accounts. A
          separate capital account shall be maintained for each Partner, and
          capital contributions to the Partnership by the Partners shall be
          charged to such accounts. Partnership profits or losses shall also be
          charged or credited to the separate capital accounts in the manner
          herein provided. No interest shall be paid on the capital account of
          any Partner.
6. Cash Distributions. Any
          amounts held by the Partnership and not required for purposes of its
          business, including reasonable reserves for contingencies, may be
          distributed to the Partners pursuant to the terms hereof. No Partner
          shall be entitled to make withdrawals from his individual account or
          have returned to him his capital contributions except in accordance
          herewith. No Partner shall have the right to require that a
          distribution be made to him other than in cash.
7. Banks and Books of
          Account. The funds of the Partnership shall be kept in a separate
          account or accounts in a bank and/or savings institution in the name
          of the Partnership. All withdrawals from such accounts shall be made
          upon checks or drafts signed by any Partner.
Full and complete books of
          account shall be kept and maintained at the principal place of
          business and all transactions shall be entered in such books. Each
          Partner shall have access and the right to inspect and copy such books
          and all other Partnership records. The books shall be closed at the
          end of each calendar year and statements prepared showing the
          financial condition of the Partnership and its profit or loss.
8. Managing Partners. In
          the general conduct of the Partnership business, all the Partners
          shall be consulted and the advice and opinions of the Partners shall
          be obtained so much as is practicable. However, for the purpose of
          fixing and harmonizing the policies and practices of the Partnership
          and of securing uniformity and continuity in the conduct of its
          business, the general management of the Partnership business shall
          rest solely in the Managing Partners. The Managing Partners shall be:
          _____________________________________________________ (Name and
          Address).
_____________________________________________________
          (Name and Address).
Except in cases of gross
          negligence or willful misconduct, the doing of any act or the failure
          to do any act by the Managing Partners, the effect of which may cause
          or result in loss or damage to the Partnership, shall not subject the
          Managing Partners to any liability to the remaining Partners or to the
          Partnership. In the event of the death, physical or mental incapacity,
          or withdrawal of either Managing Partner from the Partnership, the
          surviving Partners shall have equal rights in the management of the
          Partnership and shall appoint successor Managing Partners.
Except as otherwise
          provided herein, no Partner shall make any contract for and on behalf
          of the Partnership without the prior approval of the other Partners.
          All contracts shall be made in the name of the Partnership and in the
          case of any disagreement as to the making of any contract or
          assumption of any obligation by the Partnership, such contract or
          obligation shall not be made or executed except as directed by a
          supermajority of the Partners; further, no Partner shall release nor
          cancel any indebtedness or obligation due the Partnership, except on
          full payment thereof, or upon the mutual agreement of all the
          Partners, nor shall any Partner give, extend, or guarantee credit to
          or for any person, firm, corporation without the consent of all the
          Partners, nor at any time shall any Partner sign the firm name nor
          pledge the firm's credit nor in any other manner act as surety or
          guarantor in any paper, bill, bond, note, or draft or other obligation
          whatsoever, nor assign pledge, mortgage, sell or otherwise dispose of,
          any Partnership property or any interest therein or do anything or
          permit any act whereby the Partnership's money, interest, or property
          or its interest therein, may be liable to seizure, attachment, or
          execution, except upon mutual consent of all the Partners.
9. Relationship of the
          Partners. Each Partner may have other business interests and may
          engage in any other business, trade, profession, or employment
          whatsoever on his own account or in partnership with, as an employee
          of, or as an officer, director, or stockholder of any other person,
          firm, or corporation (whether competitive with the Partnership or
          otherwise) and he shall not be required to devote his entire time to
          the business of the Partnership. Each Partner shall devote such time
          and attention to the conduct of the business of the Partnership as
          shall be deemed by all of the Partners to be required for the business
          of the Partnership.
No Partner shall receive
          any salary or other special compensation or services rendered by him
          as Partner of the Partnership, except as otherwise agreed by all the
          Partners. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each Partner shall be
          permitted to do business with the Partnership and with any other
          Partner individually or with any business entity in which such Partner
          may have an interest.
It is understood that each
          of the parties hereto are Partners for the purpose of this Partnership
          as set forth in Paragraph 1 hereof, but nothing contained in this
          Agreement shall make the partners with respect to matters unrelated to
          the Partnership, or render them liable for any debts or obligations of
          any Partner, nor shall any Partner be hereby constituted the agent for
          any Partner except to the limited extent herein specifically permitted
          and as may be hereinafter agreed upon by consent of all the parties.
10. Waiver of Right to
          Partition. Each Partner hereto hereby waives his right to partition
          (or to separately assert any right to partition under the statutes of
          the State of ________________ pertaining to partition) any real
          property owned by the Partnership.
11. Voluntary Termination.
          The Partnership may be dissolved at any time by agreement of a
          supermajority of the Partners, in which event the partners shall
          proceed with reasonable promptness to liquidate the business of the
          partnership. The assets of the partnership and proceeds of liquidation
          shall be applied in the following order:
(a) To the payment of or
          provision for all debts, liabilities and obligations of the
          Partnership to any person (other than Partners) and the expenses of
          liquidation;
(b) To the payment of all
          debts and liabilities (including interest) to the Partners (except
          those on account of their capital contributions);
(c) To the discharge of the
          balance of the income accounts of the Partners;
(d) To the payment of the
          capital accounts of the Partners, less any previous distributions and
          any losses charged or chargeable to the capital accounts of the
          Partners and increased by any income or gains credited to such capital
          accounts; and
(e) Between the Partners in
          the same proportion as their percentages of interest in the
          Partnership as set forth in Paragraph 4.
Notwithstanding any other
          provisions of this Paragraph 11, if, upon ultimate liquidation of the
          Partnership, the foregoing allocations would leave any Partner with a
          deficit in his capital account that is not to be repaid to the
          Partnership, then, such allocation shall be modified so that, to the
          extent possible, the amount of total gain (including the portion of
          any cancellation of indebtedness income not excluded by an election
          under Internal Revenue Code Sections 108 and 1017) allocated to such
          Partner is sufficient to eliminate such deficit. If there are several
          Partners with such deficits and the total gain is less than the
          aggregate deficits, such gains shall be allocated in proportion to,
          but not in excess of, their respective deficits.
12. Retirement. No Partner
          may retire from the Partnership for a period of ____ years from the
          date of this Agreement. After said period, any Partner shall have the
          right to retire from the Partnership at the end of any calendar month.
          Written notice of intention to retire shall be served upon the
          remaining Partners at least __________ days before the first day of
          the month in which the retiring Partner intends to retire. The
          retirement of such Partner shall have no effect upon the continuance
          of the Partnership business. If the remaining Partners elect to
          purchase the interest of the retiring Partner, the Partners shall
          serve written notice of such election upon the retiring Partner within
          _______ days after receipt of the retiring Partner's notice of
          intention to retire, and the purchase price and method of payment for
          the Partnership interest shall be as provided in Paragraph 14 hereof.
          If the remaining Partners elect not to purchase the interest of the
          retiring Partner, then the Partners shall proceed with reasonable
          promptness to liquidate the business of the Partnership.
13. Involuntary Withdrawal.
          Any Partner may be required to withdraw from the Partnership upon the
          happening of any of the following events:
(a) If any Partner makes an
          assignment for the benefit of creditors or applies for the appointment
          of a trustee, a liquidator or receiver of any substantial part of his
          assets or commences any proceeding relating to himself under any
          bankruptcy, reorganization, or arrangement of similar law; or if any
          such application is filed or proceeding is commenced against any
          Partner and such Partner indicates his consent thereto, or an order is
          entered appointing any such trustee, liquidator or receiver, or
          approving a petition in any such proceeding and such order remains in
          effect for more than sixty (60) days; then that Partner shall be
          deemed to have withdrawn from the Partnership as of the date of the
          happening of any such event.
(b) If any Partner shall be
          adjudged incompetent, then such Partner shall be deemed to have
          withdrawn from the Partnership on the date set forth in a notice to
          such incompetent Partner from the remaining Partners.
The value of the
          Partnership interest in the Partnership of any Partner who shall be
          required to withdraw from the Partnership as provided in this
          paragraph, and the method of payment for the Partnership interest
          shall be as provided in Paragraph 14 hereof.
14. Death of a Partner.
          Upon the death of a Partner, the Partnership shall not terminate, and
          the business of the Partnership shall be continued to the end of the
          fiscal year in which such death occurs. The estate of the deceased
          Partner shall share in the net profits or losses of the Partnership
          for the balance of the fiscal year in the same manner the deceased
          Partner would have shared in them had he survived to the end of the
          fiscal year, but the liability of the estate for losses shall not
          exceed the deceased Partner's interest in the Partnership assets at
          the time of his death. The estate of the deceased Partner shall have
          no voice in the affairs of the Partnership. At the end of the fiscal
          year, the surviving Partners shall have the option either to liquidate
          the Partnership or to purchase the interest of the deceased Partner.
(a) If the surviving
          Partners elect to purchase the interest of the deceased Partner, they
          shall serve notice in writing of such election within _______ months
          after the death of the Partner upon the Executor or Administrator of
          such deceased Partner's estate, or if at the time of such election no
          such legal representative has been appointed, upon any one of the
          known legal heirs of the decedent at the last known address of such
          heir. The purchase price shall be equal to the deceased Partner's
          capital account as of the end of the month next preceding the date of
          his death plus the deceased Partner's income account as of said date,
          adjusted for the deceased Partner's share of profits not previously
          distributed or losses not previously charged to either of said
          accounts through the end of the month next preceding death. No
          allowance shall be made for goodwill, trade name, patents or other
          intangible assets, except as those assets have been reflected on the
          Partnership books immediately prior to termination; but the surviving
          Partners shall nevertheless be entitled to use the trade name of the
          Partnership. The capital account of the deceased Partner shall be
          adjusted to reflect the fair market value of all Partnership land and
          improvements located thereon and fixtures affixed thereto, the same to
          be determined by an independent appraiser selected by the parties for
          this purpose, whose determination shall be final and binding upon all
          interested parties. The purchase price shall be paid within ________
          year(s) of the death of the deceased partner and shall bear interest
          at the rate of ________ percent per annum thereafter. In the event no
          agreement can be made on who shall be the appraiser, then the value
          shall be established by three appraisers, one selected by the deceased
          partner's estate, one selected by the remaining partners and a third
          appraiser selected by those two appraisers. The Partners intend that
          the payments for the deceased Partner's capital account shall be
          distributions under Section 736(b) of the Internal Revenue Code, and
          that payments for undistributed profits shall be a distributive share
          of the Partnership income or a guaranteed payment under Section 736(a)
          of the Internal Revenue Code.
(b) If the surviving
          Partners do not elect to purchase the interest of the deceased
          Partner, they shall proceed with reasonable promptness to liquidate
          the Partnership. During the period of liquidation, the surviving
          Partners and the estate of the deceased Partner shall share in the
          profits and losses of the business in the same manner that they would
          have shared in them had the deceased Partner survived to the end of
          the fiscal year, except that the deceased Partner's estate shall not
          be liable for losses in excess of the deceased Partner's interest in
          the Partnership assets as of the time of his death. Except as herein
          otherwise stated, the procedure as to liquidation and distribution of
          the assets of the Partnership business shall be the same as stated in
          Paragraph 11.
The parties agree that the
          provisions contained herein with respect to the discharge of a
          deceased Partner's interest in the Partnership are in lieu of the
          provisions of ____________________________ (State Statute) and shall
          exclusively govern the disposition of and accounting for the interest
          of a deceased Partner in the Partnership.
15. New Partners. No person
          shall be admitted as a Partner of the Partnership except with the
          consent of all the Partners who shall determine the terms and
          conditions upon which such admission is to be effective.
16. Prohibition on
          Transfer. A Partner shall not, and shall have no right, to sell,
          assign, pledge or mortgage his interest in the Partnership, or the
          Partnership property or assets, except with the written consent of all
          the Partners, and any such prohibition transfer, if attempted, shall
          be void and without force or effect.
17. Entire Agreement. This
          Agreement contains the entire understanding of the parties hereto and
          may not be modified or amended except by a writing signed by the
          parties to be charged therewith.
18. Controlling Law. This
          Agreement shall be controlled by and construed in accordance with the
          laws of the State of ______________________.
19. Successors and Assigns.
          Subject to the restrictions set forth herein, this Agreement shall
          inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the heirs, personal
          representatives, successors and assigns of the parties.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the
          parties hereto have set their hands and seals the date and place first
          above mentioned.

How to Create a Business Partnership Agreement
By Priyanka Prakash on July 11, 2016 | Business Law, How To, Starting a Business | Comments (13) According to Noam Wasserman, author of The Founder’s Dilemmas, a whopping 65 % of new businesses fail due to conflict among co-founders. One way to avoid this fate is, of course, to choose the right business partner. Another way is to have a strong business partnership agreement, which is what this article covers.

Why Should I Even Bother With a Business Partnership Agreement?
Running a business which has multiple owners without a business partnership agreement is kind of like driving a car without insurance. There’s nothing to protect you if something goes wrong. That gets at the main purpose that a business partnership agreement serves:

Dispute resolution: Every relationship has disagreements, and this is especially true in business relationships where lots of financial, legal, and business decisions have to be made.  A carefully crafted business partnership agreement allows you to outline how disputes are going to be handled ahead of time instead of in the heat of the moment. This prevents the friction and expenses associated with legal action.

A business partnership agreement can also do the following:

Dispute prevention. By forcing you to have an honest conversation about how you want to run the business with your partner, disputes that may have otherwise occurred may not occur at all.
Clarify business structure: The process of putting together a business partnership agreement forces everyone to think about and get on the same page about how the business is going to be structured and run from the beginning. This allows decisions to be made efficiently and profits to be divided fairly.
Enable business transition: Should there come a time when one or more of the partners wants to exit the business, wants a partner to exit, passes away, or becomes disabled, there need to be provisions specifying what will happen to the business.

Keep in mind that there are different kinds of partnerships: general partnerships, limited partnerships, limited liability partnerships, and (in some states) limited liability limited partnerships. Learn more about how to choose a business structure in this guide. No matter which type of partnership you are creating, you should have a partnership agreement.
Business Partnership Agreement Free Template
Our trusted partner Rocket Lawyer has an excellent step-by-step template for creating a business partnership agreement. You will be asked a small series of questions to customize your agreement, and you can then download, print it, sign it, and share it with your partners for free. To go back and change the agreement later or to create multiple versions of the agreement, you have to upgrade to a paid subscription.
Should You Use a Lawyer or a Template to Create a Business Partnership Agreement?
If you can afford it, it is almost always a good idea to have an attorney involved with your business agreements.  However, attorneys are expensive and likely do not have the same level of personal knowledge about your partners that you do.  Because of this, if you do use a lawyer, it is always better to first have a good outline of what you and your partners want in the agreement.
There are several ways that you can get help from a lawyer. You can hire an attorney your own, but to save money, we recommend getting a lawyer through Avvo.

Ask a general legal question and get answers for FREE! Avvo lets you post general legal questions for free, and attorneys will respond to you within 12 hours. Click here to try Avvo out.
Ask a specific legal question and get answers for as little as $39. This is another service offered by Avvo. The catch is that you only get 15 minutes of a lawyer’s time and they will not review the actual documents.
If you want a lawyer to help you create and review a partnership agreement, Avvo offers this service for a fixed price of $399. If you’re writing up the agreement yourself, and just want a lawyer to review it, that will be $199.
For more complicated situations, you can use Avvo’s attorney network to hire a lawyer at an hourly or fixed rate.

What Should Be in a Business Partnership Agreement?

Business partnership agreements come in all shapes and sizes. What works for a two-owner retail shop in New York City may not work for a 4-owner law firm in Boulder, Colorado. Similarly, what works for partners who have worked together and known each other for years may not work for partners that just met. However, below are some of the elements that should generally be included in a good business partnership agreement.

Want to skip the in-depth overview? Hop over to our handy partnership agreement checklist.
Business Name and Purpose

The name of the company, any other names that the company will be operating under, and the name of the parent company if there is one. If your company will use a fictitious business name (i.e. a trade name like “Sarah and Bob’s Bakery”), then that should be mentioned here. 
Statement of the company’s purpose.  Generally you will want to keep this fairly broad so you have the flexibility to adapt and don’t have to revise the partnership agreement every time you try a new experiment or business venture.

Partner Responsibilities
Decide who is going to be responsible for which parts of the business.  As discussed in our article on how to find the right business partner, at a minimum you need a partner involved with delivering your product and/or service, sales and marketing, finances, and management.  
One partner may have multiple responsibilities, and sometimes, responsibilities may overlap in the day to day of the business. However, you should list out any other areas that need to be covered and decide who is going to be broadly responsible for those areas.
Workload
How will the workload be shared?  Answer the following questions:

Are partners expected to work set hours?
Does one partner plan on working more or less than the other partners? If so, you may want to adjust division of ownership and profits accordingly (see compensation section below).
How much vacation is allowed?
Will this be a full time role for each partner or are partners allowed to conduct other types of businesses outside of the partnership? If partners are given more flexibility, there should be a provision specifying that other ventures cannot compete with the business.

Contributions
Next, you want to determine what each partner is bringing to the business in terms of cash investment, physical property (equipment, office space etc), and intellectual/other types of property (software code, client lists etc.)
Once you have listed everything out, you should outline how that property will be owned and used. Here are some examples:

Personal Property Example: You are starting a landscaping business and one of the partners contributes a lawnmower. Does that mower become the property of the business?
Client List Example: You are starting brokerage firm and one of the partners brings clients with them from a previous job.  Does 100 % of the revenue from those clients flow into the business?
Intellectual Property Example: You and your partners launch an online business, and one partner contributes software code.  Is that code now owned by the business? Can other partners modify it?

Ownership Split
Now that you have decided on responsibilities, workload, and which partners are contributing what to the business, you can come to an agreement on how ownership is going to be shared in the business.  
A 50/50 ownership, as Dan Shapiro explains further in this post, is not always the way to go. If a partner is doing any of the following, that typically merits their getting a larger ownership share in the business:

One partner has contributed to a significantly larger amount of property to the business.
The partner thought of the original business concept and/or developed a beta product, secured a patent, or completed another critical first step.
Working full time while other partners are working part time.
The partner has successfully raised venture capital funding. 

Compensation/Distributions of Profits and Losses
Partners are not paid salaries. They receive distributions from the profits of the business. If there are no profits, says Michael Boutros, a lawyer and partner at Krevolin & Horst, LLC, then there are generally no distributions.
An exception to this is something called “guaranteed payments,” which is compensation that’s paid and guaranteed to a partner without regard to the profits and losses of a partnership. This is like a taking a salary. The IRS has certain rules and restrictions regarding the payment and treatment of guaranteed payments, say Boutros, so small business owners should consult with a lawyer and tax professional.
This section should answer the following questions:

Do you plan on reinvesting profits back into the business?
At what point do you plan on taking out profits and distributing them to the partners?
How and when will profits and losses be divided up amongst the owners?  Often, it’s based on contributions and ownership. For example, someone who contributes 60 % of the property to a business will typically own 60 % of the business and receive 60 % of the profits/losses. However, the setup may be different for your business if, for instance, one partner works a lot more than others or has more responsibilities.
Will you offer guaranteed payments? If so, to whom, when, and how much?

Partner Disputes
Being able to discuss and come to an agreement on differences of opinion is a must for any business to move forward and grow. Most of the time, collaboration on day to day issues happens seamlessly. However, disputes are inevitable, and when the contested issues affect the future of the business, the agreement should lay out a method for resolution.
One common mistake small businesses make, says Boutros, is to give each owner an equal say in the business without including a tie breaker. Boutros explains, “When two 50-50 partners inevitably develop diverging views on a major company decision–whether to purchase a new building, or to invest in a new international division–the company reaches an impasse that impedes its long-term viability.” Here are some better ways to handle partner disputes:

The CEO has the final say.
One partner has the final say on a particular part of the business.  For example, on hiring and firing disputes, it may be the CEO; for product development disputes, the partner who is in charge of product may have the final say.
Vote based on ownership. For instance, someone owning 60 % of the business would have more of a say than someone owning 40 % of the business.
Majority vote for businesses with an odd number of partners.
Partners agree to use an outside mentor to resolve disputes.
Partners agree to use an outside advisory board.

Other more formal options are:

Mediation – Working with a professional mediator can help partners come to an agreement on issues that they were not able to resolve alone.  For more on this option, see this article.
Arbitration – If you are not able to come to an agreement through mediation then arbitration, which binds the partners to the decision made by the arbitrator, is the next option before going to court.  For more on this option, see this article.
Litigation – If things become too contentious and the business is not able to move forward, you can sue your business partner. This is usually a long and expensive process however, and one that will probably sour your relationship with the partner forever.

Business Authority
This section should answer the following questions:

Contracts: Does each partner have the authority to sign contracts on behalf of the business? If so, those contracts will bind all partners.
Debt: Is the business going to have a credit card, credit line, a loan?  Keep in mind here that, depending on the business structure that you choose, each partner may be personally liable for this.
Spending: Does a partner have the ability to make purchases without consulting the other partners?  Generally, there is a limit that is set in the agreement above which point the partner must obtain permission from the other partners.

Partner Death/Disability
What happens if a partner dies or becomes unable to participate at the same level because of a disability?  Most business owners probably do not want their deceased partner’s heirs to be their new business partners. To prevent these types of issues a buy sell agreement will be included in most business partnership agreements. A buy sell agreement allows remaining partners to buy out the partner who is disabled or who passed away. Buy sell agreements also usually cover partner divorces to prevent a divorcee’s ex-spouse from becoming a business partner. 
You should also look into key person insurance (aka key man insurance). This type of insurance enables the business to survive the loss of a key person. The insurance company will pay out a benefit to the business in case an owner or key executive passes away or becomes disabled. 
Partner Exit
Answer the following questions:

Voluntary Exit: What happens if a partner wants to leave the partnership and pursue other interests? This is usually covered by a buy sell agreement.
Involuntary Exit: Under what circumstances can a partner be forced to leave the business?

New Partners
What is the process for deciding on bringing in a new partner?  Majority vote?  Some other method?  Here is a great article on the topic from attorney Matt Dickstein.
Selling the Business
Under what circumstances can the business be sold?  This likely goes back to the buy sell agreement.
Bottom Line
Creating a business partnership agreement is a necessity for a small business with multiple owners. The agreement will cover the good times and bad times in your business. It covers how the business will be managed, how profits will be divided, and how disputes will be resolved. With a good partnership agreement under your belt, you can focus on running and growing your business!

Are you interested in raising money from investors or in getting a business loan? The options and strategies are quite different depending on which path you choose.
For debt financing, I suggest reading our article Startup Business Loans: The 9 Best Options for some tips on how you might go about financing a new business.

If you’re considering going into business with a friend, or several friends, you’re joining in a basic American dream—running your own show, being your own boss, and hopefully gaining some control over your economic destiny.
Before you take the plunge, however, you should take a step back and consider whether forming a partnership makes sense. We mean this in two ways. First, are you ready to start a shared business of any kind? While there are great benefits to shared ownership, it can also create stress—and it will definitely require you to work very closely with your co-owners. Before you get started, it makes good sense to take a very close look at your own willingness to be that intimately involved with your prospective partners.
Second, if you decide that you want to start a shared-ownership business, what legal form should that business take? A partnership is only one of several ways you can structure a shared-ownership business. Before you invest the time and energy drafting a partnership agreement, you should carefully consider whether another ownership structure—such as a corporation or a limited liability company—might better suit your business.
This chapter will help you answer both questions. If you decide, after careful consideration, that forming a partnership is the best way to realize your business and personal goals, the rest of this book will help you draft a partnership agreement that will serve your business well for years to come.

Sharing Ownership of a Business
The advantages of having one or more co-owners can be tremendous, but so can the headaches of trying to make group decisions, agree on business goals, run your company together, and distribute the work, profits, and debt fairly. Whether shared ownership is right for you depends both on your own personality and on the partners you’ve chosen.
 
Advantages and Drawbacks
Shared ownership has many benefits. The chemistry and spirit of two, three, or more minds working together can often produce ­exciting results. There’s more energy and enthusiasm, and—at least as important—more cash, skills, and resources. And it’s a lot easier to arrange for time off if you have partners than if you’re trying to run a business all by yourself.
But for all of those who dream of doing their own thing—and who hasn’t?—only a relatively small number will be committed (or nutty) enough to invest the love and labor necessary to get a small business off the ground. Those who do will almost inevitably go through periods of stress, and their survival will depend on their ability to quickly and competently master all sorts of unfamiliar skills and tasks. In a partnership business, there are also the stresses and risks that can come with shared ownership. Money can be incendiary stuff. Before you decide to throw in your financial lot with others, you need to make sure you’re willing and able to become involved that intimately with each other. 
In a shared business, your co-owners will make decisions that directly affect your life. Of course, there are steps you can take to put some limits on this, such as requiring decisions to be made by the whole group or limiting the authority of one owner to act for others. But ultimately, sharing a business requires you to give up some control. Shared ownership allows you to share the burdens of your business, but it also requires you to share the responsibilities. If that doesn’t sound like you, a shared-ownership business probably isn’t the right call.
 
Choosing the Right Partners
The most important assets of any shared business are the co-owners’ competence, determination to work hard, and the trust they have in one another. Of course, your business partners must share your dream, but they must also be willing to share the work. Of course, you and your partners should get along well personally, but that’s not enough. You must also have compatible work styles, have similar expectations about how much each of you will do for the business, and have the same goals for your business’s future.
Partnerships are (very) human enterprises. While we can’t tell you exactly who you should pick as a partner, we can tell you that not every friendship—or every romantic relationship—makes a good business partnership. Our experience has taught us that there are a few questions prospective partners should consider before throwing in their lot with one another:
• Do you all understand and agree that you’re going to run a business with the aim of making a decent profit? Any money-making enterprise qualifies as a business. If any would-be partners are nonbusiness types who simply aren’t comfortable with that, you (and they) don’t want to be part of the same partnership.
• How long have you known each other? We’ve seen some new friendships crumble under the stress of running a business together. Don’t enter any partnership casually.
• Are all prospective partners roughly on the same economic footing? If not, how do you feel about the possibility that some partners’ decisions may be based not on the business’s economic realities, but on their own outside financial resources or needs?
• How’s your chemistry? There are no rules at all here. Sometimes, people with different temperaments work out very well as partners. And sometimes, people who are longtime friends with very similar personalities can’t develop a harmonious business relationship. Probably, the best you can do is ask yourself whether you can imagine being in a close business relationship with your prospective partners ten or more years from now. If you can’t, think twice about going forward.
 
A Personal Note
If you’re feeling a bit overwhelmed about starting a shared business, you’re certainly not alone. But we’re confident that you’ll find—as we have—that along with the hard work and unavoidable stresses of running a shared business, there’s a lot of excitement and freedom as well.
Both of us grew up on the East Coast, went off to college, and emerged, like so many others, unsure about “what we wanted to do.” We considered lots of choices; both of us drifted to law school with the vague hope that the law would give us some skills useful in making the world a better place. How we each became disillusioned with that dream is another story; the point here is that through all of our dreaming and planning, neither of us ever imagined that we’d wind up as proprietors of small businesses, full-fledged members of the “free enterprise system.” But that’s what happened. We’ve experienced both great ­satisfaction and some very real pain in running our own shops. We’ve been through our complete ­beginner stage and have made most of the routine mistakes, as well as pioneering some lulus. Somehow, we’ve survived it all to realize that doing our own thing at Nolo gives us a sense of freedom and self-worth, at the same time that we make a good living—a combination that’s hard to match in this increasingly bureaucratized world.
We know we are not alone in finding a measure of satisfaction in jointly participating in a small business. In the process of putting this book together, we talked to many people who have successfully created their own small business partnerships. We’ve been told time and again about the satisfaction, and even joy, derived from providing a product or service that genuinely interests the provider and benefits the consumer. We’ve also learned a lot about how people relate to—and may even gain some satis­faction from—the tough competition that’s so much a part of the world of small business, where survival depends on your ability to offer something that people really want and need. And most of all, we’ve been reminded constantly that although money is important, it’s not usually the primary ­reason people organize their own businesses. It’s gratifying to talk with partners more concerned with the quality of work and a sensible life than the top dollar. Happily, we’ve found that integrity and ­creativity—even altruism—are alive and well in small business America.
 
Business Structure Options
There are five common legal forms of business ownership:
• partnership
• sole proprietorship
• corporation
• limited liability company, and
• limited partnership.
(Some states have distinct subcategories of these five, especially partnerships. For example, there’s a creature called a “mining partnership” used for mining and oil ventures in some states. In this chapter, we’ll just concern ourselves with the basic forms.)
To help you choose the business structure that best suits your needs, this chapter explains the legal and practical consequences of each option. Of course, our emphasis is on the partnership form, but don’t assume that it must be the right one for you without exploring your alternatives. We’ve received letters from readers of earlier editions telling us that after reading these materials, they decided to form a small corporation or a sole proprietorship. That’s great; the time to consider your options is here at the start. Once you’ve created your legal form, it takes some time and trouble to change it.
 
Partnerships
In this section, we give you a quick look at the nature of partnerships, so that you can compare them to corporations, limited liability companies, and sole proprietorships. Later in this chapter, we’ll explore the partnership legal form in more depth.
Here are five key points about partnerships:
1. A partnership is a business owned by two or more people.
2. Each partner can perform all acts that are necessary to operate the business, including hiring employees and spending or borrowing money. (However, you can put some limits on a partner’s authority, as explained in “A Closer Look at Partnerships,” below.) Each partner is personally liable for all debts incurred by the business. This is a vital reason why your partners must be trustworthy. If a creditor has a claim against your partnership and the partnership doesn’t have enough assets to satisfy that claim, the personal assets of any partner can be taken to pay the business debts.
3. Partners share in profits or losses, in whatever proportion they’ve agreed on. Partnerships themselves don’t pay taxes (although they do file an annual tax form). The partners report their share of profits or losses on their individual tax returns, as part of their regular income.
4. Partnerships begin when two or more people form a business. Although technically a part­nership ends if one partner leaves, you can agree at the beginning that the partnership business will continue to be run by the remaining partners, if there are any. If you want the business to continue after a partner leaves—and almost all partnerships work this way—you’ll need to work out what will happen to the interest of the departing partner. Who can, or must, buy that interest? How will you determine a fair price for that interest? (See Chapter 5.)
5. The owners normally have a written partnership agreement specifying their respective rights and responsibilities. The purpose of this agreement is to cover all major issues that may affect the partnership, from the manner of dividing profits and losses to management of the business to buyout provisions in case a partner leaves or dies. This agreement does not have to be filed with any government agency, and no official approval is required to start the partnership. (There are different rules for limited partnerships; see Chapter 9.)
 




History Lesson #1




Partnerships date to the beginning of recorded history. References are made to partnerships in the Babylonian Code of Hammurabi, approximately 2300 BC. The Jews, around 2000 BC, a pastoral (not a commercial) people, evolved a form of landsharing or grazing partnership called a “shutolin.” Later, commercial Jewish partnerships evolved from trading caravans




 
The Sole Proprietorship
A sole proprietor means, as the words say, that there’s one owner of the business. The owner may hire (and fire) employees. The owner may even arrange for employees to receive a percentage of the business profits as part of their wages, but he or she remains the sole owner. The owner—and the owner alone—is personally liable for all the debts, taxes, and liabilities of the business, including claims made against employees acting in the course and scope of their employment. The business does not pay taxes as an entity; instead, the owner reports and pays taxes on the profits of the business on his or her own individual income tax returns.

Personality Traits and the Sole Proprietorship
Quite simply, the main advantage of a sole proprietorship is that there is only one boss (you), so potential managerial conflicts are eliminated, except for your inner ones. The disadvantages stem from the source—there is only you as owner and boss. If you get sick, want time off, or simply want to share the responsibility of decision making with someone else, you won’t have a lot of flexibility.
Whether you should be the only boss is often a question of temperament. Some people like, and need, to run the whole show and always chafe in a shared ownership situation, while others want, need, or at least appreciate the resources and strengths, from cash to camaraderie, that co-owners can bring. The best advice we can give you here is that old axiom—know thyself.
 
Sole Proprietorship Compared With Shared Ownership
In deciding whether to operate a business as a sole proprietorship or adopt a form of shared ownership such as a partnership, a business organizer may be inclined to choose shared ownership to involve key employees in the future of the business. While it may make great sense to allow important employees to become co-owners, either as partners or stockholders, this is not the only way to reward dedicated and talented employees. A profit-sharing agreement within the framework of the sole proprietorship may be a good alternative approach, at least until you see if you and the key employees are compatible over the long term.
 
Example 1:
Eric is a self-employed architect. He gets a big job and advertises for help, soon hiring Frank and Samantha to assist with the drafting. Halfway through the new job, things are working so well that Eric decides to bid on an even larger job. He knows that to complete this new job successfully, he’ll have to depend a great deal on his two assistants. Eric first considers making Frank and Samantha junior partners. However, because he has only known them for a few months, and because Samantha is pondering moving to the other side of the country, Eric decides that it makes more sense to put off the partnership decision and offer each 15% of his profit on the deal, over and above their regular salary.
 
Example 2:
Susan decides to open a sandwich shop near a busy college campus. She wants her friend Ellen to work with real enthusiasm but, because money is short, can only pay her a modest salary to start. To ensure Ellen’s continued dedication, Susan offers her a bonus of a profit-sharing agreement under which Ellen gets 25% of all net profits.
 
Terminating a Sole Proprietorship
When the owner dies, a sole proprietorship ends. By contrast, in theory at least, a partnership, a small corporation, or a limited liability company can continue under the direction of the surviving owners. Practically, however, a sole proprietor who wants his or her business to continue after its owner dies can leave the remaining assets (after paying off its debts, of course) to someone who will continue its operations.
 
caution
Sole proprietors need to plan for probate. If the owner of a sole proprietorship leaves business assets through the owner’s will, the probate process can take up to a year and make it difficult for the inheritors to either operate or sell the business (or any of its assets). To avoid this, small business owners should consider transferring the business into a living trust, a legal device which avoids probate and allows the assets to be transferred to the inheritors promptly. (For more information on creating a living trust for a business, see Plan Your Estate, by Denis Clifford (Nolo).)
 
Corporations
A corporation is a legal entity separate from its owners, who are its shareholders. Traditionally, the chief attraction of running a small business as a corporation is that the shareholder owners enjoy limited personal liability for business debts or obligations. Ordinarily, each shareholder stands to lose only what he or she has invested in the corporation. Other assets, such as the owners’ houses and investments, can’t be grabbed to pay business debts.
Because of the development of the limited liability company (LLC), discussed below, the corporate form of ownership has lost much of its appeal for shared owners of a small business. Limited liability companies also offer owners limited personal liability but avoid some of the drawbacks of organizing either as a partnership or a corporation. We examine those drawbacks below. Here, we’ll take a brief closer look at how the corporate form works.
In theory, a corporation involves three groups: those who direct the business (directors), those who run the business (officers), and those who invest in it (shareholders). In the case of a small business corporation, these three groups are often one and the same person. Indeed, one-person corporations are legal and common in many states.
A corporation is created by filing articles of incorporation with the appropriate state agency, usually the secretary or department of state. Once this is done, the corporation comes into legal existence. The directors are responsible for the overall supervision of the business. The officers (president or chief executive officer (CEO), vice president, treasurer, and secretary) are in charge of the day-to-day operation of the business. The shareholders are the owners, who have invested in the business by buying stock.
The directors normally adopt corporate bylaws, which cover the basic rules of how the business will actually operate. Practically speaking, for a small business, bylaws can serve the same purpose as a partnership agreement. However, many shareholders of small corporations also enter into a shareholders’ agreement, which usually spells out the circumstances under which a shareholder may sell his or her stock and describes what happens to a shareholder’s shares if he or she dies, becomes disabled, gets divorced, or retires.
Unlike partnerships, sole proprietorships, and LLCs, corporations must also hold formal director and shareholder meetings and document major corporate decisions in corporate minutes. If corporations don’t hold these meetings or prepare records of these corporate decisions, the owners risk losing their limited liability.
Corporations are taxed first at the business entity level and, then again, when corporate owners pay personal income tax on corporate profits distributed to them. But this double taxation can be minimized or avoided if the owners pay out profits to themselves as tax-deductible salaries and benefits.
Corporations have emerged in the last 150 years as the major organizational form through which large-scale international capitalism does business. Because corporations seem to be such a grown-up, big-time way of doing business, some people starting a small business are convinced that they, too, need a corporation—or at least that there must be great advantages to doing business in corporate form.
As we discuss below, however, for many new owners of small businesses, immediately forming a corporation isn’t necessary. Usually, the corporate form of doing business provides no real advantage over a partnership or limited liability company and sometimes can be disadvantageous. And remember, whichever legal ownership form you decide upon, you’ll have to resolve the same basic issues regarding power between the owners.
 
The Limited Liability Company
There’s a relatively new legal entity in the business world, called a limited liability company (LLC). LLCs are available in every state and they can be structured as multi- or single member entities, so even sole proprietors can choose to organize as an LLC.
The LLC attempts to blend many of the benefits of a partnership and a corporation. The business can choose to be treated as a partnership, taxwise, which means all profits are taxed at the individual level rather than the business level. But LLCs also permit owners to obtain a key attraction of a corporation—limited liability. An LLC owner’s personal assets cannot be taken to pay business debts. And, LLCs are generally not required to observe the same formalities as a corporation—they don’t have to elect directors, hold annual shareholders meetings, or even prepare formal minutes of meetings or business decisions, unless they agree to do so in writing.
To form an LLC, the owners prepare articles of organization, a document quite similar in form and content to corporate articles of incorporation. Articles of organization include basic facts, such as the LLC name, principal office address, agent and office for receiving legal papers, and the names of the initial owners.
An LLC’s articles of organization must be filed with the appropriate state agency, usually the department or secretary of state’s office. In some states, you must also pay a fee, which can range from about $200 to as much as $900, depending on the state. (In California, for example, a new LLC pays a filing fee of $70, but must also pay a minimum of $800 annually.) Most states require an LLC to file an annual form or report. (This is in addition to state-required LLC income tax returns, discussed below.) Further, a number of states impose annual fees on LLCs and a few impose annual franchise taxes.
Like a partnership, an LLC also should have a written agreement (called an “operating agreement”), which defines the basic rights and responsibilities of the LLC owners. To prepare a sound operating agreement, LLC owners must deal with the same issues as partners preparing a partnership agreement, including how much capital each member will contribute to get the business going, how much each person will work for the business, to whom departing members can sell their share of the business, and how that share is to be valued.

Like shareholders of a corporation, the owners of an LLC generally are not liable for company debts beyond the amount each has invested in the company. However, unlike a corporation, an LLC is not subject to income tax as a business entity unless its owners choose to be taxed this way. Usually, owners choose to be treated like a partnership for tax purposes with LLC profits “flowing through” to the owners, meaning that any profits the business earns are subject to federal income tax only on the owner’s personal tax return.
For most small businesses organized as LLCs, the owners are also the managers of the business. However, an LLC can also be used as a type of investment device, in which many or even most owners do not take an active role in business management but instead are passive investors. The business is run by a small group of the owners, called a “management group” or “board of managers.” This use of the LLC form is similar to a limited partnership, discussed in Chapter 11. In this type of LLC, the manager-owners must comply with federal and state securities laws when selling interests in the LLC to passive investors. To be sure you know how to comply with the securities laws, you must do careful legal research yourself or see a securities lawyer.
 
 




Business Structures for Professionals




        Some professions are regulated by state law and cannot use simple, ordinary partnerships. For example, under almost all states’ laws, doctors cannot form a general partnership. Other health care professionals—dentists, nurses, opticians, optometrists, pharmacists, and physical therapists —are similarly regulated. So are some other professions, normally including psychologists, accountants, engineers, and veterinarians. The scope and details of regulation vary from state to state.
However, laws in every state permit shared owner­ship by regulated professionals using different business structures. They can form a “professional corporation” or a “professional service corporation,” and, in some states, a “professional limited liability company.” Also, in some states, certain types of partnerships are allowed, sometimes called “limited liability partnerships.” If you are in a regulated profession, see a lawyer.
Whatever legal form a shared professional busi­ness takes, the owners must resolve the same basic questions that are involved in setting up a partner­­ship: who contributes what, how work is allocated, how profits are shared, and what happens if an owner leaves. Though you’ll eventually need a lawyer to prepare the formal ownership documents, you’ll benefit by working through these issues yourselves, before seeking legal help




 




Converting a Partnership to an LLC




It’s fully legal to change the structure of a business from a partnership to an LLC at any time. Essentially, the LLC articles of organization that you must create and file to convert a partnership are the same as those required to create an LLC from scratch. The partnership agreement, perhaps with minor technical modifications, can be renamed the LLC operating agreement. Once a partnership has been converted into an LLC, the owners have limited liability for all future business debts and obligations. The creation of the LLC does not, however, wipe out the owners’ (the former partners’) responsibility for any previous partnership debts or obligations.




 
Limited Partnerships
A limited partnership is a special kind of legal animal that, in some circumstances, combines the best attributes of a partnership and a corporation. Its advantage as a business structure is that it provides a way for business owners to raise money without having to give up managerial control or go to the trouble of creating a corporation and issuing stock. (You’ll find more detailed information on limited partnerships in Chapter 9.)
A limited partnership must have at least one “general partner,” the person or entity that really runs things. The general partner can be another partnership, an LLC, a corporation, or a human being. There can also be more than one general partner. However many there are, each general partner has the rights and potential liabilities normally involved in any partnership—such as management powers for the business and personal liability for business losses or debts.
Limited partners, on the other hand, have no management powers, but neither are they personally liable for the debts of the partnership. Limited partners are basically investors. The return they receive for their investment is defined in the partnership agreement. If the business fails, the most that the limited partners can lose is what they invested in the business.
 
Example:
Anthony and Janice plan to purchase rundown houses, renovate them, then (hopefully) sell them at a good profit. All they lack is the cash to make the initial purchases. To solve this minor difficulty, they first create a general partnership between themselves. Then they establish a limited partnership (with their own partnership as the general partner) and seek others who are willing to put up money for a defined interest in the venture. Janice and Anthony decide that they need $100,000 to get started, and they manage to sell ten limited partnership interests for $10,000 each.
Sometimes, limited partners receive a fixed return on their investment. For instance, they might receive “10% interest annually, with principal, to be repaid in three installments over seven years.” Investing in a limited partnership like this is similar to making a loan, except it doesn’t remain an obligation if the partnership business fails. Limited partners aren’t liable for the business’s debts, but they risk losing their entire investment if the partnership goes belly up.
More commonly, instead of a fixed return, limited partners receive a percentage of the profits (assuming the venture makes money) for a specific period of months or years, or even forever.
Limited partnerships can also be a useful means for expanding an existing business to raise money, especially at times when other sources of cash are tight and interest rates are high.
 
Example:
Judith and Aretha have a small picture frame shop that has just begun to prosper after a couple of years on short rations. Believing that the time is now right to expand, the two women spot a much larger store in a much better location, which will allow them to stock a large selection of fine art prints as well as frames. Unfortunately, they don’t have the money they need to finance the move and the larger inventory that it will entail. To solve this problem, they create a limited partnership, offering a $20,000 investor an 8% interest in the total net profits of the store for the next three years as well as the return of the invested capital at the end of that period. They sell four of their limited partnerships, raising $80,000. (As Judith and Aretha’s original partnership agreement didn’t provide for limited partners, they must rewrite it and create a separate limited partnership agreement.)
 
caution
Limited partnership interests are securities. Offering and selling limited partnership interests involves the sale of what’s called a “security.” The most common example of a security is a corporate stock or bond. You must comply with all federal and state securities laws when you offer any limited partnership interest for sale. See Chapter 9 for more information.
 
Legal Formalities of Limited Partnerships
Limited partnerships involve many more legal formalities than general partnerships. In addition to securities laws, limited partnerships are generally subject to other state controls. Setting up and operating a limited partnership is similar in many ways to the process of organizing and operating a small corporation. State law usually requires that a registration certificate be filed with a government agency. The information required on this document varies, depending on state law. Often, partnership and limited partnership agreements must be disclosed, and the names and addresses of all partners and limited partners listed. Failure to comply with state registration requirements can subject the partnership to serious penalties and cause would-be limited partners to lose their limited liability status.
Fortunately, it’s not that difficult to comply with the registration requirements; thousands and thousands of limited partnerships are formed each year. Also, every state except Louisiana has adopted the Uniform Limited Partnership Act, which standardizes both the law and the registration procedures. Many states have adopted the Revised Uniform Partnership Act of 1997, which further streamlines the law in this area.
Restrictions on Limited Partnerships
State law normally imposes restrictions on the availability and use of limited partnership names. (“Limited” or “Ltd.” at the end of a business or partnership name does not automatically mean the entity is a limited partnership—these terms are simply the British equivalent of “Incorporated” and “Inc.” Some U.S. companies include these British terms in their name because they believe it sounds aristocratic.) In addition, these laws govern the manner of calling and holding meetings and may impose many other legal requirements, which apply to the operation of the limited partnership unless alternative rules are clearly spelled out in the partnership agreement.
 




History Lesson #2




In Europe, as in England, partnership law evolved from the customs of merchants, so European civil law regarding partnerships is similar to ours. Civil law recognizes a “societas,” the equivalent of our general partnership, and a “societe en common dite,” the equivalent of our limited partnership.




 
Comparing Partnerships to LLCs and Corporations
No matter which legal form you and your co-owners choose, you must confront and resolve the same day-to-day problems, such as allocating shares of ownership, operating the business, paying salaries and profits, and resolving disputes, among others. Because there are fewer legal formalities to comply with, business owners who form partnerships have more time to focus on questions of their relationship with each other. By contrast, when creating an LLC or a corporation, the owners must file formal documents with the state and observe more technical requirements in their operations, which can sometimes distract the owners from confronting important issues about the way they work together.
One obvious advantage of forming a partnership is that you don’t have to pay costly filing and other fees, as you would to form a corporation. But, overall, most business owners conclude (as we have) that the advantages and disadvantages of these three ways to organize your business are not as significant as many advocates of one or the other approach would have you believe.
For example, suppose you and two friends are co-owners of a computer repair business. It’s clearly prudent to decide what will happen if one person unexpectedly quits or dies. A common method of handling this is to create a “buyout” clause, enabling the remaining owners to purchase (usually over time) the interest of the departing owner. If the business is owned as a partnership, the buy­out clause you devise will normally be included in the partnership agreement. If the business is an LLC, the clause will be in the owners’ operating agreement. In a corporation, this clause is normally put in the bylaws or in a shareholders’ agreement. But the practical reality will be the same.
Below we look in depth at key issues concerning the form of ownership of a shared business. We’ll start here by summarizing the most important points:
• The partnership form is the simplest and least expensive of the three forms to create and maintain.
• For small, shared ownership businesses that face risks of major money lawsuits, the LLC is usually the best initial choice.
• For most other types of small shared ownership businesses, the partnership form is normally the best choice. If business growth makes a different structure more desirable, the partners can easily convert to an LLC or a corporation.
• Occasionally, the corporate form makes sense for a new business. For instance, a corporation may be desirable if the owners want to raise large sums of money from a number of investors.

Steingold (Nolo), and LLC or Corporation? by Anthony Mancuso (Nolo).
 
Limited Liability
Shareholders of an LLC or corporation are not normally personally liable for corporate debts or liability stemming from lawsuits, as long as the LLC or corporation is adequately capitalized (that is, it has sufficient cash or other assets invested). This is called “limited liability.” In partnerships, all partners have open-ended personal liability for all partnership debts. But before you rush to form an LLC or incorporate, you should know that the difference between limited and unlimited liability is often less significant than many people believe.
There are two important forms of liability almost any business must deal with: lawsuits and business debts. To deal with the first possibility, most small business people with common sense, whether incorporated or not, purchase insurance to protect them from the most obvious sorts of liability claims (such as insurance protecting restaurant owners from claims filed by customers who become ill or fall down in the premises). An LLC or a corporation’s limited liability is obviously no substitute for business liability insurance, since limited liability doesn’t protect the assets of the LLC or corporation itself from being wiped out by a successful claim. However, limited liability can be a valuable protection if a small business is engaged in a high-risk activity and insurance coverage is unavailable or too expensive.
Many—perhaps millions—of American busi­nesses, including many retailers and small service providers, do not normally face serious risk of liability stemming from their business (aside from things like vehicle accidents, which obviously can and should be covered by insurance). For instance, businesses as varied as a shoe store, a graphic design outfit, a small religious publishing company, or an ice-cream parlor are very unlikely to face a lawsuit for large sums of money. By contrast, other types of business—for instance, manufacturers or businesses that handle toxic materials—have a much higher risk of liability claims. And because they do, it’s often prohibitively expensive for the owners of these types of businesses to purchase insurance to cover potential lawsuit judgments. Some other types of high-risk businesses include:
• Accountants. There have been some huge, successful claims against accounting firms for negligence. In some of these situations, accountants were found to be liable when they helped businesses conceal large losses or other damaging financial facts, thus costing investors and suppliers millions.
• Lawyers. Law firms can also face immense financial exposure for negligent, or worse, conduct. This conduct can range from actively participating in, or at least negligently abetting, fraudulent behavior by a client to causing financial injury to the law firm’s own client.
• Architects and Construction Companies. In the day of multimillion-dollar judgments for injured persons and frequent problems with cost overruns, everyone in the construction field is vulnerable to suit for all sorts of reasons.
• Real Estate. Increasingly, buyers of property who later discover undisclosed defects—everything from termites, water in the basement, land shifting, or a nasty next-door neighbor—sue both the seller and the real estate people who represent the seller.
This list is intended to be instructive, not exhaus­tive. We can’t give you definitive advice about the liability/lawsuit risks of the type of business you plan to engage in. Only you can decide how serious these risks are and what kinds of steps you can sensibly take to eliminate or at least minimize them. The higher the risk, the more desirable an LLC or corporation. And, obviously, the lower the risks, the more a partnership agreement, combined with basic liability insurance (such as for “slip and fall” accidents on the business premises) and vehicle insurance, should safely protect you.
But what about debts? If the business loses money, as lots of new ventures do, doesn’t limited liability protect individual owners from having personal assets taken as part of an LLC or corporate bankruptcy or liquidation? Again, while the answer is “yes” in theory, in reality limited liability protection is likely to be immaterial. Why? Because lenders and major creditors are well aware of the rules of limited owner liability. Banks, landlords, and other savvy businesspeople routinely require the owners of a new small business (whether a partnership, an LLC, or a corporation) to personally guarantee any loan or significant extension of credit made to the business. By doing this, LLC or corporate owners put themselves on much the same legal footing with their creditors as if they ran their business as a partnership. However, we should note that because many providers of routine business supplies and services do not require a personal guarantee from LLC or corporation owners, these owners can escape personal liability for these types of debts if the business becomes insolvent.
Here’s another important restriction on the limited liability of corporate and LLC owners: A corpo­ration or LLC must start with a minimally reasonable amount of cash (“capital”) to function in the business world. If the entity is only a shell, without the cash necessary to function, a court may “pierce the corporate veil” and hold individual corporate or LLC owners personally responsible for all the entity’s debts, whether they personally guaranteed them or not. While it is fairly rare for a court to determine that a corporation or LLC was undercapitalized, it can happen, particularly if fraud is involved.
 
Business Continuity
Corporations have “eternal life.” This means that if one (or even all) of the principal owners of a small corporation dies, the corporate entity continues to exist. Partnerships, on the other hand, can dissolve when any partner withdraws or dies. However, this difference is also immaterial in real life. It’s easy, and fully legal, to insert a standard clause in your partnership agreement that provides that the partnership entity continues after one owner leaves or dies.
LLCs are often functionally similar to partner­ships regarding business continuity. As noted, a partnership can technically dissolve when one partner retires, dies, or withdraws. Similarly, some state statutes require members of an LLC to vote to continue the LLC within a specified period of time after a member withdraws or dies; if they do not, the LLC is technically dissolved. Many LLC operating agreements provide that an owner’s departure triggers a vote by the remaining owners on whether to continue the LLC. The effect is that, if the owners wish it, the LLC will continue in business without legal interruption.
Additionally, a few states require LLCs to establish termination dates in their articles of organi­zation. Even in those states, however, the owners can easily keep the business going by filing an amendment to the LLC’s articles of organization extending the date on which the LLC is scheduled to dissolve. Partnership owners do not have to face this hassle, because no state has laws requiring a termination date for a partnership.
If one of the two co-owners of an LLC or small corporation quits or dies, the survivor of the business will face the same issues that would face a surviving partner. No matter what business structure you choose, you’ll want to compensate a departing owner (or his or her heirs) fairly, but you’ll also want to preserve the business for the remaining owners. How is the value of that departing interest to be calculated? How can the remaining owners be assured they’ll have adequate cash to buy out a departing owner? We discuss methods of resolving these problems in Chapter 5. Our point now is simply that you don’t avoid any of them by choosing to form an LLC or a corporation rather than a partnership.
 
caution
A general partnership isn’t the right choice if you want to raise money from people who won’t participate in the business. For larger businesses that need to raise money from outside investors and will comply with complicated federal and state securities registration and sales laws to do so, it can sometimes be psychologically easier to raise capital by selling stock to passive investors than by trying to sell participation in a partnership (which will constitute a limited partnership—see Chapter 9).
 
Transfer of Ownership
Corporate ownership comes in the form of shares that can theoretically be transferred to new owners. By contrast, a partner’s interest cannot be transferred without the consent of all partners unless, as is rarely the case, the partnership agree­ment expressly allows for free transferability. Similarly, an owner of an LLC is usually restricted by state law or the members’ operating agreement (or both) from transferring an ownership interest in the business without the consent of all other owners. But does this legal difference really add up to a practical difference?
The answer is clearly no, for two reasons. First, when it comes to small, closely held corporations, state law often restricts the right of a shareholder to freely transfer shares no matter what the shareholders want. Second, and more importantly, the stock of most small corporations is extremely difficult or even impossible to sell. There is no regular, public market for small business interests. Shares of small corporations are not listed on stock exchanges, and outsiders are rarely interested in working closely with total strangers, particularly if they can’t purchase a majority, controlling interest. Even if the business is doing well, a potential buyer will probably be more interested in purchasing the entire business or profitable business assets (for example, a building, patent invention, inventory, and so on) than one owner’s shares.
Finally, even if the shares or one person’s LLC interest or partnership interest in a small business could be sold to an outside buyer, there are likely to be drawbacks. The success of almost any small business depends on the efforts and skills of a few people. If one of a corporation’s owners can summarily transfer her interest to an outsider, the business and other owners are obviously vulnerable if the new owner has no ability to help the corporation or is unacceptable for any other reason. To protect against this happening, the bylaws or shareholders’ agreement of many small corporations—just like the partnership agreements of most partnerships and operating agreements of LLCs—restrict the right of any owner to sell to a third person and provide that the remaining owners have the option to buy out the interest of any departing owner. So again, the realities of running a small business dictate that the owners take certain similar steps to limit or prevent sales to outside buyers, no matter what the legal form of the business.
 
Business Formalities
No state or federal law or agency requires a partner­ship to file its original agreement or maintain any ongoing paperwork. By contrast, government paperwork and costs are required to start up an LLC or a corporation. An LLC must prepare articles of organization and file them with the secretary or department of state. The costs for the initial filing are modest in most states—typically $100 or so. Some states impose yearly fees or franchise taxes which can be more substantial ($800 in California). Some states also require new LLCs to publish a notice in a local newspaper.
Once it’s operational, an LLC generally does not have to observe the same formalities as a corporation (such as holding annual meetings) but can mostly function with the informality of a partnership. Like a partnership, an LLC can function with exactly the amount of formality—formal meetings, quorum requirements, keeping minutes of meetings, and so on—that the owners want. Most states do, however, require LLCs to file a brief annual report, in addition to any fees or taxes imposed. This annual form usually requires basic business information, such as the name and addresses of the current owner, and the business agent for service of process (legal papers).
Creating and maintaining a corporation is usually more expensive than creating an LLC. Filing incorporation papers costs $100 to $1,000 and up in some states. (For example, in California, the cost is a $100 filing fee and, after the corporation’s first year, a minimum annual franchise tax of $800.) If you hire a lawyer to set up your corporation, the total costs can easily approach $3,000–$5,000, or more. Running a corporation also requires more continuing paperwork, such as organizing and calling annual shareholders and directors meetings, preparing minutes of major decisions, and issuing share certificates. In many states, it is possible to adopt provisions in a corporation’s bylaws that allow the corporation to skip many of these rules and operate relatively informally. (Banks and other financial institutions, however, often demand a properly prepared corporate resolution before approving a loan or other transaction.) However, it remains accurate to say that partnerships normally can be created and operated with much less formality.

The perceived formality of corporate existence is sometimes said to encourage some people to maintain better records and to engage in more organized management practices. There may be some truth in this, especially when a sole proprietorship is incorporated. But there is no logical reason why a partnership can’t install excellent business controls and practices; in our experience, most successful ones do.

A partnership is not taxed. Partnership net income (profits) is taxed only on the individual partners’ income tax returns. An LLC can choose to be taxed as a partnership or as a small corporation. Most LLCs choose to be taxed in the same way as partnerships.
You might think that partnerships and LLCs enjoy a real advantage over corporations because corporate profits are taxed twice (first at the corporate level and then at the shareholder level), while partnership or LLC income is only taxed once. For small businesses, this distinction usually is immaterial. Small corporations can often avoid double taxation. They can pay out to owners most of what would otherwise be corporate profits in the form of salaries, bonuses, and other fringe benefits (rather than in dividends). As long as the owners actually work in the business and the salaries aren’t outrageously unreasonable, paying the owners salaries as employees is acceptable to the IRS. Because monies paid in salaries, bonuses, Social Security, health plans, and other fringe benefits are deductible business expenses for the corporation, these expenses are not subject to corporate tax. In this way, many small corporations reduce their corporate income to zero, and corporate income is taxed only at the individual level.
In some situations, corporate taxation allows small business people to pay less overall tax on their income by retaining a portion of corporate or LLC profits in the corporation from one year to the next. The individual shareholder owner is taxed only on income received, whether in the form of corporate salary or as profits. The profits retained by the corporation or LLC are also taxed, but at a generally lower rate (15% for the first $50,000 and 25% on the next $25,000) than individual income. In a partnership or an LLC that has chosen to be taxed like a partnership, these retained profits would be taxed as income to the partners at their marginal rate, which will probably be much higher, whether or not they actually received any cash. For businesses that will pay all profits to owner-employees in the form of salaries and benefits, these initial low rates of corporate taxation offer no advantage. However, if your business will need to retain substantial earnings for future operations, incorporating is likely to make economic sense. Corporations can retain profits of up to $250,000 for future needs without question by the IRS. LLCs do not have this right. (The $250,000 corporate retained earnings rule does not apply to certain personal service corporations owned by professionals, such as doctors and lawyers, which are limited to $150,000.) And, if the corporation has a valid business reason, it can easily retain much more than $250,000.
Small corporate businesses can also avoid double taxation by electing something called federal “S corporation” status. An S corporation functions like a partnership for income tax purposes. Thus, an S corporation doesn’t pay income taxes on profits; only the shareholders do. You may ask, “Why form an S corporation if you can attain the same tax results with a partnership or LLC?” Good question. The S corporation is rapidly being superseded by the LLC, which offers both principal attractions of an S corporation—limited liability and pass-through taxation. Further, LLCs are far more flexible than S corporations, which have to comply with complicated IRS rules.
Finally, a corporation or an LLC can establish a tax-deductible pension and/or profit-sharing plan for all its workers, including working shareholders and/or managing owners, while a partnership pension plan is only tax deductible for employees, not for partners themselves. However, this difference, too, is often more apparent than real, since partners are eligible for individual profit-sharing retirement plans, which tend to equalize tax treatment. 
Termination
When a corporation is dissolved and distributes appreciated property to shareholders, the gain (increase) in value is taxed both to the corporation and to the shareholders. This means that it can potentially be more expensive to close down a profitable corporation than a partnership or an LLC that has elected to be taxed like a partnership. 
Summing Up
We come back to where we started: For many, perhaps most, people who are planning a shared-ownership business, there are few real-world advantages to forming an LLC or a corporation rather than a partnership. (One exception is for owners of small businesses in fields where there’s a plausible risk of lawsuits against the business for large amounts of money.)
A partnership agreement focuses on the basic issues that must be resolved to establish a shared-ownership business with a minimum of red tape and cost. Therefore, we generally recommend the partnership form for shared-ownership small businesses that are unlikely to face large debts or the threat of scary lawsuits.
We hope you enjoyed this material.  The rest of this chapter is available when you purchase the book.
