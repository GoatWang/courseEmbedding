“You can't help getting older, but you don't have to get old."— comedian George BurnsA few weeks ago, my business partner and I were asked to present an investment idea at the Manual of Ideas “Wide Moat” conference. Warren Buffett introduced the concept of a “wide moat” business years ago -- the business whose characteristics are so strong it stands a good chance of fending off the various threats that capitalism brings to bear against it. While many folks shy away from the complex pharmaceutical ecosystem, we focused on a corner of the market that is fairly easy to understand: pharmaceutical distributors. 






                        Jonathon Fite                     






Pharmaceutical distributors play behind the scenes in this very large industry. There are huge complexities with insurance companies like United HealthCare, pharmacy benefit managers like Express Scripts, retail pharmacies like CVS and hospitals like HCA -- let alone the prospects of which drug Merck or Pfizer will successfully bring to market. But nearly all of the prescription drugs sold in the United States go through one of three largest pharma distribution companies.See, pharmacies and hospitals don’t actually keep a lot of inventory on hand, which if you think about it makes sense given the high cost of prescription drugs. The typical hospital or pharmacy relies very strongly on distributors to supply them just in time, which is a best practice for good inventory management.If a patient in a hospital, for example, needs medication, odds are that that medicine served to that patient that day made its way from a distribution center to the hospital that very same day. Distributors are an essential cog in the broader pharmaceutical ecosystem.The pharma industry also benefits from several powerful tailwinds. The first is health care innovation that creates more and more new medicines to treat more and more diseases, which creates a larger addressable market.  On top of this, the industry benefits from favorable demographics. While many other industries such as consumer products see demographics as a big drag on their earnings, the pharmaceutical industry is the opposite. It’s really helped by the aging population, and baby boomers are entering their peak prescription drug consumption years. Prescriptions also make up a larger and larger portion of all health care spending, and that’s projected to rise further in coming years.While the drugmakers, insurers and pharmacies all tend to have very high margins, distribution businesses have thin operating margins, typically less than 3 percent. To survive, they must be lean and efficient.  On the surface, the low margins are not that compelling. But some of these distributors generate high returns on capital. In other words, for every dollar invested in the business, they generate a handsome return on that investment. The key is the combination of strong cash flows and extreme focus on efficiency when it comes to transportation, inventory turnover and warehouse management.  One of these businesses in particular caught our eye.  In the early 2000s, the company traded at roughly 33 times earnings per share (EPS) -- an expensive multiple of earnings. Investors were clearly expecting lots of growth from the business in the years ahead. Over the next 10 years, the management team did the hard work of integrating a large merger and smaller tuck-in acquisitions while paying down debt, resulting in EPS growth of nearly 18 percent over the decade. Strong growth indeed.Yet, the share price went nowhere. The multiple fell from 33 times EPS in the early part of the decade to around 11 times EPS after the financial crisis. Even though the earnings were much higher, investors were paying much less for the future prospects. Yet, over the next six years, earnings tripled again and investors finally began to notice.  But during the last election cycle, the rising burden of health care costs led pharmaceutical companies to become a bit of a punching bag in the political world. Very aggressive price increases by a variety of pharmaceutical companies such as Valeant, Mylan and its EpiPen, and the infamous Martin Shkreli, who raised the price of his drug by 5,000 percent, created a series of congressional hearings and a great deal of political scrutiny on the pharma industry.But distribution companies, with their razor-thin margins, would be difficult to label as greedy businesses making abnormal profits. They are actually really efficient. If you call them anything, they are part of the solution for the high cost of health care, not part of the problem. They are not really a politically sensitive part of the value chain.But other players in the value chain such as pharmaceutical manufacturers may be “overearning” from their vested pricing practices. Pharmaceutical benefits managers (PBMs) also have much higher margins but less clear value-add. These players might experience margin compression in the years ahead versus the thin-margined distributors who likely would be much less affected.Of course, Amazon could potentially disrupt yet another industry. There has been some speculation about Amazon wanting to enter the pharmacy arena, and this speculation intensified after the announcement of the Amazon-Whole Foods deal.But Amazon has been experimenting with grocery sales for many years, piloting grocery delivery prior to the Whole Foods deal. There has been much less discussion by Amazon on the pharmaceutical front.  One aspect to consider here is that pharmaceuticals occupy a very regulated space and Amazon’s disruptive success has been in much less regulated or unregulated industries. Amazon has done less well in highly regulated industries such as alcohol, for example.   Pharmaceuticals have intense regulatory scrutiny because of the presence of narcotic drugs and the importance of not letting drugs escape the inventory chain. As a result, drugs require much more special handling than the typical distribution center would have.  If Amazon were to enter the space, we believe it would not be able to leverage its existing distribution infrastructure, but would either have to replicate it or perhaps face a build-versus-buy decision in the distribution segment. Amazon may choose to focus on other parts of the pharma value chain instead.  Last month it was reported that Amazon was in the process of building its own in-house pharmacy benefit manager to service its own employees. Just as Amazon did with Amazon Web Services, where its in-house IT platform used to service Amazon’s retail platform eventually grew to become an external IT provider to the broader marketplace, an analogy has been drawn that perhaps Amazon might grow out its own pharmacy benefit manager and eventually try to serve customers beyond that.  This is another reason why we see the PBM space as the part of the overall ecosystem that is most prone to disruption, rather than the core distribution segment. All of this, of course, is really guesswork.  What we focus on is how the companies we own are exploiting operational, financial and macro catalysts to their advantage. Our current focus is on a company that we believe could double its earnings over the next few years. A high-quality business trading at a price well below the current market multiple allows us to exploit the fact that we are all getting older.  Jonathon Fite is a managing partner of KMF Investments, a Texas-based hedge fund.

                  The class itself is difficult. The only reason why I passed with a C is because he did everything he could to help me out; he really is a great guy. Make sure you don't miss any quizzes b/c those are exactly like the tests, which both are online. He lets you take the quizzes with friends others. EVERY point counts in this class; do extra credit!!

                  Best operations management class. I missed nearly all Friday night quizzes and still made a high B. And we never touched the book. Why go with anyone else? You need to actually show up and take those quizzes for an A though.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
