      networking solutions, today announced that Jacqueline (Jackie) Hourigan 
      Rice, Target’s EVP and chief risk and compliance officer, has joined 
      ADTRAN’s board of directors. Rice assumes the seat of retiring board 
      member Roy Nichols, who has served as a member of ADTRAN’s board of 
      directors since 1994. Nichols has served as lead director and most 
      recently as a member of the Audit, Compensation, and Nominating and

“Roy’s experience, both in business and on the boards of other leading 
      companies, has been invaluable to ADTRAN as we’ve built upon our 
      leadership position in the access network. We’re excited that we’ll have 
      access to his keen insights in his new role as director emeritus,” said 
      Thomas Stanton, chairman and CEO of ADTRAN. “We are happy to have Jackie 
      join our board. She brings a wealth of experience in compliance, vendor 
      management, corporate security, and managing corporate risk. Her 
      perspective will be welcome as we continue to scale manufacturing, sales 
      and operations around the globe.”

      risk, corporate security and corporate compliance and ethics to protect 
      Target and its stakeholders. Prior to joining Target, she served as 
      chief compliance officer and legal counsel for General Motors. With over 
      19 years of legal and compliance experience, Jackie has expertise in all 
      aspects of global compliance, including anti-corruption, export 
      controls, data privacy and ethics. Jackie graduated from the University 
      of Detroit Mercy School of Law, where she was editor-in-chief of the Law 
      Review, and she obtained her undergraduate degree from James Madison 
      College at Michigan State University.

What are the three key missions for her team?

Evolve. Continually innovate the program.
Align. Collaborate with other risk groups.
Empathize. Understand and support the business.

Target names GM exec as chief risk and compliance officer


November 6, 2014 | By Marianne Wilson 













Minneapolis -- Target Corp. has named Jacqueline Hourigan Rice as senior VP, chief risk and compliance officer. Rice is a 17-year veteran of General Motors, where she most recently served as chief compliance officer.

	 

	Rice joins Target effective Dec. 1, and will report directly to company chairman and CEO Brian Cornell. In addition, the company is elevating the position to include centralized oversight of enterprise risk management, compliance, vendor management and corporate security under her leadership.

	 

	“Earlier this year, Target stated our commitment to overhaul our information security and compliance structure and practices, and with that came the need to elevate the role of key positions in the company,” said Cornell. “Jackie is a proven leader with solid global experience and I know she has what it takes to help us move forward in this complex and ever-changing environment.” 

	 

	Rice partly succeeds Ann Scovil, who retired in March as VP of assurance, risk and compliance. But in her expanded role, Rice will also be responsible for corporate security and its suppliers. 

	 

	Earlier this year, Target announced that it was overhauling information security and compliance which included external searches for leaders in those areas.

	 

	In June, the retailer named Brad Maiorino as chief information security officer. He also had been with General Motors.

Target Names Jacqueline Hourigan Rice as Senior Vice President,  Chief Risk and Compliance Officer 









MINNEAPOLIS - November 6, 2014
MINNEAPOLIS (November 6, 2014) — Today, Target Corp. (NYSE: TGT) announced it has hired Jacqueline Hourigan Rice as senior vice president, chief risk and compliance officer.
Rice joins Target effective December 1 and will report directly to Brian Cornell, chairman of the board and chief executive officer of Target. In addition, the company is elevating the position to include centralized oversight of enterprise risk management, compliance, vendor management and corporate security under her leadership.
Rice comes to Target from General Motors Company where she was most recently the chief compliance officer. Her 17-year-career with the company included key global leadership roles in areas that included ethics, compliance and data privacy.
“Earlier this year, Target stated our commitment to overhaul our information security and compliance structure and practices, and with that came the need to elevate the role of key positions in the company,” said Cornell. “Jackie is a proven leader with solid global experience and I know she has what it takes to help us move forward in this complex and ever-changing environment.” 
"Throughout the process I was struck by the unwavering commitment and incredible talent across Target, and I am thrilled to begin this next chapter of my career,” said Rice. “I look forward to shaping the company’s vision on compliance and risk for the future.”
Earlier this year, Target announced that the company was overhauling information security and compliance which included external searches for leaders in those areas.
