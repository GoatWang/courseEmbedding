Thomas B. Hogan, Jr. Joins Supreme Board






June 13, 2012 02:12 PM Eastern Daylight Time



GOSHEN, Ind.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Supreme Industries, Inc. (NYSE Amex: STS), a leading manufacturer 
      of specialized commercial vehicles, including truck bodies, shuttle 
      buses and armored vehicles, today announced that Thomas B. Hogan, Jr. 
      has been elected to its Board of Directors.
    


      Mr. Hogan, 66, is the retired chief operating officer, Northeast 
      practice, of Deloitte & Touche. He enjoyed a nearly 40-year career with 
      the public accounting firm, and at retirement, was responsible for the 
      Greater New York, New Jersey and Connecticut areas, as well as Boston 
      and Philadelphia. Previously, he served as managing partner of the 
      Rochester, Pittsburgh, St. Louis and New Jersey offices of the firm. 
      Hogan also served as director of Energy East Corporation, a public 
      utility holding company, until its sale in 2008. He is a graduate of St. 
      John Fisher College and the Northwestern University Executive Program.
    

      Supreme’s Chairman of the Board Herbert M. Gardner stated: “We are 
      pleased to announce the addition of Mr. Hogan to our Board. His 
      experience serving numerous large, global companies, especially those in 
      the manufacturing sector, along with his strong background in public 
      company accounting and SEC reporting, will be very valuable to Supreme.”

About Supreme IndustriesSupreme Industries, Inc. (NYSE 
      Amex: STS), is a nationwide manufacturer of specialized truck bodies 
      produced to the specifications of its customers. Supreme also 
      manufactures special-purpose “shuttle-type” buses and armored vehicles. 
      The Company's transportation equipment products are used by a wide 
      variety of industrial, commercial and law enforcement customers. News 
      releases and other information on the Company are available on the 
      Internet at: http://www.supremeind.com 
      or http://www.b2i.us/irpass.asp?BzID=1482&to=ea&s=0


      Other than historical facts contained, the matters set forth in this 
      news release are "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of 
      Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E 
      of the Securities Exchange Act, as amended, and reflect the view of 
      management with respect to future events. When used in this report, 
      words such as "believe," "expect," "anticipate," "estimate," "intend," 
      "plan," and similar expressions, as they relate to Supreme or its plans 
      or operations, identify forward-looking statements. Such forward-looking 
      statements are based on assumptions made by, and information currently 
      available to management. Although management believes that the 
      expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are 
      reasonable, it can give no assurance that the expectations reflected in 
      such forward-looking statements are reasonable, and it can give no 
      assurance that such expectations will prove to be correct. Important 
      factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from such 
      expectations include, without limitation, an economic slowdown in the 
      specialized vehicle industry, limitations on the availability of chassis 
      on which Supreme's product is dependent, availability of raw materials, 
      raw material cost increases and severe interest rate increases. 
      Furthermore, Supreme can provide no assurance that any raw material cost 
      increases can be passed on to its customers through implementation of 
      price increases for Supreme's products. The forward-looking statements 
      contained herein reflect the current view of management with respect to 
      future events and are subject to those factors and other risks, 
      uncertainties, and assumptions relating to the operations, results of 
      operations, cash flows and financial position of Supreme. Supreme 
      assumes no obligation to update the forward-looking statements or to 
      update the reasons actual results could differ from those contemplated 
      by such forward-looking statements.

              Earlier this year, when Thomas B. Hogan was still part-ner-in-charge of the New York Office, he set what he thought must be some kind of record: he was in San Francisco at least once a week for 12 straight weeks,
Now in his new Executive Office post to handle practice development and special assignments, he can be expected to travel even more. Rut he will always return to New York because he is one of that breed of native New Yorkers—specifically from Brooklyn—who love the city. "Maybe there's someplace else to live," he says, "but I haven't found it yet," It's only nit-picking to point out that he doesn't really live in New York anymore but in a suburb—Sea Girt, New Jersey—be-cause he lives on Brooklyn Boulevard there.
Mr. Hogan went as far away as the University of Notre Dame for college; but when he joined H&S in 1939, it was in the New York Office, Several years later, after his marriage, the Hogans' growing family forced a move to the suburbs. "We bought a house and for the
first time in my life I actually saw a furnace," Mr. Hogan recalled, rather in the manner of a city boy seeing his first tree without a cage around it.
Thomas Bernard Hogan at 50 is a big, energetic man who so dislikes being late for anything that he arrives in airline terminals three-quarters of an hour ahead of time.
When he moved into his new office June; 5, one floor up at Two Broadway, Mr. Hogan took on a new job with responsibilities whose major certainty was that they would be far-reaching. Whatever specific qualities his task eventually assumes, he has in his background administrative and technical experience that will be useful within the broad outlines of practice develop-ment and special assignments.
With more than 25 years of professional experience in the heart of the financial world, he has shown an ability to make and keep friends all across the country. Specifically in his service to clients, he has had experi-

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
