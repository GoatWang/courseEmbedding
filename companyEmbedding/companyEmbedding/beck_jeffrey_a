5.0 out of 5 starsMust Have Rare Performances For Jeff Beck Group Fans!ByTante Marenon February 13, 2014Being a huge Jeff Beck fan, I was really surprised when I saw exactly what was on this new The Jeff Beck Years 60's-70's dvd. Laser Media must have spent some time finding these fantastic performances of The Jeff Beck Group from about 1972-1973. The quality of the films they found for this dvd are average to above average, with the exception of the Shindig's I'm A Man featuring Jeff Beck with the Yardbirds, which is poor- but all the Shindig films I own are all very poor quality- so this is not an issue.The dvd begins with 4 performances of Jeff Beck with the Yardbirds- all in black and white. The performances are I'm A Man, For Your Love, Heart Full Of Soul and Train Kept A Rollin. There are no references anywhere on the dvd where these performances were taken from, other than the I'm A Man from Shindig. These Yardbird performances are always great, but not rare. After these first 4 black and white Yardbird performances comes the rarest performances I have yet to see of Jeff Beck. The Jeff Beck Group perform 4 songs from about 1972 or 1973- Goin Down, Situation, Got The Feeling and Definitely Maybe. (This is the second Jeff Beck Group- not the first when Jeff Beck started with Rod Stewart, Ron Wood and Mick Waller).To say these Jeff Beck Group performances are beyond tremendous and rare is a huge understatement! The video is just above average, but great to see in color and the sound is above average, but it's just so fantastic to hear them in these 4 live performances! You will see the talented Jeff Beck on his guitar, Bob Tench on vocals, Max Middleton on the piano, Clive Chaman on bass and Cozy Powell on drums. Jeff Beck's guitar work is truly magical especially on the song he wrote- Definitely Maybe.In addition to the Yardbird's and Jeff Beck Group performances are two additional rare performances I have not seen before on dvd. Jeff Beck and Eric Clapton play together doing Further On Up The Road. This is just tremendous! For the last performance, we get to see another rarity of Jeff Beck playing with Upp. They play Down In The Dirt from 1974. Back in 1974, Jeff Beck produced and played guitar on the debut album for Upp- who were a British jazz/rock band. When you see this Upp performance, take notice of the guitar Jeff Beck is playing. This rare 1954 oxblood finish Les Paul guitar is one of Rock's touchstone guitars, which Jeff Beck bought in Memphis after the original buyer had it modified, then decided not to buy it. The sound is simply beautiful beyond words.This 5 Star dvd features Jeff Beck in his youth in the rarest performances I have never seen of The Jeff Beck Group and is well worth buying for any Jeff Beck fan! Here Are The Complete Songs on the dvd:01.) I'm A Man (Yardbirds)02.) For Your Love (Yardbirds)03.) Heart Full Of Soul (Yardbirds)04.) Train Kept A Rollin (Yardbirds)05.) Goin Down (Jeff Beck Group)06.) Situation (Jeff Beck Group)07.) Got The Feeling (Jeff Beck Group)08.) Definitely Maybe (Jeff Beck Group)09.) Further On Up The Road (Jeff Beck and Eric Clapton)10.)

3.0 out of 5 starsGreat to see Jeff Beck's talent on display, but this could have been a lot better.ByDennis Hawleyon March 16, 2014I'm probably as big of fan of Jeff Beck as anyone, believing him to be arguably the best rock guitarist alive today.  And yes, it is nice to see all of this footage of him during his early years.  As another reviewer noted, there are four songs done with the Yardbirds, all having shown up before in various releases.  The material from the Jeff Beck Group was nice to see and hear, with four from that band.  I always thought this band was good, but for me, the weak link was the undistinguished vocals of Bobby Tench.  He's no Rod Stewart, but serviceable.  The final two tracks are excellent musically, with a dated performance with Eric Clapton doing the old blues standard Further on Up the Road.  From their appearance, it seems to have been recorded in the 80s sometime.  The last tune is a previously unseen (by me) performance with the early British jazz-rock fusion band Upp.  Another mesmerizing performance by Beck, but the rest of the band seemed mediocre in comparison.  Maybe that's why the band didn't take off.My biggest negative is that the image quality of the Yardbirds material should have been better; I've seen these performances on other releases looking and sounding much better than here. Also, the final performance with Upp seemed to have been taped off a television broadcast, as there is a blocked out section of the image where the station's call letters had been.This is well worth having if you're a Jeff Beck fan, but in my opinion, is not worth paying the price I did here; if you can find it for maybe five bucks, it's a good deal.  Anything more, and it becomes less so.  You want your money's worth of Jeff Beck?  Get 'Live at Ronnie Scotts' instead.

The difference in volume between periods are huge, you need to adjust the volume many times. Needs masterization! But there are great moments as well. Poor product.0Comment|

Bittickon November 30, 2014Format: DVD|Verified PurchaseJeff Beck is definitely, as Eric Clapton said, from a different planet.  This is a decent look at some of his earlier work.  Quality is so-so, but so was the equipment at the time.  I already have the live videos of The Jeff Beck Group on a separate video, making some of this redundant.  Otherwise, I would have given a higher rating.  Probably for completists.0Comment|Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuseCommentInsert product linkPaste the product's web address below:Product not found.

But there are some standard coverages included in most homeowners policies, such as protection for your dwelling and personal property for certain natural disasters and personal liabilities. It's important to know exactly what is and isn't covered by your policy and to understand your coverage limits. If you'd like to talk through your current policy or get coverage tailored to life in CA, I'd be happy to help.Learn More 5 Tips for Insurance Shopping OnlineThe choices you make when selecting insurance coverages, limits and deductibles can affect what you'll pay for a policy. Learn about what to expect when you're shopping for car insurance online.Learn More What Is Renters Insurance?Renting a home can be great, particularly if you don't have to worry about regular maintenance and upkeep. But you, and your stuff, are still at risk — from things such as a fire, theft or a guest getting injured. Having renters insurance in place can help protect you and your belongings. Whether it's helping you replace stolen items, paying for damage that you caused to a neighbor's window or paying for a hotel if you can't live in your home because of a covered loss, renters insurance may help when the unexpected happens.Learn More 401(k) Options for Your Job ChangeLike many people, you've probably had a few job changes throughout your career. But a new job means more than packing your desk, saying goodbye to coworkers and starting a new adventure - it often means a new retirement plan. So, what do you do with the 401(k) from your previous company? From keeping it there, to rolling it over or cashing it out, review these options when you make your next career move.Learn More Liability Insurance for Your BusinessPart of owning a business is staying one-step ahead and managing risks before they happen. But no amount of planning can keep accidents from happening, and it's good to have some backup. That's where liability insurance comes in - it may help protect your business in the event of a work-related accident or mistake that damages a third party. I'm here to answer any questions you may have, but keep these questions in mind when you're choosing liability coverage for your business.Learn More What is Event Liability Insurance?Whether it's a wedding, a sweet 16, a golden anniversary or a baby shower, life's milestones often come with a celebration. You've probably spent a lot of time planning every detail for your special event, but sometimes things happen that you just can't predict. For instance, what if you or your guests damage a reception hall or accidentally injure someone during the event? Learn how event liability insurance may help if your event doesn't go exactly as planned.Learn More Motorcycle Passenger ProtectionSometimes the best way to enjoy a ride is with a friend on the back of your motorcycle. Before you take a friend or family member out for a ride, though, keep in mind that protection is essential for you and your passenger. Aside from donning helmets and safety gear, it's also a good idea to check your motorcycle insurance covers for passengers. Before you hit the road, take a look at these motorcycle passenger coverage requirements and tips for reducing accidents.Learn More Condo InsuranceYou found the perfect condominium, called about the utilities and have movers lined up. But before you move in, do you have the right coverage for your new home? Condos are unique in the way they are insured - both you and the condo association need policies. From common areas to personal property, it's important that you understand what your policy covers and what your condo association's insurance may help protect. Take a look at this overview of condominium insurance, and then let's make sure you have the coverage you need.Learn More An Overview of Property and Casualty InsuranceYou've probably heard of property and casualty insurance. These are two types of coverages that can be included within a single policy, that help protect the things you own and also provide liability coverage that may help you protect yourself. Here are some examples of policies that generally offer both types of protection.Learn More Quiz: How Much Do You Know About Personal Umbrella Policies?You may know that a personal umbrella policy (PUP) may help protect you if the limits of an underlying policy (homeowners or auto, for instance) are exhausted. But how much do you know about how PUPs work? Test your knowledge with these five questions.Learn More Show moreShow lessInsurance Products & ServicesInsurance is unlike any other product out there - you pay for it and hope you never have to use it. And that makes paying more than you need to that much more uncomfortable.With a policy from Allstate, you can help keep your insurance costs low with the wide variety of discounts we offer. Keep in mind, not all discounts are available in every state. The best way to get all that you qualify for is to get an insurance quote specific to Elk Grove.You can get a rough "ballpark" insurance quote from many companies online, but talking with an agent allows you to ask questions and get a quote for coverage that matters most to you. As an Allstate agent, I can prepare a quote that details the coverage, deductibles (your portion of a loss) and cost (premium) of your insurance policy.Insurance products and services offered at my Allstate agency include:Auto InsuranceCar InsuranceFlood InsuranceInsuranceLife InsuranceMotorcycle InsuranceHome InsuranceInsurance QuoteInsurance AgencyBusiness InsuranceAnnuitiesRetirementCollege Savings PlanContactPhone(916) 684-3753(916) 684-3753Toll Free(800) 635-5494(800) 635-5494Fax(916) 684-4333(916) 684-4333Email:jeffbeck@allstate.comjeffbeck@allstate.comAddress:8355 Elk Grove Blvd, Ste 400Elk Grove, CA 95758Get DirectionsLandmarks:1 mile west of Hwy 99 at northwest corner of Elk Grove Blvd and Laguna Springs Dr.Areas Served:Proud to serve the areas of Laguna, Elk Grove, Sacramento, Galt, Delta, Wilton.

What's the Difference Between Term and Permanent Life Insurance?Plan Your Financial Future.Buy vs. Lease CalculatorMortgage Tax Credit CalculatorLife insurance policies typically fall into two categories: term or permanent insurance. Which type of policy is right for you?New Family? Nearing Retirement? Make sure you're doing all you can to protect the life you deserve—no matter what stage you're at in life.What’s more cost efficient – buying or leasing a car? This calculator can help crunch the numbers.Calculate your potential average yearly tax savings over the life of your mortgage.Learn moreLearn moreLearn moreLearn more    Protect What Matters MostWhether it's your home, your family, your bike or your boat, see how Allstate can help protect the things that matter most to you in life.What's Covered by Homeowners Insurance?There's no stock answer to what homeowners insurance covers, as policies vary from customer to customer and from state to state. But there are some standard coverages included in most homeowners policies, such as protection for your dwelling and personal property for certain natural disasters and personal liabilities. It's important to know exactly what is and isn't covered by your policy and to understand your coverage limits. If you'd like to talk through your current policy or get coverage tailored to life in CA, I'd be happy to help.Learn More 5 Tips for Insurance Shopping OnlineThe choices you make when selecting insurance coverages, limits and deductibles can affect what you'll pay for a policy. Learn about what to expect when you're shopping for car insurance online.Learn More What Is Renters Insurance?Renting a home can be great, particularly if you don't have to worry about regular maintenance and upkeep. But you, and your stuff, are still at risk — from things such as a fire, theft or a guest getting injured. Having renters insurance in place can help protect you and your belongings. Whether it's helping you replace stolen items, paying for damage that you caused to a neighbor's window or paying for a hotel if you can't live in your home because of a covered loss, renters insurance may help when the unexpected happens.Learn More 401(k) Options for Your Job ChangeLike many people, you've probably had a few job changes throughout your career. But a new job means more than packing your desk, saying goodbye to coworkers and starting a new adventure - it often means a new retirement plan. So, what do you do with the 401(k) from your previous company? From keeping it there, to rolling it over or cashing it out, review these options when you make your next career move.Learn More Liability Insurance for Your BusinessPart of owning a business is staying one-step ahead and managing risks before they happen. But no amount of planning can keep accidents from happening, and it's good to have some backup. That's where liability insurance comes in - it may help protect your business in the event of a work-related accident or mistake that damages a third party. I'm here to answer any questions you may have, but keep these questions in mind when you're choosing liability coverage for your business.Learn More What is Event Liability Insurance?Whether it's a wedding, a sweet 16, a golden anniversary or a baby shower, life's milestones often come with a celebration. You've probably spent a lot of time planning every detail for your special event, but sometimes things happen that you just can't predict. For instance, what if you or your guests damage a reception hall or accidentally injure someone during the event? Learn how event liability insurance may help if your event doesn't go exactly as planned.Learn More Motorcycle Passenger ProtectionSometimes the best way to enjoy a ride is with a friend on the back of your motorcycle. Before you take a friend or family member out for a ride, though, keep in mind that protection is essential for you and your passenger. Aside from donning helmets and safety gear, it's also a good idea to check your motorcycle insurance covers for passengers. Before you hit the road, take a look at these motorcycle passenger coverage requirements and tips for reducing accidents.Learn More Condo InsuranceYou found the perfect condominium, called about the utilities and have movers lined up.

Jeffrey A. Beck Named Presstek President & CEO
Thursday, July 03, 2014
Press release from the issuing company
Hudson, NH USA – Presstek today announced that Mr. Jeffrey A. Beck has joined the Company as President and Chief Executive Officer effective May 1, 2014.  Beck succeeds David Savage who recently transitioned to lead WaterJet Holdings, Inc., another portfolio company held by Presstek’s owner, American Industrial Partners.    
Mr. Beck is a proven executive with a strong track record of driving profitable growth across many technology focused business sectors. He has successfully led high performing teams through journeys that combined strategic planning with best practice execution and financial discipline – ultimately creating valuable and differentiated businesses. Prior to joining Presstek Jeff served as Chief Operating Officer for iRobot Corporation and earlier there as President, Home Robots Division. During his tenure at iRobot Jeff led the teams that delivered innovative new products, expanded global distribution, significantly improved product quality and emphasized operational excellence. Because of these accomplishments, today, iRobot is a growing, profitable and well respected technology brand. Before joining iRobot Jeff served at AMETEK Corporation as Senior Vice President and General Manager of the Aerospace and Defense Division and earlier as Vice President and General Manager of the Power Systems and Instruments Division. In both roles he led teams through the development and implementation of strategies resulting in differentiated, growing and profitable businesses. Beck’s career also includes assignments at Danaher Corporation where he served as a Division President and Emerson Electric Corporation where he held a series of engineering, sales, and general management positions. 
Jeff’s technology background, experience launching sizable service businesses and creating diversified and profitable business platforms will serve Presstek well in strengthening and building its core products and services portfolio. 
As Presstek’s President and CEO, Mr. Beck will drive the Company’s strategy and vision for long-term growth and profitability by developing and bringing to market a technologically advanced and innovative product portfolio along with superior technical support and service programs. The entire leadership team at Presstek is excited to be working under Jeff’s guidance to develop new business opportunities, foster brand loyalty and strengthen existing relationships with customers and distribution channels.
“I am very excited to join Presstek during this stage of its renewal. Presstek has made excellent progress improving operational and financial performance since being acquired by private equity firm AIP in 2012,” Beck said.  “I look forward to leading Presstek into the next exciting era, investing in Research and Development and launching new environmentally friendly print system solutions that help our customers remove complexities, chemistry, and waste from their production chain. Our goal is to foster strong customer relationships, achieve sustainable profitability, and enhance our position in the industry.” 
Jeff holds a Master’s degree in Business Administration from Boston University and a Bachelor of Science degree in Mechanical Engineering from the New Jersey Institute of Technology.  In addition he actively serves on the Board of Directors for Sun Edison Semiconductor, Fiber Optic Components and The New Jersey Institute of Technology’s Engineering College Advisory Board.
