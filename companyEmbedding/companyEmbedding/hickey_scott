WHY TOSS THE TUBE FOR GOOD?
                                

Enough TP tubes are used each year to fill the Empire State Building, twice. With Scott® Tube-Free Toilet Paper, you can get premium softness without the wasteful tube.

                                            See how TP unrolls without the tube.
